review/summary: Insure Herbal works for me
review/text: If I take this 3 or 4 times a day at the first sign of a cold, it usually makes the symptoms go away. I mix 1 1/2 droppers in a bit of pulpy OJ.... not such a bad taste that way...The key to it working for me seems to be in taking it as soon as I feel the onset of a cold. If I wait a day or two the results aren't as good.
