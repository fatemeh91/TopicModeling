review/summary: Delivery was very long wait.....
review/text: It took almost 3 weeks to recieve the two pairs of stockings I ordered and when they arrived they were not in a box nor did they have any tags on them so I am not certain they are actually Jobst brand stockings. The Sun Bronze pair fits okay but quality is less than the pair I bought at an actual compression store.
