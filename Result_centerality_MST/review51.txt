review/summary: impression of the product
review/text: the item was very pleasing to my wife. she has bought this product before in a local store that was probably a previous model, the top of the hose was not as secure as the ones i ordered from the amazon provider.the order was shipped as i was told it would be. i am satisfied with the over all purchase process.
