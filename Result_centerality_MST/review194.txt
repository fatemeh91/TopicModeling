review/text: I must tell anyone who wears these stockings...I wear them everyday...thigh highs...you need to get the Jobst "It Stays" roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be...they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN...They stay put ALL day for me. I wouldn't even put them on with out it.
