review/summary: Fall apart
review/text: I don't understand why these inserts are made up from 2 pieces. It should just be one piece. The 2 pieces are held together with a small piece of double sided tape and COMPLETELY fall apart after 1 day of walking. No problem with seller, this is just a HORRIBLY made product.
