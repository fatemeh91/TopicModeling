review/summary: Bad run the FIRST time I wore them!
review/text: Having read the previous reviewers' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs, I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last. The first time I had this pantyhose on, I got a bad run that ruined this very expensive pair of hosiery! Unbelievable!
