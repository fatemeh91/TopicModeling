review/summary: Good device but yearly probe replacement required
review/text: As a physician who has used many electronic thermometers, this one is about the best and fastest. It stands up to abuse well as my nurse has dropped it numerous times and it still functions fine. My only complaint(and the reason why I gave 3 stars not 5) is that the probe needs to be replaced regularly. I spoke with an individual in customer support who stated the average probe lasts approximately one year, then needs to be replaced(an error message comes up, rendering the unit unusable). The probe replacement is ~$85. I think that if you spend this amount of money on a thermometer, you should get more than a years use out of it before having to replace expensive parts.
