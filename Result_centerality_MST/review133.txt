review/summary: Works like a charm
review/text: I recently broke my foot and were put in a FP Walker boot. The 1st couple of days were no fun with the skin on the back of my heel rubbing. I could not get a normal sock on due to the swelling.These socks rock! Easy to put on and padding in all the right places.I am definitely buying some more.
