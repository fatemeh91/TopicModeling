review/text: I've had the practically identical ER115 version (wet/dry washable) for many years, probably around 5 or 6. First off, this thing is built like a tank for what it is. Very solid plastic, and the movable parts like the cap for the battery and the on/off switch have a precision, quality feel that is usually absent with [..]grooming products. I've dropped it more times than I'd like to admit, and it there's not even a scratch on it, plus it works almost as well as when new. It's great for ear hair, which seems to grow faster the older I get...I find I use it at least 3-4 times a week to keep well-groomed. It also works for nose hair, which I guess is its main function, but I find that if the battery isn't really fresh, it slows down a bit and can pull hard on a hair instead of cutting it(ouch-but I've never drawn blood)...but then again, this thing IS about 6 years old and the blades have never been sharpened. I seem to recall that the manual that came with it suggested replacing the unit like after 2 years (anyone else read that?)but I've gotten a lot of use out of this little sucker!
