review/text: It totally worked for me & to all the people being negative worrying about the so insignificant fish smell, It is so small in my eyes that it does not bother me with the help of a cough drop or mint or tea tree oil in water can not cure, but what really bothers me is if I don't take it & go back to getting surgeries with a scalpel in my eye while being awake (Not Fun At All. So a little fish smell is nothing up to the alternative being(surgeries)because dry eyes does big damage to the cornea especially to me being a Systemic Lupus Patient that keep's getting Pterygium Growths on my cornea (From extreme dry eyes) over & over having to get them removed by a scalpel several times. I love this stuff people try it you will not be sorry, but take it for at least two weeks to a month before you judge it prematurely & miss out on something that at least to me is life changing. Go & try it you will be happy you did! P.S & I am also taking this brand of eye drops also & they work very well.
