review/text: I can't judge it by the effect since we don't know what is going on in my son's body.But my son loves it. It smells like strawberry when you first pour it out, but after my son took it, his mouth just stinks like fish. He loves it , he would open the fridge and point the it me ask me to feed him.I think the fish smell tells you how good the content is , it's real, not something barely add the essential ingredient.I recommend it
