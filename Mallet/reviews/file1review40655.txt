review/text: I can't stand Huggies, when my baby wore them at night she had little gel beads all over her bottom in the mornings from the diaper being too wet. Huggies are also way too thick, they don't work better than any other diaper that I've tried and I tried a lot, I think they are worse because other cheaper diapers I've tried don't fall apart when really wet! They are NOT worth the money!! I like White Cloud ...they are very comparable to Huggies Ultratrim but they don't leave little gel beads on my baby's butt!
