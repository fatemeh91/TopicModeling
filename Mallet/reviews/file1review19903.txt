review/text: While he hasn't made it in the toilet yet this trainer seat works well for boys. Our son isn't afraid to sit on it, it's large enough for him to sit on and the guard is high enough for him. It adjusts to fit on our standard and elongated seats. One thing about Bjorn though is I wish they made their products in a better price range so they could reach more clients. We have the potty chair too and like that it was also large enough for our sons long legs, and has a high pee guard. They just run at the higher price range as far as the market goes.
