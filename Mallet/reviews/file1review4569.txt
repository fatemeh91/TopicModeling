review/text: I just got this a few days ago, and I just had to say that this is one of the best razors that I have ever used. And its unded $20.00. The Fusion combine 5 razors, making it one of the fastest and most perscise razors on the market. This razor just seems to glide across your face. When I start shaving with it, I went over my face about another 5 times because I didn't think it was shaving. Yes, it is that smooth. The percision blade on the back isn't really nothing to get hyped up about. In my opinion, I think it is quite usless. But that aside, it is an amazing razor, and I stongly suggest it.
