review/text: So I got the four hour body book and bought everything in there. I was pretty shocked at the price of the "athletic greens" recommended - it's like $100+ for a 30 day supply. It was however, delicious. I looked forward to it. After I ran out, I bought this, which is like half the cost for double the amount--- that seemed great. But good god, this tastes like vomit. Nothing I can do. I dread it. Really gross. Can't manage to swallow it quick enough not to taste it. So I think I'll go back to the taking the pain in my wallet vs. my mouth. I mean seriously, I already am taking cold showers, eating cinnamon, no sugar, no bread... but this is a little much.
