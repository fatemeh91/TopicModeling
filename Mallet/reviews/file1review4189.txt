review/text: I bought theses with the hopes of saving some cash and for my surprise it turned out that these razors are cheap Chinese knock off brands.These blades will cut your face and only last about a week - if you are lucky. Even with a new blade you can feel the difference and after you have shaved, take a good look at your face and you will see and feel the pain.Stay away!!!! All those 5 stars reviews are probably Chinese working for the knock off company.
