review/text: I'm not sure why so many people panned this product. I've had it up in my nursery for 2 weeks and it looks and functions well. My only issue is that the velcro straps are not long enough, so I neatly rigged it with some twine and it's plenty stable. The bins aren't sagging (so far) and it holds just what I need.
