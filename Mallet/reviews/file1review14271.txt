review/text: This cleaner works better than nothing - but not as well as spraying by hand.If you were previously doing nothing whatsoever to clean your shower on a daily basis, this product is a lifesaver.If you were previously using the daily shower sprays by hand, your shower will be about 75% as clean with the automatic shower cleaner.If you don't always have time to spray by hand, this product will keep your shower from getting unsightly in between thorough hand cleanings. But it definitely will not leave it immaculately shiny, squeaky clean. I would plan on cleaning the shower by hand from time to time if you want the sit-in-the-tub-for-a-bath level of clean.
