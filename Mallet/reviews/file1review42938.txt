review/text: This is a great cleaner for sinks, tubs, and countertops. I would compare it to the non-green "Comet" cleaner. However, I think it works better than that product. We recently painted our kitchen and some of the paint got onto the stainless steel sink. This cleaner got it all off and it is shiny again! It does have a strong smell (especially if you use too much) but I greatly prefer its smell to the "toxic" versions.
