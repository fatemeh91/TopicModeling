review/text: I wear glasses. I wish I didn't. But without them I tend to mistake my hand lotion for my toothpaste, and believe me that's not something you want to make a mistake about. So having glasses and being able to see clearly through them are important things in my life.I've gone through a number of so called "cleaning cloths" for glasses (microfiber and otherwise) and very few of them live up to their hype, so it was with some depredation that I ordered one of these microfiber cleaning cloths. Now I'm glad I did. It works great!After cleaning my glasses I always have the extra little smears of skin oil that you just can't seem to get off with soap and water, but this cloth easily removes the smears and smudges with a light wipe and buff leaving my lenses crystal clear. And it's big enough to actually handle easily and encompasses the lens you are wiping, unlike many lens cloths I have bought that were barely big enough to fold much less use to clean your lenses.It's soft, it's fairly large, it's durable and washable, it comes with it's own little pouch to store it in, and it really removes the smears. It just doesn't get more convenient than that.
