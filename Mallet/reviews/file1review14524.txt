review/text: I've used this for many years and it is very effective in moisturizing my feet. I even bring it when I travel to make sure I don't miss a night. My only issue with this vendor is that the photo shows a white tube which made me think it was the old formula. What they actually deliver is the maroon tube that is the newer formula. Both are effective but I have a personal preference for the old formula.
