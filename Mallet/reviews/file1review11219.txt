review/text: After losing our last accurate mercury thermometer (remember the days when we all had good, accurate, thermometers?) we have tried several that are either mercury-free or digital. To date, all have been a disappointment.The Vicks Speed Read was the second type of digital thermometer that we tried, and we purchased two of them. Both were miserable failures at either reading accurate temperatures or even giving repeatable measurements.Typically, a healthy adult should have a temperature of about 98.6 F -- but both Vicks Speed Read Digital Thermometers give initial readings in the 95.0 - 95.5 range. After several measurements over 10 minutes, readings rose to 96 and 97 but never reached higher than 97.3. Subsequent tests with additional people, times and comparison with other known accurate thermometers confirmed this inherent inaccuracy.Readings on both the Vicks thermometers were neither repeatable or accurate.Because of these failings I strongly discourage the purchase of the Vicks Speed Read Digital Thermometer.Still searching for an accurate digital thermometer...
