review/text: The product came very quickly, about 3-4 days, and didn't have any problems. As for the protein itself, it definitely has a rich, pure chocolate taste. In water, it's not very sweet, but still has a rich chocolate taste. In milk, it's a little sweeter/tastes better, but still has a strong chocolate taste. I guess rich chocolate just isn't a flavor that's for me, but it's not so bad that I don't want to drink the shakes. Also, the powder mixes ok with a spoon- there's usually a few small clumps of protein left. However, if you blend it, no clumps.
