review/text: I've worn these several times, and they are comfy. They do cushion your feet. But I haven't felt any muscle tightening or toning. There's no soreness or anything to indicate they're working my muscles.One thing I do warn, be prepared to need to buy at least a half size bigger shoe, cause they do take up room.Not horrible, but I'm not singing their praises either.
