review/text: I have had alot of generalized bone, spine, and joint pain for years. I have never tried narcotics because I did not want to go down that road. But I have tried many alternative products that either did nothing for the pain, or had unpleasent side effects. I have used Enzymatic Therapy products in the past because I feel that they make a good product.I would say that I experience at least 80 % reduction in generalized spine and joint pain, with no side effects from the product.Everybody has different types of pain, but if you suffer with spine and joint pain, I think you may like this product...and hopefuly get the same or better results.
