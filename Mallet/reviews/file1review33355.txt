review/text: This is a DECENT blade for those who do not shave everyday or have thick stuble. For me I have to shave everyday and have thick stuble and this product will not work in that kind of situation simply because it is just not sharp enough to do the trick and will leave you with razor burn or cuts especially on the neck portion. My recommended blade is the feather for those of you who are in the same situation as me and wish to use a safety razor.
