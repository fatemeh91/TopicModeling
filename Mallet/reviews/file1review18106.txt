review/text: I have purchased this product to block out the light so I can sleep. I have been using it for sometime now. The mask blocks out the light close to 100 percent. The only thing I have some discomfort is at the joining of the two straps behind my head. I do pull down the strap behind my head as far as my comfort allows. I would buy a 'one strap' mask like this one in a blink of an one. With that said, I will continue to wear the Bucky 40 Blinks Mask for a long, long time. Thank you in providing this product so I can sleep longer and wake up feeling charged.
