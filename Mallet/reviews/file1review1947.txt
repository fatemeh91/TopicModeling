review/text: This product is certainly my favorite oil I have ever used, as well as my fav product from Indigo Wild. F&M; is such a relaxing and rejuvenating scent to have as a body oil. I can totally understand why F&M; continues to be a best selling product in much of the Zum line of products.After buying this oil direct from Indigo Wild for over 3 years, I have sadly found that shipping their products to me now is extremely expensive. So sadly I have had to go without Zum for quite a while until a friend told me I can buy it on Amazon.Those of you not familiar with Zum oil, let me give my two cents on why I'm sold on Zum for life!The blend of oils used for Zum oil, is fantastic as well. Sweet almond, meadowfoam seed, sunflower, avocado, coconut & hemp oils make a great lube for the skin without being heavy or too thick. Great (obviously) for massage...but my fav use is for after shaving my legs. Feeling something so soothing and luxurious on my skin after a shave...well it is positively orgasmic! :)Plus the scent is just enough to leave you feeling surrounded, but not so much that it chokes you out like some other brands I have tried.Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!
