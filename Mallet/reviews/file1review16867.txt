review/text: I am a cancer survivor. After all my chemo and radiation treatments it took a lot out of me. I also was put on medication to keep cancer from returning which the medicine causes my legs to hurt real bad (to a point I couldn't hardly walk) and I have a hard time concentrating. I tried Orachel and this is amazing. It takes all the pain out of my legs and helps me to focus. The health food store charges $30 for this so I was glad to find that Amazon has it for a lower price. I have not found any other vitamins I can take that help me like this.
