review/text: I got a great deal on those from Amazon. They taste really rich, and chocholatey.They are my all-time favorite. They satisfy me for at least 2-3 hours, and they have a great deal of nutrition in them. Also they are based on the 30/30/40 diet (protien/fat/carbs) respectively, which is the most successful diet there is if followed sensibly.
