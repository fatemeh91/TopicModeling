review/text: I have two sets of 2650 and one set of 2400. I got the first set because I wanted the 15-min charger; very convenient for charging up the batteries as you get ready to head out with the camera. After only one year of very minimum usage (10-12 cycles, I estimate), most of them don't hold their charge for more than a day or 20-25 mins of use in my digital cameras. What a waste of $100.
