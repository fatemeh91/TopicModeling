review/text: Very good soap. That's pretty much what it is. Soothing too.I would recommend getting this one compared to any "conventional" soaps from supermarkets. This one cleans well, has very strong but relaxing smell and on top of that makes skin less dry.I've yet to see some serious effect on ringworm I have. I bought it to treat ringworm infection I have. For now, after four days, what it does is it makes skin much less dry. A good start...
