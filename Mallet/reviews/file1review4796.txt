review/text: I was buying the small tubs of the greens and reds and decided to look for a larger amount because I kept running out and was spending 3 times as much as buying the large tubs. I'm so grateful that I can drink my greens and reds. I tend not to eat enough of either. Now I can stop stressing about it. Thank you for producing such a wonderful, healthy, nourishing, and tasty drink. Half an apple, half a banana, 1 cup plain soy milk, one scoop of each of the red and green and I'm set for the day. Ahhhh, so good. I can feel the health flowing in to my body.
