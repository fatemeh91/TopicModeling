review/text: I've been using this for about two weeks now and have yet to have to recharge the battery. It seems to deliver what is promised. The speed is good for a battery unit and doesn't snag on tough beards. The design is ergonamic and the features are easy to use. It is simply the best beard trimmer I have ever had, and I have been trimming my beard for close to 40 years.
