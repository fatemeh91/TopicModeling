review/text: I'm a fan of Universal and pretty much anything that has the Animal brand on it. I've used many of the products that they make (Pak, Stak, M-Stak, Test, Flex, Cuts, and PM) and had good things to say about all of them. This one is no exception. Two packs a day (conveniently wrapped in easily opened plastic envelopes), each pack consisting of 8 pills (or so). Pills are caplets, small enough to be easily swallowed. This is a thermogenic, energy, metabolic booster, and diuretic rolled into one.Buyer beware: For people with sensitive stomachs this can cause heartburn. For people with caffeine sensitivity this can cause jittery/nervous behavior. For people who have a hard time with drinking enough water the diuretic might be too much.Try this product for the full 21 day cycle. If you are eating sensibly and exercising this product will accelerate weight loss or bust a weight plateau. I've used it off and on for about 2 years and I have nothing but good things to say about it. If you want something that TRULY works give it a try.
