review/text: I bought this product because I recently got a new cat that loves to shed all over the place, especially my bed comforter. I've used the rubber brushes that brush the hair into piles so they can be picked up but they only worked marginally at best. I needed something with a little more power and I found it. While it is annoying that this devices isn't cordless, there is no way that it would work as well as it does if it were. As soon as I got it I put it to the test and it passed with flying colors. It took a few passes with the pet hair attachment, but once I figured out the trick to using it, it cleaned up my comforter in no time. Even just using it around my apartment, to clean up the cat liter mess, it worked wonderfully. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has a small pet that has shed a lot of hair on furniture because the pet attachment works great.
