review/text: I bought this for my mother who uses a walker, has balance problems, trouble getting in and out of bed, and has fallen out of bed. I ordered it standard shipping on a Sunday and it arrived early Tuesday morning ... less than 48 hours later. It is very well made from sturdy tubing and is easy to use. Having something that functions as a bed rail but doubles as a handle to assist getting in and out of bed is a fantastic combination. It only took about 5 minutes to install and to set the correct height of the latch mechanism that secures it when being used in the bed rail position. It's very light and easy to lift to swing it out from the bed. My mother loves this and her mind is at ease knowing she won't fall out of bed in the middle of the night. I highly recommend this product. However, I don't understand why the price went up from $98.75 to almost $150 in the last 30 days. I probably still would have bought it at that price but might have looked to see if it is available for less at some other site. At the time I bought it I got it at the best price I could find. If I had paid $150 I would have rated it 4 stars.
