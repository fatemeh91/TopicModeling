review/text: I don't know why two of the other reviewers had problems, this little gizmo has worked great for me for the past 5 years when I bought it at Wal-Mart. Now they don't carry them and I want a replacement. BTW, I bought another kind (flat shaver style) and the thing is too clumsy to use (cut myself twice). This works great, at least on me.
