review/text: Before I started taking this, I couldn't even use a toothpaste like Squigle (which uses a mild surfactant, Polaxamer, versus the harsher surfactants, like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, that major brands use) because it would give me painful canker sores. Two weeks after starting Jarrow NAG, I started using Squigle. I got two minor (less painful than usual) sores, but they went away after a week and I haven't had any since (I've been taking this product for six weeks). My nutrition-expert-friend says that it takes 4-6 weeks for the oral mucosa to regenerate and hence see the effects of NAG, so my experience fits with his explanation.I've also found that this has reduced stiffness in my shoulders and back. I used to be particular about the bed I slept on. Now I'm more flexible about where I sleep. Even when I sleep on an older, soft mattress, my back doesn't hurt in the morning (it would before I started taking NAG).
