review/text: One dose = one bottle. 5x2 pills for two days. With the caveat on the label: repeat as needed. Which would be another bottle. 2 pills 5x a day is a little crazy even for a vitamin nut like me.Someone in my office was getting sick. So I took these bad boys, instead of vitamin C but kept my normal Orange Triad/ Alive alternating regimen, as well as Acidopholis and salmon and cod liver oils. I skipped my normal once weekly cold shower.Ive been sick for nearly 3 days. This is the worst cold I've had in years. I'm still sick. I'm all about homeopathic medicines and herbs, and maybe without these my cold would have been way worse. But if this cold keeps up for another couple days, I'm looking at 3 of these bottles. Today I took a behind the counter mucinex and im feeling much better. Maybe for someone who takes less serious multivitamins it would have a more noticable effect...
