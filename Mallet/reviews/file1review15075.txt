review/text: My wife and I have been using these since June, 2011. I did a lot of reading online before buying Life Extension brand. I had to spend weeks to convince her to use them, printing out articles for her, but then she noticed that working at a computer, her eyes did not get tired when using the drops. Now if I forget, she demands I bring the eyedrops. That is quite an endorsement, coming from a skeptic.
