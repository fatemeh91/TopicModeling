review/text: this really works but i have to heat it up on both sides in the microwave on 55 seconds to get the heat i require for degenerative disk in my neck. really wish i could get one to go from the base of my skull to my waist for the real relief i get using this product. good stuff. gives me temporary relief of this garbage of a spine. thank you for making this product available to the public.as Bette Davis once said &#34; Getting old is NOT for sissies&#34; she is really on the mark with this statement. thanks for the warning Ms. Davis. Miss you a lot.
