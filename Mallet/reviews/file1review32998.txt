review/text: I purchased these for my 86yo mother who has edema and varicose veins. She has a hernia, so cannot comfortably wear full support hose, and I was looking for a thigh high to meet her need. These have been very helpful though she must have my help in putting them on since most any support hose that do their job are challenging to get on around the foot and ankle, then to be pulled up is another thing, too!I agree with another review that the top doesn't grip as well as needed; perhaps being a little higher would help as they hit my mother about where the thigh starts to get larger and that change pushes them back a bit. PRODUCT SUGGESTION, HERE...ACTIVA :)
