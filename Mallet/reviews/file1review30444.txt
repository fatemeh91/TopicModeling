review/text: I've tried many facial products- but always go back to Dermalogica- even though it's pricy- it's worth it -and lasts a long time- about 9 months. When I have used other products my skin gets dull or breaks out. When I use this cleansing gel, my face glows. All entire line is wonderful!
