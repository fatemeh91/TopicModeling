review/text: I didn't realize that these were a men's product when I chose them, but they worked really well for me. I needed an inexpensive disposable razor (I use men's usually) for shaving my legs. These provided a surprisingly close shave and were very comfortable to use and hold. I'd highly recommend them and the price is excellent.
