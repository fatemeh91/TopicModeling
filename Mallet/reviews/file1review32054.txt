review/text: I was so happy to find that I could buy these Tide To Go sticksTide to Go Instant Stain Remover, .338-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 6)in bulk! Although I use these sticks occasionally for stains on clothing (I always keep one in my purse) and they work very well, the biggest use I have found for these is to clean the white grout between the tile on my kitchen countertop. This grout looks stained and awful very quickly. I have tried everything (including bleach sticks), but this stain stick is the only thing that really works well. The harder tip of this stick is perfect for this purpose. All my house guests always comment on how new and clean my countertop looks.
