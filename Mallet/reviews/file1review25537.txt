review/text: So I finally get the message after watching "queer eye" and so I start checking these things out. I read all the reviews of these things that I could find and this one ranked high in the majority of reviews. And Man, this is cheap and does the job. No pain from hairs being pulled out yet. (Maybe these things require a gentle touch.) I have several Panasonic products and this rates up there with the rest. Works great. Had it for 4 weeks and no problems. I even put a half used battery in it. Highly recommended.
