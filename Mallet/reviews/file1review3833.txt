review/text: Why Should You Buy Yogi Get Regular Tea:1)It tastes great! At first, I was afraid it would have a very bad taste, so I mixed it with Organic India Tulsi Lemon Ginger Tea. But one day when I was out of the other tea, I ended up drinking it straight. It was great, smooth and has a slight sweetness to it.2)You can use the teabag 2 or 3 times. I use my teabag twice. Not only is this cost effective, but it helps me to go to the bathroom 2-3 times daily. When you are all done with the teabag, don't throw it away. Use it as a facial cleanser or toner by gently wiping the teabag all over your face and neck. It will do wonders for your skin.3)It does keep you regular, but not "runny."4)They have great quotes attached to each teabag. Not only does the tea keep you regular, but the great quotes attached to each tea bag's label has great quotes.Enjoy!
