review/text: I have used the 8585 model for about 4 or 5 years now. I have replaced the cutter and foil several times. Each time the result was the same as a newly purchased razor. However, the last replacement foil and cutter, which came from Goodman's, provided a shave which felt mostly like using a serrated edged rusty knife. It appears, by visual inspection, the cutter has been redesigned. The cutter now appears as if the individual cutting elements are wider and not thin blades as in the past. Consequently, the experience is pure torture. The order through Amazom expressly identifies the Braun Activator 8585 series. I was sent the 8000 Series product, which indicates it is for the "Series 5." When I questioned Goodman's about the difference, they simply stated that it was the same product had been "modified." This is no longer the product I have used and respected. It is a piece of junk not worthy of Amazon's endorsement, as neither is Goodman's.
