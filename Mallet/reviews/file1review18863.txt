review/text: Probably the cheapest of the rechargeable Brauns. It's very, very fast, cleans easily and fits my hand naturally. BUT, Norelco's rotary blades float and conform to contours of my face so there are no missed spots. Still, it's a very nice razor with a great price. On the other hand, Norelco gives less skin irritation than the Braun.
