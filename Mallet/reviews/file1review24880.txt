review/text: I have PCOS, and have been taken this product for less than a week and so far I can see a difference in my complexion, I'm also taking a multivitamin which probably plays a role in this as well. But needless to say "My skin has never looked so good. EVER(or at least since i started puberty and was diagnosed with PCOS)!
