review/text: I purchased the model BC-076 14"x14" w/manual switch along with the optional Stupe pad with a waterproof internal pouch for use with a damp cloth. The pad itself is made of a very substantial canvas cloth material and the cover is soft fleece. It all has a satisfying weight to it and feels like it will last a lifetime. It is also made in the good old USA. You can get this pad with two different switches.One is a four stage switch that cuts the pad off when the desiredheating level is reached. The other is a manual switch you must hold down constantly until your preferred heating level is reached and then release it. According to the manufacturer, the four stage switch will reach a maximum temperature of 160 degrees. The manual switch will go up to 180 before the internal thermostat cuts it off. Having to hold the switch down was not nearly the inconvenience I thought it would be.It is for this reason I would recommend getting the manual switch and don't bother with the optional stupe cover. The standard feece cover provides plenty of moisture by itself when placed directly on the skin. I found the best deal including shipping was with Pro Therapy Supplies. They ship fast.
