review/text: So I decided to go on an organic trial run, and ordered a dozen or so different Kiss My Face products. I actually do perfer them, especially after finding a website telling me that the main ingredient after water in my 99 cent bottles of Suave from Amazon.com was used in engine degreasers, and garage floor cleaners. I sent the stockpile of Suave shampoo back to Amazon.However, this mouthwash is quite pricey. As of now, it clocks in at 56 cents an ounce, whereas the big 1.5L of Listerine on Amazon.com goes for 11 cents an ounce.It's quite minty, and strong like Listerine, only missing a bunch of chemicals on the bottle that I can't even pronounce. My mouth feels quite clean after using it. But it doesn't last long. Filling the cap 3/4ths of the way resulted in this bottle lasting only two weeks being used just by myself. $125 a year for one person for mouthwash is a lot.I've decided to try "Tom's of Maine" mouthwash now though, since it's cheaper, comes in a larger size, and is also made with natural products.This mouthwash is made in Italy, and is not ADA approved.In summary, I enjoyed this product a lot, it just seemed to want to kiss my wallet often, along with my face.
