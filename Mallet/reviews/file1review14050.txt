review/text: I like the idea of this organizer. HOWEVER, the shelves do NOT sit straight like in the photograph. There is a lot of space - it holds about 60 diapers. But the 'shelves' droop forward once you put anything in them. I'm not even talking about heavy stuff. I mean like bibs and pacifiers. Great photo, just didn't pan out in real life.
