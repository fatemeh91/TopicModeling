review/text: At 4 months of age our active daughter was to big for the infant tub and not ready for our big cast iron tub either. A friend told us about the Snug Tub and it was one of the best items we have bought for our daugher. She used it for 5 months and we felt very safe and secure with her in it. Then we used it outside as a small pool for her to play in.
