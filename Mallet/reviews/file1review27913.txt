review/text: As others have said, this isn't necessarily the best stuff on the market. However I've yet to find something better on paper for value, at least something that isn't heavily reliant on soy. It's high density of protein (24 grams per protein per roughly 30 gram serving), high levels of essential BCAA, mixes well (I prefer with a shaker but have done it with a spoon), and goes down and digests nicely. It does have artificial sweeteners, but I'm alright with such things in moderation (but beware if that concerns you).I've had Natural Chocolate (another product on Amazon), Double Rich Chocolate, Cookies and Cream, Vanilla, and Strawberry. The Chocolate flavors, Strawberry, and Vanilla are fantastic. I got Cookies and Cream recently to change things up and honestly, it's too sweet for me. It goes down nicely enough but I don't enjoy it nearly as much as some other flavors I've tried.
