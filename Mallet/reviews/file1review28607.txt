review/text: I was getting sick of chocolate, so I thought I would try this. I was a little hesitant, thinking it might not taste very good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I like to mix it into a fruit smoothie for a post-workout drink, but it also is not bad just mixed with water.I would definitely get this flavor again.
