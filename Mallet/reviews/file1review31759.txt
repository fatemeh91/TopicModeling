review/text: Great little kit for survival, keep that in mind when you check out your items. If I was out hiking in a secluded area for days and got lost, this is the kit I want with me. Yeah the fishing kit is not for your fishing trip, as most people fish for recreation and not survival. It's a kit to keep you from starving if you can't get rescued right away due to location, weather or whatever. Your BRAIN is your real chance of survival anyway, this kit just improves your chances if you put thought behind it's use. It's small & has a nice variety of items. Yeah the items are a little on the cheap side but so is the price. Again it's for survival and not casual use. Although some of the items are useful in daily life, as noted by other users.If your going out in remote areas or your just an all around outdoor person, you know to bring supplies as Murphy's law has taught most outdoor people, STUFF happens, so be prepared. Adventure medical makes great products, I also like their .9 first aid kit ultra light & watertight! Are they perfect for every buyer?? No kit is, you have to add to suit your adventures. But they do have excellent kits to build from.Mine also arrived with a bad bag, but the company replaced it without even asking them! Very happy, thanks!Anyone who enjoys extended time out in the woods should have one of these kits, hopefully you never need it, but if you do, you'll be glad to have it. Then I bet it will get 5 stars once it saves your butt...Update: Decided to gut this pack- as I do not carry in my pocket, and I just didn't care for the bag set up. (Note: Bag does not open from top, it opens at the red line.) I transferred to a survival tin, added more items, and is still a small footprint of 5 x 3 1/2".
