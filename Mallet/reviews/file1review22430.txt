review/text: I bought this product instead of Vitamin Shoppe's other L-Arginine which has... I can't think of it right now, but another supplement with it. This is a great product that you can definitely notice an increase in strength and stamina in a matter of weeks. Plus coupled with the low-cost, makes this product a winner. Don't spend a lot more money for Nitrix, etc. they all just contain the main active ingredient L-Arginine and are selling a flashy bottle.
