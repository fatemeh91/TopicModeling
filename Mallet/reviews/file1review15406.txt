review/text: I did something kind of interesting with the oil - I added it to my shampoo so that every day I wash my hair, the oil smell isn't even something I worry about. It turned the shampoo a green tint but it works. One of the girls I work with just mentioned how long my hair is getting, and I've only bee using it for 3 weeks. It dried out my hair a little bit but just throwing conditioner over it worked perfectly and my hair is soft, strong and long. :) I like it.
