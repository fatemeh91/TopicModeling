review/text: This seemed to make my foot even colder. But that is probably an unfair assessment, since it was so uncomfortable that I couldn't wear it for more than ten minutes. It simply added "and clammy" to the description of my "very cold" feet. My foot might have warmed up later, there in that little straight jacket for feet. I have permacold feet due to chemotherapy, but hand warmers placed between layers of socks are far more comfortable than this. It was also a little annoying to find that I had indeed ordered a "foot" warmer, and not "feet" warmers. For that price, I kind of expected there would be two. (But of course, it does say one foot warmer, so that is really my mistake, not Thermoskin's). I like the idea of a specialty item to really warm up cold feet. For me at least, this was not it.
