review/text: Dentists had been recommending power brushes to me for years. Finally I broke down and bought this one. The reviews for the Triumph and the Sonicare were both great - I chose this one because the brush head is smaller.I've had this for a little less than a year and I really like it. My teeth feel cleaner than ever and my gums feel better. I also like the polishing mode.I would definitely purchase this again.UPDATE 11-28-08: This thing stopped working last week. I had it for maybe two years, and I do not think that is acceptable. I liked it, but it didn't hold a charge for very long, and now it won't charge at all.I just ordered a Sonicare. I hope that lasts longer and works as well. This is WAY too much money to spend on something that lasts about two years. If it would let me, I would change my rating to two stars. It did a great job, but now it's useless.
