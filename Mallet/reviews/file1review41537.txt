review/text: Great product at an unbeatable price. Shipping was fast. I love this. It keeps my teeth bright, clean, and shinny. I made the mistake of leaving it home when I went on a trip. I went back to a manual and brushed my teeth about 5-7 minutes at a time and they still felt dirty. Once you go electric you never go back. 2 minutes and your mouth feels great.
