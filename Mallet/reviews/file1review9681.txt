review/text: I've been wearing glasses like these for several years. At least one or twice a month someone will comment on how much they like my glasses. They are not perfect. If you wear them often they will wear out. Either the bridge will crack or the plastic will give at the hinges. If you wear the same pair every day I'd say you will get 6-9 months wear out of them. So, they are not super high quality, but they aren't crap quality either. If you are cool with needing a couple of pairs each year then I highly recommend these. I guarantee that strangers will tell you how much they like them and even daily acquaintances will one day actually look at you and say, "Are those new glasses? They look good."
