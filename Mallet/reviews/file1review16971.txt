review/text: The trimmer worked fine for about eleven months, and was met with regular use. However a single two-foot tumble killed it DEAD. Won't turn on, and won't accept a charge. Beware and take VERY good care of this product should you decide to buy. They don't offer warranties on this model for a reason.
