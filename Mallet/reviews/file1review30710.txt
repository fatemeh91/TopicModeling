review/text: This was my first classic razor. I had always used the typical schick and gillette multi blade models, I tried them all. This one is so much better! You have to be gentle, but not in a tedious or difficult way, you just have to take it easy. People and websites say that it takes more time with a classic razor, but in my experience it is about the same. Mach 3 and all those razors would leave my skin really irritated and scratched up but these kind wont irritate your skin very much at all if you do it right. You can get expensive creams but the best I have found is an ordinary can of gillette cream. Not the gel the cream...that used with this razor will be a world of difference. Good luck!
