review/text: My husband bought this toy for me about two years ago. It still works like the first day I got it. I love that this toy's ears aren't so soft you can't feel the vibration. The ears of the rabbit are stiff. My only complaint would be that I would have liked a softer head and shaft with the firm ears. GREAT BUY. We purchased mine at the sex store for $60+tax.
