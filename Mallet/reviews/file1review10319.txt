review/text: I have been buying items off amazon for years. It pissed me off when I spent $10 on these and I got a pack full of batteries with battery acid all over them. I'm very disappointed in amazon because of this. If you want batteries, don't get them on this website. You have better luck going to ebay and buying off someone with 1% positive feedback.
