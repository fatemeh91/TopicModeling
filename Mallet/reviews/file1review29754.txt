review/text: These pads are too thick to use for any top that isn't baggy or a sweater. Additionally, they still manage to leak even as thick as they are! The Gerber disposable pads with liners (they come in boxes of 60) are much more effective. I hate adding to landfills, but I hate worrying about wet spots on my shirts for everyone to see even more!
