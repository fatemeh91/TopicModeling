review/text: Tom's of Maine ToothpasteTom's is a small company, employing fewer than two hundred people. It was founded in 1970 and then purchased by Colgate in 2006. Fortunately, Colgate has left Tom's alone to manage their business according to their original principles.Tom's makes natural products. The toothpaste contains no sugar, sweeteners, or artificial flavoring. By contrast, I looked at a tube of Colgate toothpaste that I have on the shelf. It contains "flavor," whatever that is, "saccharine," and "propylene glycol." The last ingredient is a less-toxic form of anti-freeze. One advantage of Tom's toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it.I have been using Tom's for years. The toothpaste comes in many flavors. On Amazon, you can findPeppermint,Spearmint,Fennel,Orange-Mango,Cinnamint,Wintermint,Apricot,Soothing Mint,True Mint, andGingermint, among others. I prefer the Peppermint flavor, which is refreshing, but not overwhelming. The toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces.I do not exactly live in a wilderness area, but my local stores no longer carry Tom's. Fortunately, it can be found on Amazon and other web sites. The prices do vary from vendor to vendor, so check for the best price.
