review/text: I was taking prilosec twice daily and chasing it with tums. A friend told me about this product and I figured anything is worth a try at this point. So I bought, I took, I LOVED! It really helped greatly and I haven't had to go back to the prilosec or the tums. I don't know the mechanism of how it keeps that upper stomach sphincter closed and I don't care. I just know my heartburn is gone! Would definitely recommend the product. It is cheap and it worked for me.
