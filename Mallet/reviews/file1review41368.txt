review/text: I have high arches, and I found that these inserts are not high enough for me on their own. However, they are very useful to add support to some shoes.I tucked these underneath the insole in myDr. Scholl's Women's Jamie Lace-Upshoes. This added a little boost to the existing arch and stabilized the sole, making those shoes supportive when they were not before. When the original insoles on those shoes disintegrated, I replaced them with aSof Sole Women's Arch Support and Cushion Insole, again with the Superfeet insert tucked underneath. This provided excellent arch support.If you have a LOW arch, these inserts might be great for you on their own. If you have a high arch, you can put these underneath a good insole for more support. Every foot is individual, so find what works for you.
