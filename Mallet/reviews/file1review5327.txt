review/text: Given that we're darned sick of the pills we swallow around here, this is very handy.It's a good supplement for calcium and magnesium and has little taste, so you can just add it to broth, soup, stew, grain or legume dishes, whatever.It's a very handy way to boost mineral content in the diet.
