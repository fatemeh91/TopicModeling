review/text: Im a fairly new user of this product but so far i like it. Im not hungry, I dont have the gitters and i dont feel like im racing through the day. It gives me that extra jump to go through my work out. It also makes me feel more alert. My nails have never looked better. I like it. As far as rapid weight loss im not sure about that. I think if you apply the right diet and exercise this might help you, If you are looking for something to take and do nothing this is not for you.
