review/text: The Brunton Helios Stormproof Lighter is a great tool to accompany your camping gear or emergency preparedness supplies. The pointed flame is adjustable and will direct the flame like a blowtorch to whatever it is pointed at, in whatever direction, upside down, sideways, or right-side up. If using to light a camp stove use a higher flame to avoid stove flashback. The only setback is these type lighters are never allowed on commercial airlines, checked or carry-on. As with most butane lighters, the fuel lines can become clogged when using lower quality fuel, like you get at the local grocery store or drugstore. This can cause the need for costly repairs. Unless you wish your lighter to join the pile of disposable lighters, I would only use quality butane fuel, filtered at least 3 times, like you can get at specialized smoke shops.
