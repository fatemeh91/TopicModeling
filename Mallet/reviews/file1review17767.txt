review/text: Having used a Remington beard trimmer for 5-7 years prior to purchasing this model, I bought this with confidence that it would produce the same quality results. I couldn't have been more wrong.I have a fairly thick beard and after several months it's become quite apparent that this trimmer is never going to produce an even trim. It doesn't matter what angle or how much pressure I use, it just never gets everything.In addition to the inconsistent trimming, the battery holds very little charge. If I don't plug it in every other use, I'm left with a dead trimmer the next time I need it. That wouldn't be so bad if you could use the trimmer while it was plugged in, but you can't.
