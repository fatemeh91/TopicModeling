review/text: I've been a loyal user of the Dymatize Iso 100. The Elite was a better bargain, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Gourmet Vanilla and was shocked how awful this stuff tastes! The frist few days I had to drink it with my nose squeezed shut just to get it down. I had to go out and buy some low sugar chocolate syrup to add just to make it somewhat tolerable! I can't wait until I finish the 5 pounds so that I can go back to the Iso 100. Seriously, this may be the worst tasting supplement I've ever tried.
