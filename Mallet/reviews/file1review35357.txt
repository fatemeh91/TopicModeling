review/text: I ordered a Standers CarCaddie for my newly partially paralyzed mother for Christmas, and instead they sent me a Standers HandyBar instead. Thankfully, for my purposes the HandyBar should work fine, but that is still not what I ordered, and for many people who are expecting to get a CarCaddie the situation might not be as flexible. Standers, you need to correct your shipping process!! I wasn't notified that it would be different either. I was still charged the CarCaddie price (which was thankfully the cheaper of the two) but received a different product. I'm sure both are great, but you need to fix this! Buyers beware.
