review/text: #1 protein on the market. Love it.Pro's: easy to drink, inexpensive, easily dissolves in water, low in calories and fat, high amounts of BCAA's in each serving.Con's: None?This protein + creatine (also by ON) and maybe a shaker cup and multivitamin are the only supplements you will ever need. Don't be fooled by all these other scams and expensive proteins.EDIT: just bought the Mint Chocolate after finishing 10 pounds of regular chocolate and needing a change. WOW! Great change of pace. Just enough mint. 10 stars
