review/text: I have had multiple neuroma surgeries and the neuromas have recurred, so I have significant pain in my forefoot. The only answer from the surgeon was cutting loose my achilles tendon, which I didn't want to do. These cushions really, really help and have allowed me to continue Bollywood dance. The glue is really surprisingly long-lasting after rinsing. However, if I use them without socks the edges get stuck on my shoe and can bunch up. So they can't be used without socks or barefoot. Combining these with using rocker shoes most days have kept me from pain and surgery. None of the 20 other products I have purchased at the store worked.
