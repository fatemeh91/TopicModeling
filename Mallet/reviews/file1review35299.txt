review/text: While this product does work as described, it is much too invasive and tedious to use. I removed hair from my chin and other parts of the body some of which have never grown back in many many months. However the scars still remain, they will go away eventually but for the time being, it is quite a pain to cover them up with makeup. Most of the hair is still there though and I'm opting for laser.
