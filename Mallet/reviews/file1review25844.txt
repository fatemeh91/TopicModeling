review/text: This is a great shaver for use in the shower. With a light coat of shaving cream, I get the equivalent of a shave with a blade. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin so shaving has never been one of my favorite pastimes. The Panasonic ES7017S now makes this ritual tolerable and even pleasureable. My only complaint is that the off/on switch is awkward, and, with wet hands, nearly impossible.
