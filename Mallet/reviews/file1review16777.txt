review/text: These are so strong with throat numbing ingredients that all the other benefits are quickly overlooked. Hey, oral surgeons: forget anesthesia, just use these suckers. So strong that I had to question: "Is this normal? Will I be able to talk later on coherently? Am I drooling?". Metal box is a plus for hiding small trinkets.
