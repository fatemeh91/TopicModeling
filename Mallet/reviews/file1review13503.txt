review/text: We bought this to cover and protect our new king memory foam mattress.We got it, threw it in the wash, and used it the first night on our new bed.I couldn't tell that it was even there. It makes no sound, fits the mattress perfectly, and is nice and soft.Nice to have the water protection also in case our young son sleeps with us and has an accident... or our dogs and cats...Highly recommended!
