review/text: My wife takes 8 pills a day - 2 large (horse-pills) and 6 small to very small. She's been looking for a new, round pill minder for about 3 months!!She was very upset to discover that while the end compartments and the middle side compartments held all her pills, the "around-the-edges" compartments do not! And since these are for Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, she was very disappointed with this product. She expected it would hold MORE pills than what she was using.So if you are taking pills larger than a Bayer baby aspirin, expect to only be able to put about five pills in each of the smaller compartments.
