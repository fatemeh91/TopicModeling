review/text: Bought two of these - floral and bronze - as gifts for my elderly mother and she is in love with them. It's hard enough when someone has to rely on mobility aids to walk a moderate distance, but having something that is unique and serves additionally as a fashion statement, not only lessens the impact of being dependent on a cane but serves as a nice icebreaker.I highly recommend these for the added stability as well as for their morale-building property.
