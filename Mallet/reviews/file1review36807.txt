review/text: If have strong hands, socks with large easy opening and want this to be hard without bending - that is what this is.But if any hand troubles or just want easy flexible inserting for sock - this is NOT it. I bought this thinking it was the same as what I had, but definitely not.(I have size 8 feet)I guess hardness helps keep the opening very large but makes it impossible to get sock on due to hand difficulty. And I don't need an opening anywhere that large.Recommend instead:Carex Sock AidGood flexibility and still large enough opening for my 8 size feet.
