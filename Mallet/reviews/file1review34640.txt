review/text: Purchased this and Flaxseed Oil to help punch up my HDL "good" cholesterol levels. Not sure how it is working yet but they seem to work fine and I feel better taking them. We also use Coconut oil in bulk form for cooking as the fat composition is supposed to be better for you than other vegetable oils. As for capsules, I have read other reviews that say these "taste bad".... but I have never had this problem. Because they are capsules I am unsure how anyone could taste them anyway, unless they were punctured or chewed. They are rather large capsules, but they go down fine. I would recommend them.
