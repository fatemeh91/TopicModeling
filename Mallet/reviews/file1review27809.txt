review/text: I just finished a 90 day fitness challenge and Gold Standard whey protein was a part of every single day. It made a great protein supplement. I enjoyed the taste (only used the "double rich chocolate"). For me, the only downside was that it was a little hard to mix. I ended up using it in a smoothie most of the time as it wouldn't dissolve completely just in a glass of milk. However, this is the first protein supplement I've used and that might be par for the course with protein. Overall it's a great product and I will continue to use it now that the fitness challenge is done.
