review/text: I'm in my thirties and was recommended these by a friend as I was having knee and elbow pain from boxing and running. I have been taking them for three weeks and after about a week I noticed relief, and after three weeks my knee is fine and the pain and restriction in my elbow is greatly reduced, I haven't made any other changes to my regiment or diet other than adding these tablets so I'm very happy to keep taking them.
