review/text: I first saw these being used in the reality kings videos and wondered what kind of condom it was. I did some research and found it was the skinless skin now called crown condoms. I used to use Trojans and Durex but now I only use these. These are the most comfortable condom I've ever used! They go on easy and stay on, they are snug but not too tight or too loose, they're just right. I can feel so much with these it's very close to bareback and they have a very nice natural feel to them. Don't let the pink color fool you, the pink actually makes it blend in better with your skin. I usually buy these in the 100 pack, I'm a single guy so I do go through a lot of these. And you get the most bang for your buck if you buy in bulk. Yes it's true they did move production to Thailand but these still blow anything out of the water for the price. I've never never had one break on me yet! At least try the 12 pack for 2.xx seeming as though they're so cheap.
