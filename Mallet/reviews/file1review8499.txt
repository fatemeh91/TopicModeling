review/text: I don't think you could find a better bottle brush than this one. As with all OXO products, it has a soft grip. It has a somewhat flexible shaft with a well designed set of bristles. I have neuropathy, which makes it hard for me to grip many items but the OXO soft grip works perfectly.I am quite pleased with the OXO bottle brush and would highly recommend it to you.
