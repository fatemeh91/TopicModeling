review/text: A friend whipped out a bottle of DMSO on the tennis court and requested I try it. I am recovering from ankle reconstruction. Wow - he was right! Although I am cleared to be active, I have a long way to go in my recovery and often get a bit sore. Now I can grab a bottle of DMSO out of my bag, roll it across my scar, and voila, I feel great again! I especially love the roller ball so I can keep my hands clean.
