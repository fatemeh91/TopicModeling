review/text: If you are eating gluten-free and you want bready products, psyllium husk is the way to go. I add about 1/8 of a cup to cup of flour for things like breadsticks, bread, and pizza dough to make a chewy, bread-like texture. Gums or gelatin do not do as good of a job. However, do not use in quick bake goods like cookies, pancakes, or such or the texture will be off. This is the least expensive way to get psyllium that I've found, and I love this product.
