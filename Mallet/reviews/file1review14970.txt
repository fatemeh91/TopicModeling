review/text: I started taking Futurebiotics Hair Skin & Nails Vitamins last year, following a life-threatening bout of septicemia, after which my hair started falling out at an alarming rate. Within three weeks of starting the vitamins I had thousands of small new hairs growing in all over my scalp. And my nails are beautiful and strong, healthly and natural. Even my dry, flaky skin has greatly improved. No more embarrassing flakes everywhere. And as an added benefit, this multi-vitamin compares favorably to the best brands on the market, and Amazon offers them at the lowest price.
