review/text: Online shopping is always a hit or miss. Yes, for some products there may be dozens or hundreds of positive reviews, but who knows how many of those people are being compensated for writing them, etc. I want to write this as a real, ordinary person who ordered this after a half hour of comparing reviews for this and similar products.I casually decided to open it before I wrapped it up for Christmas, just so I could see what it looked like in person and also to give it a quick try. Here I am twenty minutes later completely blissed out and surprised by how well this works!I didn't need the instructions manual, as using this feels fairly intuitive to me. The knobs are, as the other reviews say, pretty hard but that makes it all the easier for you--you don't need to push as hard to get it to work. I highly recommend this product, I have never felt inclined to write a review before.That being said, we should all support our local businesses in addition to online shopping! Just saying!
