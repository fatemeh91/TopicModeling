review/text: The smell when you open the tub is awesome...so if you want the best smelling protein this is for you...now the taste is another matter altogether. I didn't know until I purchased this that it contains no sweeteners at all, at least I don't see any on the label list/nutrition info, so maybe that is why it has a flat taste. I don't mind artificial or natural sweeteners in my protein in the name of flavor but this was lacking and had to add my own sweetener to the shake just to tolerate it. If you really like banana flavor I'd have to recommend theMyofusion Banana Perfection - 5 lb - Powderinstead as it actually tasted of banana and was sweet. So kind of a waste of money as I did not enjoy it but i will finish it just to not let it go to waste but I won't purchase another tub of Dymatize unless it's theDymatize Nutrition Elite12-hour Protein Powder, Blueberry Muffin, 4.4-Pound Tubwhich I do enjoy and contains sucralose, so I don't see why there isn't any sweetener in this product.
