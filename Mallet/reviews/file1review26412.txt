review/text: OK so I only have a wife that thanked me, but this is a great product and works well. We had been using "The Relaxor" which is a similar design and was sold at Long's Drug store for about $12.00. We were buying a new one every 6 months because of the poor quality.This is comparable in price but far superior in quality. Nice that it is waterproof so it is easy to wash and has the purrrrfect speed to keep the fun coming. Enjoy :)
