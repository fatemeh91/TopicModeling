review/text: My two sons, ages almost 3 and 4 1/2 are on the Autism spectrum and are fussy about what food/drinks they like. Getting them to take vitamins? No problem now! We call this "yummy juice," and they drink it down fast. I have to put it away quickly so they won't ask for more. Great purchase!!
