review/text: I quite like this toothbrush. First, it has a smaller asian brush head than the typical american toothbrush. (For some reason, I found this to be the case when purchasing toothbrushes in China or Japan.) I prefer smaller brushes so I can get in the back of the wisdom teeth, which is difficult with a larger chunk of plastic. Anyhow, kudos to this brush on size alone. The ionic aspect it quite effective. It definitely seems to reduce plaque, based on feedback from my hygienist. Combined with regular flossing, I think this is the cleanest you can get your teeth at home. Also, note on usage... putting too much toothpaste on the brush will render the ionic action useless. If you look at the hole in the handle of the brush, this is where the ions gather. If this gets blocked up with toothpaste slobber, then it won't work. So really, try it without paste first. I add just a tiny smidgen, more for the taste than anything.
