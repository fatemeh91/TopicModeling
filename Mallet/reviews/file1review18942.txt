review/text: I don't mind the bulkiness, since I like the external armor feel. But I do have to Lysol it after I use it. Yesterday I did one hour moderate cardio on the elliptical, and it was completely soaked by the end of the workout. I will have to wash it. Also, you can only wear it for a couple of hours.I put them on before going dancing. I can stay on the dance floor longer. This design is intended to provide compression, but because of this, by the end of the night, they become uncomfortable.I'm looking for an upgrade, but something on the higher end, such as a Don Joy, that, unfortunately, requires a prescription, which is a bit of a hassle. This one you can just buy off the shelf.
