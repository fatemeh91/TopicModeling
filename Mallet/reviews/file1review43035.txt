review/text: PROs: It lifts your belly to relieve pressure and pain, just like it says it does. Not in any sort of miraculous way, but it definitely helped with my sciatic pain and extreme pressure from my son dropping so low (baby #3 in 4 years will do that to you).CONs: The straps come up WAY to high on your chest. You can't wear anything but crew neck shirts. That eliminates pretty much everything in my maternity wardrobe. I dress modestly, I have nothing that is cleavage baring, but even still, the straps come up so high you can see them. It's really annoying when you're already so limited in clothing choice.The chest section presses on your ribs. This isn't terribly uncomfortable, but any pregnant woman will tell you this is something you REALLY want to avoid. It exacerbates heartburn quite a bit, and makes it even more difficult to breathe than it already is with a moving bowling ball pushing up into your diaphragm.It is very small. I am 5'8, 115 before pregnancy (size 3 pants) and currently 149lbs (size Small Tall maternity pants) at 33 weeks. I ordered a small which says it's good for under 5'10, pre-pregnancy pants size 3-10, and current weight of 90-165lbs. I never get past the 150s in pregnancy, so I ordered the small, worried that I should have ordered the petit. I can only get it to snap on the largest setting it has. I definitely should have got the next size up even though I'm never going to reach the minimum weight/size requirements of that size. Because I'm tall, I also have very small pregnancy bellies, I don't grow outward very far. They really should fix the sizing!
