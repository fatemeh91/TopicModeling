review/text: This product will not replace your standard anti-perspirant but its not a bad natural option if you don't sweat much and its not hot outside and you are willing to reapply it throughout the day. I put this on in the heat of Southern CA and I started to stink within 2 hours. In addition, the wild rose scent reminds me of a grandma. I only use this deodorant as a refresher before going to the gym.
