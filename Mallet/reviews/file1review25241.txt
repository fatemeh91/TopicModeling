review/text: You will need this to add to the base station to the Sennheiser Set 50 TV Wireless Mono Assistive TV Listening System. This extra battery will sit in the charger and when the main unit battery gets weak, it is very easy to switch batteries. Order at the same time you get the device. A unique battery so you should get now as it may not be in stores.
