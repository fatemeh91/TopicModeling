review/text: The zadro suction cup mirror is ideal for traveling. I will make my adjustments. I bought a regular mirror (no magnifying) and take duct tape to attach it to the side I will be using, that way when traveling I can see the back of my hair while styling. The other advantage is the magnifying makes it easy to apply makeup, pluck eyebrows, nose hairs, hairs around mouth. I only wished they had a clip on non-magnifying mirror included than I would not have to make my own.
