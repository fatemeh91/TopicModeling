review/text: This drug makes me extremely nauseated. I took it about 5 hours ago and I'm still shaky and it's a really odd feeling, hard to describe. It did give me energy, but I'd rather have a few cups of coffee than experience this weird sick to my stomach feeling. I even took it on a full stomach! Don't waste your money.
