review/text: I have tried other disposable razors and thought that the Gillette Daisy plus was better than most. It provides a very smooth shave, especially with the double blade system. The only thing I didn't care for was the moisture strip along the top of the blade. It didn't make for a smoother shave in my opinion. In fact, I'd prefer not to have it at all. Overall, a very good product that I'd definitely recommend to others.
