review/text: This my second review for the product. I'm not sure what happened to the first one.First time, I believe I rated it as 3 stars due to poor packaging. Recently while ordering something else on Amazon I found a gift card from unknown sources. After some investigation I realized that the company actually refunded shipping and send me email stating that they are sorry and are addressing the problem. I really impressed that they actually listen! I am sorry I somehow missed their email when they sent itBack to the review. I bought the batteries for a lawn mover. They work great and I have them for 2+ month now. Those batteries are high quality batteries and I expect them to last for at least few years. That was the reason I decided to go with a bit more expensive batteries. The shelf life is quite a bit better then the cheaper ones. The shelf life was another reason for my choice. Basically it means even if the battery were sitting some time in a warehouse it did not loose its capacity.Shipping was fast.
