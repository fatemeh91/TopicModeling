review/text: I don't assume this is unique to zippo lighters, but the fluid evaporates extremely quickly if you don't use it. If you're not going to be carrying this around in your pocket, get a 99 cent bic lighter. If you are going to be carrying a lighter around then it's still easier to just buy disposable lighters.
