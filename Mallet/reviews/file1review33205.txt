review/text: I have been taking these for almost a year- they are amazing. At the first sign of getting sick, follow the directions, I would take more than 1 etc. I would swallow them with a bite of food to get around the taste. They worked 100% of the time.I bought them at GNC. My GNC is out of them. I went on-line, ordered them, and much to my delight saved 50%. Yea. I took 1 today and got so dizzy and sick and nausious. Ugh. Why would I order something on-line and swallow it???? I do not recommend buying this on-line.
