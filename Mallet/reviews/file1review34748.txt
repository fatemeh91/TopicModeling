review/text: I tried all the regular store brand deodorants. They all stained my shirts, got white gunk all in my arm pits, were sticky like glue if they were clear, nasty... I finally found Men's Herbal Pine and have been using for 5 years. It goes on clear with a manly scent. I use 4 pumps per pit. This is not an antiperspirant! IF your pits really stink, you may not be happy with this. If I have had a hard day, I may end up a little musty at the end of the day but I am willing to give up a little for an organic deodorant that works perfectly 95% of the time.
