review/text: Simply put, you won't know how you lived without it. The relief is virtually INSTANT. It heats up rocket fast with automatic moist heat that has been cranking like brand new for years. I own two myself and have purchased many others as gifts for friends/relatives. There is no way you will be disappointed. The cover is thick and quality-made and washes up beautifully.The only issue you might have is the hand control. You must depress constantly for the pad to continue to heat (this is a safety in case you fall asleep). Keep in mind that once this comes to the heat level you like, it will maintain that heat for at least 5-10 minutes even when you stop depression However, they now make them without this feature so really, there's nothing negative here.
