review/text: I didn't even know that I was magnesium deficient until I stumbled upon an article that explained magnesium's role in NMDA receptor balance in the brain. Having long suspected that I possessed an imbalance I sought various techniques to balance. You can do some research on NMDA, but they are tied to alcoholism and other destructive behaviors.Since beginning to take Magnesium Taurate I've noticed a marked increase in energy and general well being. My body just feels better and I find it much easier to focus on tasks. I believe that magnesium imbalance is a national health crisis that needs to be addressed. Living in Europe where my primary source of water was mineral water containing magnesium, I was surprised at my body's rapid muscle gain and the level of growth that I felt. Returning to America I once again found myself plagued by similar fatigue symptoms.In conclusion, give this product a try. I've found it to be very helpful.
