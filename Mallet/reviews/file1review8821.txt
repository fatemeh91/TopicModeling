review/text: A good product but over-rated. Here's why: Contains a large proportion of lecithin. Lecithin is a BY PRODUCT of the soy oil industry. Chemo guys were at some point assigned to find uses for effluence from processing beans into oil. Lecithin--and various extraction of that, such phosphotidyl choline, choline itself, mono and di glycerides, and a few other exotic "value-added" stuff--is not really a natural food, and does contain elements of the psuedo-estrogen found in soybeans. How much I know not, but it's there. In a word: Lecithin is FILLER.I also fault this and any other green drink for containing probiotics. Most peeps will take a seperate probiotic and it is best to stick with one brand at a time, rather than load your guts with all manner and sundry of "good" germs which may or may not be "synergistic, but indeed antagonistic. There are no adequate studies done about this, but there should be, since Probiotics is, one can argue, the fastest growing sector of "health foods". Besides, whenever you open the container--which Vibrant Energy says to store in freezer--the probiotics are losing life, and by the time you get the bottom of the barrel, especially if you buy large (no, not Costo-large, as Costco won't be carrying the likes of these products anytime soon, IMO) there's probably little value left in the probiotic apportionment of Green Vibrance.Suggestion: barley or wheat grass juice and spirulina are all you need for a powerful green drink, sans fillers.
