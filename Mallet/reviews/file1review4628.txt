review/text: Just got this yesterday and so far am very impressed. First off, great design from the shape of the handle etc to the holder itself. If you like cool industrial design for the masses (think Michael Graves and so on at Target) then this will make you happy. It's also an impressive piece of manufacturing, that they can get the five blades lined up with such accuracy. Extra points for the design geeks.More importantly of course, the shaving experience itself. I live in Minnesota which right now (winter) has quite a dry climate, so a harsh shave will leave you with raw, uncomfortable skin for most of the day. I'm not sure if this razor gave a closer shave than with my Mach 3, but it certainly was way quicker and required fewer re-strokes, which cuts down on irritation and the potential for nicks and cuts. It was easy to shave the hard-to-manage parts of my face where the hairs aren't all lying in the same direction, like under my jaw, which again cut down on the number of re-strokes. Once I got used to the extra razor on the back of the cartridge, I liked the way I could use it as advertised: for near my nose, round my goatee etc.I have to admit that I thought five blades sounded ridiculous, but it does seem to work just as stated in the manufacturer's blurb.UPDATE: Now had this for about two weeks, and I'm continuing to be happy with it. I've noticed a lot fewer problems with ingrown hairs and little nicks and cuts. The cartridges seem to last a good long time too - I haven't had to change the first one yet and it still does a good job.
