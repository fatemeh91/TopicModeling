review/text: Within the first week the blade got weak and it would pull the hair before cutting it. OUCH! OUCH! OUCH! Then it would frequently stop spinning. This was very painful when a nose hair is caught in the trimmer and you have to pull it out. OUCH! OUCH! OUCH! Basically I read all the good reviews and thought maybe I just got a defective one, so I was dumb enough to get it again. Exact same experience. Either I have an abundance of thick nose hairs or this is a crappy product. It might very well be a combination of the two.Honestly, every Panasonic product I've owned has broken down on me before a resonable time. I opted to splurge and get a "heavy duty" nose hair trimmer from Sharper Image, and am quite pleased with it.
