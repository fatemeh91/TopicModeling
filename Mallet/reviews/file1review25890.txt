review/text: This was a add on to the camera I bought, the charger is easy to use and handle and already saved me batteries twice so far. I think this was a great packaging idea. Kudos to them. I would tell anyone who is buying a camera or other item that uses lots and lots of batteries that this is just great idea to save money while having charged batteries on hand at all times.
