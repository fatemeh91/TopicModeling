review/text: The cane is great for getting at places you can't on your own and for applying pressure without wearing out your hands in the process. However, you really have to experiment with the device to figure out how to use it best. With all the curves and knobs, for me it took some time. The little booklet that is provided with purchase is just a few pages.You can also easily apply too much pressure, but that too comes with practice. A useful device, a bit overpriced, but effective with practice.
