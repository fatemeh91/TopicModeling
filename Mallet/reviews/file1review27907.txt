review/text: Most people here highlight all the important stuff. I just wanted to add a few of my own comments that would be beneficial to others in my situation.1) Double Chocolate is good. If you like the flavor of coffee (like the sugary cappuccino coffee @ gas stations), coffee is way better. You can mix it with water, and it tastes just as good as if you use soy.2) I use this one to two times a day with p90x, and have seen great results. I'm on my second round of p90x, and would recommend this stuff to anyone. To clarify what I mean by results, all the major muscle groups have gotten larger (especially chest and legs), and yet I've still lost around 15 pounds. I credit the results to hard work, and p90x, but this protein is my breakfast each day.3) I workout every morning at 5am, then go work construction for 10 hours. Thus, I combine this with accelerade (also available on amazon) and feel pretty good throughout the day.
