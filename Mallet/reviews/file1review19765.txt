review/text: This has been very easy for my son to use. It doesn't wobble on the seat so he feels secure. A tall stool makes it easy for him to toilet independently. He started using the separate toilet seat at around 20 months and had success using this seat independently (as a transition to no seat at all) at around 30 months. Highly recommended as a transition from a separate potty chair to the toilet. Also great to bring along for trips.
