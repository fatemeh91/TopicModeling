review/text: The back buddy is ah-mazing.I was considering purchasing a thera-cane having just learned some trigger point therapy techniques from a friend.My friend has something like this also but not as many knobs and functions as the body back buddy.This is a sensational tool for myofascial release spots in your back and neck, one that cannot be overlooked.For me, it's a absolute must have.
