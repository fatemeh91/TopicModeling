review/text: I have been having some pain in my upper back / near my shoulders from sitting at the desk typing and using the mouse at my job. This cane helps some!It's not a miracle device that made all my pain go away, but it certainly helps and has made it feel better. At least I know when it gets really bad, and I don't have someone around, that I can use the cane to help relax the muscles in my back and make it feel better.Looks a little strange... and when I received it at my work's shipping address, I got some funny comments about its appearance from my co-workers. lol....Anyway, I recommend it! Will it cure all pains? No. Will it help? Yes!
