review/text: I have been using this product off & on for years & it works!Tea Tree Info: The unrefined concentrated Tea Tree oil is caustic & should not be taken internally. If the oil has been refined properly it has many wonderful, effective topical uses. The leaves of the Tea Tree (Melaleuca) plant have been used for ages as a tea (hence the name). I drink it. Many concentrated oils from plants (essential oils) are caustic but we eat the food they come from such as oranges, cloves, thyme, oregano, etc. It is still possible, though, to to be allergic to almost anything but if using any product of this type for the first time you may suffer a Yeast (candida) die-off reaction (very unpleasant). Google search for more info.
