review/text: I love this product. I am 46 years old, female, I have always had PMS probably closer to PMDD. Starving, aches, headaches, depression, anger, tears, very heavy periods, and anemic. This only got worse as I got older, at my age I am probably pre-menopause. I am not normally someone who takes supplements of any kind, I generally believe you should get your nutrition from your food. However, this product has changed my life. It has almost eliminated my PMS/PMDD! My periods are also light much more manageable. Also it has eliminated the cravings during PMS, so I have for the first time, been able to successfully change my eating habits, even during PMS when I would normally give in to every craving.
