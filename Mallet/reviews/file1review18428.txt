review/text: I purchased a AL100 Personal Digital Breath Alcohol Tester for my daughter. It is nice and compact and fits easily in her purse. I know she uses it when she goes out because I have heard her girlfriends talk about it and they enjoy checking "where they are at".It is quick and easy for them to set up.
