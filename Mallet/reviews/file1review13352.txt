review/text: Worked great. Just finished potty training and this is perfect for protecting the mattress from occasional accidents. without having to remove the entire mattress pad. It is very thick, though, so takes up alot of space in the washer. However after 6 mos with a waterproof liner on the bed and my son waking up soaked in sweat (they are very hot), this seems to be the perfect solution.
