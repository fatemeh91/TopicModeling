review/text: First off, as always, everyone's body is different. This is simply my experience so YMMV. I have taken many different Thermogenic/Fat Burning supplements throughout the past 7 years: Lipo 6, Lipo 6x, Lipo 6 Black, Hydroxycut, OxyElite Pro, ALRI Venom, Applied Nutrition RPM, Controlled Labs REDuction, and have just now finished a can of Animal CUTS. Some have worked great and some have worked okay, but this was the first one I've used that did *nothing*.I felt none of the usual effects of a thermo - no energy boost, no extra sweating/heat, no increase in heart beat, no extra focus or mood enhancement, no appetite suppression, nothing. And most importantly, I did not lose one single body fat % over the 3-week cycle. This product was completely ineffectual at doing anything except giving me heartburn and a bad aftertaste. I have about 35 lbs (or 10% body fat) to lose, so it is not that I am too close to ideal. I followed the directions, I eat right (myfitnesspal calories input every day and eat clean foods), drink 8-14 cups of water a day, work out with high reps/lower weight 3-4 days a week, and cardio on bicycle or elliptical for 30min-hour 3-4 days a week.TL;DR: Worst thermogenic I have used out of 9 different products. Product did nothing but give me heartburn. Did not help fat loss. YMMV as every body is different.
