review/text: I am still hopeful regarding this product despite my poor experience. I want this stuff to work and hope to come back and edit my review at some point. My colleague was so vehement in swearing by this stuff, with several examples of others she knows that it works great for, that I went online and bought 2 of the biggest bottles of 180 tabs and 2 of the largest bottles of the alcohol-free tincture (for my 3 year old) to keep us healthy against those nasty pre-school germs. He recently started preschool and it's been the typical runny noses & colds plaguing everyone in our home relentlessly since then. Probably a coincidence, but the week I got the stuff and began taking it, I felt a flu coming on, so I did the triple dose every 3 hrs as suggested and ended up getting one of the worst flus I've had in 15 years despite nearly going through 90 tabs! I've had several colds since then, and each time I try to thwart it at the "first signs of imbalance" as the bottle says, by taking 3 tabs every 3 hrs, and each time I still get sick. WTF??? My husband actually makes fun of me now because taking Wellness Formula is such a joke, I'm always getting sick regardless! And yes, the tabs are so big and stinky they make me gag, but if the stuff worked, I wouldn't care. I am just so disappointed with this stuff (or with my immune system vs. preschool), bah!
