review/text: I saw a youtube video about how great this product is but when I went online to search for more reviews I noticed that all reviews prior to 2010 are great and after 2010 were not good at all. I read that the company has changed over to inexpensive ingredients. I was really looking forward to using this product but after learning about the new ingredients and reading the reviews after 2010 I will continue my search for a natural peel product. Suggestions anyone?
