review/text: This is a wonderful combination of vitamins and herbs that really helps when I feel a cold coming on. The beauty of amazon is that I was able to buy it in Michigan and send it to my daughter in Florida when she was feeling sick. Which is funny because when she lived at home, she would fight me to take them (but she took them). Then she went off to school and the first thing she asked for when she was feeling sick was the wellness formula. They are a little hard to get past the nose (I just plug my nose), but they work wonders. One might say "miraculous". They also have a liquid elixir that is good in orange juice, well let's not say "good" but palatable. I would not be well without them.
