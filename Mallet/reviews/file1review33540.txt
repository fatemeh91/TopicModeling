review/text: I have always had Water Pik and never have had a problem. Not this time, however. I purchased the WP-65. It worked fine shooting the water through, but there seemed to be only a very weak or a very strong pulse; therefore, when I wanted it on the medium setting (#3), the force was the same as on the high setting. I sent it back and received a replacement which worked beautifully for the first two days. Then, when I filled the resevoir with water, it leaked out the bottom. Faulty gasket, I presumed. When I realized after several attempts that it was indeed the machine and not me, I sent it back again. I have switched to a different brand.
