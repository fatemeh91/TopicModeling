review/text: this trimmer IS the best nose hair trimmer I have used by far. Be warned however- if you've never used a good one it will take getting used to. It is occasionally painful- not REALLY bad at all but you will notice it for sure if it grabs a hair the wrong way. I was very surprised to not see others talk about this in their reviews.Alas, mine was dropped on CARPET and died on me. Take VERY good care of it as it is obviously fragile and the length of life is questionable even if you do take care of it. I am purchasing another as it is so good, but Panny would do well to make it cut a little easier and absorb the inevitable drop.
