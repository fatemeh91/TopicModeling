review/text: I bought this cleaner two weeks ago, thinking this would save me time and energy cleaning my bathroom. So far, it's doing a good job with keeping the tub clean, but I'm not too thrilled with the way the shower curtain is looking. It seems to create more of a buildup on the shower curtain. I have to take a sponge and wipe off the shower curtain three times a week.In my honest opinion, I'm not a fan of Scrubbing Bubbles, even though it was a good concept. I think I'll just stick to my Comet cleanser and scrubber brush :o)
