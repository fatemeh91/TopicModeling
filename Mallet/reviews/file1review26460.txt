review/text: I've used this product for many years, and I have to say that after trying others this one is still the best. Forget the Fukuoku and the others. The quality and portability of this little gadget can hardly compare to others. Watch out for imitations though. I tried those too and they don't last nearly as long...Also very compact and portable, in case you need to travel.
