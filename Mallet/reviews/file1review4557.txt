review/text: I held out with the Mach 3 up till now, with highly satisfying shaves. Two shaves with the manual Fusion Proglide illustrates the improvement convincingly. The spots around the nose are just as easy to shave with both. The upper lip is easier with the Proglide. My main problem area is the chin. Even the Mach 3 has to be maneuvered carefully to shave effectively and without skin iritation.Enter the Proglide: my most difficult chin area gets shaved easily, effectively, with no whiskers left even against the grain, and with complete comfort and freedom from blade irritation. No cuts, no nicks, which is the norm with the 2-blade razors I rarely use. Am extremely happy with the manual Fusion Proglide, feeling it gives the best shave I've had.Have not used this enough times to test its long-term effectiveness, but I may try updating this after several days.
