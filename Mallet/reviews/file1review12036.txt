review/text: I'm so glad to have found these. I was taking a different brand prenatal vitamins, which were about the same size, 3 at a time, twice a day. With those I HAD to take them with food. Now I can just take one whenever, with or without food (although sometimes I notice a bad flavor if I don't take them with food--extra liquid helps a lot though). Also, since there's only one pill, my urine doesn't get quite so bright yellow or smelly.Easy to swallow with liquid, great price, only have to purchase every three months, great mix of vitamins and minerals plus digestive supplement, does not repeat on me.
