review/text: Upon arrival, I was impressed with the quality of this pen. I had read the reviews before I purchased this pen and based on what was written, I had to take the plunge. The only qualm I have is when the pen arrived, the metal clip was slightly scratched (hence the four stars). I do not feel this is a major setback as it will be a matter of time before I add my own scratches.I had also read how certain individuals are disturbed that Cross pens are made/assembled in China. This however, does not bother me. Cross has an excellent warranty on all pens so this wasn't much of a concern. The other issue was the marks on the pen not lining up which is correct. This again is not really to much trouble as the lines are barely visable unless you are looking closely. I would imagine if this pen was indeed made in the USA, the cost would be much higher. Anyhow, great product.
