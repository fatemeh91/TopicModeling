review/text: The pill containers are perfect for my needs, the colors are cute. The stand squeaks when pulled across a smooth surface, so I added two pieces of masking tape on each end, that got rid of the issue. I enjoy filling the containers! I am able easily to dump out the pills for one section by placing part of my hand over the other section. Each section is big enough for 3 medium, 1 large, and 1 small pill. Wouldn't work if you take a whole lot of vitamin/supplement size pills!
