review/text: When I was pregnant I bought this in case my water broke in bed. We have a new mattress and I didn't want to take any chances. We also have dogs who used to sleep in the bed. This cover was a good investment. We've never had any accidents, but I feel better that it's there. It doesn't make any "plastic" sounds and is soft and flexible. It is also easy to clean. Now that we have a baby (and are expecting another) I think this was a good purchase that will last for years... I'm sure bottles, sippie cups, etc. will fall at some point, and I know our mattress will be safe. We are very happy with this purchase!
