review/text: This is my second pregnancy and both times I was in a great deal of discomfort...so much so that I couldn't walk some days.This prenatal cradle has made a world of difference and allowed me to enjoy my pregnancy. I highly recommend it. The only downside is that the straps do sometimes show when you're wearing an open neck shirt.
