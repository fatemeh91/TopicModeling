review/text: Ordered this for my dad as it was easier for him to use (by himself) than an arm cuff. It, so far, has worked out well and the ease of using it means he will monitor his BP on a regular basis.Medical professionals have told me that it is, sometimes, not as accurate as a cuff. But, if BP is not at a risky level, this is acceptable. One point, with a wrist monitor, it is necessary to 1) be at rest for 5 min and 2) the wrist must be held up at angle to heart for most accurate reading, not simply laying flat on arm of chair or in lap.I have recommended these to others with aging parents.
