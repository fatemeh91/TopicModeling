review/text: My doctor told me to buy a cuff to check my blood pressure from time to time. I didn't know what brand to choose so I came on to Amazon and read the reviews..I am very pleased with my choice of Omron. Directions are easy to understand, fits perfect on my wrist. works terrific. Great price for the money.Amelia Petre/Ridgefield, CT.
