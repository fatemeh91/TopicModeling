review/text: I purchased this trimmer for the sake of removing the guide comb and trimming my beard to have a "shadow" remaining, and used the comb to maintain a sculpted chin with a setting of 3 or 4. This trimmer allows you to flip a wheel to increase or decrease the width between the guide comb and trimmer head.I went with the Remington MB-200 due to the cost and high star rating here on Amazon, and I was very let down. For starters, like mostly everything else made today, this thing is made with super low quality fragile plastic, in and out. The guide comb is extremely breakable and is made of the thinnest plastic.However, that was not my main issue. I used this trimmer only five times until it completely broke down. Remington used a cheap underpowered motor. In my specific case, the little rotating motor pin under the trimmer head simply died down the more the trimmer was activated (it was audibly struggling to the point where it sounded like a car whose transmission was about to die). Eventually it stopped working entirely, and it could no longer nudge the trimmer head anymore, even though it was fully charged.This experience made me realize that it might be better to simply choke up the $80+ to get a real trimmer, preferably a salon-quality one from a big name like Oster, with metallic guide combs. After all, this is something I'll be using every day for the rest of my life. I'm guessing these cheap items are assumed to die down in the short-run and therefore be "disposable."
