review/text: It works. It's okay. I will probably buy a different silicone lube next time (pjur), if only for the bottle. I think it's a little thinner and not quite as nice as the other brand of silicone I've used, but honestly just opening this badly designed bottle is a buzzkill and I haven't closely compared the contents of the bottle.This 8.9oz bottle is awkward and messy to use. The stuff dribbles out, inevitably smearing the bottle, and it's difficult to control the amount. Oops, too little. Oops, too much. Messy and bleh. Once that hassle is over, it works fine.
