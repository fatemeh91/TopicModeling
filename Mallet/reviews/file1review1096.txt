review/text: First I am going to say it is a great price what I paid at Amazon. I have looked at the local box stores and you will get only one with that price what Amazon is charging.As far the product goes it is a great product to take care of your Tennis Elbow. Recently I got Tennis Elbow. I have tried physical therapy, medication, other Tennis Elbow support products and none of them work as this Futuro Tennis Elbow Support. Some of them I had worked for couple of weeks and then it worn out. In addition to take care of my Tennis Elbow for me it do give great use to take my luggage in out of luggage carrousel because I travel every week and it do not put that much pressure on my elbow. Thanks Futuro making a great product.
