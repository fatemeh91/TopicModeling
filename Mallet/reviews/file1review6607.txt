review/text: There is only one thing that I wish this tool would be and that is more travel friendly. It is a bit odd shaped and difficult to fit into a small to medium-sized gym bag and back pack. Otherwise I'd take it with me everywhere. It is very effective at getting rid of all the aches and pains developed after sleeping in a bad position, working long hours, sitting at a computer for too long, traveling, and over-exertion. I must have saved several hundred dollars in massage therapy and pain killer medication costs in the past year and a half that I've owned this.
