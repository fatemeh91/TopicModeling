review/text: This heating pad has been so helpful in loosing up tight back muscles prior to playing golf. There have also been very cold nights when my calf muscles have cramped and I use this moist heating pad to relax the cramps for a good nights sleep. I highly recommend the thermophore moist heating pad for any aching muscles.
