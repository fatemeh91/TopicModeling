review/text: Nifty idea, but breaks too easily. I purchased this item due to my back problem and it worked great for a while until the grip fell off. I thought it was just a manufacturing defect and therefore purchased another one. Same problem again. Will not buy again. A typical As Seen on TV item, poorly constructed.
