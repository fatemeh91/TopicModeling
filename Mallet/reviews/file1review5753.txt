review/text: The Vitaminder and Medication Dispenser does work very well. It holds all the vitamins I need. When we travel I use this and it eliminates having to pack all our various vitamin bottles. The brown tint helps shade them from sunlight while still allowing you to see which vitamin is in each slot. For carrying a small extra daily supply of my meds and vitamins in my purse I found theEzy Dose Disposable Pill Pouchesto be ideal. ~ Mrs. B.
