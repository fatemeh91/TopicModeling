review/text: I've got hardwood floors throughout but I needed to get into corners. I already have the OXO dust pan so thought this would do the trick. It did! The bristles stay clean after use. Also, I want everything, even a broom, to be well designed. All OXO products have a good look but follow the adage "form follows function".
