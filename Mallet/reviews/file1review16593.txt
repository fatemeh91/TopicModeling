review/text: My search for a lighter included the terms butane and refillable. And this lighter's description included this phrase: "Uses butane fuel (sold separately)" Unfortunately the lighter I received was NOT a butane lighter and had a wick and instructions on how to fill with lighter fluid. Looks like I received the correct lighter but the description is wrong. Too bad as it is a nice looking and feeling lighter but if you are looking for a butane lighter, this is not the right one.
