review/text: I just received my Prenatal Cradle Plus so I can't give a very detailed review yet, but I can tell you that it instantly helps with the pain of vulvular varicosities. I have been unable to walk without pain for weeks and this made a difference immediately. I tried the crazy support stockings and everything, but this is tons better.I had it shipped to my office and was able to figure it out and put it on in a restroom stall, and at seven months pregnant, doing anything in a restroom stall is a trick! Some have complained about the top straps showing but I found a way around that. Get some of the tiny binder clips from the office supply section and clip the straps to your bra. These clips don't have sharp edges and you don't even know they are there.I agonized over the price of this thing for a long time, but even after just a few hours in it, I totally think it was worth it. My doctor recommended it and my insurance even covered it. If you want to file yours, get a prescription from your doc and save your receipt. It is considered a medical device by my insurer (a major company in the southeast) so maybe yours will cover it too.
