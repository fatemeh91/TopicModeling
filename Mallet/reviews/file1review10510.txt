review/text: I got this product to take along with my total body cleanse because it's made by the same company, and I had heard it is good to get more fiber, especially when detoxing, so as to help absorb the toxins. When I got home, however, after taking fiberSMART for a few days I was looking more closely at the Supplement Facts on the back of the bottle. Truth is this product only contains 1g of fiber per 4 capsules. So even if you take the 12 capsules per day, you're only actually getting 3g of fiber. WTF!? Just eat a slice of bread and you'll get more.
