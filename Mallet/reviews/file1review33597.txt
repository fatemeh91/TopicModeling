review/text: I thought I would go with the Waterpik name in that I have had their products in the past and got many years of use out of it. This particular model seems to work OK at first but within 60 days the control for the different settings stops working. You have to keep moving it from low to high to try to find one that works. Maybe it works for a day or two but then you have to try another setting.I have gotten this model twice, thinking I got a bad one the first time, but the second one had the same problems.I am a heavy user of these devices, using it twice a day. I would expect it would hold up to this use.
