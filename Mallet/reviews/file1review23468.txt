review/text: After reading the reviews, I chose this scope. I was terribly disappointed! I could not pick up anything...just an extremely vague thump sound--sometimes! It was no better than a toy in my opinion. I have returned it and plan to buy another scope. How anyone can say they got great use out of this is beyond me!
