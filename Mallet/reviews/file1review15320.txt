review/text: I purchased this holder and was very surprised at the excellent quality and workmanship of this case. It's made of sturdy leather and fits my standard size zippo perfectly. Keeps your lighter safe. I don't wear it on my belt but the loop hooks easily to my purse strap. Very handy!! Love this case!!
