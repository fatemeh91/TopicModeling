review/text: I've tried almost every major protein product on the market and this is the best by miles. Easy to mix and pleasant to drink (Some flavors even with water) you can a ton of value for your dollar. When you mix most protein powders you get clumpy parts but this dissolves pretty easily and makes taking your shake simple and enjoyable.5/5 Stars for me and a perfect product to take before/after you workout or as a quick snack.
