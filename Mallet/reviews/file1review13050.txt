review/text: I bought this neck collar based on the suggestion of my physical therapist. I have degenerative disk disease in my neck which spasms on a regular basis when inflamed. This collar was able to touch all of the right places and the velcro band secured it into place. It really helped to calm the spasms as much as possible.
