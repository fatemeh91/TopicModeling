review/text: This seat is amazing! My 15 month old daughter peed on it the first time she sat on it. We got the smart potty and she was sort of uneasy about it. The minute she sat on this seat she got the biggest smile on her face. It is so super easy to install and doesn't wiggle a bit. It isn't extra colorful and flashy so my daughter feels like she's really using the big girl potty just like mommy. I have seen a couple of complaints about leakage between this seat and the toilet seat. This does not happen if it's installed correctly with the wings clamped under the seat.
