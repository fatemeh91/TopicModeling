review/text: I have seen Bucky products before and they usually have buckwheat or something in them. These are fine for what they are but are not filled. Should &#34;ultralight&#34; have tipped me off? Probably. It does work. Only a very small mout of light gets in. It will serve my purposes for awhile.
