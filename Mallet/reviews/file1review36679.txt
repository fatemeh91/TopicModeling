review/text: Irish Spring Bath Bars are excellent! The smell is pleasing and this soap leaves you feeling fresh and clean. However, I didn't like the shape of the bar. When wet, it was difficult to hold on to. Also, if you have skin that's very sensitive, this is a good soap for you. I have sensitive skin and I had no problems with this bath bar. I would recommend this soap to all my friends and family. I recommend it to you!
