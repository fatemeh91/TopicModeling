review/text: I tried taking 2 at mid day, felt more energy, concentration after about 1-2 hours, lasting for a few hours, not unpleasant, but not the kind you get from dopmaine (ritalin or adderall).Same day could not fall asleep. I tried it again the next day, with the same outcome.Stopped taking it and my sleep returned to its norm.Overall the benefits for me from Vinpocetine are mild to small, but the cost too high.I gave the rest to my mum, she says it doesn't bother with her sleep and that it had helped some with her memory, but she would not pay for it.
