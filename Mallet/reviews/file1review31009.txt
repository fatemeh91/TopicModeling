review/text: I don't know if this works better than any other glucosamine and chondroitin/MSM combo pills I've taken, but let's just say since I've been taking the supplements whether this brand or another, I've gone from HAVING to take celebrex everyday to walk without pain in my knees to none. That's right, zero. It doesn't help that much with the pain in my feet (neither does celebrex) that's bonespur related, but the help with the other pain is worth every cent and every big gulp to get these pills down! to be fair, I also take fish oil and 2000mg of ginger every day to help with inflammation)
