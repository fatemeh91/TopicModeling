review/text: I've never used a daily shower cleaner before - I never wanted to use that much chemicals. So I thought this one, being enivronmentally friendly, would be worth a try. I'm almost at the end of my first bottle & I can't say that my shower stays any cleaner than if I did not use anything at all.A couple of qualifiers on the above statement:- I have a cleaning lady who comes every 2 weeks & I do absolutely nothing to clean the shower in between her visits. I thought that using this between her visits would make a visible difference in cleanliness. I can't see any difference. Maybe our shower just does not get dirty enough between thorough cleanings for a daily product to make sense.- My shower had some hard water stains from before the cleaning lady's time that nothing has been able to get rid of. This product didn't make a dent in them either, but I think that might have been asking too much.- typically my husband showers in the morning & I shower before bed. We only used this daily cleaner after my husband's shower because the bathroom is next to the master bedroom & the smell is too strong for us to want to smell it all night. Using the cleaner only once daily might have lessened it's effectiveness.Regarding the smell - it is not unpleasant, just much too strong. Our master bath is upstairs & you can smell it from the front door while the product is still wet. I am extremely sensitive to odors & typically buy unscented products whenever possible, so don't let my opinion influence your decision too much.Bottom line: If you are going to try this product buy one bottle first to try it out before investing in a case of it - I'm sure glad that I did.
