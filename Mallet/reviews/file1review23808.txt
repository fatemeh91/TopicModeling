review/text: In January '07 I began having left hip joint pain. I couldn't sleep on my left side and even during the day I felt it. It didn't stop me from walking or doing anything that I wanted to do, but it was annoying and troubling and it didn't go away. About June'07 I started taking Phosoplex regularly. Last month, February '08, I noticed that my hip pain was gone. I don't know exactly when it stopped hurting, but the pain is gone and I feel great.
