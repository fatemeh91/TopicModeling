review/text: The purpose of Vata Massage oil is to address the particular vitiation of the vata (air) dosha in the body, which is the etiological cause of around 60-80% of all diseases listed in Ayurvedic literature, including nervous disorders. The oil stinks. At least in my case, it did. Moreover, the fact that it was herbalized proved to have no significant benefits over regular sesame oil, whether I used it for abhyanga or in a basti. Finally, given that this oil is much more expensive than regular sesame oil (from Banyan Botanicals), it is highly recommendable for one to purchase and utilize regular organic sesame oil instead. Those are my two cents.
