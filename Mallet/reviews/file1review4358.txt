review/text: The product is just fine, fit my fusion power handle.When I search, this product popped out as Fusion Pro-glide, and in the link for this product, the text also suggested proglide, but the product I received is just normal fusion. On the webpage itself, the description is correct, but if not looked carefully but just believe the search result, you will think you are buying a proglide. It is confusing.
