review/text: I definitely liked this deodorant a lot. When I first started using DRY IDEA Roll-On, I was a little leery since I had been using ""cream"" deodorants. I didn't know if I would like the ""wetness"" or not. Well, DRY IDEA is the best deodorant I've used in years. Even though it goes on ""wet"", it dries rapidly and doesn't blemish your clothes. It kept me dry all day, even through very stressful situations. At the end of the day, no matter what kind of deodorant I've tried, my clothes either smell like the deodorant or a very slight body odor. Well, with DRY IDEA, this didn't happen. My clothes and my underarms are as fresh as when I got out of the shower and put the clothes on clean. Most deodorants cause me to itch. That's when every few days, I alternate deodorants. With DRY IDEA, this isn't necessary. I've been using it for over one week and still no itching! I'll definitely keep using DRY IDEA!!!
