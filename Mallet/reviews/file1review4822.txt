review/text: I tried the ORAC Energy Greens (another brand) in the plastic container and in the plastic little on the go packets - when I take the on the go packets, I feel great. When I take from the plastic container, I don't feel anything? The same with this Micro Greens mix -- I don't seem to notice a difference in my energy or mental acuity or feelings ? Also the taste is worse than ORAC Energy greens bc it's kind of sweet and minty rather than just being a bland greens taste which is much more palatable. So far, I'm compelled to go back to the ORAC greens packets. I've heard Ormus Greens by Sun Warrior are very good too?
