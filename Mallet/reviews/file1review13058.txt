review/text: I agree with past reviews. The collar does not get quite hot enough and I assume not cold enough either (although I only heat it). After having my neck operated on (C2-C7) last Novemeber, I have suffered from muscle tightness at about shoulder level in my neck. I have gone through many microwavable gel packs from Wal-Mart likely imported from China. The gel in those are much more liquid and will get hotter and stay hotter longer. Unfortunately they blow out at the seams when heated and spill heated oil-gel all over its cover, your neck and any furniture. The last one purchased we immediately put it in a secondary "seal-a-meal" plastic bag prior to its first heating to hopefully extend its life... still leaked all over me, burning the skin on my neck and hands after its second heating.This device is wonderfully fitted. The gel is not liquid so it stays evenly distributed in it's cover. It does give wonderful temporary relief and does allow a person to remain active or at least mobile. I find myself wearing it even when it cools down because it does keep the cold air off the back of my neck which is a primary cause for the muscles tightening. I cook it as recommended, about 40-45 seconds each side, but there is no way in the world that I would let it cool off for 60 seconds before applying to my neck as recommended. I think this product is fantastic and I look forward to purchasing some of their other products in the future.
