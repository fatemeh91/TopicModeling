review/text: I decided to give myself something better than the usual chocolate bunny this year. This bunny is way better than chocolate! Very pretty and glittery color, fun to use, and no icky phthalates! The bunny vibrates at an extremely high level, and those wonderful ears are ticklish in all of the right places. The shaft is the perfect length and girth for my taste- not uncomfortably large, but solid. The rotation function is interesting- I think this is something I will have to play with, to get the most out of this toy. You really need to hold the base firmly to get the feel of the rotation. The beads were fun, but sometimes distracting. I found myself using the rotation and vibration together as a warm up, but when I was ready to orgasm, I needed to shut off the rotation and focus on the vibration. The vibration definitely is reduced when the rotation is turned on. The toy is also quite noisy, so not the best to use if you have roommates. However, this toy is still so much fun, and will provide so much opportunity for experimenting with sensation. I'd recommend it to any woman who is looking for a powerful toy that stimulates multiple parts at once. It seems like a very good quality toy that should last for quite some time. Definitely a great value!
