review/text: I am using this to rebuild the good bacteria while using antifungals to kill off the bad bacteria (candida albicanis). It's been 3 weeks so far and I intend to take for a full 90 days in a high dose and then taper off to a the daily one scoop recommended. I've stopped taking all other probiotics/probiotic brands. I've experienced no negative affects!The symptoms I experience from Candida Albicanis are brain fog, itchy skin and intestinal upset. My symtoms are triggered by dairy/yogurt, sugar and simple carbs (breads, pizza, cheese, coffee, vinegar/salad dressings, fruit).Will post an update after the 90 days goes by.
