review/text: This did not work for us at all, not even a little bit. Maybe it works for others and that's great but for me it was a waste of money.It wouldn't be so bad if it had even half way cleaned our dishwasher but it didn't even do that. Next on the list is trying the FinishDishwasher cleaner, hope I get better results because I'm sick of white chalky residue on my black cooking utensils.
