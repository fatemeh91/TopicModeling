review/text: I think this survival kit deserves another 5-star review. At 3.9 oz., this kit is small, and that's a good thing to me. It's amazing how much stuff is in this little bag. All of the items are of the best quality. The signal mirror is beautiful. The inclusion of a lens magnifier is something I haven't seen in almost any other kit (great backup for fire starting). I know the firestarter that comes with it is normally about $8 just by itself. I just tried out the Fox 40 Micro whistle, and it's so loud, my ears started ringing (be careful). For a complete personal kit, I would recommend adding a knife, light, survival blanket, water purification tablets, wire saw, and a water bag. For the price, you can't get a better survival kit than this. I am really impressed by the quality here. My only minor complaint is that I wish they made the bag that the items come in a little bigger. I have trouble fitting everything in there properly and keeping it closed after I've taken items out and tried to get everything back in. That's almost not even worth mentioning though because this kit is excellent. I've bought other kits before... the kinds that tell you they have a signal mirror until you find out they mean the inside of the tin can the items come in. Not cool. This AMK Pocket Survival Pack is the best.
