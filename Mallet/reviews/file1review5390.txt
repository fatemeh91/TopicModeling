review/text: To use: pull out about 6 inches of floss. Wrap around the circular button once or twice. Pull across the prongs. Wrap around the button 2-3 times, and floss. If it becomes a little loose, that will better wrap around the tooth and be better for your gums. If it is too loose you just pull on the end and re-wrap if you need to. When it wears down and breaks, just pull out some more floss. I carry one in my pocket, have one at my desk, one at my sink at home and one in the car. The food that gets in my teeth is not there very long! It has been years since I last bought one. I would love to get some refills. After using them for 10 years (?) only one or 2 have broken. The angle and the length of the Flossbrush is just right to get the back teeth without putting your hands and fingers inside your mouth!If you buy this floss you will use less than any other way. If you pull out floss and wrap around your fingers you will have about one foot of floss. Using this tool will give you at least 3 times more floss.I would not be without several!
