review/text: I purchased this seat 4 months ago and it has been great! It appears to be well made and I'm sure it will last a long time. I love the simple white color so it blends in with the regular toilet seat. It fit's securely on each toilet I have tried it on. Adjusting the seat to fit any toilet is very easy. It is smooth and easy to clean. This seat is a great purchase because you'll need a training seat anyway and you can just skip the separate little potty completely. It's so much more convenient to just flush everything away. My 17 month old daughter seems to feel very comfortable and secure on this seat, yet it has a large enough opening so I'm sure she will use it for a long time. Going straight to a seat like this, especially plain white with no cartoons or colors makes a regular toilet not seem scary. My daughter will use the toilet in a public restroom with no fear. This is a good high quality toilet training seat and I've been very pleased with it!
