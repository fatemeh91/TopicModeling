review/text: I liked this toy. This vibe has a nice shape and it's not really big. In a way it's actually really cute. It's got really strong vibrations, but I would have liked more variations between the vibrations. I enjoyed the fact that the toy doesn't have an odd taste or smell. My only real complaint is that its too hard around the middle, so you can feel the motor when you use it. Other than that it does the job, and it perked up my night.
