review/text: Have owned this model electric shaver for over 4 years ( it has been a long time, forgot when I got it ) ..have replaced the foils at least every year because they have worn through. Gone through about 4 to 5 foil kits. I replace them , when it starts nicking me, then I look for that hole in the foils. Have not noticed any problem with battery holding a charge, have gone a couple of days in our motor home without electricity, and shaved. It is a bit tricky changing out the foils, you need to be mechanically inclined with fine dexterity to push out the rubber groumets or bumpers, not sure what to call them, then the foils pull through. I have worn out the rubber protector over the "on" and "off" switch, have been using it this way for over one year. So I guess my only complaint right now, is that that rubber protector over the switch will eventually wear through after 4 years and expose the white plastic switch. I recommend getting a spare foil kit, in anticipation of replacing them, so you will not be without a replacement foil for several days.I am happy with the shaving quality of the unit, I have a medium tough beard, need to shave in the morning and if going out, later that evening, do a second shave.In this case, I got my money's worth, still using it
