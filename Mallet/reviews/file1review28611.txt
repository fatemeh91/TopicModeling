review/text: I remember first seeing a tub of this on my RA's desk in college. I started working out and taking protein my freshman year and never looked back since. I've tried a couple of other protein powders (weight gainers, different isolates, etc.) but I always came back to this one because it just works and it tastes great. I always get the Double Rich Chocolate.Random note:I love cereal. Mix this with milk (almond milk works really well) and you have chocolate milk for cereal.
