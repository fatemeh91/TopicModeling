review/text: My wife prefers a higher protein breakfast and your typical cereal doesn't have enough unless you want to eat oatmeal or shredded wheat all the time or Kashi which tends to go on sale less and were not really sold on the added soy protein that they add to their cereal so the ON Vanilla Ice Cream goes great with any cereal in the morning. She mixes it with fruit and whatever cereal she is into that day and even oatmeal from time to time. Mixes well with milk...tastes great and goes along with pretty much anything since it's vanilla. I just wich it was on sale more often.
