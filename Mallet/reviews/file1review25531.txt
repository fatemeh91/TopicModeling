review/text: I've had a nose-hair groomer (Wahl) that actually cuts nose hairs - dropped it to a bad landing one day, and had to replace it. This Panasonic got such great reviews, how could I go wrong? It's "chosen" by Hammacher-Schlemmer -- must be the world's best, right???The one I ordered did cut the nose hairs, but first gave them a good hard tug! OWEEE!! Well, this can't be right, I said, so I exchanged my first torture device, and the replacement does exactly the same thing!!! Since it's now the only one I have, I reluctantly go through this torture, with watering eyes and clenching teeth, every other month or so.OK, the results are clean-looking, but I really don't think it's worth the pain. CanNOT recommend it!!
