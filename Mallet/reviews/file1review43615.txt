review/text: The product works as advertised. It allows for you to take blood pressure measurements easily and accurately.My only slight difficulty that I had with the product was putting on the standard pressure cuff that comes with the unit. I have thin arms, and when I try to close the cuff with the the velcro, find that the cuff slips around my arm so that the arrow is no longer on top.Perhaps the other cuffs that are available with this product would eliminate this problem.Other than that, I feel that I received a good value for a product that works as advertised.
