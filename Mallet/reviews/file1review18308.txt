review/text: I'm trying to avoid as many artificial foods and products as possible, so I bought this toothpaste. It has a distinct herbal flavor, don't expect it to taste exactly like toothpaste, but its fine. I like it, but I enjoy herbal flavors. Am very excited to use it instead of chemical toothpaste. Also got swanson's cinnimon dental gum (natural). Clean happy mouth.
