review/text: Quality is good. Cap is good and tight. I have had no issues leaking even when traveling with them in suitcases. I really only wanted about 10 of these bottles. Hospital gave me one after the birth of my boys and I found it very useful for the solution for cloth wipes/cloth diapering among other things. At the cost of each bottle it seem to make more sense to buy the bulk package and I'm glad I did. They were smaller than the one I got from the hospital but they have a million and one uses and since there were so many in the package I could give them out to everyone too. lol
