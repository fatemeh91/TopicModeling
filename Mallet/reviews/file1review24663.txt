review/text: I was really looking forward to trying this product. I was not aiming for weight loss so much as a good energy boost while tackling a new job search. I have to say that this was the least impressive formula I have ever tried! I didn't notice any difference when taking one pill, so I tried to increase to 2 pills as directed, but every time I take two I break out within about 10-15 mins in this AWFUL, terribly itchy bright red rash. Never had this problem with any other similar product. To be fair, it does warn that this could occur on the bottle (a niacin-sensitivity reaction) but in my humble opinion it makes light of a really unpleasant situation!! It says it may cause temporary side effects which "should subside in a matter of minutes". Yes, this is true, but oh my goodness, for those 30 minutes it makes you feel like your skin is crawling with biting fire ants! I am sorry to be dramatic but I just had my third (and final) one of these episodes and it really is awful. And while the stinging and burning feeling does subside after 30 minutes or so the bright red sunburn look is much slower to fade. I tried spacing the dose out to see if that might help and I tried drinking with extra water, but it happens every time with the 2 pill dose, and for me, one pill doesn't do anything at all in the way of providing me energy. Therefore, I really can't recommend this.
