review/text: This is the second pad I've owned in 20 years. Thermaphore pads just go forever. This is basic model; you press the trigger and it gets hot. It's comfortable and the manual safety switch prevents the pad from heating if you fall asleep. Not much in the way of heating controls, and no organic/microwave features. If you want those, this is not the right pad for you. My wife has back problems and this is the only pad she likes.
