review/text: I kept hearing stories of people's teeth becoming really sensitive from these strips. Asked my dentist friend and he told me that is likely due to getting the material (peroxide) on the gums. Also told me that the results are directly proportional to how long you leave the strips on. With this info, I used the strips with good results and no discomfort.If you're wondering what it feels like to use these, it's very similar to getting an x-ray or mold at the dentist. Something in your mouth, which shouldn't be there, but you'll be able to work around it with a little practice. Not uncomfortable, just a bit odd, at least at first.
