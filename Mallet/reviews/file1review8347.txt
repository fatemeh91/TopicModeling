review/text: I was really disappointed in this brush. The way I viewed it was to clean the inside of the top of the Contigo lid. I did not want a bottle brush. I did not send it back , as I will use it for a bottle brush. Those lids need cleaning very good when you use it every day as I do. Look for something to clean them with and I will be happy. I love the cup! Sharon Briceno
