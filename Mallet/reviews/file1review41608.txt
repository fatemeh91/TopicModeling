review/text: This toothbrush's performance is flawless! Even in the short time I've owned mine, I've already noticed a difference in how clean my teeth feel. Brushing doesn't feel as much like a chore using this toothbrush as it did with a manual toothbrush. Overall, it's an excellent, high quality, superior performance toothbrush and I highly recommend it!
