review/text: I always had perfect vision but suddenly could not read the channels at the bottom of the TV screen. I thought the TV screen was just blurry for some odd reason till my husband said he could read them. I sucked on one pill like a lozenge (it tastes like spinach and mild spices) and even though I did it in the morning could not fall asleep at night and had some sensitivity to light and the computer screen and my eyes burned slightly that evening. The day after I didn't take it and tried not to look at the computer screen that much and I did an eye exercise I read online (look at some thing really close and then look at something really far away and keep on looking first close than far. Even when I was reading a book I tried to look far away every 10 minutes). Anyway that evening I could read the channels at the bottom of the TV screen again!
