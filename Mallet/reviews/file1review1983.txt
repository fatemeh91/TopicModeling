review/text: We've been using this on our boy since he was 5 months old. Couple of features - waterproof back that prevent wetness going to clothes. The pocket in the front was useful in holding major spills.One thing I'd like to see straps on the side. Our son sees the bib flapping around and starts yanking it. Straps on the side would secure it so that he does not see it.Other than that - completely satisfied.
