review/text: I have used this a few times since purchased and it is extremely easy to use. All you do is pop in the batteries (included) and put it on your wrist and hit start. The measuring seems very accurate. I also have a watch that measures heart rate, and I have checked it against the wrist cuff, and they always come out the same or within one reading. The memory feature is good, but you may still need to track yours on paper if more than one person uses it because it just tracks the last 60 readings with no other info.
