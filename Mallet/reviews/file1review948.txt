review/text: The NeckEase hot/cold pillow is wonderful. Microwave it for less than 3 minutes and you are left with one hour of warm, soothing neck relief. I bought a second as a gift and they really enjoy theirs too. Highly recommend wearing while watching TV or a late night movie at home.ps. The item arrived in its own packaging with instructions and a very nice hand written note of appreciation. This seller is the real deal!!!
