review/text: I read a lot of reviews about different foot baths before I settled on this one. I just wasnt blown away by any stretch. The heater stays hot but it doesnt get hot enough for my liking. The jets and the circulation are the one nice thing about it. Although there is only one jet and it only hits your toes. I would like another jet for the heel or under the food. The little foot kneaders/rollers are absolutely useless. You have to move your foot back and forth to use them but the bath is to small so you cant really do that. All in all its a 3 star product. Still waiting for someone to make a great at home foot bath.
