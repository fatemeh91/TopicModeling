review/text: This is an almost perfect product. Almost. It is the perfect size for support and my grandchild loves the softness and squishiness it possesses. I love the low speed setting--neck tension just melts away. However, when you eventually have to change the batteries, you will see that the battery cover is not worthy of the product. The plastic notches are very easy to break. Correct this and you get a 5 star from me.
