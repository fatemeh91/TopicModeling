review/text: I have been using the Mach 3 now for several years. I have been very pleased with how it feels/shaves. Then along came the Fusion (5 blades). And honestly, the shave from this one is better. I never thought that possible. You can hardly feel the blades just glide across your face. I for one will continue using the Fusion. Even though I don't like paying double for the blades. The shave is well worth it.
