review/text: It took awhile, but I was finally able to purchase this at a reasonable price. The product arrived in strong packaging, so it was in good condition. I did not find it difficult to assemble, since I had someone to help hold the top part while I hooked it to the mechanism in the bottom portion which makes it work. It would be hard to do alone. The instructions for fine-tuning it were clear and easy to apply. It is vary accurate. The readings on our scale matched the readings on the scales of 3 different doctors offices.
