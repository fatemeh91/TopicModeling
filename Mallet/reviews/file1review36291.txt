review/text: Somewhat expensive, but it works perfectly. In my informal comparison test of this digital ear thermometer with a nurse' digital oral thermometer (which took more than a minute to get a temperature reading), it gave a reading within 0.1 degree of the digital oral thermometer in less than 1 second. I highly recommend this product.
