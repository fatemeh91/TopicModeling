review/text: It actually worked as advertised. I use it several days a week for 30 or more minutes per session. If you leave water in it at room temperature, it will within 5-7 minutes be comfortable enough to put your feet into, and within another 5-7 be wonderfully hot. It's noise level is reasonably low even at it's highest settings. I actually called into Brookstone and spent the extra $20.00 to extend the warranty replacement out beyond the manufacturers (1yr+2more) because I can't see how I lived this long without the device. It's basically a hot-tub for your feet.
