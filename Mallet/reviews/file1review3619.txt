review/text: I have used supplements for several years to help balance my hormones as I get super moody and eat too much when I don't. I sometimes drink the herbal teas for women but no longer want to drink teas as it is the summer time and too hot. So, I found Total Woman at my local health food store and gave it a try. Because I had not been drinking my tea, my hormones were really out control when I bought Total Woman so I decided to take the maximum number of capsules, which is 4. I felt better right away and happy to buy more. I like the cost on Amazon because I paid almost $30 at the health food store and with Amazon Prime, I don't pay shipping. $21 is a great buy!Balancing hormones is very important for women. OH! I also love that this is a multi-vitamin, too. The herbs in this supplement are PERFECT for women's health. This is a great supplement for a normal healthy woman looking for something to improve the health of endocrine/womanly system.
