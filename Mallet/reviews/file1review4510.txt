review/text: The lengthy product literature above (apparently from Gilette) is misleading for this model. It touts the advantages of the Fusion Proglide razor, and the vibrating Fusion. Both of those razors cost more. I'm not sure why anyone would want to talk a customer out of the exact product at hand (Fusion Manual); surely they didn't intend any "bait and switch" but it sure was careless -- and relatively uninformative.BTW I do indeed own a Gilette (Manual) Fusion razor and have used it. I wasn't all that impressed, and I don't find it significantly better than the old Mach 3. For the money (and cheaper blades in the long run) I prefer the Schick Quattro Titanium.
