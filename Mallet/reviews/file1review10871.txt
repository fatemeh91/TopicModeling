review/text: I'm writing to try to diminish the effect of the erroneously placed merchant review of one star that's skewing this product's rating from 5 stars to 3. I think this is an excellent product concept. Keeps the saline sterile and delivers it with enough force to work for cleansing wounds. No need to draw it up into a syringe. Now anyone can have effective wound cleansing equipment in their home first aid kit. Everyone should have some around.
