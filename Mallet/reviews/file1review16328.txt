review/text: I got a sample of this product through Amazon's Vine program. Each tablet comes wrapped in its own little wrapper. Those plastic wrappers are a pain to get open. It would have been helpful if the manufacturer would have put a little cut in one edge for a place to get a tear in the wrapper started. The first load of dishes I washed, I used one tablet and it wasn't enough to get the dishes streak free. The second load, I used 2 tablets (1 in each dispenser) and got better results. I would have thought that since this is a Finish branded product that my glasses would be streak free, but with only one table, they were not. I think I will stick with the Cascade.
