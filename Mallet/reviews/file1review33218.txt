review/text: I read about this product a year ago as a great way to avoid or shorten a cold. I was skeptical at first but I now know it really works. I have used this when I have felt a cold coming on ad managed to stop it on two separate occasions. I have also used this once when I had the flu and even though I still had flu symptoms they were a lot milder than usual. My only complaint is that the dosing is intense. They expect you to swallow 6 pills several times a day when you are sick or exposed to an illness! I usually take 6 or 12 (if I'm up for it) a day and I found even that makes a huge difference.
