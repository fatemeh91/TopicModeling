review/text: Purchased as a late Valentine's day gift for my wife. I wasn't sure that would fly very well but thought "what the heck."On first impression it's a bit "larger" (circumference not so much length) than I thought it would be.Buttons are well located and easy to use. The rabbit seemed to be able to hit a few spots that hadn't been "touched" before, which was good thing. All in all it was very pleasing to use and we were very happy with it.
