review/text: This is the best moist heating pad ever, and the second one I've purchased. The first one lasted over 20 years, and I literally wore it out. I chose the pad with the manual safety switch, as I had before. You have to be really careful that you don't get it too hot, or you could get a burn or blister, so the pad would not be good for a person with poor circulation or diabetes, otherwise, it is fantastic. Wonderful for muscle muscle pain. Thank you
