review/text: I did not know until I received the product that it was a sports drink supplement, and the recommended measurements weren't like the ones I've seen on the individual packages of Natural Calm. I've only used it 3 times since I bought it, and it didn't make me feel as well as the original Natural Calm supplement made me feel. I will just stick with the original version from now on. The only thing I found good about this product was the taste. Other than that, it was of no use to me.
