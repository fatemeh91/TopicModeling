review/text: I just got my Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Protein yesterday. Well i had a good workout today and I was excited about taking the Tropical Punch flavor. Once I tasted it.. well it wasnt too great. It kinda tasted liked tropical punch but it tasted like medicine or tropical punch with a milky flavor.
