review/text: This stethoscope is very good for pediatric ICU, however if you work with patients over 12 years of age, it is sometimes worth it to have a larger bell to hear broader areas of lung sounds (our 12 year olds are much bigger than I was when I was 12 years old). Very good for nursing assessment of lung and heart sounds for newborn to 12 years.
