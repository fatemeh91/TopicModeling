review/text: So I bought this as I have a tweaked neck from too much Basketball. I was massaging my own neck where it hurt but this made things worse. I realized one day how tight the muscles around my shoulder blade have gotten. My wife tried but too delicate and although I realized these pressure points and muscles where the ones responsible for my neck pain she just couldn't get enough pressure on them. This Back Buddy is great and I've used it for 3 days now and already my neck and back feel better, more loose, etc...I'd like to mention this is more like giving yourself a deep tissue massage. It's not the gentle rubbing that some people prefer. The plastic contact points are rather small (end of your thumb) and although there are some bigger ones this tool seems to lean towards the firm touch massage. I guess if they had some larger points of contact I would like to try that too (4 stars for this instead of 5) but this is exactly what I needed for rock solid, knotted muscles. Also it's very easy to use and apply more than enough pressure if needed. You can easily work on your back, shoulder blades, etc... for a solid hour without tiring as it's leverage and design works that well. Be cautious not to overdue it the first few days though. I found it works best with shirt off and some massage oil or lotion. Through the clothes works but you can't slide it around as well so this requires a bit more effort.I highly recommend this for those wanting a firm massage ! Also shipping was fast and this thing is super durable. I'm loving it!
