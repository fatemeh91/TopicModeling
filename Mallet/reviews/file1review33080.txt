review/text: I have used Wellness Formula now for several years with amazing results! I would take it when I'd start getting a scratchy throat or just felt like a bug was coming on. I would also get lots of sleep and wake up feeling great! I cannot remember a time it didn't work for me. I took it because it worked but was ignorant as to why, but now research studies have demonstrated the benefits of andrographis, along with Vitamin C and garlic. I have to mention, however, that it doesn't always work for my husband. I feel this is because he is often stressed out from work and gets no exercise. I think this just shows how important it is to have a healthy lifestyle in every area and not expect a few pills to do it all.
