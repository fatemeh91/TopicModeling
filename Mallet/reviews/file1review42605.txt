review/text: I concur with previous posts about lactose intolerance. Use water or cut milk with water when blending. The chocolate and vanilla flavors are tolerable in taste over time. Avoid the berry as it tastes and smells like vomit. If you have to use the berry then blend with the vanilla and use milk.
