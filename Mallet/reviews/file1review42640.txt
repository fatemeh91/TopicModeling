review/text: I opend the box and inserted brand new batteries. It DID NOT WORK! (No power or even a light). I have tried different batteries from other devices that I know work and it still did not power on... AND NO, not USER ERROR! I will be sending this back for a refund.I'm only giving this a 1 star rating as this opinion survey does not allow you to not post your review without selecting a star rating. I would not even give this a 1 star if I had the option.What a shame!
