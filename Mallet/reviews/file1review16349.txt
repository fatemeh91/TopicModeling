review/text: Dissolves fully, works great on getting stuck on food off dishes. If you're like me and rinse your dishes before placing them in the dishwasher, Finish Powerball is fantastic. No more having to "fingernail pick" bits of stuck on food after taking your dishes out of the washer. Finish Powerball is fantastic!
