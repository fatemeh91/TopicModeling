review/text: I will never use any other drain cleaner after trying this one. It works without acid or lye and clears the drain pretty much instantly -- with a pleasant puff of lemon scent at the end. You need to buy the starter kit the first time and just refills after that. You place the can upside down into the drain, fill the sink/tub with enough water to cover the cap, plug up the overflow with a wet washcloth and then just push down on the can. It is sometimes easier to do this with two people: one to push down on the can, and the other to plug up the overflow. On one of my sinks, because I am short, I had a hard time pushing on the can with enough force with only one hand. I tried to stuff the washcloth into the overflow so I could push the can with both hands. My mistake. The drain cleared, but the force of the gases blew the washcloth out of the overflow, and all the gunk that was in the drain splattered over me and the wall.
