review/text: I'm very disappointed in its longevity (or lack thereof). I'm going to try SonicCare next.Update: I'm doubly annoyed. I ended up getting this toothbrush again, despite it's weak battery life because it seemed to be the only one that gives the actual time of brushing, not just a signal every 30 seconds. Only guess what? They changed the brush (the exact same model!) and no longer give the time. In fact, you can see the two customer photos here still have the time, but THOSE PHOTOS ARE WRONG. That's a feature this model used to have, but no longer. There is plenty of room for it, and it obviously used to work. I guess they now moved the feature to the more expensive model with the separate monitor. Why would anyone want yet another piece to their toothbrush on the counter???
