review/text: I've tried alot of other pain reliever but until CryoDerm, nothing relieved my Mom's lower back pain from arthritis. So you can imagine how happy I felt when she told me it feels cool after a few seconds of spraying her back and relieved the pain enough to stop taking Alleve every morning. I also got her a gel-filled heating pad that wraps around her waist and back which she puts over the spray application. So we're back to smiling again, thank heavens!The only improvement I hope for is that it relieves her pain 100%. Right now relief is something she is grateful for, however. Otherwise, I would've given it a 5-star.What I like about it is that it is all-natural, no added toxic chemicals or other additives. So thank you, makers of CryoDerm!!
