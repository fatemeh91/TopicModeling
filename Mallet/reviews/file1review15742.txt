review/text: This pen is just amazing. It feels good in your hand and continuously writes smoothly. Best of all if the mechanism ever stops working, Cross replaces the item no questions asked. It has the quality of items like Mont Blanc and higher Waterman pens too. One note, the eraser is a little nubby so it takes a few good erases to smooth out the top but after that it's smooth sailing. I was impressed with it's ability to write on different surfaces too. If giving as a gift though, perhaps give in a different box. The one it comes in is cheap and plasticy.
