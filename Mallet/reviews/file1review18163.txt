review/text: It is lightweight, comfortable, adjustable and blocks out the light. I tried many products and this one is the best so far. I sleep better with these shades. Lasted 2 years of daily use. I bought them because I was working the night shift and could not sleep in the daylight. I recommend you try these eyeshades.Update 08/27/2012: Still using the eyeshades and they are fantastic.
