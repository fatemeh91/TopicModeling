review/text: I've used Sonicare for over 9 years beginning with the original style and finishing with the Elite models. Those did better than a manual brush, but don't compare with the wonderful results I'm getting with the Oral-B Triumph.I started taking a medication this year that leaves my mouth dry and prone to plaque build-up. I knew it was getting bad when my wife and mom pointed out that my teeth looked yellow and breath was noticable for the first time in my life. I'm quite meticulous about having clean teeth so this really bothered me. The Sonicare Elite toothbrush I was using just wasn't able to keep my teeth from building up plaque, particularly along the gum-line and between the teeth. I got a little better results by alternating between a manual toothbrush and the Sonicare while using Plax before brushing and flossing.Wow, I've only used the Oral-B for about a week and the results are dramatic. I can really feel the floss action head working around and between the tooth as I gently rock it back and forth over each tooth. It does a wonderful job along the gum line as well. Plus, I'm still using the same products: Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste, Plax pre-brushing rinse, Reach Gumcare dental floss and Reach Act Restoring floride rinse.My teeth look and feel much cleaner than before and I'm not at all self-conscious about my teeth and breath.Only get the Oral-B Triumph if you want whiter teeth, healthier gums, and an excellent plaque fighter! You'll love this toothbrush whether your switching from a manual or other electric.
