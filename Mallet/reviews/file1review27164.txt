review/text: As a personal trainer, I eat alot of protein - 250-300 grams a day. I know my protein. This is the best. It mixes well, it has both whey isolate and whey concentrate, contains a complete amino acid complex, very few carbs, and tastes great! Other brands lack in at least one of these areas, and if they are equal, are much more expensive. I recommend this brand and flavor to all my clients.
