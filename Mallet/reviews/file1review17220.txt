review/text: The product works wonderfully except that you must, must, must rake hair in through the comb in exactly the right way or else you'll gouge out huge chunks: the guard on the bottom side of the trimmer doesn't change its depth as you adjust it, instead always remaining almost flush with the bottom side. This is a dumb design flaw: one should be able to safely twist and turn a trimmer without ever having hair cut shorter than the chosen guard setting indicates.
