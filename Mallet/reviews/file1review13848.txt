review/text: I bought 3 of these for use with a 7 yr old , a 5yr old and a 6 month old. They are great. They are just the right size for them, not to mention that it makes them forget about what really is wrong. I have had them now about 5 months and never had a problem with heating or cooling. Simply follow the directions.
