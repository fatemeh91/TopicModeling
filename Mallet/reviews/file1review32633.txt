review/text: Been buying this brand and particular flavor for over 18 months now and still like it. It's very tasty and more lemon-y than cranberry-y! Slightly tart with whole fruits, nuts, and seeds in it.Unfortunately, it's one of few nutrition bars that does not have chocolate in it. I like chocolate but cannot tolerate too much of it. Wish there were more flavors without chocolate to choose from.Also wish nutrition bar makers would make flavors that mimic meals, like chili or pasta dishes. Don't need sweets all the time!
