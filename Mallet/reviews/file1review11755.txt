review/text: Ordinarily, I wouldn't call a sewn in tag a serious design problem, but in this case, it is just plain stupid how the tag is attached. The tag is rather irritating, so I decided to remove it. It appears as though the tag is just sewn onto the upper end of the support, and that you can just remove the stitches and be rid of it. Wrong. The stitches that hold the tag on,are the same stitches that are used to put the brace together. If you cut the stitches, you screw up the integrity of the brace. I expect mine will fall apart a lot sooner than it should now.It would have been nice to have some sort of warning to not remove the friggin tag. They can print a manual in 20 different languages, but they can't be bothered to warn you not to cut the stupid tag off?? It's a good elbow support, but don't make the same mistake I did.
