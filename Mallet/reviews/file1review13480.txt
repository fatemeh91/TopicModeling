review/text: This is the best stainless steel cleaner ever. I was looking for a safe product to use around my baby. I picked this product because it is olive oil based verses all the other products which are petroleum based. I have never really used a product I have been happy with. All of them streak and need super fast buffing action. Also, the stainless steal surface would look a mess again in a day. I figured this one couldn't be worse than the others and at least it was safe for baby. I was so surprised. This product is fabulous. It cleans easy, cleans really well and protects the steel from normal use finger prints for at least a week. It smells incredible. This product is pricey, but worth ever penny. You also do not need to use much so the cost may balance out to compare with less expensive products in the end.
