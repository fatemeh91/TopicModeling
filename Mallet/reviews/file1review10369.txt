review/text: This is a good cheap alternative to over priced drug store versions. I reach for this first before the "nitequil" or cold meds at the first sign of a cold, or when those around me are sick. Keeps your immune system up and boosts when you are not 100%. I only use it 2-3 caps 2 -3 times a day for a few days only when feeling like I might get sick or to avoid the bug that everyone else is fighting, that and extra Vit C doses does the trick almost every time, or at least shortens the time down.
