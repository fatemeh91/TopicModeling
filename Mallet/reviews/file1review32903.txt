review/text: All of my adult life I had had a problem with constipation. When I was in my early 40's I was told about a product called SMOOTHE MOVE, which is an herbal teas produced by Traditional Teas.I began taking one cup every day with breakfast, and within 1 day saw results! I couldn't believe it! It was very delicious besides being good for me.I have now been drinking Smoothe Move for over 20 years, and will continue to do so.The only problem I had was FINDING IT in most grocery stores. I have now moved to another part of the country, and could not find it anywhere. I am so happy to have Amazon.com to rely on at times like these. I order 6 boxes at a time and they always arrive just on time!Thank you, Amazon.com!Donna O'Donnell
