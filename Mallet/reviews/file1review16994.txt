review/text: I bought this for my boyfriend's beard because he lazy about keeping up with trimming it. It worked great at first, but after maybe 4-5 uses over the course of 4-5 months (I told you he doesn't trim up often), it stopped working. It lasts for about 5 seconds of use then dies, and you can't use it while plugged in. Very disappointed.
