review/text: Nice design for a back sleeper, but won't stay in place or hurts a side sleeper. Oh, and velcro and hair don't mix, so really it's not adjustable, because if you don't completely match up the velcro halves, you may wind up with your hair locked onto the exposed part (unless you don't have hair:-)
