review/text: I have had this for two years now. It is an excellent toothbrush. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the battery. I wish it was a lithium battery instead of Ni-mh. It will hold a charge for about 2 weeks initially, but after a year or two that time drops to a few days. I just starting keeping mine plugged in all the time. Does an EXCELLENT job cleaning.
