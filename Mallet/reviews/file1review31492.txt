review/text: I bought this for my honeymoon cruise. We were going on excursions where we would be walking around Mayan ruins, which ends up being several miles of walking per site. My wife has a tendency to get blisters, so I was glad that this kit came with moleskin. The kit is small and light enough to be negligible as far as I am concerned. I just tossed it in a small zipper pouch in my camera backpack and forgot about it. Sure enough, the first day out my wife got a blister on the ball of her foot, and it was hurting her to the point that should couldn't walk. I pulled out the pre-cut moleskin and she put it on. She immediately felt better and we were able to continue uninterrupted. That alone was worth the $10 I payed for the kit. As a bonus, one night before dinner one of the straps on her dress broke. She asked if I had a safety pin, and of course I didn't, because why the hell would I? Then I remembered that this kit came with a few, and I saved the day again.This kit is well worth the money if you need something small.
