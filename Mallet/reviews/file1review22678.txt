review/text: I just bought this today at the hardware store. It has a round faucet adapter and not a square one. Most bathroom tub faucets are square. My bathtub faucet is square. Like the reviews for the Alson pet shower, this one, too, does not go onto a square bathtub faucet, because it has a round adapter.It's a nice-looking hand-held shower and I was really looking forward to using it. However, I will have to return it because, after struggling with it, I could not get it to fit onto my bathroom tub faucet.
