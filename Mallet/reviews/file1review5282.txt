review/text: On a recent ferry ride, the crew handed out Gin Gins to help passengers with motion sickness. I wasn't sick, but I took one anyway and have been looking for them in stores ever since! Finally I found them on Amazon and just ordered them here. I only just received my order today and I can't stop sucking on them. I have yet to use them on an upset stomach, so I can't attest as to how well they work for that, but just as a candy they're addicting and delicious! Shortly after the ferry trip, when I couldn't find them in stores, I got some crystallized ginger (not by The Ginger People,) thinking it would be about the same thing. It definitely wasn't. It only served to inform me that I actually don't like straight ginger much at all; it's way too strong for my taste. But this candy has the perfect amount of sweetness, and yet still the warm punch of ginger that makes it perfect. Delicious!
