review/text: Because I take a lot of (and a few large) vitamins and supplements throughout the day, the more common 7-compartment pill boxes are too small for my needs. I have found the 7 Day 4 Compartment Pill Organizer to be incredibly useful. To quickly refill the organizer, I have color-coded both my pill bottles and the compartments using small, round color coding labels (e.g. blue for morning, red for lunch, etc.). I would recommend this to friends and family.
