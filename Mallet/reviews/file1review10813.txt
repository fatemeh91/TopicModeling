review/text: This is a quality tool. HandyBar gives a handy helping hand - support right where one is needed most when getting in or out of a vehicle. Are you going to be riding in someone else's vehicle? Don't forget to take your HandyBar along. It will NOT harm the vehicle it is used on. Makes travel a whole lot easier!
