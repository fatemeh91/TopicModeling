review/text: This thing is sharp, that's about it. I have a 5 year old Wahl which makes a lot of noise. I had to replace it because it has become dull. I thought a new Wahl would be quiet, hahaha. This thing make the same level of noise as my 5 year old one and it makes even more noise with the attachments. Thought they would improve on their technology after all these years. Next time i'll spend an extra $50 and get a better one. It does come with a nice case though which is a plus.
