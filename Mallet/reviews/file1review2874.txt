review/text: I was having problems absorbing B12 and my red blood cells were too large as a result. Weekly B12 shots did not help. I started taking this product because my doctor thought I may have low stomach acid. Two weeks later my blood work already showed improvement in my red blood cells! The hardest part is remembering to take it with every meal.
