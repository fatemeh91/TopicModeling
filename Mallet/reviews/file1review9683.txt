review/text: Having looked for round reading glasses for quite a while I settled on these based on the price. I love them, love the look, love how they sit on my nose...and how light they are. I am very careful how I handle them concerned how they will hold up. them. One of the glasses did pop out, but I easily poped it right back in. I would buy another pair.
