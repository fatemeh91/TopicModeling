review/text: I bought this with the Apple Leather Conditioner. My 2Unfold grey leather bag from Hard Graft was really getting covered with scratches and dirt, so i wanted to revive it back to its former glory.I followed the instructions - Use with a soft cloth, wipe in circular motion. Repeat with Leather Conditioner after. I did it with half the bag so that i can compare the before/after effect.End result was fantastic - The Cleaner lessened the visibility of the scratches and brought the leather back to its original, darker color. The Conditioner gave it a shine, and a nice, smooth protective feel.It's been a couple of weeks by now, it feels like the bag is more resistant to scratches.Overall, i am just so glad and relieved it works with my leather bag!
