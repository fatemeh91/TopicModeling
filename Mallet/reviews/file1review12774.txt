review/text: A few nights ago, my son fell and broke his arm. My husband the former (now re-certifying) paramedic grabbed this out of his bag and quickly splinted my son's arm. It is very compact and therefore easy to store. He says it was easy to quickly mold into the desired shape and apply to the broken arm. No FAK should be without one.
