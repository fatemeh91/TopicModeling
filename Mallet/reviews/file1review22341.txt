review/text: the idea is sound but they only put one piece of Velcro on, and it is on the wrist rap. what happens is that as you move your hand the piece that is supposed to come down and be secured by the wrist wrap, slips. Pretty soon the whole thing works its way loose. Not at all useful. A big waste of money.
