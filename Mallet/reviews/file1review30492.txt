review/text: The cleanser came fast and packaged well. I would like everyone to give this product a try!! My dermatologist recommened it to me. You wouldn't belive how clean your face feels and not all dried out. Plus for you wemon the make-up comes off with ease. Including your mascara. I would give this 10 stars if I could!!
