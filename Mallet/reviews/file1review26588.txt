review/text: This company, gave me no hassle or cost to return this back booster. I received this Back Booster in mid-July 2012 and by the first week of September 2012 it had sprung a leak and became unusable. I'm assuming that it was just this particular back booster that was defective, because the maker of this product displayed such integrity in offering and quickly following through on letting me return the item for a full refund and they paid the cost of shipping. In fact they sent me my refund before I even returned the Back Booster. So for all of these reasons I give them my five star rating.
