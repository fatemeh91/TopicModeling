review/text: I'm grateful that guaifenesin is now available without a presciption, a blessing to fibromyalgia sufferers. I use timed release tabs and capsules daily, and I found a recipe for mixing the powder with emu oil to make a topical skin cream.This guai comes in a plastic bag inside a plastic jar, but it's lumpy and much too grainy, like sand, to use in a cream. I had such a hassle getting it, I'm not going to try to have it replaced. I'll probably use it to fill empty capsules, if I can figure out the right dosage amount.Seven weeks after I ordered, I still had not received it, and I emailed the seller. It took another week to receive an agreement to send me a replacement shipment, but when they did, it arrived by express mail in 3 days, leaving me wondering why the first shipment couldn't have been sent that fast.When I try another batch of guai skin cream, I may open some capsules and see if that powder is less grainy. I wish there were some way to buy sample packets before investing over $80 to find out it's not the quality and consistency that I need.
