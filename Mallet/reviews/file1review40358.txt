review/text: Feel that post-nasal drip comming on?? Fever?? Take this stuff. I add my testimony to the others. It's worked for me over and over again. Advancements in herbology have been one of the real positives in health research over the past three decades, especially since the mid-1990's. More and more refined herbal formulas are appearing on the shelves. I have found Gaia Herb Products to be among the best, if not the best. Through superior research and standards of purity, Gaia Herb is establishing itself as a leader in an emerging and highly beneficial field. Gone are the days of concocting herbal remedies from instructions in a book. Their website gives detailed descriptions of their numerous products. But this one is special. From my experience, it really does, immediately, stop a cold if taken early enough and in liberal doses.
