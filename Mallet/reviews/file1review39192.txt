review/text: I've used this clipper twice since I bought it, and had good results both times. I am not a hairdresser by any means... my children would turn and run if I came after their hair with scissors! However, since one child likes his hair pretty short and was wanting haircuts every few weeks, I decided to give these a try. The kit comes in a nice, sturdy case to keep everything together.There is a DVD that gives you a short lesson in giving a good, simple haircut. After watching it once I felt fairly confident. Since I was so new to cutting hair, I decided to begin with the longest attachment first, figuring it's better to "practice" with longer hair. Once I got the feel of it, it was pretty easy. Since I experimented with several lengths, it did take a while, but I was very pleased with the result, as was my son.I found the clipper itself very easy to use. The attachments come on and off easily. It was easy to clean. It was nice and lightweight, and I had no problems with the unit becoming too hot. The "cape" that's included is nothing more than a garbage bag with strings... it broke before I could even tie it around his neck! However, I didn't buy the kit for the cape, so it really didn't matter.I am very pleased with this purchase. It will have paid for itself with the next haircut, and hopefully will save me a considerable amount of money on professional haircuts.
