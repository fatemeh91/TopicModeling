review/text: This shave gel worked similarly to a lot of other shave gels on the market. It served its purposes well but it clogged my razor a lot so I will not be repurchasing this item. It didn't moisturize my legs dramatically and I can always use lotion after a shower anyway so the clogged razor was too much of a hassle.
