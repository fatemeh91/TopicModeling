review/text: For years now, I've been looking for a product to replace my old Norelco trimmers. They were awesome until Philips took them over and made them crappy. I still haven't found anything as good for the price, but this is the closest I've come. I liked it enough that I bought a second one, same model.Most importantly, it trims well without catching and pulling my hair. It has a decent number of adjustable lengths (9 settings), and it stays locked in place while trimming. It has a nice shape, which makes it comfortable to hold and easy to move around without accidentally adjusting the length setting or hitting the power switch.My first crticism is that you have to be careful with the battery. Of course, it holds a lot of charge when new, but it will diminish significantly if you're not careful. Despite what the directions say, my recommendation is to charge it fully, unplug it, and not plug in again until the charge is almost drained. If you don't charge the battery fully or begin charging when the battery is not close to empty, it will definitely reduce the battery life. Using care when charging will extend the life of the product. It would also be nice if you could trim while simultaneously charging, but this trimmer doesn't work that way.My second criticism is that the charger is only compatible with 120 VAC input. I often travel overseas, and this is the ONLY electronic product I have that is NOT compatible with inputs up to 240 VAC. It's the 21st century, why is this charger using a 19th century limitation in its power transformer?Overall, it's a good value for what I paid. My first one lasted about 21 months. I'm hoping to stretch this one beyond 2 years by taking more care with charging.
