review/text: I have very pale skin as well as light freckles .. Which is why i use the ambi fade cream, It does fade my freckles but i have to keep applying it and it does take some time but it does fade.. I stopped using it and the more i went out in the sun the more darker my freckles got. Going to buy it again to keep my freckles as light as they will get. Overall it does do the job, and for the price it's definitely worth it!
