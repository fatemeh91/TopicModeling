review/text: If you're using this stuff, you should feel comfortable reading reviews about bowel movements! ;-)I'm a female, 5'4", 119 lbs. and the first night I started these, I thought I'd kick things off with the maximum recommendation of 5 capsules...a HUGE mistake! Within hours (in the middle of the night, mind you), I was running back and forth to the bathroom with diarrhea. Looking back, I should have started off a bit slower to see how my body reacted to this stuff. Once I figured the right dose out for a cleanse (I just need 3), I was able to sleep through the night and use the bathroom at my own leisure upon waking. My BMs were somewhere between soft and diarrhea but I was going much more regularly, not urgently. Following a night of Mag07, I would start my day with Pearls IC probiotics and found that this a great combo!Upon completetion of the 10-day cleanse, I have continued to take 1 capsule before bed for maintenance. My insides have never felt better which of course, have reflected on the outside! My belly feels flat and my digestive system no longer feels stopped up. I swear, I can actually feel my body utilizing vitamins that I used to feel pass right through, never fully absorbing. I'll also say that taking care of your intestinal tract is the base of a strong immune system. While everyone else has started getting colds and the flu, I remain illness-free and full of energy!I love this product and I tell everyone about it!
