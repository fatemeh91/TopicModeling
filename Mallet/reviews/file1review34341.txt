review/text: I am not sure when the odorless part starts (after ingesting????) because I am afraid to try taking it now that I have received it and smelled it. I bought it and opened it, so now I can't return it. I am out of a good bit of money and I couldn't choke down one of these caps if I tried. They stink something fierce. I am pretty frugal and pretty adventuresome, however in this case I am afraid if I take these caps I will stink like they do. I have a job dealing with the public, and do not want to offend my family or pets either, so I will have to take a loss on this product. Buyer beware! If I could give lower than 1 star I would.
