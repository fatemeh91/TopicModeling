review/text: This is honestly the best tweezer I've every purchased. The end is sharp and it's better quality than anything I've ever bought at a cvs. I own at least 4 other pairs of tweezers, including name brands such as Revlon. This blows them out of the water. It's great for hair removal and has helped me out with one splinter already. It removed the piece of wood from my foot no problem. The only thing I would not use it for is removing a tick. I go camping whenever I get a chance, but if I get a tick, I won't use these as it would kill the tick instantly since it's very sharp and not be helpful in that scenario. For everyday hair removal, this is a must!Pros:SharpGood qualitySmall/compact sizeSmall carrying tubeCons:Would not be good for removing ticks.Bottom Line:Perfect for everyday hair or splint removal
