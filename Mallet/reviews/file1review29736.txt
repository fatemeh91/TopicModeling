review/text: I bought these because they are more environmentally friendly than disposables however they do not absorb much so I always end up changing my shirt because it leaks through. I don't consider myself a heavy-let-downer at all (ie. the disposables never got saturated) so I was very disappointed. They are also very flat. A little contour would be nice, and make more sense because really, who's breasts are totally flat? The only thing I like about these is that they seem to wash well and come with a mesh bag, which is convenient.
