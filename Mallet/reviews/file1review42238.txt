review/text: Even though its taste is not so pleasant, but it has enough all the vitamins needed in form of fluid,so it's easier to digest.My daughter is low in iron level in her blood, and I make her take this vitamin. The test last week came back with iron level increase as requirement. About to order the 6th bottle now.
