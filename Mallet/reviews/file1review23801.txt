review/text: I had heard many good things about this product and thought that maybe it would be worth the $$$'s. But after taking it one month, I haven't had much pain relief or improved stability. In fact, the arthritis in my knee flared up badly a week and a half ago. Could have been a seasonal thing. I continue to take Phosoplex and will do so for another month until my supply runs out. Then I'll see if I'll order it again. Regarding the stomach upset issue: When I take the four big capsules before breakfast, I have no problems if I have some milk with breakfast. Otherwise, it's difficult to keep the capsules and my breakfast down.
