review/text: This product is the only thing that has worked for me after years of both over the counter and prescription medicines.I have hard stools and this works just fine I can control how soft I want my stools to be. I took a bottle to my Doctor and she thanked me for telling her about the product. She wrote down the amazon.com address as health stores I had contacted did not carry Oxy-Powder.I digest my food better and feel better. I even experimented with yellow cheese and the Oxy-Powder worked. I did have to take more of the Oxy-Powder.
