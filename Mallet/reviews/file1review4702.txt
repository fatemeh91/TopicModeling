review/text: This shake did what it needed to do but I found that if I didn't exercise along with it I wouldn't lose any weight but when I did exercise I would lose so if you are expecting this to do all the work for you it may not happen that way. Unless you are going from eating large breakfast and lunches to this then I think it would help a lot more. I didn't have much to lose but it did help me for what I needed. The taste wasn't bad, I got the coffee flavored, for some reason it was more peanut butter tasting to me, not sure why! haha. I want to try chocolate now that I am back from my honeymoon and the resort was all inclusive, I gained a bunch of weight back.
