review/text: ok ok...so maybe you don't want a perfectly kissable pout, but this is a great product!! I have chronically dry lips, and this chapstick turned that right around. There is no color or flavor to this "moisturizing lip treatment" and has SPF 15. It was able to soften up my dry, chapped lips in a couple of days. After trying this product, I bought eight more!
