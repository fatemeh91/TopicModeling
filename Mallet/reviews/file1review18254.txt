review/text: This cream smells delicious! Like pineapples, kiwi and laying on a white sand beach...but I digress. This has all the good stuff in it and for 1/4 of the price of the so-called top pf the line. And this WORKS! I use it at night...it's a bit too thick to wear under make up, but it makes a perfect night cream. In the morning, my skin is soft and looks perfect. I've been using it for 2 weeks, only at night, on a freshly cleaned face. I also use a peptide moisturizer first. This spreads luxuriously and soaks in really well. The smell is refreshing and delicious! I'm the type to try everything and anything -- I even tried snake venom (doesn't work)-- this is one cream I will buy again and keep using. Love it.
