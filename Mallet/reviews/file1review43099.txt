review/text: perhaps I'm not big enough in the belly yet, but it doesn't exclude me from needing some support. I found that my 5'2" 36HH short and curvy frame (size 14 during pregnancy) didn't get any support from this. the straps around the chest were tight and cut into my chest. the belt itself was too big under my belly even on the tightest settings. Bummer, I was looking forward to a belt with support that also let me sit easily. Also, it pinched my bump in a weird way making it look like a saggy beer belly rather than a kid. :( Luckily Amazon makes returns easy.
