review/text: This toothbrush has a wider handle and fits my hands better by giving me a better grip. The bristles are wider (the front bristles being longer), and therefore, it allows me to clean behind my teeth better and to reach and clean my teeth better at the very back. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this toothbrush to my family and friends.
