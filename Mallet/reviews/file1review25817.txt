review/text: Only trimmer better than this is the one it replaced. The old model was more powerful.Been using this model for a few years now. Outstanding is the only word I can use.Advantages:* rechargable batteries that last.* Can use power cord as well for low battery situations or for a little extra power for that extra extra thick beard.* Holds charge for a long time.* Long life (mine is many years old)* Depth guard stays in place firmly - no changing settings by accident (improvement over old model)* easy to clean and lubricate, blade pops off easily without tools* wider path than most other trimmers* depth guard can be quickly and easily removed for edging beard and be reset without changing setting* build in power converter (not tried)* solid design, firm clicks on dial. High quality plastic.Only slight negative is the power could be a tad better on battery. But still far more powerful than any other cordless trimmer I have tried.Best value. Not cheapest, but performance outweighs any price issue. Worth the price. If you have a beard and need/want a cordless trimmer, look no further.
