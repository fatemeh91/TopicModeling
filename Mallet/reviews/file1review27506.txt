review/text: I am a regular ON-Whey customer. I've always made it a point to drink Whey Protein 3 times a day to cover my protein requirements for my lean weight, which is 1 gram of protein per pound of my body weight.The only con I would give is that, for a Double Rich Chocolate flavor, it's not that chocolaty yet. I hope that they could keep on improving the flavor (without adding sugar or fat of course).MUSCLE MAINTENANCE:- I always make sure I drink whey on breakfast to replenish lost muscle cells after that long sleep.- I always drink whey protein before sleeping, to fight midnight hunger, and to keep my muscles fed on the first 4 hours of sleeping
