review/text: This glucose meter markedly improves the process of checking blood sugars. The drum is preloaded with 17 test strips. Just turn it on and a strip drops into place, turn it off and it releases into a sharps container. Especially useful for older folks with poor eyesight, tremors, or coordination issues. The softclix lancets are especially nice. Virtually no discomfort from the puncture. The device stores readings for a physician or an aid to check and record for future reference. With different settings, it can be used on the forearm, but I haven't tried that since the finger puncture is pain free and as a pre- diabetic, I don't check my sugar that often.
