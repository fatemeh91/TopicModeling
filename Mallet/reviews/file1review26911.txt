review/text: This is the best tasting one that I have tried.It is a bit thin, I use about 5 ounces for 2 scoops (the scoop seems a bit smaller than the other). It does not fill me up, nor provide energy, like some of the others did. But the smaller scoop gives more servings per container and good amount of protein per scoop.It is nice because it does not make me gassy like all the others did. Especially good for when I need a break from the others to reduce this.
