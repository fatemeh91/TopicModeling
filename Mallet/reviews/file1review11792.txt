review/text: I've tried lots of protein powders and many have ended up in the trash. This one is so good! I do Atkins and for my shake, I put 2 ounces of heavy cream in my blender, then 2 scoops of this Banana Scream, a tablespoon of natural peanut butter, a teaspoon of Thicken Thin Not/Starch (not essential but gives it a milkshake mouthfeel), 8 oz. of unsweetened vanilla Almond Breeze, and 6 ice cubes. When I want a bit of chocolate I will add a tablespoon of dark cocoa powder, in place of or along with the PB. SO good and filling too!
