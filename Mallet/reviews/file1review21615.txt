review/text: This tub is perfect for my 15 mo old girl, and we use it as our everyday tub and also take it when we travel. my only complaint is that the drain sits flush against the bath floor so it doesn't really drain unless you put something underneath it to elevate it a little (I use a foam letter since we already have them in the tub for her to play with).
