review/text: I recently purchased the Hoodia Pops and found them to be very tasty. There are multiple flavors and cut that craving for candy that I shouldn't really be eating. The only problem is I keep waiting for that chocolate chewy middle. Despite that drawback, I recommend these as an alternative to sweets that are taboo. They are good and good for you.
