review/text: I used to buy the Tylenol version of these, but then they had a huge recall and you couldn't find them anymore. I found these and they work great. I like the lesser dosage and the fact that there are not 10-15 extra filler ingredients. They don't taste great, but it doesn't bother me if I swallow them quickly. I will continue to buy.
