review/text: Not the fault of seller. I previously ordered USNEA (barbata) and I did not know the difference to Usnea (Uva Ursi). I was looking for a larger oz quantity not found with previous brand. Barbata had no taste and did help with congestion issues.If you can get past the taste of dirty dirt it might be a good buy for 4oz's of product.
