review/text: Amazing product - one small application really does last 8-14 days, and I live in the desert southwest, and swim and shower every day at least once. They say it works by stopping bacteria (which are apparently what causes the smell, yuck) - whatever, it WORKS! And keeps down my chances of Alzheimer's too, because there's no aluminum in it - check out your current product, bet it's full of aluminum ready to seep into your body through your underarm pores, one of our most permeable areas. Just love this stuff! It really works! (Though, I confess, I didn't believe it either till I tried it)
