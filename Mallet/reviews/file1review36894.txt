review/text: I LOVE the sock aid. Makes it SO easy to put my socks on. I hurt my back a few months ago and was unable to bend enough to put on my socks for about a week and had to have my husband help me. Once I got through that I still have trouble reaching all the way to put on socks as I have rheumatoid arthritis and my arms do not straighten all the way. A client showed me her sock aid and I must say it's as easy as it looked when she used it. I got the knack down quite quickly on putting it onto the device and just LOVE it. As another mentioned, the terry cloth is raveling a bit so I hope it lasts. My client has had hers for a couple of years and used it a lot so I'm hopeful mine will do the same because it is so easy to use.
