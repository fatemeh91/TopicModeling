review/text: This is by far the best instant green drink product I've tried. Noticeable improvements in bowel function and the occasional joint related aches and pains I would sometimes get after heavy weight training disappeared completely. I especially noticed this on my knees after heavy leg training days. Not sure why, but I clearly had a deficiency somewhere that the green drink fulfilled. I had tried several lesser quality brands and didn't see any benefit. They also gave me a bad case of mud butt! As for the taste of Perfect Food, come on now people. Grow a pair and deal with it. I mix it with 8 oz of cold water every morning and evening and have no problems whatsoever. I guess it's an acquired taste, but I actually enjoy the fresh green flavor now that I'm accustomed to it. Regardless, this is an excellent product that I recommend to everyone I know and consider it a cornerstone of my healthy diet. Try it!
