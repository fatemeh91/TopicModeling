review/text: The product is great. It makes it so much easier to wash the baby. It soaps up nicely and stays soapy for the whole wash, then it rinses clean so you can use it to rinse the baby was well. It is very soft also, not at all scratchey.My problem was actually recieving it from Amazon. I ordered it on July 8th and it FINALLY shipped yesterday, August 10th!! I have not recieved it yet, but I expect to in the next couple of days. I was very dissatisfied with Amazon's shipping speed. At the time I ordered it I was NOT told it was back-ordered or that shipping would be delayed. You would do better to buy it from a regualr store like Walmart.
