review/text: I've had this oil now for a few years and would always mix up small batches with 2 essential oils (clove bud and tangerine). Initially it works fine and everything. A good massage oil.The problem comes later. I've finally, after a lot of wondering, pinned this smell on the massage oil. Before doing a massage with my partner, we'd throw down a sheet or something so we wouldn't get oil all over the bed. After a while the sheet STUNK. Like, just rancid and weird and off and disgusting. Threw the sheet out, used other things, etc. After a while all of my bedding was destroyed due to residual oils on our skins getting onto the fabric. After a while it would go rancid and cling to the sheets. I would wash and wash and wash and could never get the smell from this oil to come out.It has ruined a lot of bedding for me. Not sure if it's because the oil is now a bit older (3 years though doesn't seem like a super long time for a medium sized bottle of oil unless you massage for a living or something) or if it's just screwed up.Cannot recommend. Also, what is up with all the spam reviews? Those did not come from customers, they're too spinny. I was going to rate 2 stars, but the fake reviews piss me off and so it gets 1 star. And really, if you can't let it come in contact with your sheets without ruining them, you can't really use it anyhow. Why take the chance?
