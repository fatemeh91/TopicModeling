review/text: Holy Cow...I don't leave reviews. I order too much from Amazon, because I don't have time to stop and do things like write reviews. But this BodyBackBuddy...OH MY GOODNESS. One of the best purchases I've made in YEARS. I need DEEP pressure, and my wife's poor thumbs can't always handle the load. But now I can dig out knots that my professional masseuse couldn't get to! I LOVE this thing... considering the mini version for travel, because the only con I can come up with is the size. But it's thin, so I'll find a place to store it.
