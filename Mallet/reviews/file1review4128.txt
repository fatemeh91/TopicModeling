review/text: Saw this product advertised as a useful weightloss aid, supported by a report on the Dr Oz TV show. However, after two weeks of using this product, I found no benefit whatsoever. I will continue until the capsules have all been taken, although I think it's just another scam in the mega-million dollar 'weightloss' industry. I would suggest you do not waste your money on this product (although it was inexpensive).
