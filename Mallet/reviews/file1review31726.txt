review/text: This product is really great, I own three now - one for the backpack and 1 in each car. The quality of all the items is really excellent, and at $21.25 (for subscription customers) its a smokin' deal.I would recommend this for anyone who wants to spend time in the woods, including boy scouts on "great adventures", kids who like to explore, and of course for more serious people like myself who like to get away from civilization on backpacking trips.Buy this, and spend 15 minutes getting to know the parts and how to use them, and it could really save your life. Of course, you should add a small flashlight, small knife, and it would be useful if you were carrying a metal pot to boil water when you are out there in the woods...But with this kit, you've solved 90% of your problems.
