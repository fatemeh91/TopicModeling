review/text: The is fantastic, I usually use the pencil more than anything else. As a college student my pencil is more forgiving and a test taking staple. The pen refills are small and run out quickly. Pen arrived on time as promised in good condition. Have no regrets, great pen, cross quality, easy to use. Thanks cross.
