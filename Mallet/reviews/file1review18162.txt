review/text: I purchased one of these 40 Blink masks for my wife since she sleeps with a cloth over her eyes. The slightest light keeps her awake. I however can sleep through a stampede of buffalo at a PETA convention. My wife however did not like the mask so I "borrowed" to take my daily naps with since our room has giant floor to ceiling windows that allow the sun to blaze in. For me the mask works great. I've always struggled with claustrophobia so I thought I'd have a problem but the design keeps the fabric away from my eyes so I don't feel trapped. It's super lightweight and comfortable. The band is not even noticed. No light gets through and I sleep sound. I can't compare this mask to other brands since it's the only one I've ever used but I think it's perfect. Even picked one up for my mom.
