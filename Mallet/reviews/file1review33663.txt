review/text: The first Waterpik I purchased was the portable rechargeable one. It was fine at first, but I left it for three weeks unplugged to go on a trip, and when I got back it would not charge at all. I still had my receipt so I took it back and was reluctant to buy another one. I did some research and decided to try the Personal Water Jet. So far it is great - it is not very noisy, easy to use, and I really like the lever that lets you adjust the pressure. I still haven't used it full force yet - there's plenty of pressure when the lever is put half way. I like that it came with two tips and the tongue cleaner. One thing I do after I use any type of mouthwash in the reservoir is afterwards I put in clear water and run it for 15-20 seconds to get the mouthwash out of the system. This makes sure there is not any build up in the lines. I read that this could help prolong the life of the appliance. I am saving my receipt, however, because there is a two year warranty and I can return it if something goes wrong.
