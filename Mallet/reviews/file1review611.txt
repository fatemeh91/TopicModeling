review/text: My mother used a traditional style walker which was unstable with small wheels, and she fell and broke her hip. She was nervous about getting about again until I bought her the Cosco Traveler Rollator. It is very sturdy, and has large wheels so she can use it outdoors or even for a stroll in the park. It has lots of adjustments (even the seat can adjust!) and is easy to use, or fold up for the car.She really loves it, and it is great to see her out and mobile again.I would recommend this for any elderly people who would like the secure feeling when walking, or anyone recovering from leg or back operations.It is the perfect walker product.
