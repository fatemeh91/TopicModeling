review/text: With this product I would say I am 90% pleased. It cleans between your teeth a lot better than flossing. Also it gets in between the teeth that are real close together with no problems. It does remove the tiny particles that flossing seems to leave behind.The reason I only gave it 4 stars is: Reservoir could fit better. Most of the time I have to move it back & forth till the pressure comes thru the jet tip. Once I get that going it works fine. Also it would be better if they had the pressure control on the unit instead of handle. Being left-handed causes a problem because my thumb will push up the pressure level. But that I solved by putting tape on it to where I want the pressure level to stay at. The plus side is that it has a 2 yr. warranty on it and all in all it does the job it claims it will do.
