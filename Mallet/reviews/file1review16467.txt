review/text: Purity does a good job finding the best ingredients. They may be a little more pricey, but you usually get what you pay for. No wierd aftertaste with these, they aren't BIG pills you typically see nowadays. Although you have to take 4, they are easier to swallow with their capsule form. I bought these because I was trying to find a multi without the typical saw palmetto/prostate ingredients they like to throw in there nowadays.
