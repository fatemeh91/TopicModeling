review/text: It was very lathery and rich-feeling, but I didn't feel that it lived up to its moisturizing claims after use. It did provide a smooth shave. The scent was very refreshing and light. However, I feel that there are equal or better products available right now. I wouldn't buy this product, nor recommend it to my friends or family over other products already available for sale.
