review/text: My dog seems to enjoy this post-grooming when he's half asleep. When he's awake, he's more interested in chewing on it. I can't think of anything less necessary for the overall care and grooming of a dog. I do have actual knuckles, after all. Perhaps this is the zenith of cute-but-useless pet-based spending, though somehow I fear not.
