review/text: Must be the Highland cattle. Seriously, there is nothing about this soap that really makes me feel Irish or makes me think of shamrocks or pots 'o' gold, but I do like the smell of Irish Spring. It's perfume is mild enough that it is not overhwelming and doesn't induce sinus infections from those who are sensitive to artificial smells - but it definitely makes you smell clean and leaves no film or residue on your skin.
