review/text: If you thought this was a diaper (I didn't) it isn't. They are perfect clothes to have around for breastfeeding and general baby needs. I like them because they are thin so you can use 'em and toss in the laundry bin without worrying about filling up your laundry load with thicker clothes. I love these. A total must have! (I've had 3 kids, and have used these each time around).
