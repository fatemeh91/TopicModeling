review/text: For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed, but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush.
