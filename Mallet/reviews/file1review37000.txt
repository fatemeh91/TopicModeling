review/text: Even though an aerosol can is a little large and I don't travel with it, I rather like the spray on Right Guard. Frankly it seems the best of all the deodorants I've used and keeps me smelling pretty fresh all day, even on a hot summer day when I'm outdoors a lot. I prefer this band to most others.
