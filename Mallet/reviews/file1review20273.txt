review/text: I have used the old fashioned cloth baby diapers as kitchen and cleaning cloths for at least 45 years. They do make wonderful absorbent kitchen towels because they are large and dry very quickly. These are the diapers that are NOT folded and are not thick. They are useful as dust cloths too for they do not leave lint on surfaces.terry
