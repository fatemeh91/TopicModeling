review/text: I bought this seat for my father in assisted living. It fits nicely over the elongated toilet. He needed a seat more comfortable than the regular 3-in-1 commodes. We removed one of the cushion sleeves from each handle so that the legs would reach the floor. The seat is stable and a great help in transferring to and from his wheelchair. I feel this is by far the best commode on the market.
