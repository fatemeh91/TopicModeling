review/text: I have tried it all! Zelnorm, magnesium, exlax, ducolax, enemas, Castor Oil, senna, vegetable pills, I even tried colonix ouch (would not recommend). I have had constipation issues for about 2 years now so I was searching and searching for new ways to help with my constipation. I didn't really expect these pills to work since I have tried so many things. Well I'm proud to say they do work. You do have to continuously take them since they are in no way a Cure, BUT they will make you run to the bathroom. When you suffer from constipation like me you can't wait to run to the bathroom. I got Zero cramps from these pills like I do laxatives. I took the pills before bed like it said and about 20 minutes after I had gotten up the next morning I felt the urge to go. It might be runny right after you wake up so just make sure you stay around the house about 20 minutes after waking up.I saw where other people wrote they made them have diarrhea??? When you suffer from constipation like I do you can't wait to release even if it's a tad runny at first. Only people who truly want to go #2 should take these pills because they work exactly the way they say they do. Also if you drink enough water like maybe 2 water bottles with the pills you will get no cramps. I learned that the hard way when I used to take laxatives. Dehydration from laxatives and any other pill that makes you go #2 is what causes the horrible cramps so as long as you drink water you will be fine. Also if you are like me you will read to take four pills the first night and get scared to death. Well no worries you will not go #2 as much as you think. It might look like a lot but it's just enough to help you go about 2 -3 times the next day.
