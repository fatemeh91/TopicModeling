review/text: BASED on MY personal experiences- VERY IMPORTANT:i took this and lost 15 lbs after Having a baby...i first used as directed and it made me very shaky and sick feeling- but the key to that is to only take 1 dose or even half of that dose - 15 mins before breakfast and DRINK LOTS OF WATER and dont forget to EAT if you dont it will make you fell like vomiting...it will give you plenty of energy to EXCERCISE and clean...best if taken before vigorous activity - if you take it and then sit on the couch - you will feel sick - its not a miracle pill but if you take care of yourself and decrease dose and stay active it does wonders - and dont forget to drink A LOT of water!!
