review/text: This is one of the best antacids available. Not only does it take out your heartburn but it tastes great with no bad aftertaste like most of them have. They are not gritty and Chalky. I have never figured out how some of these items can be both gritty and chalky at the same time but many of the other ones are that way. NOT THESE!! I have actually taken one just because the flavor was so good and I wished to take a bad taste out of my mouth. I LOVE these. Dray
