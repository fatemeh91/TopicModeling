review/text: My elderly father likes to carry his daily meds around in a little case (taken from the day-of-the-week case I fill up on weekends), but now that he has am and pm pills to take, I needed a new system since he easily gets confused. These little cases, an individual one for each day of the week, really help. I fill them up on weekends, and put a little label with the numerical date on each one too, so he knows, for instance, it is Sunday, May 31, and he plucks that container off the rack and puts it in his pocket. Not perfect, but an improvement.
