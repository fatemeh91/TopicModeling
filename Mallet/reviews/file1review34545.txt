review/text: I was looking for a safe, non-chemical alternative to the topical insect repellents like Frontline and Advantage for my dogs, and BugBand was recommended to me. The ingredients are natural and it's safe for use on kids and pets, which means when we go out I can bring just 1 bottle of insect repellent for the whole family. Despite living in an area in which both mosquitoes and ticks are extremely prevalent, no one, human and dog alike, has gotten a tick, mosquito, or flea on them while wearing BugBand spray, even after hikes in the woods. The smell is a bit strong when first applied, but not unpleasant.
