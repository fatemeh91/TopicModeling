review/text: I had avoided buying a new shaver to replace my old Remington Microscreen (bought at Fedco years before they closed, for those in Southern California just to show you how long I have owned that one). I never found any I liked, so I just kept the Remington going -- new batteries once, new screen and cutters, etc. I also didn't like the fact that any new models, including new Remingtons, were made outside the U.S. and often in China.I happened to stumble across this Wahl shaver, did a little checking, and found that it is well-liked by owners, and as a bonus is actually made in the U.S. Now, after owning it for a short while, I find that it is a great little shaver.I finally charged it for the first time since I originally charged it, which means it went almost a month on a single charge, and I use it almost daily. On the few times i let my beard grow a little I find that the different heads allow me to cut longer growth with no pulling at all; after the initial shave I switch to the closest head and finish off for a remarkably close shave -- better than I ever obtained with any other shaver or razor.The build quality is excellent, it is very light to hold, and the pop-out trimmer works superbly. I hope this shaver is available for a long time, because if mine ever needs replacing, I want another just like it.This may just be the best shaver available. And the bonus trimmer is quite nice as well.UPDATE: It keeps impressing me more and more. Charge lasts forever, and it shaves so amazingly close, I can't even match the closeness with a blade razor. This may be the best shaver you can buy.
