review/text: I did not purchase this product from Amazon. I am just here to say that I love the scent of coconut and I found this product to be very nicely scented. I use the Castor Oil for other things and found this one in my local health food store and decided to try it. It does leave the skin feeling very soft and the scent is light not overpowering. My only complaint is that it doesn't have any coconut oil in it. Still I highly recommend this product
