review/text: This never gave a normal reading when I tested it, gave mostly low readings, and when I did have a fever-checked with a mouth thermometer-it read low. From reviews, it looks like there's no quality control at all. After a parent depends on this thing and then discovers her child has been running a 103 temperature, we'll see the first product liability lawsuit-also naming Amazon-on this thing. Then Amazon will take it off the shelf.
