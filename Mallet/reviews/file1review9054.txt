review/text: I love Green Vibrance, but the taste leaves a lot to be desired (although no worse than any other green drink). I've tried it in a number of concoctions and, hands down, putting a scoop in a big glass of O.J. is the way to go; it makes it taste (dare I say) good! After drinking it in the morning, I find that my energy has improved slightly and I like knowing that I've filled those nutritional gaps that would otherwise stay empty if I depended on food alone.
