review/text: I bought the Leifheit Rotaro Carpet Sweeper - 11410 for about $58, and the Bissell Sturdy Sweep Sweeper, 2402B for about $24, in November 2010. Both are hand powered sweepers that do not use electricity or batteries.The Leifheit is a great sweeper, the rotating side brushes do a good job sweeping edges, and the dust pan is easy to clean. It has an adjustable brush height. The handle pieces screw together. But it is big, obviously not as big as my electric, canister vacuum cleaner, but noticeably bigger than the Bissel, and over twice the price.The Bissel is a good sweeper, not as good as the Leifheit, and the dust pan is a little clumsier. Agree w another reviewer who noted the edge brushes don't do much. The handle pieces slide into each other and are held together by friction, which some previous reviewers disliked. My husband jammed them together tight and if they come apart, he will put a screw into them. I don't think that will be a problem.Both are made primarily of metal, and so I think both will be sturdy. I kept them both. The Leifheit is for the house. It is perfect for quick jobs when I don't want to drag out the vacuum cleaner. The Bissel is for an off-the-grid travel trailer, which did not have room to store the larger Leifheit. The Bissel replaces a Swiffer carpet flick, which required those disposable sticky cards, which were expensive, and have since been discontinued.Very satisfied with both purchases.
