review/text: If you have a glass shower door, then definitely buy this squeegee!! It glides really easily down the shower door and leaves no streaks. I first tried another brand that ended up being flimsy and left water streaks no matter how hard I pressed it against the glass.I have had mine for a year now and it is still like new.
