review/text: We've had several orders of Vitamin Shoppe products and all have been at best prices and arrived quickly. The combination of Astragalus and Stinging Nettles seems to help our whole family to have less colds in winter and less allergies in summer. Healthy eating and living have to be part of the equation too - but from times we've stopped using them (several weeks) to taking them again, there is a definite difference in colds and allergies. It does seem to boost the immune system - with 4 of us in schools, we get exposed to a lot.
