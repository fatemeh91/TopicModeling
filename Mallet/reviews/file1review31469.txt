review/text: The .5 kit is great. It seems legitimately water tight (haven't had a chance to test that) and it's the perfect size for my bail out bag. I may make some additions to things in there. Other buyers have reported expired medications I received none of that. I assume they improved on providing unexpired medication. I will be making some of my own personal additions to this small medical kit. Hopefully it will never have to be used. :)
