review/text: Only issue I had is that its a little bulky and this thing is really loud. I replaced my Panasonic-ES8109S. But I have to tell you I now get a clean smooth shave, without any redness or irritation on my neck. There are three heads that come with the unit: sensitive, close, and heavy stubble. I agree with other reviewers that Wahl is an overlooked player in the market. But you see plenty of Barbers using Wahl. If you compare the Panasonic one I had 3 head, wet/dry to this unit. I am trying to be funny and not rude, so here goes. The Wahl is like the street worker, not so pretty, but gets the job done fast! The Panasonic looked pretty, got it done, but not sure if the job was as good!!
