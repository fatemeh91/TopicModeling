review/text: I have the privilege of being a senior citizen, I earned that right one day at a time over a period of many years; contrary to what some young people believe, I have zero interest in being young again; I've already been there, done that, and got the T-shirt!Being a senior citizen offers both advantages and disadvantages; one of the disadvantages is the reduced production of gastric hydrochloric acid, which compromises the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. In addition there is the problem of reduced function in other digestive organs resulting in less effective absorption of vital nutrients.We need not despair as there is a wide array of supplements available that can help alleviate this problem; one of these is the Solaray HCL with Pepsin being reviewed here. The way I use the Solaray is in conjunction with Twinlab Super Enzyme Caps; what I've discovered works best for me is a combination of the two products taking one of each with every meal. This combination does the job for me and also saves money!We all have different requirements and you may need to experiment with combinations to see what works best for you; the good news is you have many options that can help you deal with digestive challenges. A little experimentation should provide a workable solution.
