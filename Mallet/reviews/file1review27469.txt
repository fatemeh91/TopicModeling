review/text: Just received it a couple of days ago, I had not been working out due to a hamstring injury so I was eager to get back into a routine and I was looking for the right supplement. It seems like they are too expensive, or so cheap they taste like crap, and most are full of artificial ingredients. I ordered the Mocha! Mixed with unsweetened Almond Milk, half a banana, and one tablespoon of peanut butter, it made one of the best protein shakes I've had. It does have a small amount of artificial ingredients, but is mostly whey and cocoa, which I like. Compared to most other protein supplements, short of buying pure whey (which is hard to choke down) this is a better option in my book.I have the 2 1/2lb. container and at one shake a day it seems like it will last awhile. All in all, not the cheapest or maybe the best, but in my opinion it is easily the best value for folks looking for a protein supplement to their diet.
