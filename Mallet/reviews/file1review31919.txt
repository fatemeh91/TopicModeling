review/text: It *is* an "acquired taste." Ahem.A few drops of stevia make it more palatable.The great thing about it, though, is that it contains alot of magnesium in the form of choropyll. Why is that good? Among many things, it's a muscle relaxant and helps me bring down my blood pressure (all foods with chlorophyll do that, but juicing them enhances the effect. Just look up the research on the web.) Further, it's full of antioxidants.So, does it taste bad? Unequivocally so...but, it's healthy stuff. So good, in fact, I can't bring myself to take a star away from it. I'll just hold my nose and drink.
