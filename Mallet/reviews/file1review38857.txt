review/text: I have tried other pre-electric shave lotions, but none compare to Mennen's Skin Bracer Pre-Electric lotion. It affords me a clean shave every time and has a pleasant fragrance to boot. Unfortunately, none of the stores in my geographical area carry it any longer. I was pleased to be able to buy it at Amazon and bought enough to last awhile because the shipping cost on one bottle was more than the cost of the lotion itself.
