review/text: I don't have very yellow teeth, I just bought this because I wanted to brighten up my teeth a little and get a better smile.I got what I expected, results in three days!Plus I didn't even two strips a day, so I was definitely happy.Don't expect this to brighten up your teeth like four shades,but it DOES work.Plus for the price, I definitely recommend this.I've had no gum problems, and the drooling is OK for me.So this is definitely the product for me.
