review/text: At the beginning all was well. You can feel it helping and i would put it on every night. I didnt get it for pain or anything of the sort...just to help minimize my bunion. Unfortunately after 2 weeks of daily use I noticed that the velcro part that tightens or loosens the regulator is beginning to come apart at the seams....Now there are a lot of tiny strings everywhere. I wish it would have lasted longer.
