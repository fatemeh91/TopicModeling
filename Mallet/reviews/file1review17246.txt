review/text: I loved this beard and mustache trimmer. The built-in length adjuster works great and is a great feature, but the battery's lifespan is the Achilles heel.The NiCad batteries only lasted me about 2 to 2 1/2 years before giving up altogether. A NiMh or Li-Ion battery would make this a much better unit for the long haul.I guess I can't be too mad about a $25 trimmer though, hence the 3 stars. I'm even considering getting a new one to replace Wahl that I'm currently using.
