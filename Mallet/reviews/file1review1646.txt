review/text: I bought this product primarily for the price and the concentration of Salicylic acid. It has proved to be very convenient as well.Pros - Superior convenience, seems to be effectiveCons - The stick is a bit too thick and needs to be rubbed onto the skin a few times to get an adequate quantity out.
