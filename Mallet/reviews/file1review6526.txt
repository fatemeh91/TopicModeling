review/text: UPDATE: I still like this thing, but if I could go back in time I think I'd get the kind that's not double-sided like this one. (Like, cut off 2/3rds of the way down.) The reason being that with that shorter one you could hang it over the arm of your couch and it would stay out of the way but would always be handy. This one is so big and awkward that there's no good place for me to keep it. It's still an excellent product, but if I had the other one (like a friend of mine has) then I would use it more often because I would be able to keep it in a handier location.-------This thing is JUST what I needed. I also bought three other products, the "AccuMassage Self Massage Tool", the "Back Roller", and the "Davinci Tool" (All sold through Amazon by BodyBackBuddy). So far, this one is by FAR the best--at least for what I need. It allows me to dig into the sore spots under my shoulder blades and work on them as if I could step outside my body and massage my own back.The other three tools that I mentioned above aren't that great, at least not so far. I was especially disappointed in the AccuMassage. It looked like it would be great for doing my neck, but doesn't actually squeeze mine the way I'm needing.
