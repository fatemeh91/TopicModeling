review/text: I like the detergent itself--it cleans clothes well and leaves no cloying odors. The only complaint I have is with the bottle design.1. I have woman's average-sized hands. I would like to grip the bottle by the thinner dimension while pouring because it's more comfortable. The spout however is midway on the wider face, which means I have to grip it by its widest dimension, which is a bit uncomfortable. If I were elderly or had smaller hands, this would be even more uncomfortable.2. For some reason, the cap design is such that some detergent always manages to be oozing out of the cap, sticking to your hands unless you're extremely careful about where you grip the bottle. It's a nuisance, and I'm not even a neat freak. I switched to HE detergent because I wanted the compact size for a less-cluttered laundry room, and oozing sticky detergent doesn't help.I like the product and love the compact size, but unless the bottle is redesigned I'm going to try a different scent-free HE detergent when this one runs out.
