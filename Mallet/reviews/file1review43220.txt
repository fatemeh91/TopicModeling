review/text: Ok, so i am a sucker for cute packaging. I think these look so good in my cleaning collection. For what i use them, they work. I also really like the scent. Yes, they are pricier than other brands but when you buy them in packs like i do (i hate going grocery shopping so i stock up) the price is actually really decent. Considering that they are environmentally friendly, i don't mind paying a little more. I will just keep the cleaning to a minimum... :)
