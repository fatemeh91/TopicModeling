review/text: Cross has gotten this pen right. They offer a unique multifunctional pen with the perfect complement of red ink, black ink and mechanical pencil all in one unit. And they made it sleek and professional looking...worthy of any executive suite. I use both pen and pencil so the Tech 3 proves very convenient - no more searching my desk for multiple pens. Given the proliferation of touch screen phones/blackerries/etc, not having the stylus does not detract from this pen (usually offered as a fourth function on other multi pens). I have small hands which makes the smaller-than-typical diameter of the barrel very ergonomic and easy to use. I also prefer its lighter-than-typical weight (almost similar to regular cross pen offerings). I did not find slipping a problem - I did get the satin black finish versus the chrome. Rarely has a product stood out so superior to other available alternatives, that I felt compelled to write this review.
