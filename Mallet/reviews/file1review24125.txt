review/text: I have used many heat wraps, especially those heated by microwaving... and this one smells great. I got hooked with Dreamtime products when I got a little kit from them that included a candle, spray, etc... but that was a smaller wrap than this one. Also, this wrap has little pockets that keep the grains evenly distributed along its length. Its cover is velvety soft and looks good, too...when left on the bed or couch after use.
