review/text: This is actually an LL-10 10X loupe by Carson. I looked at a number of inexpensive loupes offered by Amazon in order to choose one for a larger purchase for printing professionals. This loupe is built solidly, has a large area of view, and allows a lot of light in to the image which helps with viewing. There was a small out of focus area in the center and it was also out of focus around the edges. I showed these loupes to several other people and a number of them liked this the best (mostly because of the amount of light that it allowed). There was a different loupe (by a different manufacturer) that more people preferred because of its better focus over the whole view.
