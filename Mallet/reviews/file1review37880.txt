review/text: The Humphreys Teething Pellets are not super user friendly. It was a pain to dissolve the pellets in 1/2 tsp. of water (with an inpatient infant near by) and then trying to put it on my baby's gums wasn't really easy either because it was like rubbing water on them. I would have hoped for more of a pastey solution or at least something with substance. After "applying", there was no noticeable difference in my baby's pain. I should have listened to some of the other reviews. What a waste of money.
