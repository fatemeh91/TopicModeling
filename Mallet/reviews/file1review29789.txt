review/text: I bought this because the price was pretty good and salmon oil is a healthy fish oil to be taking. Personally, I have problems with belching fishy taste after taking a lot of different kinds of fish oil. Krill oil is not too bad but that stuff is pretty expensive.The quality of the tablets is fine. However, I really have a problem with these coming back on me after taking them. If you belch fish after taking fish oil tablets, then this could be a problem for you. Sometimes keeping the bottle in the freezer and then taking the tablets cold helps the belching problem. These tablets are a good price and reasonable dosage for the money.
