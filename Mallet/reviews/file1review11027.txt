review/text: Bored one night I was browsing amazon supplements and found a amazon forum link with questions and answers. The question was about heavy body odor and someone recommended this. I don't have a chronic problem with body odor but there's been a time or two that I've left the house forgetting to swipe the pit with the miracle stick. The result was less than pleasing especially in 90 to 100 degree weather. After doing a little internet research I figured it sounds safe enough and if it doesn't work for days I forget to swipe at least it will cleanse the blood stream, maybe even allowing better absorption of my vitamin supplements. Long story short, I tested it and it does minimize the funk but doesn't eliminate it completely, which is fine by me. But if you stop taking it your body odor will return full force after a day or so.
