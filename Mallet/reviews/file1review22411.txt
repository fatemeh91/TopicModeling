review/text: Well, after much thought on which scar product to use on my two recent scars, I went with this one because it was cheaper than the other patches. The Curad ones only contain a 21 day supply and cost $20 so for the 12 weeks it is going to cost like $80. So I went with the Neosporin and medical tape. I had read that these don't stick but I found that I can't even get mine to stick right after peeling them off! But I bought some medical tape which keeps them on...shame though because one of the scars is on my face :( so everyone keeps asking me what happened since I have what looks like a bandage taped on my forehead. I do have to say that after only a week of use I have noticed a difference in size of the keloid scar on my hand so that is awesome! I have yet to notice a difference on the regular scar on my face but it has only been a week, so I'll see how it goes. I would still recommend these over the Curad ones since it is by far cheaper, but for the vain I would go with the Curad since I have read that they stick better and are more discreet.
