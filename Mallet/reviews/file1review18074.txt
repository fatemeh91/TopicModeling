review/text: I love my bucky 40 blinks eye mask. I rode to Florida from Missouri and took long naps with my face mask. It blocks out all the light and lets you zone out, nap and relax. The mask is so soft and comfortable with the bulging eye pockets, letting you blink. I would recommend this to everyone.
