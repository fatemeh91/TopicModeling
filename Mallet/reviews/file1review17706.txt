review/text: Though the price was appealing I wasn't satisfied with what it did.It's just your average trimmer (clipper) with a Guard / Head (plastic cap) on it that can be adjusted by turning a wheel.The titanium blades felt powerful but it was either too short / too long when trimming my beard... wasn't happy with it.
