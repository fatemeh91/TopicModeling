review/text: The little strips were the best invention for helping people to Breathe Right during the night. I use the clear ones because I sensitive skin. The small/medium size is the ones that fit most people. Before applying the strip, first wash your face to remove any oil or dirt. Otherwise the strip may come off during the night.The strip once applied, forces your nasal passages open to let air flow freely and you breathe normally. If you are prone to snoring, which I am, my wife swears by them, so I wear them.If you buy them through Amazon with their subscription service with free shipping, the price works out to about 30 cents each. That's a bargain if you have priced them in the stores.
