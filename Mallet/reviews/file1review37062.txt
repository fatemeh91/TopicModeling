review/text: To put it simply, this flosser will save me from the ravages of inflammed peridontal ligaments. Flossing has never been more pleasurable or productive, and I want to do it again and again. Each application results in surprising excretions of decayed meals that would never have surrendered to manual manipulation of my old flossing twine. My fingers are starting to stiffen from my arthritis, so the battery power really helps me to perform this important grooming function without asking for assistance from my younger wife. And the little hummer is thinner in the middle than at either end, so it should remain lodged snugly in the pocket even during vigorous activity, I can be sure I will not loose it when I go on outings. One of life's surprising pleasures in such a small sleek package. Thank you Oral Braun!
