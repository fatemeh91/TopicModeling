review/text: this is the best colon cleanser that i have ever used and i have tried alot of different ones. There are no cramps, or that bloated feeling. Its like having a natural b.m. This product is worth every penny and i will continue to use it. I highly recommend oxypowder to anyone who has a problem with constipation. it also helps to keep you regular.
