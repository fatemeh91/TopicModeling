review/text: Initially, I was looking at the soothing spa that has the shower and everything attached to it--it has mixed reviews and to be honest, not very many good ones. With my first child, I had a tub with a sling to support them and thought it would work great. That sling would up getting moldy-even though I would ring out the water and hang it up to dry--so I knew I didnt want that with a tub for my 2nd child. Although the soothing spa looked so cute, when I looked at this and read about the mold resistant foam and the fact that it folds up nearly in half--I was sold. We just got it yesterday, it it works great and is very nice and compact. What we decided to do it get a handheld attachment for our bathroom sink, that way I can still have the "shower" effect for when I am bathing my child--my first child hated baths, but loved showers--this is the perfect medium along with that handheld attachment for the sink! Plus, the attachment was only about $5, the bath was about $14..Compared to the soothing spa and shower which was about $35, so about a $15 savings as well.
