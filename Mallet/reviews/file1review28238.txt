review/text: I'm a VERY picky eater! Just ask my girlfriend, family and friends :-)Yet I must say that this is is a good drink! That is if you like chocolate. Mix one cup of the powder (very fine) along with 8 oz of milk (skim, etc.) and it taste even better than chocolate milk! The secret is to mix it up REAL good! I mean for minute, or if you have a mixer or blender that's even better. But I usually (for time reasons) mix it after breakfast with a spoon then drink it up.The price has gone up since a year ago. However I think that's because it's gone up everywhere else as well. However with having it shipped free to your house and no tax (through Amazon), you don't have to go wrong! No lugging it home in a huge bag/box, just order and have it delivered to your door free!
