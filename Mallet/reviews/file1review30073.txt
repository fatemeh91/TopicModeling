review/text: This is the first Seventh Generation cleaner my family tried and we were pleased enough to continue using it. Like many we were looking to take a step back from the daily chemical invasion of our home in the name of keeping it clean.We like this cleaner for a few reasons:1. It works well2. It is enviromentally sound3. It doesn't stink out the kitchen like standard commercial soaps doLeft off a star because on occasion it does clump a bit in our dispenser though it is a fairly new and modern appliance, and it is a bit less effective when the dishwasher is packed (typically the silver ware after a party). But for every day dishes for our family of 4 it never lets us down and it feels good knowing I am not bombarding our family's dishes with chemicals before we eat off them.
