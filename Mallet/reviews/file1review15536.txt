review/text: Have ordered from this company before and all was well. This time, I ordered multiple packages for a discount. Then, when I pulled out the first package and realized the batteries didn't fit, it was past the return policy deadline. Am contacting the seller directly to see if the situation can be rectified; but, I don't have much hope.
