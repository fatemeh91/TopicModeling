review/text: Both my husband and I are dancers... My husband had a knee surgery about 6 years ago and it is important we take care of our joints... especially during winter time. At beginning I ordered one Herbal Concepts Hot/Cold Comfort Pac with Removeable Cover, Blue as well as the original bed buddy one. The bed buddy one (white without cover) gets dirty quickly and you cannot wash it. The Herbal Concepts one is so easy to use and the fabric feels soft. After using the first one... I have ordered few more (including the shoulder one). During winter I would use them to warm up my bed. They are really great... I do have a recommendation to the manufacture, if they can make the cover with an easy snap on so the cover can stay closed.
