review/text: Purchased this product to kill a pesky wasp hovering outside my balcony. After spraying the wasp multiple times directly with the spray, I watched it finally fall. Then, a few minutes later, it flew back, far angrier and looking for revenge. Finally, I dowsed the wasp with the spray while it was on the ground. It crawled around, not killed by the spray, but merely weighed down by the weight of the spray's petroleum distillate. I ended up having to stomp the bug and get insecticide all over my shoes in the process.The spray is ineffective at killing wasps and mostly seems to anger them further. Perhaps the bugs down here are tougher than this spray can handle. The only thing this product was effective at was giving my favorite pair of sneakers a permanent petroleum smell.
