review/text: We live in the country with hundreds of acres of farms that produce hay and have thousands of blooming trees and flowers. In the springtime, our vehicles are coated with the yellow powder of pollination. I've found taking one stinging nettle in the morning and again at night has almost alleviated my reaction to the pollen. When the pollen count is at high season, I increase the dosage.
