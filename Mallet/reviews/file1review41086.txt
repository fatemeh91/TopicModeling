review/text: I ordered this microfiber pad to mop vinyl floors with spray cleaner. It fit my Don Aslett mop handle, which I can no longer find replacement pads for. I wet the pad with hot water and ring it out before attaching to velcro on bottom of mop. My vinyl floor has a little texture, so there is some drag, but I feel like the fibers are getting into the crevices of the floor and cleaning well. The pad is made very well, better than the original pads that came with the mop. It sticks to the velcro on the mop and doesn't fall off, even when quite wet. I find this method much easier to deal with than a traditional messy mop and bucket. I can rinse it in hot water when finished with the kitchen floor and then go on to the bathroom floor before throwing it in the washer. I recommend this product.
