review/text: My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/54P7J ,with $10 off and free samples.

I have been having heavy periods, and started taking two of these a day. This time, my cycle was MUCH lighter! Much better than taking hormones for no reason! I have been taking this for about 3 months now, and it has almost completely done away with those "female issues"! It has reduced cramps, irritability and reduced flow. My hair and skin is ever more radiant and it REALLY helps relieve the stress of hormones. My pre-menstrual mood swings have significantly improved. My boyfriend has noticed the difference and has been very grateful for the product. Amazing!
