review/text: The first table pad we bought for our newborn started to tear in just a couple of weeks of use. So glad I splurged on this and was surprised to find no reviews. At 9 months of age, our baby is now super squirmy -always trying to spin- and this changer feels safer as it deeper and heavier than the one we had before. Its soft vinyl and it doesn't need a cover, which I wouldn't be able to use anyway given how often I have to wipe something up. I like how easy it is to wipe clean.
