review/text: The trimmer is great so far. I bought this after my old trimmer just stopped charging and I'm glad it did because this trimmer is a much higher quality for about half the price of what I paid for my old one. You don't have to worry about the head slipping from pushing too hard on your face. The only con would be that it doesn't come with different types of trimmer heads, but for the price you really can't beat the quality of this beard trimmer.
