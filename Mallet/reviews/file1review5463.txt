review/text: This item BROKE the first time we used it. The electrical contacts are very thin and flimsy and break very easily. All of a sudden, snap, the electrical connection broke and it was done... Many products have this flaw, this isn't the first one that has done this to us. Good power and shape, but since it can and does break very easily, we did not get to use it for very long.
