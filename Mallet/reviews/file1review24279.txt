review/text: I spent $150 on custom made orthotics from the chiropractor in July. In November, they came apart. I had grown accustomed to having the arch support and my knees sounded off with a cricklety-crack and then became sore on the inside edge for two weeks. I simply had to find something else, but I sure couldn't afford another $150 to only last another 3 months. These had decent reviews and came with the three sets of arches in case I didn't rate my arch correctly. After being off of the original orthotics for 3 1/2 months, it felt once more like I was walking on golf balls. I went down one arch level to medium and kept wearing them. The pain went away for me after three days. Feeling like one is walking on golf balls is true for any orthotic, so it is important you give any orthotic a well-deserved amount of time to get your feet acclimated. The chiropractor told me it could be 24 hrs to a month before my feet would quit complaining about the lump under the arch. Be patient! These are a great buy and so far are helping me every bit as good as the $150 models. I'd buy them again. It's worth it to have good support. I might buy more so I don't have to switch them out from shoe to shoe. That's the beauty of it when they don't cost a small fortune. I certainly don't see these wearing out any time soon, either. Good product!
