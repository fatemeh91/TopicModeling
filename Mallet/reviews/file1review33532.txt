review/text: I have been using Water Piks for over 30 years and I believe that the use of Water Piks has been a major factor in helping me to maintain the condition of my teeth and gums.During this period I have had quite a few different Water Pik units (I'd say at least 6). In most cases I have had to replace the units because of leaks in the hose. The cost of repairing the hose almost equals the cost of a new unit, so I always end up buying one. I object, not only to the cost of replacing my Water Pik every few years, but also to the effect on the environment of discarding so many of these machines.
