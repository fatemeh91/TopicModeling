review/text: I bought this kit to do yoga at home, since I've been with an instructor for a while. I wanted something with blocks and strap for modifications, plus a mat to keep at home. This kit looked like everything I wanted in one go.The blocks are nice, great size and texture, the strap is basic but nice, heavy duty. The only problem is the mat itself.The mat is smelly, which will probably wear off with use, and it's a bit narrow. But the worst part is that it's not sticky. It's SLIPPERY. Imagine my surprise when I moved into downward-dog pose and almost fell flat on my face because I couldn't get my hands or feet to stop slipping!! I ended up throwing the mat to the side and finishing my practice without it.Now I have to run to the store and buy a $15 Gaiam mat. I would never recommend this brand of mat. Stick to Gaiam.
