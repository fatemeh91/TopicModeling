review/text: We've been using this product for about a month now, and are happy with the way it's making our son's skin feel. It lathers nicely, and his skin is so soft after a bath. And, when he wakes up he smells so fresh and clean! He has sensitive skin, and so far he has no dry patches with this new soap.
