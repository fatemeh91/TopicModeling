review/text: This protein powder blend is one of the best I've tried. I first used the product in 2003. Almost 10 years and it's still one of my most preferred recovery drinks after weight lifting, running, or martial arts. The protein is hydrolyzed and can be blended into a fruit-protein-shake or works well with powder + water in a shaker bottle. Research different brands and professional metrics per brand on bodybuilding.com to be sure this is what you need. Particularly important is the low metal count found in the Optimum brand. I found the unadvertised low metal values of this product to be quite acceptable for the price and excellent quality!TRAIN HARD WIN EASY!!
