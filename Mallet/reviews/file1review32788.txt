review/text: The Slim Fast shake has replaced my breakfast and lunch for the most part. I have it with 2% milk for the extra fat. I used to skip breakfast and eat double cheeseburger lunches but I went up a pant size. So I decided to try this simple replacement. I am not on a strict diet by any means. However, simply replacing my HIGH calorie lunches 80% of the time has allowed me to slowly widdle off the weight. I drink one shake at 7:00 am and have my second at noon. I am usually pretty hungry by 4:00p. I will usually have a piece of fruit to tie me over until dinner or I will simply start making dinner and eat it then.In the course of a little over 4 weeks I have lost 10 pounds without exercise. I am not feeling hungry all the time and I eat what I want from time to time. Like I said I am not strict. Also I don't feel groggy and lethargic after drinking this shake so I am a bit more alert during the day. The other side effect is that I have saved quite a bit from not eating out at lunch everyday.The milk chocolate taste of the shake is excellent. I highly recommend this product as a replacement meal even if its just a few replacements a week.
