review/text: Being alpha-lipoic acid, I cant really say "this product totally works", since it's application is really only anecdotal. So I'm giving this product 5 stars based on the fact that it doesn't have any crap ingredients (like titanium dioxide that is in other ALA supplements on Amazon) its made in the good ol' USA, the capsules are small and easy to swallow, and it has specific instructions on how to use it for increasing the absorption of creatine, which is what I use it for. For more information on ALA and R-ALA, just search on google.
