review/text: I have previously searched for this item in many stores and it is not available. This product was recommended by our Doctor to prevent some allegeries and itching. We have used this product for at least 2 years and hope to continue. I will have to make our washing detergent without scents if this product is not available. I have been told that this is a viable option.
