review/text: When used with one of the Coolskin shavers (I do not see this product being used without them, anyway), this is by far the best option available.It is the only thing that will avoid skin irritation and reduce cuts. It also leaves a nice feeling that eliminates the need for an after shave gel or anything similar.
