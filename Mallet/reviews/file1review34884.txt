review/text: I looked high and low to find a wood oil that actually has no mineral oil in it. I use this product on my butcher blocks and it's great. Remember, even though products say made of "natural" mineral oil, it's still a petroleum product.Update: Been using for three weeks and this product works great. My countertops look great and are well protected.
