review/text: My wife wanted a foot spa and I began my search via the web and noticed that most people weren't pleased with their foot spas they complained of loud noises, jets (i.e. bubbles) were not powerful, or just plain cheap.I decided to give Sharper Image or Brookstone a try. Sharper Image claimed that their spa kept the water warm but were out of stock (a good sign) but I wanted one immediately and gave Brookstone a try. My wife loved it! She frequents the nail salons for pedicures and stated that this machine was just like the ones at the salon in regards to features and comfort. She was VERY thankful. I have also experienced the jets and the water temperature and it works as advertised. You won't be dissatisfied. There are cheaper ones but IMHO this is worth the money. Enjoy.
