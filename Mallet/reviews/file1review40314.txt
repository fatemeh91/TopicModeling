review/text: Friends often wonder how our family manages to escape the wrath of most colds and flu. We swear by daily doses of Vitamin C/garlic and echinacea at the first sign of any symptoms. And that's where Gaia Herbs steps in. This company has an herbal-blended product for almost every need. I like Quick Defense because of its high concentration of echinacea alkyamides, the main components that stop a cold in its tracks. The addition of andrographis, black elderberry and ginger is an added bonus. Used when needed and as directed, this product and other Gaia echinacea-based blends work very well.My only complaint about Gaia? It's expensive! For the money, I prefer using echinacea liquid herbal extracts. A one oz. bottle lasts much longer (usually an entire winter season), and again, there are several Gaia blends to choose from (I personally like Echinacea Goldenseal Supreme). Avoiding just one cold makes spending a little more worth it.
