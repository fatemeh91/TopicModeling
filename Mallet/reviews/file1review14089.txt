review/text: There seem to be a lot of complaints about this organizer. But it works fine for me. It is true that the pockets can sag a little, but it probably all depends on what you put in them and how much you care. The items I have in my organizer are diapers, a tissue box, a small container of cotton swabs, package of wipes, a tube of baby gel and a bottle of baby lotion. It works well for me attached to the changing table. My changing table does consist of slats, so it was easy to install using the velcro tabs. The only part that I did not like was trying to install the organizer to be straight across - it is hard to align both velcro tabs exactly the same height. All in all, I am happy with the product. Mine is a blue color on the trim, not green (I got mine at Target).
