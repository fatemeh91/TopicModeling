review/text: We purchased this cover to protect our new King size latex mattress. Over the course of the last 4 months, we have had several doggie accidents on the bed but the cover has held up great! One time, the bed was wet for an hour or so before we got it off the mattress but it kept it dry nonetheless.Great product for a very good price.
