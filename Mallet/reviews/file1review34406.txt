review/text: I've bought this lube many many times and couldn't imagine a better lube. The downside, which I guess is enough for some people to totally dislike it, is that this lube doesn't rinse off totally totally clean with water alone. I don't mind this because I'm not afraid of soap and often shower after I've used it anyway, but if you definitely want something that washes off totally clean with water, get astroglide I suppose.
