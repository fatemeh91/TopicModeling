review/text: I particularly liked the shape of this brush. It seemed to massage my gums and teeth. The handle seemed a little awkward. I believe it may have been the length of the handle rather than the shape. Overall, when I completed brushing, my mouth and teeth felt clean and massaged. I'd probably purchase this brand next time I need to replace my current brush.
