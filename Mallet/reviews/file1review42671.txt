review/text: These batteries came fully charged right out of the package. I bought 2 of them for my new Canon SX10IS camera. I have taken quite a few "test" photos so far, and the first pack are still holding their own. If they hold this good of a charge after a few re-charges, then I will be replacing all of my other rechargeables with these. I highly recommend these to anyone for anything.
