review/text: I first received a tube as a gift, and I quickly fell in love with the product! I used to use ChapStick, Blistex, Carmex, etc. but I love the feel of this so much more. I have also used the Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Mint flavors, which are fine, but I can't get past my love for the Chocolate Hazelnut. I have a tube in the bathroom for after I brush my teeth, one in my purse for re-application throughout the day, and one in my nightstand for before bed. It keeps your lips extra-moist without the antiseptic odor of some other products.The only thing I don't like is that there is no SPF, but that's not a huge deal for me because I'm hardly ever outside for any length of time.Enjoy!
