review/text: I've made the same promise to myself (and my last 5 dentists) after every cleaning; I would definitely start flossing regularly. However, it always took less than a week to fall off of the flossing wagon; that is until I was introduced to this product.I just changed dentists &amp; had my annual cleaning. The dental assistant gave me the customary &quot;thank you for becoming a new customer&quot; goodie bag (that included the Reach Flosser Starter Kit). I've been using it for about a week and can't believe how easy it is to floss my teeth. In fact, it now takes less time to floss my teeth than to brush them (and NO I haven't substituted brushing with flossing ... it's additive not commutative :) )In any event, I've NOT found a more useful personal hygiene product since the introduction of the Mach 3 razor. It has changed my life ...
