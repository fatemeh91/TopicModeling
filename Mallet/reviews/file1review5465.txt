review/text: I have a pair of GE clippers that are dreadful. I have to go back with scissors to even out the mess they've left behind. I so much hated cutting my children's hair because of the pull and mess, I wait until they look like little animals. After reading all the reviews for clippers on this site, I was waffling between these Vidal Sassoon and the Andis pet clippers from petco. I got these at Target today and came right home to cut hair. They already had enough charge to test, but I hooked them to the cord(which is like a cell charger) and had my 6 yo done in no time. I am so happy with these clippers! They have the best attachments I have seen or used yet. They have longer and shorter settings. I didn't even have to use scissors on my 9 mo.I did use the scissors on my 6yo. They are nice too, not flimsy. The clippers have a nice look and feel- good control, wonderful cut, worth the money. I am delighted.
