review/text: This is a great product. I didn't think it made a difference the first time I wore it, but when I don't wear it I now notice a difference. The only drawback I have found is that it limits your wardrobe. I wish they had one where the straps didn't come up and around the shoulders that way, but then I guess you wouldn't have the support, so I make it work. I know there is a lot of stuff to buy when you're pregnant, but it is definitely worth the money.
