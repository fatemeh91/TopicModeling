review/text: Unfortunately, this product just doesn't work. We pre-rinse plates, we've tried adding more or less detergent, and nothing seems to help. Our dishes are always streaked with a cloudy white film, and our glasses are all cloudy. Our utensils are rarely clean, and are always spotted. I've thoroughly checked our dishwasher to make sure there are no clogs and to ensure diry water wasn't re-circulating.I don't like the scent of lavender in dish cleaning liquid anyway, I prefer lemon or citrus, but I purchased this hoping it would be an environmentally helpful product.Sadly, it just doesn't do the job. I am now stuck with 5 bottles that I am not quite sure how to use - maybe they'll help cleaning the tub.
