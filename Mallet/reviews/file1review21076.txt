review/text: This products works well and does exactly what it is supposed to do. The heat certainly is hot enough and the pad is big enough. However, if you are type to fall asleep when comfy (even when you don't intend to), I would suggest you pay a little more for the timed version so that you still get the treatment you need if you fall asleep.
