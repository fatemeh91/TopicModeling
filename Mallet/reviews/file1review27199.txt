review/text: This stuff is excellent as protein supplements go. I mix mine with water, and would compare the taste to water-dilluted yoohoo. Then again, we arent consuming this stuff for the taste now are we?It mixes up easily in a shaker, and on one occaision in a standard glass (forgot my shaker) I was able to mix it just as well with a fork.I've been using the product 3 times a day (breakfast, mid-morning, mid-afternoon) for about a week, with one more dose immediately following my workout on lifting days. It's too early to talk about results, but I'll follow up down the road.
