review/text: We accidentally came across these tweezers while searching online. We've purchased numerous tweezers and have become frustrated at finding ones that did the job. Our experience with tweezers are that most hairs are too fine to be removed by most of the tweezers, and after time the tweezers become dull and useless.The Tweezerman tweezers out of the box is as sharp as a needle, so be careful. It's amazing at the hairs it removes that have not pierced the skin as of yet. In addition, if or when they become dull, you can send the tweezers back to the company and they'll resharpen them for free of charge. Who knows if we'll ever have the chance to do that but it's nice to know that the option is there.Why did it take us so long to find these tweezers--they are simply extraordinary!
