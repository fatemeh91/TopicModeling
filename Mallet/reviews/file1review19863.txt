review/text: I bought one of the foam ones for my 3 year old . It worked great till it started stinking. I would spray it with bleach and the smell still didn't go away. I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I love it . It is easy to use and stays put. The best thing is that it doesn't stink and easy to keep clean.
