review/text: My two youngest LOVE this DHA. I like it because it has the higher dose that I look for, it is a huge bottle, and a great price. It really does taste like strawberries. If it tastes like fish to you you need to get it replaced because it's rancid. My 12M old and 4year old take this every day. I can see major improvements in their focus and behavior, especially my 4 year old! It doesn't get much better than nova naturals so you can't go wrong!
