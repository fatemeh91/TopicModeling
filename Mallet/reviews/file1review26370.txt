review/text: As other reviews have said, this is not J&J's ELASTIKON tape. It's a generic brand ("Elastiant" from VetOne). I knew that from other reviews and bought it based on price since using for normal use for dog injuries. It isn't as sticky as Elastikon but still works and sticks to dog fur and itself. Just put a strip of medical tape on end prevents any rolling up of end.
