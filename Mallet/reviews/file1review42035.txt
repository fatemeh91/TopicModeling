review/text: Hello I wanted to write a review because I was sad to see that no one had written a review yet. I love this shaver and so does my husband. He uses it every time he shaves for his fine hairs and for all sides of his neck. I use it so much. I love it because it doesn't irriatate my skin like most razors do. I can get the bikini area real well too. The draw back it that the shaver does not hold it's charge now that I have had it for a year. I keep it constantly on the charger so I can do my legs at least. I would buy this product again because I like it even with the charging problem.
