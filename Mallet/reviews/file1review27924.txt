review/text: So far I've tried the chocolate malt, delicious strawberry, and now the vanilla icecream. The chocolate malt is my favorite so far, but the vanilla icecream is a very close second. The strawberry wasn't bad either. Optimum Nutrition in my opinion is the best there is. I crave this after every workout. It isn't something I have to force myself to drink. It dissolves well in milk, but you will have to stir it for a while as well as a couple of times while you drink it.
