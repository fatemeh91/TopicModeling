review/text: I read the reviews before buying one of these to replace an older Panasonic model that I liked. Quite a few reviewers reported this model pulls on the hair. I didn't know if they just had sensitive nostrils so I thought it worth a try. Well, I'm sorry I did as mine gives a very painful experience and I'm not an experienced hair trimmer user. And other models don't have any better reviews, including the one that worked well for me before it died.I think the reason for the mixed reviews is a good number of these units come right from the factory with poor cutting blades, hence some love it and some winch over it. In hind sight I should have returned it but at the time it didn't occur to me this type of health and beauty items could be returned. The unit is reasonable well-made so I give it two stars, for performance alone I would it it none as I haven't found any use for it. If I had the box it came in I'd wrap it up and give it to my worse enemy LOL.
