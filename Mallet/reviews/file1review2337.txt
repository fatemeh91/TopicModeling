review/text: After removal of a carcinoma on my lower eyelid and all the following surgery, my eye did not close completely. This resulted in the drying out of my cornea. My doctor recommended a combination treatment of the Thera Tears Gel capsules and the Thera Tear Eyedrops. Now, I seldom have any dry eye discomfort.
