review/text: This product is a great whitener. I have had the bleaching trays from the dentist before but they are sort of annoying to wear. When I needed to rewhiten I asked my dentist for a recommendation and she said I should try these. I did and I think these did just as good a job as the whitening tray and they were much more convenient.
