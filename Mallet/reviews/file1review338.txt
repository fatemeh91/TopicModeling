review/text: I was really looking forward to using this item. However, upon opening it I was overcome with a strong chemical odor. The packaging says &#34;for novelty only&#34; which means, it's not safe. I did some research and found out this could actually cause cancer. Of course, I can't even return the stupid thing eventhough I never used it. Shame on you people for selling shoddy products that can esentially kill people.
