review/text: I had no issues with my initial order. The first box was 100% useable, so I went ahead and ordered two more. What a waste! Second box had 4 bad tablets...ok, not so good but I overlooked it. Last box: about one out of three effervescent tablets were spoiled, and by spoiled, I mean there was either a brown smelly and badly decomposed tablet or some nasty rotten black goo in each of the packets. I can't speak to the effectiveness of this product yet, but I was hoping that it would at least be useable! Bad batch perhaps, but TWO boxes!? Unfortunately, I missed the product return deadline by less than two weeks because I didn't discover the bad tablets in time.
