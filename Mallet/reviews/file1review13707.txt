review/text: I love the kaboom products and was thrilled to find this. I hate the products that make the water blue and smell perfumey. These tablets smell like bleach for a few days and then I get 3-4 months of extremely low-maintenance and odor-free cleaning. I am a major grime and germophobe and I trust the kaboom products to thoroughly disinfect without the overwhelming fumes. I have searched for the refill tablets for more than a year now and finally thought to try here...don't know why i didn't in the first place! If you are looking for a product to help reduce your time spent cleaning, this is definitely the one!!
