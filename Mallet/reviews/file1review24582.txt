review/text: I went home over the summer and decided to buy this because, yeah, I wanted to lose weight and I didn't have the energy to work out. When I took it I couldn't sleep for more than four hours and it was hell trying to get those few hours. I didn't feel like I lost weight, but when I returned to college a friend said I looked like I had gotten thinner, though my clothes felt tight. This was a few months ago and I stopped taking them when I returned until a little over a week ago when I needed to stay awake to study for exams. Oddly, this time they didn't keep me awake. At first there were no side effects until I stopped taking them. I have never been so paranoid and scared of dying in my sleep. Almost a week after, my heart races at odd moments, depression hits me like a bus as well as anger, my breath is shorter, and I'm scared out of my mind. My body feels weird as hell. I only took one pill a day with a large glass of water and I am usually tolerant of caffeine, but not this stuff.The only good thing about my experience is that my winter coat fits more comfortably than it did a few weeks ago. But I'd gladly trade the weight loss for peace of mind. It's just too f*****g scary.
