review/text: I must admit that I bought this with some reservations. I had read other reviews saying how great it was, but very painful. I was pleasantly surprised when I got it, and it did not hurt nearly as much as I had been led to believe. Maybe my pain tolerence is high? It does a decent job, but I feel that it can leave some stubble in places. The stubble is long enough to feel, but going over it repeatedly still does not remove it. Overall I have been pleased with the performance.
