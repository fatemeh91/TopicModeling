review/text: I didn't think it was possible to make an eye mask that doesn't let in light. I've tried several, and decided it wasn't worth it. But then I saw this at Bed, Bath and Beyond, and decided to try them on. Wow. They worked! They actually worked! The price was steep, so I got on Amazon and purchase here instead.They really do block light really well. They also feels comfortable over the eyes, it's not like others I've tried, where it feels like the reason it is dark is because the cloth rests on the eyelids. You can actually have your eyes open in these.Some reviewers have pointed out that these have Velcro in the back. This makes it uncomfortable to sleep on. I got mine for travel, and since I cannot afford first class tickets on international flights, this is a moot point for me. I am also a side-sleeper, so again, even if I wore them to bed, it wouldn't be a problem, for _me_. But be aware of this if you intend to take them to bed and you sleep on your back. If you're using them sitting in a seat on a plane or train or car or ship, you shouldn't have any problems.
