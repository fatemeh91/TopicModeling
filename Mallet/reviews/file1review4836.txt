review/text: So I was looking for a product that had Barley Grass in it. Macro Greens has some of the most of this ingredient in it. I had tried some other product that had a berry flavor added to it, and it was awful, but Macro Greens has no extra flavor added to it so it mixes well with anything. I would suggest mixing it with a protein mix of some sort. The first time I used this product I got a little tingle on or in my skin, just weird at that. The weirdest thing that happen was by the time I got to work, it seemed that my nose got affected. I could smell all kinds of things, like when someone walked by with perfume, even after a minute I could tell it was in the air yet. I even went over to one of my co-works and complained of someones way to strong perfume, and he did not even seem to smell it, but I could and i ended up walk away for a bit till she left. The big surprise was lunch time , when I could tell just about every ingredient that was in each of my friends different lunches just by smelling it. Very weird affect from this product, and even weeks later it's still the same. Anyway I think this product is great and I am just glad to know that i get my Greens every day, and feel health.
