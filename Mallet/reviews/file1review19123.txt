review/text: I bought these because they were less expensive than my previous month's supply of Clear BLue Easy Ovulation tests. My cycle is pretty regular..27-28 days. These registered as negative for 2 days before ovulation. I had one Clear Blue Easy test left and I tried that one (CBE) immediately after one of these, it was positive! I'm not sure if I got a pack of "duds" or if these aren't as sensitive as the Clear Blue Easy brand.There was a very faint line, but not as dark or darker than the control line. Which under the instructions on the website indicates that it is a negative test. I don't think I'll buy these again! I will say, shipping was super fast!
