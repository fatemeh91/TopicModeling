review/text: Never got the product...it was to arrive on the 12th...so I called on the 12th and it was a great experience. A real person answered the phone after 2 rings and refunded my money immediately also sent a voucher ($20.) toward future purchase and a free shipping label in the event that the product came and needed to be returned. The Seller was Discount Vitamins. They understand the meaning of CUSTOMER SERVICE!
