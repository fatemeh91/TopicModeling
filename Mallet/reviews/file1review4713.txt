review/text: Ok... I seldom write reviews so here it goes.I have never been on a wheight-loss shake diet and was very skeptical about this product. It is true that after eating it you feel satisfied and the taste is not that bad when you blend it with fresh fruits, but beware! if you leave the shake sitting for too long it tastes gross! I made too much once and had to put the remainder in the fridge to drink later. When I went back to my shake it tasted really bad! I'm going to finish up this container and then switch to Kirkland brand wight-loss shakes (the chocolate one is delicious by the way). I hope it really works out for other people, but sadly this product just wasn't for me.
