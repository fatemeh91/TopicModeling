review/text: This just didn't work. I waited the three days of using no deoderant per the instructions. I tried applying sparingly (it didn't work). I tried applying liberally (still didn't work). The cream has the smell and consistency of diaper rash cream and contains a lot of zinc - so perhaps this is just modified diaper cream! I don't mind sweating (as I did with this product) but I had smelly pits in less than a day. I'm now off to try Herbal Magic Roll-On deoderant, recommended by several friends at work.
