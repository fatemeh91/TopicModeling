review/text: I am a vegetarian and I was so happy to find these vitamins. All of the samples that the doctor gives have pork, beef, and so many chemicals in them. These are all natural, and they're vegan. At first I was buying them at the wrong health food store, and paying too much, but now I get them at a larger chain, and in the 90 count bottle. I never noticed them to make me sick, besides the time I tried to crush one in a sandwich because they're so big. Right before I finish a meal, I pop one in and always try to wash it down with something else besides water. If I have some left, after delivery, I plan to still take them a few times a week.
