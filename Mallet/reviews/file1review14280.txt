review/text: The commercial makes you think that it will clean a dirty shower and keep a clean shower clean, neither of these are true. At the most it will slow the eventual build up of soap scum. It doesn't work on my small shower so I can imagine that it will not work in a regular sized tub shower. I am a gadget person so I fell for it.
