review/text: I found this soap that because it has tea tree oil in it, it actually prevented the spreading and healing of heat rash (fungus) under my belly. Used daily, redness and fungus gone. Great for hot months or year round. Must be diligent in using regularly. I have recommended this product to several of my friends.
