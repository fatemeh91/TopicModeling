review/text: The product did not work better than some of it's competitor's products as I had hoped for. It did not mix with water as easily as some of it's competitors. The instruction for opening the bag was not clear enough so I ended up cutting open the bag across it's width, rendering it's resealable feature useless. I intend to try their 10 pound Whole Psyllium Husk and see if it works better for me than their Psyllium Husk Powder.
