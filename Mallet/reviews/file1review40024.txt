review/text: Celsius Calorie Burner Orange is every bit (or more so) as energizing as any of the other energy drinks (Monster, AMP, etc), and it has a fairly good orange flavor. We tried this after trying the very goodCelsius Calorie Burner, Cola, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), and it comes in close second in taste.While I can't really confirm that this actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking "too much" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my son tried one before his workout and got "jittery". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.Overall, this is an effective energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder) but is much better than the Green Tea Raspberry version (which other people seem to like).Highly Recommended!CFH
