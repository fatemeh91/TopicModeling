review/text: I have been using ON protein for years now. If you are on a budget this is about the best tasting and protein per dollar brand you can get. It has been slowly going up in price and I was truly disappointed to see Amazon get rid of subscribe and save on this but its still a great price. It mixes well and is very light unlike other powders that can be thick and heavy. My favorite flavor is the Coffee. I also love the chocolate coconut and chocolate mint is great as well. Also you can never go wrong with the regular chocolate if you are unsure about the funky flavors.
