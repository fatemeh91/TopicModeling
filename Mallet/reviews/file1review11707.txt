review/text: I have been buying this from Amazon for the past year. The Subscribe and Save made it at a reasonable cost. It's great for mixing with milk if your child doesn't care for the taste of milk. It is very sweet if drinking it straight. I don't want my child getting used to drinking stuff that's too sweet. Overall, good product but way too sweet if drinking it by itself. For some reason, this product is no longer a Subscribe and Save item. Not even the non fiber stuff. Therefore, I just picked up a case (non fiber) at Costco today.
