review/text: I researched pretty heavily when deciding how to replace my old basic Oral-B model. The old one had lasted me a good five years and was not holding a charge very well any more so it was time. I finally settled on the Triumph 9400 partly due to the great deal that Amazon.com was offering at the time. I am not disappointed, to say the least. My teeth have never felt so clean as they do everytime I use this brush, it really is just like a dental cleaning feeling! One major plus is that I am no longer having to use the sensitive teeth toothpaste. After about a month of use my teeth are no longer experiencing the sensitivity and that is worth the price of the unit alone.The charge lasts well over a week, which is long enough for me. The display is nice, I especially like the smiley face if you go the whole two minutes cleaning time. The only thing I can say negative is that I still don't know what kind of toothpaste I am supposed to use with the polishing head, the directions don't tell you.I would buy this unit again and highly recommend it, especially if you get it on [...].September 9, 2008 update - Still using my Triumph and still working great!March 22, 2010 update - Still using my Triump and still working great!
