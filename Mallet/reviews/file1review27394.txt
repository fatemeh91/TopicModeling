review/text: I have tried other powders such as EAS, GNC, etc. This is by far the best and easiest to mix. I use a blender bottle to make sure is mixed well but forgot it one day and just put some in bottle water which worked with no lumps. Great protein too, 24grams in 1 scoop! Also taste is much better than others I have had. French Vanilla creme has the creme aftertaste which I am not a huge fan of (even with rootbeer), but still much better taste than other name brands. Will try chocolate next.
