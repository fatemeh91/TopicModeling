review/text: I really didn't expect this product to work as well as it does. It really does pick up all the little stuff, and is very easy to clean. Even the roller is easy to clean when stray hair is tangled around it. Yes, I also experienced the problem with the pole coming loose at the bottom - I just inserted some folded heavy paper into the hole along with the pole; tightened it up easily. At the price, for me, that's not even an issue to complain about. I really love this sweet lil sweeper
