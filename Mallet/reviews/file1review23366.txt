review/text: I found the La Petite Wax Warmer performed exactly as described. As some said, the only problem was breaking the bar of Zip wax I bought to use with the warmer.I've tried the room temperature products and was totally dissatisfied with the results. The wax in the warmer stayed at the right consistency, unlike the tubes of Zip wax which tended to cool and stiffen. It was easy to use. Everything stayed neat. It was also easy to clean up and store.I'm very pleased that I made the purchase. And yeh - it still hurts. Nothing seems to change that. But at least it gets the job done.
