review/text: I use this pad as an indoor potty for my Havanese dog. It works perfectly. She goes outside 98% of the time, but if it's raining or snowing, forget it. We leave it in the foyer by the front door. If she has to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, she goes downstairs on her own and does what she needs to do. Next morning we we flush what needs to be flushed and then put it in the washing machine. I'm glad I thought of it. The grass potties were expensive, small, and too much work.
