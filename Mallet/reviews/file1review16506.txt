review/text: I have tried MANY energy pills over the years. This is my favorite that doesn't make me feel weird of moody. I take one Stacker every morning since I don't like coffee. I have done this for 5 years now. I tried other stackers and they made me feel weird but am a fan of this Stacker 2XPLC. One bottle lasts 3 months for me.
