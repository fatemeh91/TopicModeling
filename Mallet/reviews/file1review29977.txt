review/text: I looked up the recommended amount of each amino acid required for my body weight. This product provides roughly 1/10 of each one in 4 capsules. So I would have to take 40 capsules per day to get the recommended amount.I don't want to take that many capsules per day and it would be very expensive.However, I do think it's a good idea to take SOME of these every day to make sure you get all essential acids daily, which is not likely unless you are a nutrition fanatic.
