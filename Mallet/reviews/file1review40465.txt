review/text: After years of trying many lip balms on the market (carmex, burts, chapstick, blistex, dr. hauschka, mac, etc), I have finally found the BEST one! I love this lip balm. It's goes on smooth and leaves your lips so soft! I have converted numerous friends into using Karite Lip Balm. It's worth the extra $$.
