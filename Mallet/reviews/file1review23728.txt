review/text: I have been suffering from plantar fascitis for the past couple of years and things got even worse when I started playing tennis. Feet were really sore through the day and stepping out of bed was a nightmare. Visited a podiatrist and he recommended custom orthotics which I have been using for the past year and a half. I started looking for alternate options when they began to wear out and I did not want to shell out hundreds for the custom ones.From my research on the internet, I shortlisted rigid orthotics from two brands - Moszkito and SpencoI use both of them currently and have had good results, same as what I have got from my custom orthotics. I use the Moszkito on my dress shoes and Spenco on my sports shoes.Spenco feels extremely comfortable and it fit in the shoes rightaway without any modifications. They feel less rigid than the Moszkito ones which hardly bend. The cost factor is defintely in favor of Spenco since they are way more affordable. For about $15.00, this is a gamble you defintely would not avoid to get rid of your foot/heel pain and if it works, you could fit all your shoes with a pair so that you do not have to move them around shoes.Final take - If you are in pain, do not hesitate to give this a try. They work well for me. They may work well for you too!
