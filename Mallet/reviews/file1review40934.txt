review/text: I love all Nubian Heritage products. I would take this soap over most other natural soaps and WAY over any mass produced chemical concoction. That being said, this is not my favorite Nubian Heritage soap. The peppermint smell is not very noticeable -- I only caught a whiff of it the first time I used it. The almonds are pretty rough. While this is still superior to most soaps on the market, I prefer the Nubian Heritage Mango Butter Soap or Shea Butter Soap. If you are looking for a rougher soap, then this is the soap for you. However, if a rich, creamy lather is what you seek, try the other NH soaps. I will save this one for scrubbing stains off my hands after I henna my hair and stick to the others for showering.
