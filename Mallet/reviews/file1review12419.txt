review/text: As always I recieved great service from Amazon. I have a 4 month old Dobe puppy that still has to have her ears taped up so they stand. I tried other kinds of tape that cost up to $6 a roll and it didn't work like the zonas tape. Zona holds great and the price was the best, about $1.00 a roll. Keep up the good work Amazon.
