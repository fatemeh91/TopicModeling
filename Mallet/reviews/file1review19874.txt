review/text: I bought this for my 8 months old daughter after she had been using the BabyBjorn potty for a month or so. I realised that it wasn't much fun cleaning the potty so decided to give this toilet seat a go and it's been working great for us. My daughter is happy seating on it, it's small enough for her and it's very easy to install, put on and take off.
