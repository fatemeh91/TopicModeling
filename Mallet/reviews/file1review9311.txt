review/text: I've tried several pill organizers which are nice but don't hold everything I take daily. I don't personally take a LOT of medications, but I do take several supplements/vitamins daily. All those capsules won't fit into a regular little pill organizer.These are nicely colored and nest well into the tray. They don't &#34;lock&#34; into place, so if the tray gets knocked over, the individual days will definitely fall out. However, because they don't lock in, they're very easy to pick up for the day. The inside cases are separated into two trays. This can be used for AM/PM medications or like me - to separate my supplements from my prescriptions.Overall I'm very pleased with this set. They hold more than I expected, are easy to open/close & travel well. A couple days I have just grabbed the day case and tossed into my purse to take my meds when I had a moment or a meal if I've been too busy in the morning. The snaps are secure and haven't opened in my purse which gets some pretty aggressive tossing/toting around. :)Would definitely recommend!
