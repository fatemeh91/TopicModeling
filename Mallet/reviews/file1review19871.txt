review/text: We had 2 other seat covers, but they would slide on the toilet seat and the guards weren't large. This seat is like the BMW of toilet seat covers. It seems very comfortable (not that I've sat on it myself, but my son can sit for a very long time on it), it fits most toilets (has a little wheel you turn to make the inside part get larger or smaller depending on the size of your toilet, which makes it not move around much), and it has a large pee guard. We've since thrown away the other seat covers and bought a few of these for our house.
