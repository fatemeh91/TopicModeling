review/text: I have been using Slimfast for quite a while as I have lost weight and now need to work at keeping healthy with my food choices. I used the Slimfast Optima in the cans for the longest time. They were fine but very bulky to purchase and store and though the drinks did fill me up for 4 hours as stated they weren't such a treat while drinking them. They tasted fine but were somewhat bland.I ordered this powdered version for convenience sake. The order comes with 3 cans - 14 shakes per jar - for a total of 42 shakes. What a great deal! But most importantly I have the freedom to make the shakes to my preference for a treat just like a milk shake. With the directions they say you can just mix it with milk and drink. I don't recommend this - very boring. Definitely use a blender. I use the powder, ice and milk in the blender and add my favorite fruit as well. What I get is a frothy, tasty, cold delicious treat that I look forward to drinking. I savor it and it holds me over for 4 hours and is so preferable to the premade shakes in a can.It is important to remember that no nutrition/diet item is a miracle worker. This product will give you meal supplements that you will love to drink but it still rests on you to make healthy choices the rest of the time. Slimfast does have great tools for free on their site to help you as you try to loose weight and eat healthy.Highly recommend this product.
