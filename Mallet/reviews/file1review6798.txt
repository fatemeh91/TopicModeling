review/text: I've had chronic back pain dating back to a completely detached rhomboid that I suffered a few years ago. After surgery, I've been dealing with extremely tight muscles, painful trigger points and misaligned joints in my spine.Just received this today and I'm so grateful for taking the risk in ordering one of these! I haven't been able to put it away since really getting into my soft tissue. Although I'm still finding different ways to maneuver the BBB to target certain spots, at many angles... this beats rolling around on lacrosse balls, hands down!I haven't used the Thera Cane, but I'm finding that the extra hook comes in handy by pinning the BBB under my leg for added pressure in hitting areas around my scapula and first rib!
