review/text: I got a bunch of coupons for Glade products, and since I buy the air freshener and ran out of Air Wick, I decided to give Glade plug-ins a try. This was a complete waste of money. I couldn't smell a thing and have no desire to use Glade plug-ins anymore. I will continue to use their Rainshower and other water candles and air freshener. I even like the vacuum deodorizer, but the plug-ins leave much to be desired. I found Air Wick candles with this same scent and they worked immediately.
