review/text: The AccuFitness AccuMeasure FatTrack Gold Body Fat Caliper is not hard to learn to use technically, but if you don't know how to pinch the right part of the skin in the right places you can end up with wildly varying readings. Once you have the technique down and get consistent readings each time the results are pretty accurate.I tried it the same day that I was hydrostatically tested and it was within 1.5%. However, if you pinch too much or too little skin your readings will be meaningless. It Takes some practice.
