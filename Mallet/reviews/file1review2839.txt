review/text: Visit to the dentist. Dentist say, "You have several thousand dollars of tooth repair!" I know why. Mama loves sugar in all forms! She can consume sugars each and every hour she is awake! Been doing it for years. I use to buy her candy in bulk-20,30 Pounds of her favorite morsels-and she would distribute the candy in different bowls everywhere in the house: Living Room, Kitchen, Dining, Garage, Bedroom,etc., and every time I would try to talk to her she would have 2 or 3 in her mouth. She had got to the point where 1 was not enough! So dentist informs her: "You are better of eating all the candy you want in 1 hour than distributing the candy throughout the day. Better to eat 1 dozen donuts (of course she wouldn't eat that many, mama weighs in at 170 Lbs) in one sitting than eat 1 each hour. The devastation of your teeth is brutal!" Enter GOLIGHTLY Sugar-Free Cough Suppressant, Menthol, 30 Count, Mama says she needs them for she suffers this persistent, year after year need to cough so she considers this type of product indispensable. But since all sugar has been "halted" by me until all teeth are back to normal this was the compromise. I am hoping they are really sugar free and assist her on the coughing. When I ask her, "Big Mama, how do you like them?" She gives them a "thumbs up" so 4 Stars for now.
