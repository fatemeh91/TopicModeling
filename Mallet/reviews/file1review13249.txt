review/text: This sheet protector does a fabulous job absorbing moisture and keeping sheets dry. Unfortunately, contrary to other reviewers, I found that the protector does slip. Most mornings I find it hanging halfway off my son's bed. It could be that he's just a mover and a shaker in his sleep; perhaps someone who sleeps more soundly wound't have such trouble.
