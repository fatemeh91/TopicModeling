review/text: In the years of youth the human body abundantly produces a special water-gelling molecule called HA that is largely responsible for producing these visible signs of youthfulness. That is because HA, a key component of collagen, is the body's natural "space-filling" molecule... ~Bill Sardi, researcher and authorAfter using a Hyaluronic Acid face cream by Derma E on a daily basis, I took a second look in the mirror and my skin was literally "plumper" as if it was more hydrated and healthy.I have also started buying the Solaray Hyaluronic Acid as a dietary supplement after reading about people in Japan who eat a sticky gelatinous root vegetable instead of rice have smooth skin, flexible joints and full heads of hair even when they are quite old. Researchers have finally concluded that they have unusually high levels of hyaluronic acid in their bodies.Also look for Pycnogenol and the All One Protein Powders, especially the Antioxidant blend.You might also want to look for the Derma E products:Microdermabrasion Scrub - Salon Quality exfoliation right in your own home!Astazanthin and Pycnogenol Age-Defying Moisturizing Cr&egrave;meCracked Skin Relief Cr&egrave;meVanilla Bean Cleansing MousseTea Tree & E Antiseptic Cr&egrave;meEach capsule contains 20 mg of Hyaluronic Acid and 50 mg of Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid). These are "enteric coated" capsules so they survive the stomach.I love how my skin looks when I take this product. I alsofeel younger and my entire body is looking younger. I don'tthink I will ever allow myself to run out of this supplement.If you are into antiaging, also look for ALL ONE FRUIT Antioxidant Formula. It will amaze!~The Rebecca ReviewP.S. Drinking Aloe Vera Juice also seems to make your skin softer and you can mix it into a variety of fruit juices. The taste becomes very mild after about two weeks. I actually have grown rather fond of the taste of Aloe Vera after seeing great results.
