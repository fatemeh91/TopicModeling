review/text: This is the best thing ever. I am 8 months pregnant and since I can't reach my legs anymore in the shower, I was having serious stubble issues. This epilator is the best. It is not even remotely close to as painful as waxing. Definitely tolerable and my pain tolerance is not all that great. I used it 2 weeks ago and still am stubble free. A must have for busy moms with 5 minutes of shower time!
