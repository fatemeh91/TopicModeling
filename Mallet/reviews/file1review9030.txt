review/text: Yes, it is expensive, but look at all the organic ingredients you are getting! What I like about this product is that it tastes like blended green juice and all the ingredients are listed out. The owner of the company actually grantees it, and you are able to see the ingredient list and a full transparent disclosure with no proprietary secrecy. I just wish they would have something that would define what every ingredient is good for. I mix it with water or some juice.
