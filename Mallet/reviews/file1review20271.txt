review/text: These diapers are great for many different uses. I mostly use them as a burp cloth or for spit ups. They work great for this but I think they could be softer for little ones skin. I also use them to put under her while changing her diaper, it keeps the changing table clean and all I have to do is wash the diaper instead of the whole table. I would recommend these diapers, I just wish they were a little softer.
