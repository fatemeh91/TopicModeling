review/text: I've been taking this for 2 years while my hubby and I tried to conceive. I didn't have any problems in all that time. It is a HUGE, non-coated pill, but I didn't have too much trouble swallowing it.Then I got pregnant.At about 5 weeks, it became impossible to swallow without gagging and forcing it down my throat. I almost vomited trying to swallow the darn thing. It's just too big!!I only just learned that in 2008, the FDA identified this vitamin as being number 5 in the list of prenatal vitamins containing the most lead! You can read more about it by doing a search for "prenatal vitamins lead" and then clicking on the link to the FDA's site.Definitely scary stuff!
