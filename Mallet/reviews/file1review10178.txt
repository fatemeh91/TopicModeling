review/text: I love Blistex Infusion. My daughter who lived in Charlotte, NC, first gave it to me. I could not find it in Virginia. I could not ask her when I ran out because she got breast cancer at age 33 and passed at age 40 on March 28, 2011. She wanted to help me with my dry lips and certainly did. I had looked at drugstores, etc., and finally went to the Internet and ordered quite a bit. I did not want to run out again. It feels great when you put it on, and it stays there. One of the great blessings she left me among others. This was purchased through Amazon, and I have had great service with them.
