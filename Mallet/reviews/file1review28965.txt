review/text: I got mine on clearance at Target for about twenty five bucks, but mainly use it as a trimmer. The foil shaver is good but still not as easy and close as using a plain old razor blade, and does irritate my skin unless I use some sort of aftershave toning cream afterwards. So instead I now use the trimmer to shave...this leaves me with a five o'clock shadow look but it's much faster and doesn't require the lather-up-and-rinse process of using a blade and shaving cream.Really appreciate the ergonomics of this thing, it fits perfectly in my hand. The battery holds a decent charge, I recharge it maybe twice a month tops. It's not too loud either, which is a plus.If I had to do it all over again I'd probably buy one of those Norelco Beard Trimmers and use it for shaving because they have a vaccuum which means that your hairs are tidily sucked up so there's no mess you have to clean up afterwards...but for the time being am pretty happy with this thing. I also like that it's water resistant, so I can use it in the shower if I want to.
