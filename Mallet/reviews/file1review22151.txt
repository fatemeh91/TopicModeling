review/text: I have very sensitive/allergic skin, but must wear some bandages over a port in my chest. Using this, pulling up just a tiny amount of the bandage and then rubbing this under the bandage and skin while pulling off the bandage,reduces pain about 95% or more. I have LOTS of problems with sensitivities, and I can use it. I recommend it.
