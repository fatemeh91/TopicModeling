review/text: Although these appear to have wonderful ingredients and are just once a day, I dread taking them because I throw them back up every time, even since I cut them in half. They are so huge, so dry and so wide that it makes me cry to take them. So, for what is worth, go with the organic in the veggie capsules. They are worth taking four per day!
