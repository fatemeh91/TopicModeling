review/text: Cordyceps is one of my favorite herbs of all time. I'm an acupuncturist, so I have a lot of herbs I like... Cordyceps is used to boost the energy of your kidneys, lungs and heart. It is one of the best herbs out there to improve stamina and energy.Nature's way has one of the best brands available. You will notice the herbs have a nice nutty smell when they are good quality Cordyceps. If you buy cordyceps and it is flour colored or bland smelling, it is not good quality.One of my other favorite brands is Planetary formulas. They use both alcohol and water extracted cordyceps, so you get a broad spectrum.Planetary Herbals Full Spectrum Cordyceps 450, 450 mg, Tablets , 120 tablets (Pack of 2)The other cordyceps they carry includes some other kidney tonics that make it stronger for your kidneys.Cordyceps Power CS-4 120 Tablets
