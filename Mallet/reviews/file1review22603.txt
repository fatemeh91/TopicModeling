review/text: I had gallbladder removal surgery a month and a half ago. I gave myself time to "adjust" - but a month later I was still feeling very bloated and constipated. I read up and found that this was a normal post-surgery issue - and the solution was to take bile supplements. I rush ordered a bottle of this. After a day a taking one per meal - the bloating went away... and I am now very regular - more regular than ever before in my life. A warning though - it says to take it "with" a meal. I find taking it at the beginning or during is best. Taking it at the end with no food to follow can be a problem - but that may be my GERD and not a gallbladder gone issue.Just ordered a few more bottles so I can leave them at places - like work - where I am likely to have a meal. Highly recommend it.
