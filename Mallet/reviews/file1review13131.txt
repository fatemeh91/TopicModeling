review/text: I love the softness of the cool gel on my neck. The pack stays cool for approximately 20 minutes, which is perfect, then refreeze. The only thing that I dislike is the cover which shifts around, I don't know the remedy for that. The pros definetly outway the cons. My 4 year old loves to sleep with my gel pack?? Crazy, we fight for it each night. Thanks.
