review/text: The Body Back Buddy was recommended for me by my physical therapist. I live alone and am on a limited income - so I don't have a partner to help with accupressure or massage and I don't have extra money to hit the spa. The Body Back Buddy works very well - you can get a surprisingly steady firm pressure on unreachable back pressure points with it, which helps me a lot. I have severe fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis and this helps quite a bit.
