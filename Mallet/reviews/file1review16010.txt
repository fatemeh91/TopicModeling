review/text: New HeadBlade Sport -The Ultimate Head Shaving Razor!I did not find this item easy to use and it did not properly shave my head even as I replaced the blades. I tried holding it from several angles and moving it different ways across my head. Nothing worked. It got a few spots and left others with stubble or longer.I ended up discarding it and going back to my Trac II razor.
