review/text: Received waterik water flosser today and it was well packaged. I ordered it on Feb. 12th, not too bad on turnaround time. The assembly was pretty easy. This was my first time ever using a water flosser. A bit of a scary experience. I encourage you to start with the flosser in your mouth before you turn it on; got everything on my counter nice and wet. Also don&#8217;t put on clothes you plan on leaving out the house in.To sum up, there is a reason the waterpik is better than flossing and it is because of the high intensity water pressure. I saw a comment where it said that the pressure wasn&#8217;t all that great so I set it at high before I turned it on; be aware that isn&#8217;t a good place to start, work your way up. The water pressure contends with that of a dentist instrument. Overall great product and I plan to buy one for my sister. &#61514;
