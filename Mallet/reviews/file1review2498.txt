review/text: Estroven has been a "Godsend" for me. I had been taking it for about 3 years and stopped taking it while I was traveling for about a month. I started feeling the same menapausal problems I had before I started taking it. After I began using it again and it lessened my hot flashes, I began sleeping better again. My husband was glad I was not so irritable and it brought me back to my old self. Having a digestive problem for about 30 years I was reluctant to take anything like this; however, it has been terrific for me and I highly recommend it in place of estrogen to help my menapausal issues. Just give it about 60 days. I have recommended it to several friends and they are astounded at their own personal results. In addition to Estroven, a friend recommended a product called PROGEST Body Cream with all natural Progesterine. It completely eliminates the hot flashes and you take it when you feel one coming on! You owe it to yourself to try them both!
