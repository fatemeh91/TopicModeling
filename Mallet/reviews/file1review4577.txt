review/text: A Work of Art and the best shave I've ever had! I laughed when I heard Gillette was coming out with a razor with 5 blades but it didn't surprise me. This is the best shave I have ever had. The 5 blades glide across the face without friction or burn and the shave feels effortless. The 6th single blade is gimmicky but good for what it is for...under the nose and sideburns.I cringed when I saw the cost of replacement blades but buy your blades on EBAY and save lots of money. I bought 64 Gillette Fusion blades on Ebay for about $85.
