review/text: I bought these because Consumer Reports rated them very highly recently and I have very hard water and usually feel like I have to pretty much wash everything off of dishes by hand and just let the dishwasher finish them. With these I really started experimenting with leaving more food on the dishes and not rinsing, and it does a great job with a lot more &#34;dirt&#34; than other detergents I've tried. Some soaking of real bad casserole dishes still seems prudent, but it is a big step up.
