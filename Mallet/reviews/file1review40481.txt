review/text: Top notch cream at a great price for a budget like mine. Comes in a good size tub. Doesn't take much to get a good lather. Good protection from razorburn. Better than Proraso red AND green in my opinion. Not quite as good of protection as Dreadnought cream, but Dreadnought is much more expensive and you get way less than Taylors. Taylors is the best value I've found with high quality. I'll come back to it when this tub is done. I also love the scent of the St. James cream.
