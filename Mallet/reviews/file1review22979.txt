review/text: I found SleepKey to be surprisingly effective! The whole package--the hand-held computer and the informative documentation--helped me create an environment and discipline myself to get the restful sleep I craved. With this product, I was able to break some old, non-productive patterns and replace them with behavior that gives me a good, sound sleep. (And I can say this months after I completed the SleepKey program.) I highly recommend it.
