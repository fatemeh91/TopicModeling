review/text: This is exactly what I hoped it would beCross Townsend, Black Lacquer, Selectip Rolling Ball Pen, with 23 Karat Gold Plated Appointments (575).It's a pen that's heavier than most...an attribute that I wanted. It's a little wider in diameter than many...another attribute that I wanted. In addition, I wanted a cap that would solidly click on to the lower portion when configured for writing...like this one does. I have a Cross Apogee which does NOT do that. Since the balance of the pen depends on the cap being attached when in writing mode, the solid lock of the Townsend is highly desirable. The Apogee cap sometimes comes loose when writing.The ordering process was easy on Amazon and the delivery was much faster than I'd expected.Cross rolling ball pens all seem to come with a black ink refill. I prefer blue, so I always end up swapping out the refill right after I get the pen.
