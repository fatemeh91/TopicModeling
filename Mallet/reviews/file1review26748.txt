review/text: Protein is one of those necessities after a workout or during the day if you're training. I've tried numerous brands and I've actually stuck with ON's for quite a while. The profile is nice for a protein but the best part is, it's delicious with just water! Some protein powders, I find myself mixing with milk or making a shake to get the taste right. ON's protein tastes pretty good with just water and in a shaker bottle, it's so fine that it is easily mixed -- gone are the times of clumps of powder in the middle of the bottle.Overall, good buy and for me, I've only tried chocolate and I'm enjoying it!
