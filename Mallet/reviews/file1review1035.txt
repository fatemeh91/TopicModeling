review/text: Buying oil of oregano can be confusing, as there are many plants which are colloquially referred to as "oregano". I don't know why the FDA doesn't require all these products to provide the latin name of the plant on the label and in the advertising, but they don't. Fortunately, the Nature's Way brand tells you it's from origanum vulgare hirtum, which is the good stuff. They also contain soy lecithin, which is from non-GMO soy.
