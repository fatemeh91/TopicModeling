review/text: This was a good buy for my 27 mo old stepdaughter who is potty training! The seat fit well on my standard toilet and did not move or cause messes. She sits comfortably and is able to toilet herself happily and independently! I put a 3M Command hook next to the toilet and the seat stays there when she's not using it. When she is ready she easily takes it off and puts it on the toilet herself! A must buy for all parents potty training and a great alternative to using a floor potty.
