review/text: I have found this product to truly help my overall health, as well as my digestive system and consistent bowel movements. I must advise, the price is good on Amazon, but I would recommend that I bought it at [...](for 1 bottle, but it's a 220 count compared to the amazons 90). Just thought I would let that be known, but I still use amazon for most other things. Tastes great, only positive things to your health and immune system will come....and a bit of gas...
