review/text: Hi, this is a bad product in my opinion. The best way to do this is to use a glycolic acid product like Glytone 29.5% Ultra Heel and Elbow Cream. This will remove the unwanted dead callused skin much easier and with a better result. Just need to use some care with it's use like everything else but it does a great job much easier.
