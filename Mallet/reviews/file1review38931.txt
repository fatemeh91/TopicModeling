review/text: I'm glad to see that I can buy these cartridges on Amazon. They are also cheaper than the ones I buy in stores. I have been using this razor for many years. I had two handles, but lost one. When I went to look for a replacement in the stores, I couldn't find one and figured Gillette had discontinued the Sensor Excel for Women. I thought I might switch to one of the newer versions (Venus), but I HATED it. I just want a simple, re-fillable shaver without 20 blades and huge amounts of packaging. The Sensor Excel for Women fits the bill and gives a great shave smooth shave without a lot of nicks. The shaver's wide handle is easy to use. Glad to see that I can get another handle here at Amazon, but why are the women's handles so much more expensive than the men's?
