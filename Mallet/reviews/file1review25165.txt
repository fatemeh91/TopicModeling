review/text: Okay so this vibe is large both in length and girth. Also one of the vibes is right near the tip so it is pretty stiff with little forgiveness. I've had this for a while and it was really to big for me to use and my wife was okay with it but still said it was a little uncomfortable and pinched if put in too much. So I have been using a little smaller dildo now and and thought I would give this a try again.WOW is this thing amazing. You have to prepare a little bit before entry and I got to say it is a little tight at first but once you get the head in the rest is easy. The head is larger than the shaft and it easily rubs your PSPOT on the way in and out with every stroke. The vibe function is great too but I never use it. I like it just as a dildo. I use this one after my smaller one to get warmed up to the Rambone dildo. This one opens you up really nice and ready for the huge Rambone. I never thought I would be able to use this ... however now I find myself wanting more. I bought the Rambone and it (for now) solves the quest for more.Overall this is a 5 star dildo and the jelly type texture makes clean up a breeze. I highly recommend this if you don't already have anything in this size category.
