review/text: Recently I've lost about 30 lbs, which set my hormones completely awry. I've always been on birth control to manage my cycle, acne, and mood swings, my birth control was no match for the release of estrogen with the weight loss. I was not myself at all, severely moody, crying or raging at the drop of a hat, breaking out, and being generally a miserable human being. While ranting to my massage therapist about this one day, he suggested that I try Dim-Plus, which his wife takes. He swore up and down it made all of the difference, and it really has.Since my weight loss was pretty rapid (30 lbs in just over a month and a half from switching to a vegan high protein diet), my symptoms were more pronounced than they would have been in a normal person, I'm sure. However, I noticed a difference almost immediately, and so did my husband and dogs. I became more approachable, more even keeled. My monthly cycle after I started taking this (I'd been on it about 2.5 weeks when I got my period) was almost back to normal. I've been on it for a month now, and plan on ordering my 2nd bottle. I'm still having spikes here and there of the moodiness (and yes, I've spoken with my doc, she's verified it's hormonal), but it's much more easy to control. This stuff is awesome.
