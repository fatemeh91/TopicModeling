review/text: I've been searching for this product ever since Wal-Mart quit carrying it. These are the best facial hair remover strips I've ever used...better than some salon eyebrow waxings I've had, and less costly. Just remember that after you apply, to pull off in reverse direction of how the hair grows. Otherwise you'll get no better results than if you used scotch tape.
