review/text: I have ordered 20 of 12 okamoto crown condoms, the total price for the comdoms is a little over 30 dollors, but they charge me overm 90 for the shipping!! It is much more expensive than the pirce I can buy in the retails stores! They charge the pircie as 20 different shippment but they ship me as one package (very light and small). I thought that was one order, but they charge me as 20 orders. I guess the shipment only cost them less than 10 dollors (grand shipping by post office), what a rib off!!
