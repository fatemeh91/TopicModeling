review/text: Here the product is very good. I had no problem with the batteries and they are working as expected.Don't know how long they will last for yet. I am hoping they will last longer than the cheaper oneswhich i have purchased in the past. I don't mind paying the dearer cost for these batteries as longas they last and are of superior quality to the cheaper ones.The cheaper ones I purchased previously did not fit as good as these ones do. Also one of the cheaper ones completelycame apart.These ones on inspection do appear to be of better quality. Delivery was good also.The only negetive I would have was that the cost of postage on top of the price of the batteries was too dear.I would expect cheaper postage for such small item. It was not next day delivery or anything like that.Overall though quiet happy customer.
