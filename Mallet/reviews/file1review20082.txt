review/text: To be honest, I am surprised that this supplement is available without a prescription in the US simply because how dramatic it's effects are.After going off of birth control 2 years ago my period literally disappeared for unknown reasons. Along with the missing period I had HORRIBLE breast tenderness and a non-existent sex-drive. At first, my doctor thought I had a prolactinoma at the base pituitary gland that was secreting excess prolactin into my body, but after 2 MRI's, a cranial CT, and multiple blood tests it turned out not to be the case. Afterwards, I decided to do some research into 'natural' remedies and that's when I came across DIM.After taking this supplement (at double the recommended dose - 2 capsules, twice a day) for 3 weeks my period returned and my breast tenderness vanished. I was SHOCKED. I have never taken an over-the-counter supplement that actually made a noticeable physiologic change in my body. A week later my sex drive returned which turned out to be a pleasant surprise for my boyfriend ;) Ever since, not a day goes by that I don't take my DIM.(The reason that I take double the dose is because if you take a look at the scientific literature regarding DIM, the majority of the studies are done with MUCH higher doses than what this product recommends.)The only drawback is that sometimes DIM gives me a headache, and that's when I know I need to decrease the dose back down to only 2 capsules a day. Immediately after taking a lower dose my headache disappears.
