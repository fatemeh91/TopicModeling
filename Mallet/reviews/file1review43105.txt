review/text: This belt was difficult to take on and off (or at least more than I wanted to deal with). Once I had it on it was comfortable and lifted my belly to relieve pressure from my pelvic area/hips/legs. I did end up returning it because of the straps in front that criss cross. I was not able to wear any shirts that didn't go up to my neck without showing off the straps.
