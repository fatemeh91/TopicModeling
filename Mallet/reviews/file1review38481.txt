review/text: I mustered up some courage and tried my new epilator last night. The results are extremely satisfactory. Although it did require several passes over the area.Being a epilator newbie, the pain was definitely less than waxing. Optima was significantly less painful that I even tried it on the bikini line. The epilator picked up hairs less than 1mm long. Waxing cannot do that!Many reviewers complained about the design of the Optima. I found the shape easy to hold, but the power cord does get in the way sometimes. Nonetheless, the performance I got yesterday more than makes up for its short falls.Overall recommendation: Strong Buy
