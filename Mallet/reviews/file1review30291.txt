review/text: this little vacuum is so powerful!! It works wonderful with and without the attachments. It's even gotten my 7 year old to want to vacuum his room an everything else because its so powerful and fun to use. I would recommend buying the extra filters along with the vacuum as I can see them not lasting very long. I plan on buying the filters today, just to have them on hand, because I would hate to not be able to use it just because I ran out of filters. And I plan on using it alot. Works awesome on hardwood stairs and carpet. I love it!!!
