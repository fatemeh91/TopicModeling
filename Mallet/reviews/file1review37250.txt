review/text: I was skeptical at first to purchase this product but I am so glad I did I ordered it in medium and my ring size is a 9. .which my hand size is a large but the medium provides a perfect comfortable fit...i wear them all day at work and do not experience any raynaud episodes or aching....i totally recommend this product.
