review/text: A couple reviewers mentioned that the clove taste is strong... and it's true. If you don't like the taste of cloves, you'll be horrified. I was a little shocked by it with the first couple uses, but I've gotten used to it already and I kind of like the lingering taste to be honest.I can't give any feedback as far as longterm results since this is my first bottle, but I'm happy so far after using it a few days. My mouth feels and smells clean, without being left stinging like most mouthwashes do. :)
