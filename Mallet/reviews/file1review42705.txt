review/text: FIRST OFF -- ABOUT THE DOUBLE DOSE!120 mg. std. for flavone glycosides [24%] and terpene lactones [6%] compared to 60 mg. from most other brands equals essentially a double-dose! Of course these capsules are more expensive than the other brands which makes up for the dose differences!IN A NUTSHELL: WORKS VERY WELL WITH GOTU KOLA & BILBERRYFor Mental Boosts - The herb most reputed & documented! Combined with Bilberry and Gotu Kola you can maximize the cardiovascular and cognitive functioning benefits of the herbs.However, one should not take combinations of these or any herbs without the oversight of a health professional regardless of how safe each of the aforementioned medicinal herbs may be individually.WHATS GINKGO BILOBA GOOD FOR ANYWAY? ACCORDING TO THE READER'S DIGEST - "THE HEALING POWER OF VITAMINS, MINERALS & HERBS";* Slows the progression of Alzheimers and improves memory and circulation particularly to the brain and extremities.* Lessens depression and anxiety, especially in older people.* Alleviates coldness in the extremeities [Reynauds disease] and painful leg cramps [Intermittent Claudication]* Relieves some headaches, ringing in the ear [tinitus] and some forms of dizziness [vertigo].* May be useful for reversing the symptoms of male impotence.ACCORDING TO HEALTHNOTES 2006 here is an ordinal listing of applicationsRESEARCH "STRONGLY" INDICATES GINKO BILOBA "IS" EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF THE FOLLOWING;* Age-related cognitive decline (ARCD)* Alzheimer's disease (early-stage)* Glaucoma (normal tension glaucoma)* Intermittent claudicationRESEARCH AND ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT GINKGO BILOBA "MAY" BE EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF THE FOLLOWING;* Altitude sickness (prevention)* Depression (for elderly people)* Erectile dysfunction (of vascular origin)* Macular degeneration* Schizophrenia (in combination with haloperidol)* Vertigo* VitiligoANECDOTAL EVIDENCE BY GENERAL USE SUGGESTS THAT GINKGO BILOBA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF THE FOLLOWING;* Asthma* Atherosclerosis* Deafness, acute cochlear* Diabetes* Memory enhancement (in healthy adults)* M?ni?re's disease* Migraine headaches* Multiple sclerosis (injections)* Premenstrual syndrome* Raynaud's disease* Retinopathy* TinnitusGUIDE FOR USING GINKGO BILOBA:Unlike some other herbs, standardization is really essentially to insure getting enough of the active constituents of the ginko leaves, called flavone glycosides [24%] and terpene lactones [6%]. Without standardization you couldn't ingest the correct volume of the dried Ginkgo leaves, and you would be more prone to allergic or toxic reactions which the standardization process in this case corrects reliably.40-80 mg. about 3 times a day as part of your herbal regime is about the usually dose according to Dr. James Duke's, "Herbal Handbook".ABOUT BRANDS: SWANSON IS A BEST BUY - VITAMIN SHOPPE - NOW & NATURE'S WAY ARE TOP QUALITY TOO!This particular 'Vitamin Shoppe' brand product has been on my shelf, though it is not right now. The results here are roughly equivalent to the results I experienced from the 'Nature's Way', 'Swanson' and 'Now' Brands which I also highly regard. Also bear in mind, that this Vitamin Shoppe product has twice the standardized extract, 120 mg., than the others mentioned here. Still, the difference here in these similarly standardized Ginko products boils down to the price, even after factoring in the double dose for Vitamin Shoppe. You see, the Swanson standardized Ginkgo is 60 mg. in each of the 240 capsules, std. for 24% flavone glycosides, and 6% terpene lactones is roughly half the price of the brands I named per volume of product from discount vendors also available here. That includes the Vitamin Shoppe brand as well.You can read about the constituents of herbs in detail in Michael Murray's "Healing Power of Herbs" or James Duke's, "The Green Pharmacy" or "THE READER'S DIGEST - "THE HEALING POWER OF VITAMINS, MINERALS & HERBS";[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]
