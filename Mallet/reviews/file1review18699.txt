review/text: The chair is comfortable, but the massage features are pretty subpar and it's not as good as some other massage chairs that I've seen for about 50 more dollars. Nonetheless, it's a good buy if you want basic massage features and can only pay for a normal office chair. If I could go back in time, I would spend a little more money and get something better.
