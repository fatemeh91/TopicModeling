review/text: Hurt like CRAZY the first time I used it.First time: Took about 1 hour for both legs (Dark Course Hair)After this first episode I thought NO WAY!!!!!!!!I will shave 3 x a day before I do that again. But after about a week (must have forgot how much it hurt) decided to do it agin.Touch-Up: About 1 x per week; average about 15 minutesHardly any pain, just a kinda "pinch" feeling when it grabs the hair. but really NOT A BIG DEAL.After the leg's I decided to do the bikini area. SURPRISE!! Not bad at all. Ok it was not the most wonderful experience but really waxing is worse. I was so confident went to my underarm. BIG MISTAKE!! I almost cried. It hurt so bad I only got 1/2 of one arm done. Too scared to try again.What I dont like:1. THE CORD. Get a cordless. Cord not that long, and it detaches easily from end of unit. (no battery backup)2. Must go over same spot a few times to remove hair.What I like:1. I dont have to shave everyday.2. Pulls hair leaving no "shadow"I would buy this again. For the most part it does exactly what I need it to do...... REMOVE HAIR!!
