review/text: I have no complaints, molding them was easy enough, you have to put them in the boiling water then in your mouth and suck the air out, I did this twice for each one and didn't have to use the third one provided. They aren't as tight fitting as the ones you would get from a dentist but they work just fine for whitening.
