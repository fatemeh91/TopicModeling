review/text: I ordered this on the recommendation of a physical therapist who thought I might benefit from Trigger Point Therapy. It is extremely sturdy and easy to use. It took three weeks of working with it and while I won't say I'm "cured" I will say I no longer take pain pills daily after eight years of suffering with back pain. I am also going to get the Travel size Back Buddy for when I'm away from home. It was well worth what I paid for it and I've already recommended it to a friend with similar problems!
