review/text: this beats repeated wimpy 2% liquid applications to pieces! it is a stronger solution in wax and stays PUT, especially if you put a bandaid over it. it will destroy a wart and even callous tissue when used properly. If you don't want the rest of nearby skin to get irritated, then put a protectant over it before applying the stick, and ONLY use the stick on the area you need removed; this is CONCENTRATED.
