review/text: Despite what the first reviewer says, a weight loss product does not have to be sugar free. It doesn't matter if those calories are in the form of protein, sugar, fat or jelly donuts. As long as your body is utilizing more calories than you're putting in then you'll lose weight. That said, I wish this product did have a little less sugar.Despite the sugar concerns, I think Slim-Fast Optima is a pretty good product. I believe they added more protein and fiber which helps make you feel satiated longer and it contains less sugar than the original Slim-Fast formula. There is no magical weight loss product. These supplements are simply a way of substituting for some of the higher calories items you would eat. They should be a compliment to healthy foods that comprise the rest of your diet.As for the taste... I have tried both the chocolate and strawberry varities and think they're both pretty good. They're not a dessert by any means but the taste is more than acceptable for what they are. The powder also dissolves fairly easily without clumping like some other products do.
