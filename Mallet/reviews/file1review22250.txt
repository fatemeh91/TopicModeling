review/text: I couldn't find these at ANY store that I checked at! So glad I found them! I bought these in hopes to make my own "lunchables" so to speak. My kids refuse to eat school lunch, so they take their lunches EVERY day. I ordered two "two packs", assuming that would give me four containers....they're packaged as 2 two-packs per unit....so you get 4 containers per unit....ooops...I ended up with EIGHT containers! Oh well, guess I won't have to wash them as often to keep up with daily lunch packing!They are AWESOME! Each compartment seals individually, giving you the option of packing a dry/solid item in one compartment and something like salad dressing, dip, liquid of some kind in one of the other compartments without the fear of it leaking into one of the other compartments. LOVE them! :o)
