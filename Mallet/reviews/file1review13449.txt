review/text: Bought this cleaner to clean the old cabinets in the home my son recently purchased. We had tried a number of cleaners/polishes and nothing seemed to work. When we tried the Parker and Bailey's, the cabinets came clean and looked great. I decided to use it on my dining room table where the edges had gotten gummed up with all the arms that had rested there. Again, never used any cleaner that even seemed to remove the grime. This one not only got it off, but the wood looked terrific. I would recommend this wholeheartedly.
