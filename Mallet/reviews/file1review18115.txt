review/text: I sleep in hotels about a third of the time, so I need a good quality sleep mask. This mask is almost perfect. Very comfortable, soft, lightweight, and most importantly, it blocks the light VERY well (in black at least). The bridge of the nose is not a perfect fit, and can let the smallest bit of light in as a result, but never enough to disturb my sleep. This is by far the best sleep mask I've seen for under $25.Edit:After using the mask a few times a week for a few months, the seams on the edges have fallen apart. This was due to regular wear, nothing drastic. I would say if you use this mask every night, you won't get much more than 8 weeks out of it before it's seperating into two pieces. I considered buying another and having the edges stiched or re-seamed at a tailor to prevent this, but went withRevolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Maskinstead. So far it is equally comfortable, a little heavier (not in a bad way), and a little larger so no light comes in through the nose area (or ANYWHERE). Only problem is it is one color only, which is a weird blue, not black.
