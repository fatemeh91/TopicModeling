review/text: This little demon is an excellent razor for shaving especially sensitive skin.It takes about two weeks for your skin to get used to and perfect your own technique to avoid the odd nick or two.The razor is 3'' long styled in the old gillette superspeed era.it is extremely well made and is a hefty wee bugger with the weight being a perfect balance for holding and shaving.I would also suggest shopping around as the prices vary from seller to seller.One of the secrets of using this type of razor is make sure your shaving area is well lubricated as to enhance glide this might mean you should put on pre oil,shave cream then your gel or foam.Also dont press too hard when shaving let the razor do the work a couple of passes and Bobs your uncle.Dont try and get too close like a babys bum cos you might get irritation just nice and gentle and you will really enjoy the shave you get.There are various types of DE blades on the market,ones that get good reviews include,Merkur,Derby and Feather,I use Derby and can highly rate them as very good quality.This is one of the best investments I have made when it comes to shaving and I highly recommend this Merkur razor along with quality blades.The quality of the blades you use makes a big difference in the shave you will get,rather invest in good blades.Hope review is of help.
