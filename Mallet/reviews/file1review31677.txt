review/text: I picked this product up on sale for $19 and for $19 I'm TOTALLY impressed. I knew about the Ionic White from a local news story where they had a correspondant try it. The news storie's take was that it did not work, but when they showed her before and after it really looked like it worked great!Anyway, it's fairly straightforward, follow the directions, I imagine the swishing is the most important part, so I really did do it for 5-7 minutes every time, and I'd estimate that my teeth are 2-3 shades whiter, it's noticable to me, so that's good. I didn't mind the process, thought it worked well for the price and am pleased with the product.
