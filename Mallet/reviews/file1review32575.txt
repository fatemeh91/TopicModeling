review/text: I did not like this tea at all. I've bought grocery store teas that had tons of flavor, but I wanted to try this tea for the pure presumably stronger tasting experience. Even with 2 bags, this tea produces nothing more than slightly colored hot water. And one time, there was an aftertaste of dirt in a cup of tea.
