review/text: Love this little kit! -- the best I found during my research, and I was happy upon receiving it to see everything is good quality. It has all the absolute essentials, except would recommend a water-proof plastic bag and a couple of water purification tablets, which could be tucked into the pouch, as there is a little bit of room for extra stuff.-- (edited) just wanted to add my lesson learned - if you decide to add water purification tabs they should be in glass not plastic. I first used a mini-ziploc bag and the tablets bled out and stained. A tiny sample-size (glass) perfume vial hold the water purification tabs, and is the smallest glass container I could find.
