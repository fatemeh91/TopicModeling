review/text: I have been hunting around for such a mirror in Singapore for months and the nearest I could find is a lighted wall hung mirror with 3x magnification. I would love this product even more if this come in local voltage. I have to buy a step-up transformer and do not feel exactly comfortable using it since it gives a buzzing sound. I hope that Conair would manufacture in dual voltage(110 & 220v)or at least allow the consumer to choose the voltage they want....talking about going global!
