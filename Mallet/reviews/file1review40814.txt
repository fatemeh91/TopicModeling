review/text: I agree with the reviews they are pricey, but I do think they shave better than the cheaper ones and I like not having to mess with shave cream. I also think they mositurize pretty well.It is true that the shaving bar runs out fast on the razor side so I just turn it over and rub it over my leg and then shave.It didn't seem to do as good of a job on my armpits. I don't know why. I have lots of the old cheap razors still so I use them for my armpits and the fancy razor for my legs. I do think they give me a good shave on my legs.I am a pretty cheap person and decided this was worth splurging a little and I will stock up when they are on sale.Maybe the Schick people will improve the design- who knows?
