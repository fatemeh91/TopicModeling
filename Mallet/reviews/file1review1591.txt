review/text: I had warts on my fingers that grew over time. I had tried every remedy possible plus all over the counter treatments and finally freezing them at a doctor's office. The doctor guaranteed me that after several painful treatments they would fall off but it never happened. I tried ordering the "stick' guessing it would also fail. I applied it to the area in the morning and night and kept it covered with a band aid because the medication is very powerful. After 2-3- months of consistantly doing it twice per day, every day they completely disappeared and even the scars have healed. It was painless compared to other treatments and did not irritate the surrounding skin even when it came in contact. I feel the band aid was an important part of keeping the product from washing off and being less effective. Even if this doesn't work for everyone for the price you have nothing to lose if you have dealt with painful warts before.
