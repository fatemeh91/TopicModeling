review/text: This is the product we use when my elderly mom complains of constipation. It works all the time. We used to use slippery elm but it did not give consistent results. We also used some "natural" product that the doctor recommended but it didn't work well either. It is good to start off w/ one capsule gradually because using 3 at once can cause an unexpected accident especially for an elderly person.
