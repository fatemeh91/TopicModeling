review/text: This was recommended to me by a good naturopath. I tried it on its own and it didn't work, so I let my MD prescribe something for me. That seemed to control the blood pressure somewhat, but not enough. He was going to add another Rx, but I didn't like the sound of the side-effects, so I gave Perfusia another go. I took both my first Rx along with the Perfusia, and within a day or two my blood pressure dropped to an average of mid-120s/70s. I've been on this regimen for 18 months and it continues to work fine.
