review/text: I had all the issues that made a colon cleanser necessary. Bloating, gastric pains, skin rashes, and excessive tiredness. After a couple of days my problems started to go away. This is a gentle cleanser yet very effective. Everybody is different so you have to test out what is your ideal dosage. I settled on 5 pills. Also access to a bathroom at all time would be ideal. Of course as with any supplements consulting your doctor would be a good idea.
