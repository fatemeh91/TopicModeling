review/text: i do a lot of back packing, weeks to months on end. food supply is limited, we pack, fish & hunt when we can but sooner or later it will be just u, jar of peanut butter and these. check the supplment facts, lots of good stuff. because they have whole foods, herbs, enzymes. they wont hurt ur stomach when food supplies run low. they do help with energy but more importent. the keep u alive. i take them daily.
