review/text: I first tried an Oral-B 7500 series. I didn't like it because it didn't have the shudders every 30 seconds and it was very harsh. So then I bought the Triumph 9425 from Costco (for only $100)! I LOVE THIS THING!!! I started on the Soft setting for my sensitive teeth, but after only a few days I was using the Clean Setting and it didn't hurt at all! I love the way it feels like I've just been to the dentist. There's not much vibration. It has a polish and massage function which I haven't used yet, but I will. It also has a smiley face when you've completed your 2 minutes, which can be motivational (even though I'm over 30).My teeth feel better, and my breath is fresher! This is a great tool! I definitely like it better than Sonicare because there was too much vibration and the brush head was too large. I love this brushhead because it fits behind and around my teeth with ease. It's so easy to use and you get amazing results!
