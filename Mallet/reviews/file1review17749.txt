review/text: I have only owned this for a month so I have little to say. But for the price it cant be beat. I use it to maintain a tight scruff and it does the job flawlessly. Their are no bells and whistles that can break on this unit. What I like the most is how the charger connects to the trimmer. It uses a beefy headphone like jack. Much nicer than the other more expensive models I have owned. I have a feeling this will last a lot longer than the other ones I have owned.
