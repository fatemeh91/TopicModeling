review/text: I bought this for my child who has occasional accidents. we take it with us trips so we dont have issues in hotels etc. It is comfortable for him and is easiy portable. It does absorb well, no mess went through to the sheet below. However, it does tend to bunch up and scoot around easily and for that, i gave it 3 stars. May be better for an adult who does not tend to move around so much in their sleep.
