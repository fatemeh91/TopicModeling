review/text: Had this trimmer for about 8 months. Certainly did a good job, and I liked the adjustable head, but thenthe battery started to go a couple of months back, and a charge would last less and less time, until finallyit now only runs a minute or less - not enough for even one careful trim.It wouldn't be so bad if one could run it off house power, but for some odd reason the battery charger onlycharges the battery, it won't run the trimmer. So if the battery is dead and you need a quick trim, you'resimply out of luck.Too bad. It's actually a good little unit otherwise, but only 6 months of solid operation (and only occasional use)is just not acceptable. I'd rather pay more up front for something that will last longer. Or at least will let me use itplugged in if I need to. (My old Remington cost a little more, but lasted over 3 years, and could be run offa wall socket as well as batteries - this was the 'replacement model' - a huge step backwards.And there are too many people here with the same complaint (or even worse versions) to feel I just got a rare'lemon'.
