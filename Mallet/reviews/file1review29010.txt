review/text: I have no idea what is wrong with some of these people. One actually said in the trimmer mode the hairs don't reach the screen. That's because they aren't supposed to, the trimmer does the cutting. I guess that's why they call it a trimmer. Read the directions and you shouldn't have a problem. Some people apparently expect this thing to act like a ladies electric. This is a razor for a man so like all mens razors it has power and isn't delicate. If you want that buy a ladies version.With electrics you have to go in different directions more than once a lot of the time. This is no exception but it does a great job on my neck which was ALWAYS a problem with the Remington's I've had.I've had a couple of Remington's that didn't last but a couple years then broke down or the battery died. I had an old Braun that worked well for several years with little sharpening. Now that I'm back to Braun I'll never switch back. HUGE difference.This thing does a great job of keeping my facial hair trimmed and once you get used to the trimmers you can easily create anything you want. Just be extra careful when you start using it and you shouldn't have problems.
