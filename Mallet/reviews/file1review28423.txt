review/text: The taste is a little funny, but it's fine if you doctor it up with some cinnamon and frozen blueberries or whatever you like. Not great with plain water. It does mix really well, even in a shaker; this makes it great for travel. I noticed an increase an muscle mass almost right away after switching to this brand. It's also very digestible. I'm still on my first jar, but am very happy with this product so far!
