review/text: Don't waste your money on these, I bought 2-pks of these in Feb, 2009 based on some favorable reviews posted here. Once I received them and charged them up with myLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery ChargerI noticed that about half of them lose their charge after sitting unused for a week or two.Go buy some SANYO eneloops instead.
