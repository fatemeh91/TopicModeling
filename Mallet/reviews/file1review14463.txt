review/text: I've been using this product for several years now and I love it. With the 2-step process it covers my gray very well and makes new growth less obvious. As with all henna haircolors, it does take a little more work, but it's well worth it in the end. My scalp loves me for it as there is absolutely no irritation from the henna. And, since I began using this product, my hair feels healthier and appears shinier.
