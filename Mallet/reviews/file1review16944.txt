review/text: I had one of these wrapped around my knee after Artheroscopic knee surgery in 2004. Always kept it in the freezer to put on aches, pains. For the past two years I have been using it on my hips,knee and shoulder. It was beginning to show wear and leaked a little sometimes; so I started searching for a new one. The Medical Supply Store had nothing like it and were going to order one in a 12" x 12" size for $50.00. Said no, and told them that I was going to search the Web. Found this right away and ordered it. Is is worth the price and stays cold for hours. BUY IT! YOU'LL LIKE IT!!
