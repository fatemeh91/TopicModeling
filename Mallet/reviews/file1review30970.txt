review/text: Five months ago I received a bone scan that revealed my hip joints had degenerated due to my juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. I'd been taking a pain killer ever since for my hip pain. I tried THIS product and I can only attest to the fact I am no longer on pain killers. With just two of these tablets per day. That should say it all.
