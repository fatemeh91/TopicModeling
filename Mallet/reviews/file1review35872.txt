review/text: It really does! I started taking Tahitian Noni a month ago. The whole thing is, you have to follow the plan. Such as, if you bought bottles and bottles of vitamins and over the counter products to repair your body, mind and hair. Your products would cost you a fortune without a doubt. Not to mention, you would have to be extremely careful because you could get sick by taking too much of something and the fact that some over the counter products do have a tendency of having side effects when mixing.With the Tahitian Noni Juice, there is a natural balance of vitamins and minerals from the seed, the meat of the fruit to the skin. As a whole being used for many needs that your body, mind and hair may need.In my case, I had insomia and constant headaches, most likely from lack of sleep. Do I take over the counter products? I did, but found to make me extremely graugy in the morning, plus they have side effects and can be addictive, and the fact that they are also expensive once you have to rely on them.With Tahitian Noni, my body and mind mend itself into giving me the energy during the day and the necessary rest I needed at an appropriate time. Since I started my new routine after taking Tahitian Noni Juice, the energy has also caused me to eat regularly, rather than sporadically. I crave for healthy foods rather than sugar or fatty foods, my headaches are gone and my family say I am not cranky any more.What does this tell you? Tahitian Noni has really changed my lifestyle and that's a fact!
