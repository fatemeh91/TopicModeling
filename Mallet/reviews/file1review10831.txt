review/text: I bought this scale because I wanted to get a body fat scale first of all, but when I found out that they donate money to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, it was even better! Having breast cancer effect my family was my strong reason to buy this scale and lend more support. The body fat feature is great, easy to use! Just a couple of buttons and I was ready. I may not like the results but it was easy. I also drink a lot of water so knowing my body water levels is also important. I must admit, I use the scale mostly for just the scale mode (I just step on it for that), but will do the body fat thing once a month to see if anything changes. I like this scale much better than my older one. My older one I had to press it first and wait before I stepped on it, which bugged me. I like just stepping on the scale to get my weight. I was researching scales in the stores and it seems that most Taylor models are like that. I saw Weight Watchers and Healthometer in the stores with a big red sticker to press on first and wait -- yuck, I didn't want that again. Amazon has such a good price on this scale, I had to buy it! And now, I am happy!
