review/text: I grew up thinking that Cross pens were "the thing to have." My relatives gave them as gifts for graduation and so on. Recently I decided to buy myself one after having used disposable pens for years, and I'm very disappointed. This pen was beautiful when I got it, but after two weeks in my purse it already had several scratches in the enamel that were deep enough for the black underneath to show through. (All I keep in my purse is sunglasses, wallet, phone, keys, and pens, so the keys must be guilty.) Also, it has started skipping although the ink cartridge is not empty yet.I'm really disappointed in this product. Cross should tell people that these pens are not made to go anywhere except in a nice, soft pocket. And given the fact that the ink is now inexplicably skipping, I'll probably go back to disposable pens. What a shame, and a waste of money.
