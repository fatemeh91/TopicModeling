review/text: I originally ordered the Peanut Butter flavor, but had to substitute for the Fudge Brownie flavor when the supplier said they didn't have the Chocolate Peanut Butter bars. The product was dry and seemed old. It took a long time for the bars to be delivered also from the time I originally ordered them.
