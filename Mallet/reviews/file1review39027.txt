review/text: This is a replacement for a different brand that quit after 4 years. It is a powerful clipper that plows through my hair quickly. It is noisy with considerable vibration. Not the low level buzz of the typical barber clippers. It does seem sturdy and cuts cleanly. So the noise and vibration aside it is quite good. I keep my hair short so I can't comment on the numerous attachments for more challenging hair styles.
