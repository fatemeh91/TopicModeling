review/text: I really wanted to like these 3/4 orthodic inserts, I wanted pain relief from having flat feet, and based on the reviews, it seemed promising, however i should have read the negative reviews more closely. They are really bulky and while the arch seems sturdy, it is way too hard, and uncomfortable, after wearing it for one day, I wish I had not purchased them, my feet hurt more! so i am back to the 3/4 dr sholls 6 dollar inserts I purchased at walmart. they relieve the pain a little, im still looking for a good pair of inserts.
