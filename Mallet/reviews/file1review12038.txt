review/text: as the name indicates, you take only one huge tablet a day. it does have strong smell and leaves after taste if you hold it a little in your mouth. my solutions is to take it with milk right before bed time.i did not seem to help my nausea or other stomach symptoms as it claims but still is the first vitamin that i could ever take for such a long time and tolerate it. i am planning to take it also while breastfeeding.
