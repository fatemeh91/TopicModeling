review/text: I ordered these pill after seeing a coworker drop a tremendous amount of weight in a short period of time. She claimed all it took was 30 min of excersise each day and these pills so of course I had to try it. I started with one pill mid day like it says in the directions just to see what would happen. I didn't sleep a wink for an entire week! These pills will not let you rest. By the fourth night I found myself praying for sleep. I discussed this problem with my co worker she suggested taking them first thing in the morning rather than mid day so I did. That corrected my lack of sleep problem rigt away I continued to take one pill a day for another week. During the day, I noticed an increase in energy and a decreased appetite so I lost a little water weight over the course of two weeks but then it happend.I started having the most painful headaches that nothing would cure. At first, I thought it was a migrane that wouldn't let up then I thought it was due to my blood pressure being elevated. I was on the verge of going to my Doctor thinking that I had developed a major health problem. I didn't connect the pain to the pill. Then I read a review of these pills on Amazon and a few other sites and realized what the problem was. Thank Goodness for a place where consumers can share information on products. I had to write this review to let others know about my experience and to warn you to be very careful with these diet pills. You don't realize how important sleep is until you can't get it anymore.
