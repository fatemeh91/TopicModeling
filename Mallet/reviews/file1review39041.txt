review/text: We gave in and bought these when my son couldn't hold still for the barber. His hair is quite thick and it pulled a bit the first time we tried to use them. A little oil seemed to fix that, and we've been going without incident since we figured it out. We seem to need oil every 5 or 6 cuts. It isn't too loud, and the clippers themselves are very sturdy. The attachments are handling well so far, and we swap them on and off quite frequently. The DVD that comes with it is quite helpful too and gave me a little confidence before putting clippers in my hands for the first time. We consider it a success!
