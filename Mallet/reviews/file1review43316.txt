review/text: I own a cleaning company, and I use as much Method stuff as possible (see review of tub & tile cleaner). I do LOVE this glass cleaner. If you're getting any streaks, use a microfiber cloth (the glass-specific one Method makes is great also) or, even better, a coffee filter. I've never tried using this with a paper towel or anything else, so maybe that's where the streaking comes into play. I love the minty smell, and so do my customers.I have to say, the best thing ever to clean glass is plain, ol rubbing alcohol and paper towels, but the smell isn't that attractive (even though it is completely streak free and very cost-effective). Sometimes I will clean with the alcohol and then run over it quickly with a microfiber cloth sprayed with this Method cleaner so it smells great.
