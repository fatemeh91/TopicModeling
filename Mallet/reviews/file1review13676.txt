review/text: We have found these to be very comfortable. We owned the original Mediflow pillows and are pleased with the upgrade. I always preferred a down pillow, but the mediflow helped with neck and shoulder irritations. When we discovered that Mediflow made a pillow with down, I was excited to upgrade.
