review/text: I thought it would be good. But, it's great. Out of the box it looks a little tiny, maybe not up to much. But boy, can it do a LOT of cleaning. And, no electricity needed~~~~ !I love the screw together handle. I left one piece off so that it's exactly the right height for me to use when I'm sitting on my Rollator.I love the brush comb. So cool. It snaps onto the handle, so it's always right where you can get it if you need it.I doubted this little sweeper could get up the masses of lint from a plush, fleece blanket that shed quite a lot. But, low and behold, it did a tremendous job, and that's when the brush comb came most in handy.It can't clean in the groove between Saltillo tiles, but that's not a problem because I have a little cordless vac.I should mention that it picked up grass, leaves fallen from plants, match sticks fallen from lighting cooking candles, peat moss, plain old garden dirt, not to mention dust...Get one! I'm pretty sure you'll love it.
