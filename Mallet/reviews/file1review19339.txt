review/text: After trying many different pads and protectors for my five-year-old who wets the bed even through his Goodnites underpants, I am ecstatic to find something that works well and is easy to use. This pad washes well and goes into the dryer without melting and distorting so you can get it dry in time for the next night. I put it over the sheets so all I have to do most mornings is remove the wet pad and put down a new clean one (we have two) without having to do a whole full bedding change. Love these pads! Highly recommend them!
