review/text: My obstetrician recommended these vitamins, so I was excited to try them out. Unfortunately, the seal under the cap was broken upon arrival. In addition, the cotton layer looked like it was pushed out of the way. It was positioned such that it looked obvious that someone had placed their finger inside the bottle. The distributor, All Star Health, said that the seals sometimes get broken during the shipping process by extreme changes in temperature from hot to cold. I feel that if this is the case, the manufacturer should change their sealing technology so that the seals don't break. The distributor offered a refund, which I am taking them up on. However, the refund does not cover the shipping that I paid to get the item, or the shipping I'll pay to send the item back, so there's a $10 shipping loss on a $20-something dollar purchase.
