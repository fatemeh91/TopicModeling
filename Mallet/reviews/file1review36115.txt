review/text: This hot water bottle and cover are GREAT! I really like to use hot water bottles to keep me warm and to ward off cramps. Unfortunately, often times the bottles WREAK of rubber - to the extent I'd get headaches. Anyway, this bottle has no smell at all! Plus, the cover is tr&eacute;s cute and soft. A great buy all around.
