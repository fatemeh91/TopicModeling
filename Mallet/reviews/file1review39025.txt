review/text: Pretty good clippers, came with lots of tapers. Worked well. Wahl is a good name in hair cutting (I know that's a given, but yea), so if you're really hesitating 30 clams to get some shaving action, all I have to tell you is that I never looked back, so you probably wouldn't either. Yay for hair cuts!
