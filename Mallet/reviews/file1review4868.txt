review/text: I ordered the product from footsmart and never received it. I had to get the product from another vendor.The product is what the description says it is and that is great. The seller is the worse online retailer I have encountered to date.Vendor claims 6-10 days shipping time on what should be 2-4 days via USPS First Class Mail. Since I never received the product, I don't know what shipping method the vendor used, but the shipment could not be tracked, so I assume they use third class, bulk rate postage. Not only did I not received the order, I had to buy the product from someplace else, I also have to wait until footsmart decides to issue a refund.Two words describe this vendor....THEY SUCK!
