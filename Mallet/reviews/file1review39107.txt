review/text: Excellent quality. Comes with a ton of attachments, which can be overwhelming but if you know what you're doing they really help. This is probably the best clippers I've ever owned. Just be sure to clean and oil them properly and it should last for years. Comes with a cd-rom instructional video but I haven't checked it out.
