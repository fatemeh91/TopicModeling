review/text: I'm a girl, and I love this product. Though I think its for the masculine people out there, I enjoy it because its a fresh scent, and it doesn't have that choking flowery scent that you get tired of very quickly. The scent is light, and gives you good protection. So I'd recommend this product to a female, if she's not the girly girl type.
