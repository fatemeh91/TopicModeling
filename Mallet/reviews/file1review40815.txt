review/text: The Schick Intuition is one of those designs that make you think "Why did no one come up with this before?"To be able to lather and shave within the same device is extremely convenient--especially when used in the shower or travelling. If you're still not sure. You can buy these on eBay for cheap. The Intuition retails for around $8, but can be bought for less than $4. Refills can be expensive, but can be cheaply found online too.
