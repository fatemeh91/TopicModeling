review/text: I can say I own just about EVERY hair removal product out, and this is my all time FAV! I find the size and shape refreshing. It fits right in the palm of your hand to be held in a cupping manner rather than a traditional razor and most other electric removers. It is quick with amazing results. Though like any tweezing method it can be a lil bothersome at first. With regular use that lessons. After only using it twice for the underarms I find it painless and literally just as fast as shaving with a razor if not faster and no messy shaving cream/gel. To top it off, the hair grew back baby-soft. Since I have dark hair after shaving with razors the hair below the skin shows through the top layers of skin making a dark appearance, whlie this item leaves my pits looking clean!!! I love that it comes with changeable heads so you can clean up any hairs that you decided were too sensitive to be removed by the foil shaver head. I recommend this product highly.
