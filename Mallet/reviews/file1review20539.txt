review/text: Tom's flat floss (a.k.a., dental tape) is absolutely the best floss I've ever used, much superior to Reach and other waxed dental tape. It remains wrapped around my fingers without slipping, it resists shredding on sharp teeth, and if it does get shredded, it resists breaking into two pieces. It also slides easily between tight teeth. Even the case is good, dispensing easily and cutting without problems. They really got this one right!
