review/text: I had bought a Sonicare toothbrush not too long ago as I had one that died. On a recent trip to the mountains of Colorado I misplaced the Sonicare and cannot find it. I bought this for a couple of reasons - it was less expensive than the Sonicare, I wanted to compare the two, and if I find the Sonicare I will have two different brushes.So far I have been very pleased with the unit. Has many of the same features and the timer is a nice feature. Pros are that it seems to be as efficient as the Sonicare, easier to keep clean, and is lighter. Cons are that after the timer goes through it cycle it does not shut off the toothbrush. Also, the location of the on/off button is such that (for the way I use it) it is easy to change the setting on the brush or shut it off. Once you change it the timer resets itself.All in all I would recommend this to anyone.
