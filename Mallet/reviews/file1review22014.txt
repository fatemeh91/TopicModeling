review/text: This product worked really well for me as an asthma patient , It helped me get the mucous out , you have to eat before you take it or you will get nauseous , I took it 3 times a day as instructed on the bottle ( I'm 30 year old) & the bottle only lasted me 3 days &that's the only complaint I have , I wish the bottle was larger ..but other than that great product , will try the pills next time
