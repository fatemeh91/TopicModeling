review/text: This is a good protein shake because of the high protein and low calories per serving but I prefere the taste and mixability of BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder. If you are OK with the extra 80 calories per serving (200 against 120) BSN is a better choice; better taste (I compared vanilla flavor) and easier to mix.Now if you just want protein and no extra calories for taste, Optimum is for you!
