review/text: I cannot express enough how much I love this prenatal vitamin! I had been taking a variety of rx prenatals from my dr and when I ran out I ordered these. From the first day I started to feel better (less morning sickness and no more constipation!). HIGHLY recommend! Oh, and Amazon's price is great!
