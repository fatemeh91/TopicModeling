review/text: After reading all the good reviews about this, I decided to purchase it for my 1st time potty training experience (my 2 1/2 yr old son). Though the potty-training isn't going so well, this seat is great! It fits on our toilet easily and is easy to tighten so it stays put. It's a great size for him, easy to clean, and he loves the "teddy bear" on it. A good buy, a great value. :-)
