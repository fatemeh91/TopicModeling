review/text: If you're new to GABA consider yourself blessed as you've just found the best form of it available in my opinion. 1/3rd of a teaspoon of this in tea ( I prefer it mixed in with tea but you could just take it as is, washed down with a swish of water, whatever, etc. ) does more for my anxiety than any benzodiazepine like clonazepam ever has. GABA by itself will not knock you out like Valerian Root might, so for example you can even use it to calm those morningtime nerves if need be. Each to their own of course but this is my personal preference: 1/3rd of a teaspoon of GABA ( Source Naturals Powder-Form brand ), 4 drops of Rescue Remedy ( Bach's Flower Essences ), mixed into a hot cup of Kava Kava Tea ( Yogi brand ), and taken with 2 grams or so of Valerian Root capsules. Out like a light within 30-60 mins, this recipe will cure even the harsher forms of insomnia especially when combined with some kind of happy-place imagery like the kind transcendental-meditation can help you find ( you might try Stephen Levine's books to guide you at first, if you're interested ). Given today's economic climate, I feel most people would benefit greatly from trying this product.
