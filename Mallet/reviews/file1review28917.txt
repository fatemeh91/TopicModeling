review/text: I am fully willing to accept that this might have been a 1-off experience, but I wanted to leave it here for anyone else that maybe had the same experience.I've been using ON's Whey Vanilla Protein for over a year, specifically the older 2 lbs container that Amazon no longer carried when I went to order it. Instead I got this 5 lbs container.In the past my experience with ON's Whey Protein was that it tasted very "gentle" -- it was an easy protein powder to mix into anything and not taste. I mixed it with milk or water by itself and would take it before and after a workout.After I got the new 5 lbs tub, I did my same routine and took my shake before my workout. I was struck with how chalky and noticeable the taste was. The taste of the new protein was much more pronounced. It's not a pungent taste, just a nasty sort of chalky taste.I went and worked out and came home and had my 2nd shake that was even more pronounced. I couldn't get that taste off my palette for about a day and ended up tossing the entire tub of protein.I don't know if anyone else has noticed the more pronounced taste, but I've moved to another protein powder just because I personally cannot stand it. If you are using this and continue to notice no taste and everything is fine, it's very possible I just got a bad/unmixed batch of protein or something.Other than that, it's hard to beat the price of the ON Protein, which is what has always attracted me to it on Amazon.
