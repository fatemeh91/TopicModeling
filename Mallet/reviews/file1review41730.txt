review/text: I bought this toothbrush as a gift. I already have owned the Oral-B 9400 for many years and given others as gifts to my family. This is by far the best toothbrush out there. This model is specifically recommended and used by my dentist and all of his staff. The delivery was very prompt as are most all products purchased directly from Amazon.
