review/text: I was really hoping to have scored a good deal on these, but unfortunately they do not work. In actuality they make me feel even more anxious. I have tried my fair share of kava kava brands and these are by far not satisfactory. And I seriously have to wonder.....did I get ripped off? The answer seems to be yes because the usual benefits of even the mildest dosage of kava kava are not present here. Total bummer.Update: I took two pills this morning, as opposed to my usually taking one, I would say they worked but I am a little apprehensive as to why I would need "900mg" when I usually am more than happy when taking one of at max 250mg of another kind.Final decision..the money would be better spent on a different brand.
