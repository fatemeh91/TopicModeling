review/text: I typically use the chemical deodorant and have been looking to make the switch to natural. Regular deodorant (not clinical strength) works just great for me, and I don't actually sweat much so I don't think I'm a "hard case" in the deodorant department. Anyway, I've tried this deodorant for a few days and it lasts about 4 hours before the underarm smell begins to break through. Once that happens, reapplication doesn't really help. Since I am looking for an all-day natural deodorant, I am forced to say that this deodorant is a failure.
