review/text: This is great for getting that little tiny sliver that is deep in there and just won't come out.It won't work well for larger things, because the jaws are, by necessity, very narrow and therefore can't grip very hard. So, you'll want a regular tweezer too.Also, keep it in the original package to protect the tip. I dropped one and the little sharp points on the tip bent, so I had to buy another.
