review/text: :( I have sensitive skin. This lotion has a irritating "cold burning" sensation. Yay menthol. I didn't get a close shave and i didn't want to shave with it because it felt like the razor was dragging across my irritated skin.I was going to return my shaver until I tried the HQ170.The HQ170 moisturizing shaving lotion is much more comfortable.
