review/text: I hate getting old. The hair on my head is shedding like a St. Bernard drools, but the hair in my nose and ears grows faster than unwanted weeds in my garden. I have tried scissors, tweezers, and my razor all with varying degrees of success, blood and pain. This invention has solved all my problems. I no longer look like a scarecrow with straw coming out of my nose and ears. I no longer cut myself, and I don't bleed all over the place. This item works without pain, and is fast and easy to use. Highly reccomended.
