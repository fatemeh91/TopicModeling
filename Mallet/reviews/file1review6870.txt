review/text: I have 400 slides to go through. This product works, but it is a little hard on the eyes. You must hold up to a bright light. The one thing I do not like is that there were absolutely no instructions that came with the product. I hope I am using it properly. It is worth the price $6.00, compared to other products that cost over $25.00.
