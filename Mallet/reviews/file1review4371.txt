review/text: What can you say about these blades? They are excellent. I have found that by using this type of blade compared to other cheaper versions, I have had significantly less razor burn and cuts. They are effective at cutting the hair, and they seem to last a good long time. The five blades adds a smoothness that I never really got from other razors. Yes, they are expensive, but they are worth the money.
