review/text: I really like the daisy razors. I got a close shave without nicks or cuts on my legs. They stay sharp for a long time compared to other razors. I shave with soap, so the moisturizing strip helps the razor guide smoothly over my legs. I think it's kind of silly to make the razor pink. I think it should be lime green. Then it'd really look like a daisy.
