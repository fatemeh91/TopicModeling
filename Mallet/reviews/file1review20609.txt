review/text: Am I the only one having this problem? These foils aren't lasting me more than a few months. And, no, I don't push the razor hard against my face, I use it at a 90 degree angle, and I don't have an abnormally thick beard. I've used Braun razors my whole life and for some reason my 8595 goes through foils like nothing else. I've even had the entire cutter unit (motor) replaced under warrenty just in case that was the problem. Personally I think the problem is in the design of the foil as the thinner mesh just isn't as strong as the previous design. Is anyone else having this same experience? Is the newer 360 model any better?
