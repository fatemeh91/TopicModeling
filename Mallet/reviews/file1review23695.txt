review/text: I love these Spenco Orthotics! These provide the arch support I need when I spend all day on my feet. They have significantly reduced the pain in my arches. I usually put them on top of the existing foot cushions that come with the shoes because these orthotics are only 3/4 in length so they don't work in all my shoes; they make some of my shoes feel too tight for my feet. I would recommended the full length Spenco Orthotics if you want something to replace the existing foot cushions that come with your shoes.
