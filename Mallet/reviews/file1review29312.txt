review/text: After heart surgery, the hospital gave me one of those reallylarge containers to hold cold water and it had a flexiblefat straw in it. Eventually it was hard to keep the strawfrom showing mold, so I found the straws on amazon.com -always my first stop.Sure enough and even though these came from CA, I could notbelieve how quickly they arrived. Straws work great and nowI have umpteen kinds of colors to chose from and I don't haveto worry about mold - just throw them away.
