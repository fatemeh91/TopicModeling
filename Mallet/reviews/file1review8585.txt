review/text: I have used this for about a year and it is holding up really well; a good sign for any cleaning brush. I used to struggle with a plastic scouring pad becaused I didnt know a cleaning tool like this was available. My wife found it on line. It is an excellent tool that really helps getting the job done fast and right
