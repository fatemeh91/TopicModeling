review/text: I was excited to find a changing pad cover for $10, but I will be returning this item. The material is SO THIN! It's a tad small for a standard size, contoured changing pad so it comes up a bit on the sides which looks very ugly. The purple is a dull lavender, I was hoping it would be a little more vibrant in color. The color I could overlook, but it's so thin and small that there's no point in having it. With a coupon I can get a yard of nice minky fabric in the color I want for less than $10 and make my own nice thick minky dot changing pad cover. Even if you're not handy with sewing though, it's worth it to spend a little more and get something worth having. Don't waste your time or money on this item.
