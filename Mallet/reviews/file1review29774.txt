review/text: i read a lot of reviews on here...i didn't want to waste my money on a product that wouldn't work. I started with disposables (got the linsonah on sale for $1 - so i thought i would try them) but didn't like the regular cost or the wastefulness.Got these from babies r us for the same price as amazon. and overall, i'm happy with them. the diameter is a little smaller than that of the disposable, and sometimes they shift around in my bra and don't cover the nipple - but the same thing would happen with the disposable.i feel they absorb just as well, or better, than the disposable. Either that or i'm producing less milk than in the beginning (my baby is currently three weeks old), but i'm not leaking through to my shirt nearly as often - maybe once every other day.I do change them frequently to avoid leakage. I just use some soap in the bathroom sink, press between towel layers to soak up excess moisture and lay out to dry. I have not "run out" with this method.For $7, i'm happy with my purchase.
