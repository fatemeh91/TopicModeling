review/text: There were no instructions or packing slip in with this item. Was very hard to figure out how to put together. After finally was able to put together, it is a good item. It has a tubular part that fits between the mattress and box spring, this part keeps slipping so that the handrail moves out at times. We have to push it back in continuously. Good idea just needs tweeked a bit and include instructions for the customer.
