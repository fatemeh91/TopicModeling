review/text: I'm 63, so you can bet I've tried many electric razors over the years. The razor is comfortable to use and gives me a very close shave. Certainly the closest I've ever had with any electric razor. Clean-up is neat. Plop the razor in its holder and a micro-processor determines the level of cleaning. It whirs and buzzes a few times then dries itself. The cleaning solution is in its own plastic, throw-away container. No mess at all. I would hate to go back to cleaning as usual.I have no reservations recommending this product.
