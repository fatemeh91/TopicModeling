review/text: Once again a review for an item that is difficult to review. They're batteries. They work well. Good price. As described. If you're looking for a review to tell you what a battery is, or why these are the best ever, then you came to the wrong review. They power the stuff I need to power, they last pretty well, and that's really the extent of what I look for in a battery.
