review/text: Had my doubts about the advertised claim of moist heat without having to insert a wet cloth or otherwise add water, but it truly works! Velcro straps allow you to make it into a roll or a &#34;muff&#34; as they call it, into which you can insert hands / arms into both sides. Has a certain feel of quality and sturdiness not common to the less expensive ones on most store shelves. Made in USA. Only fault I find is the circulating lights on the control are invisible to my blind mother, and the control, though not complicated, is less instinctive than it could be for the visually impaired.
