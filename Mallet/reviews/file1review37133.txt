review/text: Like many folks with spinal cord injuries, I have a tremor in each hand. Weighted cutlery greatly reduces the effect. I've owned Good Grips weighted silverware before, and as before, have found these knives to be of good quality. The price is high, but they are well worth the cost. They were delivered quickly and in appropriate packaging. I take off one star for price (though this may be the manufacturer's fault).
