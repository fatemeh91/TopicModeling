review/text: The Norelco rotary shaver that dispensed HQ170 as it shaved my face provided the smoothest electric shave that I have ever had. I have sensitive skin and found the lotion left my face feeling smooth and not raw as I had felt after using a Remington reciprocating cutter.I tried the HQ171 Gel but it was slightly irritant and did not smooth the shaver heads over the skin like the lotion did.
