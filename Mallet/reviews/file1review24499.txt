review/text: I'm so happy to have these, I'm buying two more sets of them. I'm going to take a trip to Europe and will be doing tons of walking. I want a spare pair here at home and a spare pair in my suitcase. I was a bit concerned that they wouldn't last well after washing them with cold water, but they come right back! Sock link accumulates on them and a cold water rinse is all they need and they bounce right back. : )So worthwhile.It's about the best thing ever if you have painful callouses. I have spent a small fortune on she's and slippers due to my feet hurting so much, constantly searching for something better that will work. These help relieve the pain!Thank you so much!
