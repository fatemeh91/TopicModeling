review/text: I purchased this item because I needed extra protein after Bariatric surgery. I had tried other types of protein replacement in the powder and liquid form. I was expecting a thin liquid solution that coud be mixed in juice or water. What I got was a thick, awful smelling liquid that tasted equally bad. This product should come with a disclaimer.....disgusting!!!!!!! Couldn't get past the smell to taste anything cherry-like.
