review/text: Anyone who has had the itch of Shingles, or in my case, the related Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, knows the itch is maddening. I had the blisters in my ear canal, but the worst was on my earlobes. I had to be very careful not to infect them. Shinglederm Rescue Relief was something I could use on the outside of my ear and get some peace from the constant itch. Even now, there are times when I get the itch on the outer ear from the old virus, and I head for the Shinglederm to sooth it. It is mild and not greasy. it just helps.
