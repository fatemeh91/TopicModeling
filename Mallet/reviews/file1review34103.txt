review/text: This kit seems like a really good value to me - I really like all of the varieties, and a little goes a long way. This kit will probably last me several years, so I think I can splurge $20 or so for a luxury item like this every few years.The fragrances vary enough that you really can notice the difference. I can honestly see wanting to use all of them depending on what 'appetite' I will have when the time comes - not a dud in the whole kit!Enjoy!
