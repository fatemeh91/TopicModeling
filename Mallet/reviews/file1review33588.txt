review/text: At recommendation of my dentist I have been a Waterpik user for over 25 years, and am never disappointed with the product. Good price at Amazon, no hassle swift delivery. After removing the tip, the lid can cover the works for ease of traveling with this indispensable tool for removing all the small bits of food that stick between and behind the teeth. Multiple power levels in blue slider on handle. I don't use the other tips so cannot comment on them; the one tip is all I need daily. Highly recommend this for anyone who has any gaps between teeth or implants that harbor food particles. Not noisy. Tips remove easily. No complaints.
