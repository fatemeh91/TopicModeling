review/text: I bought this cushion to get some relief from sacroiliitis in driving two hour intervals. The cushion is really too wide to properly fit the flat bottom part of my car's U-shaped bucket seat, so the sides of the cushion rise up and put pressure on the back of my thighs. This becomes moderately painful after about 30 minutes, but the pain is tolerable. I do get relief with the cushion from the much more severe pain previously experienced in my tailbone that radiated down my right leg. I'm tempted to trim the sides of the cushion to better fit my car seat and give my thighs some relief.
