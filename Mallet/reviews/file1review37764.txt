review/text: This is GREAT STUFF! Been using for about 7 years now very hard to find. A hidden secret in drys quickly doesn't stain my clothing and it actually holds very well unlike it's cousins you will have to fresh n up before the end of the day. Strong and will not leave under arms sore or lumpy. The shipping from this vendor is Pretty pricy! If your looking for a true product it's worth the cost.
