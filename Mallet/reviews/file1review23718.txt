review/text: My arch had flattened enough that my toes were touching the front of boots that used to fit. This device lifted the arch enough to make the boot comfortable again. One foot hurt horribly the first half day that I wore the orthotics, as my muscles learned to support the arch again. You should where these only a few hours each day until you become accustomed to them. The 3/4 length is the best choice. A full length orthotic would raise the toes higher where there would be less volume for the toes.
