review/text: My dad is getting up there in age and sometimes isn't motivated to eat or eat well. We've had to supplement so he's getting more meals per day. This product along with peanut butter sports bars, whey powder mixed with milk, and Pepperidge Farm Oatmeal cookies have been his between meal snacks that have actually helped him put on a little weight again. Put an Ensure over ice and add a half scoop of chocolate whey powder and I don't think you can pack in many more digestible and nutritional calories into a delicious drink. He loves it.
