review/text: I felt that this product was a good alternative for nutrition on the go. It would be nice to eat a fast bar when you're rushing out the door rather than skip an entire meal. The taste was acceptable. It wasn't like eating a candy bar but it wasn't terrible either. I haven't tried other nutritional bars so I really don't have anything to compare these to. I did feel that this was an interesting product and it definitely has its place in today's fast-paced world.
