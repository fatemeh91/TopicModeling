review/text: This stuff was a total waste of money. It made my appliances streakier than they were before I used it. The best, cheapest solution for stainless appliances is this: dab a few drops of baby oil onto a soft cotton towel and polish the steel with that. The thin coat of oil takes away every streak and leaves it shiny and more resistant to fingerprints and stains. I can't believe how well it works!
