review/text: I have a friend who works for a doctor/nutritionist in CA. She checks out all the vitamins and only prescribes the ones she feels are &#34;pure.&#34; This is he general vitamin she chose. It smells like a vitamin when you take it, but it doesn't repeat. Recently, I had a blood test, and my Bs were actually a little high--and I am in my late 50s. Bs are so important to brain function, especially when we age. Taking these are so much easier than a weekly shot of B12, and they give all the Bs.
