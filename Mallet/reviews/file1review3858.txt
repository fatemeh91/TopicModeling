review/text: I agree with the last reviewer. These strips probably do work, but it's difficult to tell when they do not stay in place. Last night and this morning I tried to do my normal activities for the 30 minutes that they strips were supposed to stay adhered to my teeth, and by the time I took them off, they were misplaced on my teeth. I will be returning mine and trying other Crest strips, as I have read how there are more effective / adhesive ones to use.
