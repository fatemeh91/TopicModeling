review/text: This product is great! I have arthritis in my spine and hips and haven't been able to put on a pair of socks (without assistance) for a few years. With a little practice, this product is easy to use. It is, however, difficult to use with compression stockings so I wouldn't advise purchasing it solely for that use.
