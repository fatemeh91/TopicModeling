review/text: I'm not sure about all of the "claims" which are made about Propolis, Royal Jelly, and Bee Pollen, but this product tastes great. I'm not giving it five stars, because I think it's a bit overpriced. I take it in hopes that it will help me through the allergy season in South Carolina. So far, no complaints.
