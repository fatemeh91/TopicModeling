review/text: I'm a receptionist so I work in front of the computer most of the day. I also study online so I'm exposing my eyes to a screen 90% of my time. I started to notice red lines in my eyes and how I constantly felt like I had to rub them. I looked for ways to alleviate the situation with eye drops but my condition persisted. I also drink most nights, some table wine or just while socializing, so I thought maybe it was the drinking. I did not drink for six weeks straight and the red lines remained!!! I became self conscious and started to look for a remedy. I found these capsules and I thought, why not? So I got these babies, popped them, and WOW! Within two days my eyes were visibly whiter! The red lines were diminishing and then.... I LOST THE PILLS! (hahahaha!) I have no idea where they went? But after looking for them for more than three days, I decided the results were worth a second purchase. I've gone without them for about a week and the dryness is coming back =( Far as I can tell these pills DO WORK! So if you suffer from dry, itchy, red eyes, these pills are your fix!
