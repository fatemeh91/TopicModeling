review/text: My husband and I have used the original all one multivitamin in the past, but recently switched to this one to get the added benefits of the green phyto base. It is an excellent multi vitamin, we really do feel better when we take it. The green phyto base allows us to not have to add a variety of expensive green powders, thus saving us a bit of money.The only reason I gave this a four star rating is because even in a smoothie with lots of fruit the taste of the phyto base can come through and may be unappealing to some people. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product :)
