review/text: Used a blade all my life, so I thought I would try an electric shaver in hopes of saving time in the mornings. Looked at the top of the line Panasonic, Norelco, and Braun. After much deliberating and review reading, I went with the Braun.The 8585 is mechanically very nice and the base/cleaning system works very well.This said, after 2.5 weeks of use with the shaver (the recommended 'break-in time'), I feel that results are spotty. Generally it takes some effort and time to get a truly even looking cut. Even at it's best, the appearance is generally that of a second day cut with a Mach 3.I haven't returned this yet, but I'm seriously considering it. $165.00 + the cleaner cartridges is very expensive for a device that doesn't provide an all-together great shave every time.
