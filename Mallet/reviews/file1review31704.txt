review/text: I liked the Fa bath gel, so when I saw that they had deodorant, I thought it was worth trying. My current brand works well, but I get a little tired of the scent. I had no idea how Caribbean Lemon compared with the Fa bath gel I was remembering, but it seemed like the closest one. As it turned out, I think it may be the same scent, and regardless, the deodorant has a fresh, refreshing scent, kind of lemony with a hint of pine. It has the usual antiperspirant ingredient (aluminum chlorohydrate), which makes it an effective deodorant and antiperspirant (which also helps if you are stung by a bee - just rub it on liberally).
