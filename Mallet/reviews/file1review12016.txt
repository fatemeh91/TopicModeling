review/text: I bought this prenatal when I ran out of my Trader Joe's bottle and couldn't order it online. I figured out that it was pretty much the same formulation. This one is great! It has a series of natural ingredients that make the vitamin gentle on your stomach, as I have never had any nausea as a result. It's also super convenient that you only need to take one per day. I take mine in the evenings after dinner and I have had no problems.
