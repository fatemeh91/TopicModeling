review/text: I have had gastric bypass and I have tried a lot of protein mixes and this one is the best every once I found this one I haven't had to try another one again. This one dissolves and isn't chalky. It tastes like choc milk. I use only non fat milk cause it does make your milk thicker and that's ok for me. I used to have this 3 times a day but now I only need it for breakfast and it is feeling and satisfying until I have my first break at work. And now that I found it on Amazon it mails out to me and I don't have to worry the store is going to be out any more and it was cheaper then in the store. Yea for me! And it has very low sugar and high protein. Try it you might like it.
