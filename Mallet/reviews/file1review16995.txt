review/text: Product lives up to my expectations. I have a full beard and use the product to trim it at setting "3" (slightly longer than stubble). Excellent quality, especially given the price. The construction is solid and does not feel flimsy or fragile. The adjustable head has flexible "teeth" which look like it could break easily if handled roughly. But this is hardly an issue for its intended use. Very good battery life. I like the fact that the cutting blades are hinged and can be lifted and cleaned from underneath, no special tools required. Highly recommend.Update: Had to remove 1 star for the charger. I had to travel recently to a country where the outlet voltage is 220 volts, and realized that the charger is rated for only 110 volt AC input. This forced me to carry a (rather heavy) step down voltage adapter while traveling.
