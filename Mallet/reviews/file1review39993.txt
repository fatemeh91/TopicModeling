review/text: Well the Kleenex ColdCare tissues came at the right time. I have a very bad cold and have always used another brand of tissues. But I really like this brand now and will buy these from now on. They were very soft on my nose -- no Rudolph nose from them -- and they're very strong tissues. I've told all my family to start buying these tissues too.
