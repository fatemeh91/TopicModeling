review/text: Don't be fooled by the picture. This is the black tube currently used. I tried to find this at the local supply shop but they only carry the oils. I guess even they want you to buy new clippers instead of prolonging the life.I bought this for Wahl lithium trimmer so I could clean properly. Works like a charm.
