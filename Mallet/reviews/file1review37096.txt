review/text: I hate flossing, and this little device is very good. It is easy to use (yes, pressing and holding that button is a pain but you'll get use to it), and it fits nicely between my tight teeth.BUT, and this is one big but, I have go through at least 6-8 of them in the last year. It somehow stops working after about 1 or 2 months. I use to think it's the moisture as it may not be totally waterproof. But now, with the latest one, I just think it's a bad design. Still, I am hostage to this device as this is the only flosser that I would use.I am experimenting with other ones... Hopefully the Reach is at least as good and more durable.
