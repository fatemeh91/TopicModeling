review/text: If you are like me, and do not have the greatest teeth, then this product is for you! It is easy on mygums. My teeth are cleaned thoroughly without having to scrub. Just use the toothbrush gently. Since I have been using this brand, I have not had any problems at the dentist in over 15 years. Thanks to Amazon, I discovered that this toothbrush even existed. My own dentist had been giving me a different brand, so I told him about this brand.
