review/text: I injured my knee a year ago and was looking for a knee support for jogging. I jogged the first time without a support and my knee was sore and felt kinda weird for a day or so. I bought this knee support and wore it while jogging and my knee feels great!!! I would highly recommend this knee support for anyone who is looking to jog, etc.!!Jeff
