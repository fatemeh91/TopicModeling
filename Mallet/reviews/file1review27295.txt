review/text: Okay, I will admit that the only other whey protein I've had is muscle milk, which I guess is a whey/soy blend. The two flavors of muscle milk I tried were disgusting. That is why I love 100%Whey by Optimum Nutrition. Not only does it have some great nutrients and a lot of protein for the price, but it is also a pleasure to drink. I like to put it in my shaker with some crushed ice and it comes out tasting chocolaty, delicious, and refreshing after a hard workout.I have been doing the P90X workout program, and I started using this whey protein to supplement my diet. I drink it before and after workouts (if you're on a budget, just drink it after your workouts as that is when it is most effective). I went away on vacation and didn't take any whey powder, and I noticed I was more sore after workouts and became fatigued more easily. I can honestly say that I am currently in the best shape of my life right now. My flab has been shrinking and my muscles have been swelling and I have this fine product partly to thank for my success.The only complaint I have ever had about this stuff is that when I ordered my last 5lb tub the scoop was buried deep inside the powder. Since I had just finished my last tub I still had that scoop to use, but if someone was ordering this for the first time, they would have had to fish it out somehow. Aside from this minor inconvenience, this product is the best bang for your buck I have found on the internet and makes a great compliment to your exercise regimen.
