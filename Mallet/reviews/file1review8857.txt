review/text: I bought this because of all the great reviews. And, I wanted to add it to my fruit smoothies with protein to get some added nutritional benefit. I will continue to use it, but I've not noticed any zip in energy. In fact sitting her now at 4pm I feel very tired. And I'm having some type of stomach cramp on the right side. I had my smoothy with Vibrance at 8am this morning and have not felt energized all day.I will still use it for the health benefits. If you mix it with protein powder, berries and some coconut oil, you don't notice the bad taste.
