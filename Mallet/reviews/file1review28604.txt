review/text: This is some of the best protein you can buy. It can be expensive, but when it does go on sale try to snatch up as much as you can. Good sales on this don't come around too often, maybe twice a year. The mixability is perfect in a shaker cup, and the taste is good. I find you need to use less water than it says to. I only use 4 ounces and it mixes and tastes fine. The quality is higher than most and has less contaminants than most other brands. You can never go wrong with Optimum Nutrition.
