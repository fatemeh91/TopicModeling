review/text: I used Slim Fast a while back after having my daughter and had gained a little too much weight. I am doing it a second time to get rid of the holiday pounds and get my butt into gear. The first time I used it, I loved it, the first week takes will power, but it does work. I drink a shake for breakfast, then have one for lunch along with a green apple and a small portioned, healthy meal for dinner. The first time I did this, I lost 90 pounds in less than 6 months. Of course if you add exercise program into it the weight falls off faster, but even if you dont exercise you lose the weight. I dont have that much to lose this time, but I went back to what I knew would work and would work fast. I highly recommend this product. Hope this helps.
