review/text: This was one of my better purchases online. The ottaman is light weight but can easily support one person sitting on it. The cover matterial is nice and soft. The massaging feature gets old in about 3 minutes. I don't find myself using the massage feater hardly ever but the ottoman is certainly worth the money.
