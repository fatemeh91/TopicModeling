review/text: The taste was very good, not too orangy. (I especially like the Ginger Ale even though I'm not normally a ginger ale fan). To me, all the Celsius drinks are the best of both worlds, you get a great tasting, high energy, calorie burning carbonated drink, without the feeling of being bloated. I've lost 40 lbs this year and Celsius helped in the process. The price on Amazon was great, the shipping was fast and the product was well packed. I'll buy again!
