review/text: We have problem water that changes composition every few months (which makes it difficult to get an adequate treatment system). It's currently full of iron and our dishwasher looked terrible and wasn't cleaning anymore. I ran Dishwasher Magic through it and was AMAZED. Seriously amazed! It was hugely improved after 1 use, and after 3 consecutive uses, was almost pristine again. This will definitely be on our regular maintenance list on a monthly basis.
