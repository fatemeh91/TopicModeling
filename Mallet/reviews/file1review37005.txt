review/text: Of course no condom feels better, but this is about as close as I have gotten to the feeling of not having anything on. My wife seems to like it as well because I last a little longer yet not too long like what tends to happen with other condoms. Yes, I think the deed can last too long at times. When you are going at it for longer than 20 minutes and one doesn't even feel like he is on the edge, you know you have a problem. Thanks to these babies, those days are over! Highly recommend, and I recommend the seller (I bought from them before). The only complaint I get from my wife is that we don't "do it" enough. :) Sorry honey, but I do have to work and make a living. :)
