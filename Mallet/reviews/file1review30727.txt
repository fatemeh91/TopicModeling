review/text: I really enjoy this razor and wrote a full review, complete with day by day descriptions, on my blog. You can read the full account here:http://ducksaway.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/safety-razor/Here are my main thoughts if you don't want to read the whole thing:-There is definitely a one to two week learning curve so plan appropriately. It also takes about a week for your face to get used to the new razor so be prepared for some healthy razor burn at first.-The razor is very good, but I think some of the reviewers may be overly influenced by their desire to believe the razor is better than it really is. You can get a very good shave but it won't be the greatest shave in the history of man. If you have a thick and dark beard like me you may be initially disappointed after you realize you are still unable to get every single hair. When using this razor (or any razor for that matter) it's important to recognize the limits you can achieve, otherwise you'll find yourself taking far more passes than would be advisable, especially when the razor burn kicks in. In the end, it's only a razor and there is only so much you can accomplish in terms of shaving.-Using soap is great and probably the best part of the process. It feels very good on your skin and is far preferable to canned shaving cream.Overall, I am very satisfied with this razor and the associated products but it's important to be realistic and objective in your assessment when deciding whether or not a safety razor is for you.
