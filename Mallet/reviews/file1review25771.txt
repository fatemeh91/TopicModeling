review/text: I purchased this product and it just doesn't work. There are few things more frustrating that placing a whirring cutting device into your nose and ears, and then waiting for it to do its job, trying every angle, all to no effect. I think the device's little blade is too far down the safety nozzle for it to do anything useful for me. Your clipeage may vary.
