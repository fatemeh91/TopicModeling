review/text: The neck collar is convenient for the back of the neck but it chokes me when I velcro it the right way. This product should fasten off the front of the throat. I hook it incorrectly to make it work. I also do not feel it gets very cold. I have read that heat/ice items do not get very cold.Sandy
