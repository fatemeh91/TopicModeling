review/text: Some of the liquid Echinaceas taste really bad and some of the pills are large or you have to take a lot of them.This brand works great for us. Our kids love the taste, as do we.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was for the amount it's a little pricey and the dosing is tricky... I think it says it in drops which is a pain to count out. Once I figured out where that amount was on the dropper line it was a lot easier.Great Product!
