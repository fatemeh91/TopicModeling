review/text: when this arrived in the mail,there was no charge at all.I charged for 8 hours,and then did not touch it for over two weeks.when my beard needed trimming,i reached for my Remington and after over 10 minutes straight,the charge was still good and strong.fits well in your hand.well worth the price.
