review/text: I got this brush to clean my nalgene and my REI thermos (specifically the 15oz Flip-Top Vacuum Tumbler). The REI thermos has a weird little lip right before the opening that's hard to get at, and this brush does beautifully. It's also long enough for my standard nalgene, and long enough for my mom's nalgene that has the narrow mouth. It also made cleaning my food jar thermos easier, although I could wash that with a washcloth if I really tried before.It just feels like a quality product, I've had it for a little less than a year, and it's held up quite well so far.It is important to note that it's too big for standard pop/water bottles and thus does not work for platypus water bottles, but I wasn't really expecting that when I bought it.
