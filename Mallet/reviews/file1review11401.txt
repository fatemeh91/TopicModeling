review/text: Had one of the $500 grinding guards... always felt like a tennis racquet in my mouth.Bought both the Plackers and the Sleep Right guards to compare.Sleep Right is adjustable, but abraids my cheek.Plackers can be worn on top or bottom arcade, whichever works better.Plackers is meant to be worn only 3 times, but I've been using mine for a month, and it's working great!Definitely recommend the Plackers over the Sleep Right.
