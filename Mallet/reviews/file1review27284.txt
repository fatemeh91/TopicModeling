review/text: I have tried several other brands of protein powder, and by far, this is the best brand I have used! It mixes very easy, it has MANY flavors to choose from, and the vanilla flavor(s) mix very well with fruit, etc. It has a great mix of many of the vitamins, and nutrients that you have to take with "other" brand protein powders.All this, and add to it the low Amazon price + subscribe and save feature, and you have near perfection! I am currently buying the 10lb vanilla ice cream flavor, and paying slightly more than if I were to buy the 5lb tub at GNC stores.
