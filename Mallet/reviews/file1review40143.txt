review/text: This is an excellent combo kit. If you are a beginner, you are likely to feel the need of the yoga block and the belt. if you are a pro, then you already know the value of the block and belt.The mat is good, no need to spend money on expensive mats, rather donate if you have extra cash, as this will work just fine.
