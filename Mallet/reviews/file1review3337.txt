review/text: I have been using this throughout the years & my cholesterol was fine, but I had stopped for a while. Then not too long ago my cholesterol was extremely high & the Dr. wanted to put me on some prescription meds. So I started an excersize program, changed my eating habits & added this to my diet again for maintenance. So far so good, no meds.
