review/text: Lavilin cream is amazing. I have been trying different products for years in order to control foot odor and wetness. This is the first product I've ever found that really works. My socks used to be soaked at the end of a work day - no more. It's simple to use. I noticed the difference from the first time I applied the cream. I immediately bought more and sent some to my son. I only wish I had heard of this cream years ago.
