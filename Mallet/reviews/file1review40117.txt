review/text: Update 1/18/12: I have to drop my rating on this product - the sticky mat is more like a slippery mat... I tested it out at home during one session after soaking it and it was fine at the time. Maybe it was because I was on thin carpet. Unfortunately the same didn't go for when I took it to a studio with hard wood floors. The grip was terrible. I wasn't able to get one good adho mukha savasana or chatarangadandasana in it at all! I ended up with sore wrists the next day from trying to keep steady during the dog. I would not recommend this product after all!I was pleasantly surprised when I received this kit I bought for my mother. It has all the basic elements needed and the quality is fantastic for the price. The mat is nice and sticky which helps avoid slipping and at the same time is not too sticky to where your skin gets caught when trying to maneuver. It didn't have an icky smell that some mats have brand new. The blocks are a decent size. A little on the small size for my taste. For a beginner I think larger blocks in width, length and depth are better for grip and balance. The strap is a little short for me as well, as I prefer it longer especially for harness/partner use and balance moves with the grip in the back - but it is functional and better than a belt or rope. Haven't had to use the bag but have to agree with previous reviews that there won't be much use out of it before it falls apart at the seams from minor use. It's not so much the quality of the work (stitching) but the material itself that appears to be cheap. Those issues are my personal preference and I consider myself an intermediate yogini. Overall the package is a great starter gift and I would definitely consider purchasing again in the future as a gift for a friend or beginner.
