review/text: Compared the Barbasol and Gillette Edge in spray cans, and L'Occitane and Proraso in tubes this is my favorite shaving cream. Mild lavender scent in the unscented is really nice. It has a smooth consistency and a little dab lathers up so the tub will last a very long time. I like it so much I want to try the aftershave lotion too. It doesn't dry out my skin like L'Occitane does
