review/text: I adore Method's pink grapefruit all purpose cleaner and their tub and tile cleaner, so I tried this. Horrible mistake - left streaks all over my fridge, and I'm returning it. Get their other stuff; baking soda and hot water followed by a rinse is fine for nontoxic stainless cleaning and doesn't leave streaks.
