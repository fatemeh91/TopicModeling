review/text: Older and sick folks are the ones who take pills and they are the ones who are likely hard of hearing. This product beeps a quiet beep and or warning once a minute for three minutes only. Then the banner comes across the screen stating missed dose. One has to look close to even pay attention to the display. We need a flashing light (bathrooms are dark all night) or alarm that continually sounds off until we reset it. Even the Chinglish is bad. Instead of "take your pills" it displays "take your pilled". Folks very lives depend upon their dosage and they cannot afford to gamble on Timex's shoddy product.
