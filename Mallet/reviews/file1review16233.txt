review/text: Although there is a fair selection to choose from, I was a little disappointed that, about 20 condoms had an expiration date in mid 2010. By comparison, the others had expiration dates from 2012 to 2014. I have a favorite and I don't remember exactly why I purchased a variety pack at the time. Other than the issue I had, this is a decent product at a reasonable price.
