review/text: I bought this item to replace what appeared to be an identical one that my 91 year old father had been using for about four years. Within a week, the terry portion began to unravel causing him no end of trouble. Now, I have to hit the medical supply stores to find one that will hold up for the few more years he has left. I don't buy many things from Amazon that are not quality. This was an exception.
