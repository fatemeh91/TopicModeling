review/text: I bought this for my wife, who was in awful pain during her pregnancy. The baby was sitting low and touching a nerve.This product enabled my wife's only complaint to be the fatigue that comes with wearing the support all day. It eliminated her baby discomfort.It was a very positive purchase for her and for the guy who loves her!
