review/text: I have tried quite a few whey protein's but this one is by far the best. I have the double rich chocolate and it is awesome there is usually no clumps and usually i dont even use a shaker i will just by a bottle of milk like the 16 0z. from the gas station and drop it in there, of course after you drink a little bit of the milk so the mix will fit in the bottle. The best part is that is just one small scoop not a huge shovel you have to put in the liquid. good product cheap and easy.
