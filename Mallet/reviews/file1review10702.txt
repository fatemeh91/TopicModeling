review/text: Well, it got here nice and fast. I looked at it and could figure it out with one look. I only take meds 3 times a day, so I had an empty compartment. So, I just threw in a jelly bean and now I feel complete.I guess if I was a pot smoker I would not need one, as it seems when you need to light up, there is always a ton of friends near by who smoke as well. I tried to get everyone who uses Preparation H together so that we could all use it at the same time. Ya, no takers..That is all,Gary
