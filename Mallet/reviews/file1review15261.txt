review/text: I have to agree with "R.Katz" They are incredibly chalky and cardboard like. They also have a strong dark chocolate taste. I don't particularly enjoy dark chocolate; those that do might enjoy these. The bars I received were well within their expiration date.(10 months to go) OK but certainly not the best Balance Bar flavor.
