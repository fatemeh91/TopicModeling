review/text: I received this in the mail so fast I was really surprised when it arrived. It's a great sugar substitute although I'm actually using it in a homemade toothpaste recipe. It tastes great, I love it. You shouldn't hesitate to try it. It tastes SO much better than a lot of other sugar substitutes you will be amazed! I would highly recommend this product.
