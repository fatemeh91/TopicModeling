review/text: We have an elongated toilet and this is our 3rd potty seat. This has been the only one that hasn't slid around, fallen into the toilet, or made my little one scared to sit on it. When it came I put it on and showed her that it didn't move. She was so excited she took her diaper off and sat right on it!!Update on this great potty seat:We've had this potty seat for about a month now and my little girl is LOVING it! We purchased the (Kid-Friendly Stash 'n Step Stool Natural) to go along with this, which makes it possible for her to sit on the potty all by herself. She now goes on the potty every day now! I wish I knew about this potty seat before I purchased the other two!! I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone!
