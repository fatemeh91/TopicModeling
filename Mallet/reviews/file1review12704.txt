review/text: These are just what I needed for my varicose veins and swollen feet/ankles. I can understand how some would have trouble getting them on but following the directions included should make it fairly easy. I've had practice, so it was simple for me. These really feel wonderful on my legs...better than other brands I have had in the past. I hope the great support will last through many washings.
