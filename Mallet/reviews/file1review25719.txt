review/text: ...and I have the pain threshold of the princess from the princess and the pea story, these devices should be designed with me in mind.When brand new this thing worked like gangbusters, however the razor sharp blades dulled quickly leaving me crying like a baby.Perhaps if the hair that sprouts from your nose is fine this tool will suffice, I'm still searching for the groomer that will be gentle to me yet viciously mow down stray hairs.
