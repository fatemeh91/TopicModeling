review/text: I have a problem with the skin on the corner of my thumb cracking. This is very painful. Zim's crack creme is wonderful for this problem and makes the healing process very quickly. If I could remember to use it on a regular basis, it would probably not happen again. I had a hard time finding it again locally so I ordered it from Amazon. Great product!
