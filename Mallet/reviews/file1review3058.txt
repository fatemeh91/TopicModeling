review/text: From a woman's point of view FOR WOMEN who may experience similar...hope it helpsThis is coming from someone that was accustomed to using no condoms at all and orgasmed almost everytime and going to having to use condoms and rarely reaching orgasm.These condoms are by far the best I've tried! It's the next best thing to wearing nothing. Prior to these I've used Durex Seni Thins and I hated that I could feel the cold laxtex rather than the warmth of my partner. It was having an effect on me remaining arroused. I can count the times I've orgasmed using condoms, which were few. With these I could definitely feel my partner's warmth instead of cold latex so I could focus on the moment and not on the cold. Whether you produce ALOT of natural lubrication or not, I would say to STILL have a bottle of lube nearby because these condoms are NOT very lubricated at all (that's the only reason it got a 4 star instead of a 5 star). I can now say that when I used these condoms, I have orgasmed because of their thinness!! I WILL DEFINITELY KEEP USING THESE!!!Also if you have damagingly rough sex then yes it may tear or start to come off (it's a condom - not a magic condom, the rules of physics still apply). In my experience it has not broken so far. I had a partner that was rough and we ran out of lube so the friction started to pull it off but that was the only time that happened.PROS: wickedly thin (porn stars use these), insanely affordable (you get a BANG for your buck - hahaha), did I mention I couldn't feel it?CONS: not well lubricated (easily fixed by having a bottle of lube on standby)AT LEAST BUY IT ONCE, THEN YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF. :)
