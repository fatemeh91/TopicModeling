review/text: On the basis that I'm magnesium deficient i thought I would try these. This is the first magnesium supplementation I have tried so I can't compare to other forms. When I have trouble falling asleep, having bowel movements(tight bowels/constipation), or feeling more anxious these provide some relief within an hour or so. I typically take 3 at a time and find that I can poop the next day and I can turn my brain off easier at night.Unfortunately they work so good that I ran out and now I am getting my magnesium from food sources. If you absolutely need magnesium now, then these work great. I would suggest eating foods like almonds and dark leafy greens for your magnesium, however, because it really does work better over the long term and magnesium is not the only important nutrient of course.
