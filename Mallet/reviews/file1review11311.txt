review/text: I bought Yeast-Cleanse in a health food store while on vacation and began using it right away. I did think it was strange that there was tea tree oil in it, but it seemed to work pretty well (at least while I was taking it) and I figured it was probably not enough tto to be toxic, because, otherwise Solaray wouldn't sell it, right? Back home I go to Amazon to see if I can buy it online and find mixed reviews, as you are. Hmmm. After a little research I find this from the University of Western Australia Tea Tree Oil Research Group:[...]It says:" Myth: TTO can be taken orally.TTO is toxic if ingested in large enough quantities. Apart from data gleaned from the few cases of poisoning that have been reported in the medical and scientific literature, there are no oral toxicity data for TTO and humans so we do not know if, or how much TTO can be ingested safely. In the absence of data clearly showing that something is safe to ingest, the convention in medicine is to recommend that it not be ingested. Since there are no such data for TTO it cannot be recommended. The TTO contained in oral products such as toothpastes and mouthwashes is not considered problematic since it is expelled from the mouth and not swallowed.Special consideration needs to be given to the use of TTO during pregnancy and breast-feeding. There are no data showing that topical application of TTO is safe during these times and as above, in the absence of data showing that something is safe to use, it is generally not recommended."So, I'm going to discontinue use, even though I experienced no negative side effects. But that's just me.
