review/text: I love the Biotene products. The Oralbalance for dry mouth works very well. Due to the medications I must take every day, I have extreme dry mouth. I have not found any product that works as well. I also like Biotene's Mouthwash and toothpaste. My condition was so severe, the skin came off the bottom of my tongue. My oral surgeon recommended Biotene and I've been doing much better.
