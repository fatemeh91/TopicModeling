review/text: I ordered this because I really like lavender. I have many other lavender cleaners, oil, candles, etc. However, this product IS NOT LAVENDER. When I checked the ingredients, fragrance was listed before lavender oil. I could smell the product even before opening the package (it came in a box). When I did open the box, WOW. The smell was very overpowering. Well, I decided to give it a try anyway. But, sorry to say, when I took it into the bathroom, I couldn't imagine opening the container in such a small area. I guess others like this smell. But, for those who enjoy a natural lavender smell, do not buy this. That being said, I suffer migraines and cannot tolerate many odors that most people do not have a problem with. So, maybe for most this odor will not be a problem. Just be forewarned, THIS IS NOT A NATURAL LAVENDER SMELL.
