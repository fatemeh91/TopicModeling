review/text: I have used it daily for a few weeks now following the advice on the book "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition" by Clair Davies (Author), Amber Davies (Author), David G. Simons (Foreword. And it definitely works. The book mentions the Thera Cane, and although I haven't used it, the extra curve in the BodyBackBuddy provides with two different kind of knobs (one round, one pointy) to provide different level of muscle penetration, also it allows ingenious ways to find leverage to apply pressure without tiring the hands.I would rate it excellent but I had to use sandpaper to finish the product as it had some rough edges on the knobs.
