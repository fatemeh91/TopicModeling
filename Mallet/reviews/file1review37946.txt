review/text: I am only 26 with venous insufficiency and have to find compression stockings that don't make me feel like I am wearing grandma stockings. White and tan stockings feel like they are obviously compression stockings to me, I wish that they made these in cute colors or maybe argyle :) but I like them in black and don't think that anyone has ever realized that I am wearing compression stockings. If they fit properly they are VERY hard to put on but that is kinda the point. They have a very comfortable heel and toe box for my women's size 11 feet. They stay up on their own but maybe once a day have to be adjusted to avoid pinching at the ankle. I have several pairs of these in black along with a few other brands but after almost 2 years these are the only ones that have no rips or tears and the elastic is just as strong as it was new. I wash them in the washing machine on a normal cycle with the rest of my clothes but let them air dry and they dry very quickly. When I am on my feet all day wearing these I never have any pain in my legs and would recommend Jobst to any of my patients. (I am also a Registered Nurse.)
