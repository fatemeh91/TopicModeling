review/text: These drops are the greatest thing! When my baby first started having gas (when switching from breast to bottle) we went out and bought the most expensive drops thinking we were doing the right thing. While they did work, my husband soon decided to try little tummies since they were so much cheaper. Not only were they convinent because they were non staining and the other brand was, but they also saved us alot of money! Not to mention my son LOVES the taste, and doesn't mind taking it at all! Now we have a happier baby and a fuller wallet!
