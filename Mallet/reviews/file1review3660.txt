review/text: Both the powder and the capsules work great for constipation. I had battled with constipation for most of my adult life (I'm currently 57)until about 3 years ago when I heard a doctor on the radio recommend Magnesium Citrate to a caller and I haven't had any issues since. I take one 200mg capsule in the morning which usually keeps me regular. If I do have a bout (usually due to travel) I will take a teaspoon of the powder mixed with a sugar-free drink mix (country time lemonade) and by morning I'm back on track. Be careful tho and don't mix more than "one" teaspoon as you'll be running to the bathroom with little warning. In addition to keeping you regular Magnesium Citrate has many other health benefits, which I researched prior to ordering. Make sure to visit with your doctor before taking any supplement.
