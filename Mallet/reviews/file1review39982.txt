review/text: After finding out that I have 70%, of the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism...and doing a little research, I decided to try this herbal supplement. I am a nurse, so the thought of taking synthroid was not a good option for me. It has been only a few days, and I feel a tremendous difference! My fatigue isn't as severe, and I noticed a slight change in my appearance, including the fact that the swelling in my thryoids have decreased, any water retention is decreasing, and I am a little bit more calm, I have even lost a pound! I can't wait to see what improvements, I will see next? lolThanks!
