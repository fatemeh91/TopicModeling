review/text: This product mixes poorly, remaining gritty even after vigorous shaking. This grit will quickly settle to the bottom requiring more shaking. Furthermore it caused an unpleasant sharp sensation in the back of my throat. Worst of all, from day one it caused copious amounts of extreamly sulphurous flatulence and some loose stool. By day four it had become diarrhea. I cannot recommend this product.
