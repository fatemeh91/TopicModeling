review/text: There really isn't anything bad to say about the quality of ON protein. They are ranked one of the best for a reason. As for the 10lber, I must admit, Double Rich Chocolate does get boring after a while. But then again, I'm not into chocolate all that much. It was the only one I could get a good deal on. But if you like chocolate, this is good.As for Amazon, I must commend them for their super fast ridiculous shipping. I ordered this on 9/14 late afternoon PST and it arrived early in the morning on 9/16. This is with the free super saver shipping. I was expecting it to come the very next week but it came so fast! Keep it up Amazon!
