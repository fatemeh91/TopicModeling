review/text: I gave this product 3 stars because although it does what it advertises, Oxypowder is really nothing but an overpriced laxative you could buy at your local drugstore.Tried this out and did the 7 day cleanse per the directions. It definitely did what it advertised. Wasn't horrible to where I had to run to the bathroom all day, but I definitely went a lot more than usual, and I DID feel better afterwards.However... all it really consists of is magnesium oxide. You can buy magnesium oxide pills at a vitamin shop for WAY less the price... and at least for me, it has the same affect. Magnesium citrate does as well.
