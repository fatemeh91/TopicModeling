review/text: A friend told us about this wonderful time saver. I added a little glass bowl next to the faucet so I could keep the bristles down (eliminates having to rotate it every time you pick it up). A storm related power surge took out the dishwasher last Winter, and since using this I never felt the need to replace the dishwasher. It's much easier to wash the dishes in small batches instead of loading up the dishwasher. You just press the top when you need more suds. The reservoir holds enough dish soap that you don't have to refill it very often.I don't use this as a "scrubbing" brush. I use it to clean normal dishes. It does an excellent job of distributing soap and whisking away food particles. A scrubbing pad is better suited for baked-on problems.The best part is we don't have to worry about power outages disrupting our dish washing anymore.
