review/text: I bought this for my daughter who is suffering with malabsorption. She gains weight on this formula but due to loads of corn syrup solids (refined sugar), her temperament was very poor and her eczema was also exacerbated on this formula. I find it shocking that so many infant formulas on the market contain such awful ingredients.
