review/text: The Right Guard Sport Aerosol did an excellent job in preventing perspiration and odor. It had been a long time since I used a spray, and I found it to be as good as, or even better than the brands I use now. Unlike solids, there was little residue on my clothing, which is a plus. The only negative was the scent, which was a bit strong for me, causing me to sneeze a few times. However, I have allergies and sneeze often. This product would be a good choice for almost everyone, particularly men who may like the sport scent.
