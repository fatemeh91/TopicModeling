review/text: I bought this to get some relaxation around my neck. Basically, I'm a spinal cord injured person. First few days I used it with pillow without batteries in bed to stop snoring. It helped me have good sleep. Then I used it with batteries and discovered that it vibrated too much. Again, it doesn't stay put around the neck for vibration. It's noisy and you cannot hear TV sound..........
