review/text: I recently bought this product along with the tea because I have read so many good reviews. I got off the pill over a year ago and did not have my period for 8 months, then got it every 60 days with acupuncture. Then in July was my last period and I have not gotten my period yet, and it is over 83 days. I was just daignosed with PCOS. I started taking this about 2 weeks ago, but nothing yet... The tea is realy tasty and the pill has given me no side effects. My husband and are are TTC, but my priority right now is to have regular cycles. I am praying that the pills and tea works soon! I have had cramps for the past week, so we will see! I will give it 6 months and keep praying! I will update with more details soon.
