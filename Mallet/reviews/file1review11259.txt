review/text: These cough drops are really a first-rate product. They are made in Switzerland and the ingredient list doesn't include artificial ingredients, though they do have natural food-coloring added. In fact, they are made mostly of Swiss-grown herbs with a bit of sugar added for taste.During allergy season here in pollen-filled North Carolina, these drops do wonders for soothing my family's sore throats and keeping coughs at bay.However, these drops do have a pretty strong menthol/herbal taste to them that has taken some getting used to. If you really dislike things that have a strong menthol taste to them, you may want to try Ricola's honey lemon cough drops. The honey lemon drops have the same good quality ingredients in them, but have less menthol and taste more like candy.
