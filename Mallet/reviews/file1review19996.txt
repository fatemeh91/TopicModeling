review/text: We purchased this product about three weeks ago, from Wal-Mart. Tonight, when bathing out month old infant, she managed to stick her finger into the hinge on the head side folding side. It took about two minutes to free here, and the end result was some skin breakage, and swell.In general we like Safety 1st products, but now on we will double think purchasing their products.
