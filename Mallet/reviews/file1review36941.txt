review/text: I had a dental appointment the same week I received this product for Test Driving, so I took it along to show my hygienist and unfortunately was advised not to use it due to my teeth spacing which is too tight for the Glide Dental tape to access. However, I used the regular Glide Dental Floss with great success and no problems. I'd recommend it to people who have a wider gap between their teeth though, as it seems to get more of the plaque out.
