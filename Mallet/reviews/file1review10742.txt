review/text: This medication box is perfect for me to help prepare my mom's medication for a week at a time. It's very clear for her to use without mistakes and helps her be more independent. The assisted living facility causes $450. a month if they are to dispense mom's medication. I can fill these boxes in less than an hour and save the family lots of money to lengthen her stay at the facility. One of the "girls" at mom's table saw it and asked where she could find one. I bought her one for her 90th birthday and she and her family love it and use it for her daily meds as well. Great product. Large enough to hold quite a bit of medication and vitamins too.
