review/text: This is a wonderful trimmer. While it is a little light weight and hums a little too loud, this trimmer is perfect. Allows you to trim at a good lenght - setting 10 - and anywhere in between. Easy to operate and clean. Couldn't be happier and like saving money from it's competition. Excellent product!
