review/text: These are the best tweezers you can buy on the consumer market. No questions asked. They are ridiculously precise and sharp to a point where you can easily hurt yourself. Every other pair of tweezers will go right in the trash after you use these. The Tweezerman company seems to believe in their product as they offer lifetime sharpening and repair. Be careful not to drop these though...The steel tip is very brittle and will crack easily. The warranty does not cover dropping, but they do come with a rubber cover for the tip. If you keep them clean and off the floor they should last a very long time.
