review/text: This heating pad is supposed to provide moisture by your back sweating. Kind of a silly premise which I wasn't aware of when I bought it, and it doesn't work anyway. The heating pad gets so hot so quickly that you can't leave it on long enough to sweat. The result is no moist heat...just heat. As a safety feature you have to hold the control on at all times. OK I guess, but it's a pain. The pad is large enough to cover your whole back which is nice.
