review/text: I am uncircumcised which means I'm a little extra sensitive. This is the first lubricate I've found that actually feels good without the foreskin. I actually ask my wife to use her hands more...much more intense than with the foreskin! We're going to run out of the 8.9 ounce pretty quick so I'll be ordering again soon.
