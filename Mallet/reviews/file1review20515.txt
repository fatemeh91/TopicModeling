review/text: This is a soft bristle broom definitely for indoor use. I attempted to use this outside for heavier sweeping but because the wiskbroom feature screws onto the handle it spins when sweeping if not screwed on tightly. I bought this broom to replace an excellent one I bought several years ago but can't find it's manufacturer. The broom I'm trying to replace has a positive snap on wiskbroom, will not spin when sweeping and strong bristles.
