review/text: I am 29 years old, and my husband and I have been trying for about the past 10 months to conceive, and we both took FertilAid in April, and now I am about 7 weeks along :o) Excellent product, did not mess with my cycle (which is regular) or have any side effects other than achieving pregnancy!! I highly recommend this product to women who want to get off of the TTC rollercoaster and see quick results.
