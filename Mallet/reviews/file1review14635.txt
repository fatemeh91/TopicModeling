review/text: The much touted health benefits of xylitol made me buy this product. It is a huge amount of sugar in a very fine, powdery form.I deduct one star for the misleading label which makes everyone think it is a protein powder. It should be marketed as a healthy, organic product rather than something which looks like a genetically engineered "get-big-quick" supplement.
