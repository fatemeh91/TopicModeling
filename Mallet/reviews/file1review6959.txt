review/text: This clipper set seems to work very well for what I need it to do. I use it to keep my head shaved and I wanted something that would work better than what you can get at wal-mart, which is what I was using. It shaves very close and has an adjustable lever to change the closeness. I have cut myself once using it, operator error. The only gripe I would have is that it is very loud and heats up pretty quickly.
