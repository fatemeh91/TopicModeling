review/text: This product is the best online purchase I've ever made, and one of the best all around. Granted, I have fine hair to begin with, but I also have extremely sensitive skin. Shaving has always left my skin irritated and I get knicked very easily. There is very little redness or bumps with the Braun 3370, and I'll never have to worry about cutting myself again. After just a few weeks, my hair is already growing back less frequently, and my thighs have never been this smooth from shaving. The pain is negligible and doesn't take much getting used too. I was surprised by just how satisfied I ended up being.
