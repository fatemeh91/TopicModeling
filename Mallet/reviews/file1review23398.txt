review/text: My whole cardiopulmonary unit tried this stethoscope and it was worse than the disposable ones we use for precaution rooms. We have a shortage of stethoscopes, so people barrow. I can't give this one away. My Littman Cardiology STC turned up and we are all happy again. I tried, I really wanted to believe something this cheap could do all everyone claimed.
