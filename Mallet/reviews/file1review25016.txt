review/text: They're LIFESAVERS, by golly, so everybody KNOWS they taste good already. Here are a few of the finer points. These are sugar free, so people worried about sugar for any of a number of health reasons need not worry about these. They are also individually wrapped. Big deal, you say, so what? Well, you can toss a few in your pocket on the way out to lunch, which is great because they don't give out fancy breath mints at the burger and chili joint drive through. This feature also means that you don't have to throw the tape dispensor at coworkers who thoughtlessly plunge their grubby unwashed hands into your candy supply, should you choose to keep some at the office. They ARE more expensive than those that do NOT come individually wrapped, however, buying by the case helps defray the cost, and it's worth the small added expense for the convenience and to spare the lives of your office mates.
