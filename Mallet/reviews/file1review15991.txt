review/text: The AlcoMate Prestige is the best product for the money. Cheaper units require recalibration. More expensive units are not necessary for individual use.All drinkers should have a method for measuring of their blood-alcohol levels. The AlcoMate Prestige is easy to use, small enough to travel in a purse or glove box, and accurate. You wouldn't want to drive a car without a speedometer. Sure, you might be able to reasonably guess your speed, based on other cars on the road and other factors. The police will measure your speed using a digital meter. So of course, you expect to equip your car with a similar device to know if you are legal or if you are breaking the law.The ramifications of driving while under the influence of alcohol are far greater than the ramifications of speeding.If you drink alcohol and drive, don't go without this important gauge.
