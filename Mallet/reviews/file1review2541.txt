review/text: I bought this epilator three years ago because I was tired of plucking my underarm hairs with a pair of tweezers. I prefer plucking over shaving because the results last longer and I did not get ingrown hairs like I did when shaving. I still have this epilator and it still works fantastically. For first time epilators it does hurt and this is coming from someone who has been manually plucking her underarm hairs since she was 17. It takes a few uses to get used to many hairs being plucked simultaneously-roughly 4 times. It has two settings, but I only use it on the first one and it works marvelously. It plucks nearly every hair out. I say nearly because I'll have one or two the tweezer heads don't catch. Still, you have to admit that is fantastic. I only epilate once a week and over time the hairs have gotten thinner and reduced in number. I tried it on my legs once, and yes it was painful. I haven't used this on my legs since that last time only because most of the hair doesn't grow back anymore.If you are looking to buy an epilator, I would get this one. Sadly Amazon doesn't carry it at the moment. If you find it elsewhere though, do get it. I love this little machine.
