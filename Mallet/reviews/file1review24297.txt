review/text: I spent $500 on "custom orthotics" from a specialty foot shop. These are basically the exact same thing at a fraction of the cost. They really do relieve foot pain and I couldn't be without them. They do take a couple of weeks to get used to while the tendons and ligaments in your feet adjust to them. But it is well worth it for the miles and miles of pain free walking you can do afterwards. I recommend that you buy shoes with removable insoles and then you can place these orthotics under them. My personal favorite shoe for walking or running is Saucony Grid Cohesion running shoe/sneaker. These shoes have a shock absorbant injection molded midsole and a removable cushioned insole over top of that which is perfect for placing the WalkFit Orthotic under. I have spoken to marathon runners who say there is no more comfortable shoe to walk or run in than this. I whole heartedly agree. My job requires me to be on my feet walking all day and this shoe/orthotic combination has worked wonders for me.
