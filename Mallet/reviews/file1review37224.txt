review/text: bought these gloves 6 days ago and have been using them at night only. they'rea little sticky on the outside to use during the day, but using them at night haslet me sleep and really decreased the swelling in my knuckles. 66 yr old with osteoathritis in both hands. I'm really amazed at how well these work.
