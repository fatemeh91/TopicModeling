review/text: Bought this walker for my ailing mother who is in assisted living. Many others in her community use the same type of walker and they tag them with colorful ribbons or personalization to be able to identify them. They are very popular. Love the one with the enclosed seat so that personal belongings can remain private and not seen by others.
