review/text: When I ordered this product I was a little nervous. Since I'm not a hair stylist, I was afraid that while I had done my research, I had somehow managed to pick the wrong clippers. Turns out there was no reason to be worried. I cut my husband's hair and what usually takes a good hour, took all of 15-20 minutes. I was amazed at how great they worked. I was able to go straight to a #2 guard instead of my usual #3 and then #2.I highly recommend these clippers. They're definitely a great buy for the money.
