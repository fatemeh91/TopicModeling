review/text: This is not the first time I've purchased Met-RX meal replacement powder, and it will not be the last. I have yet to find a meal replacement that tastes better (I use 2% milk, personally) or that fills me up better. I can easily make it several hours on a single packet and not get hungry. I find these especially useful on busy mornings where I know work is going to keep me running all day long and lunch is a "maybe" instead of a sure thing.Would highly recommend to anyone that is looking for a good meal replacement or for an easy way to add some additional nutrition in their diet.
