review/text: I just wanted to point out that I've now tried every flavor with only water, ranging from the merely ok (Strawberry Banana), to pretty darn good (Chocolate Caramel Toffee). However, my last three orders have been identical. I have discovered the best flavor by far which is...Drum roll please...CHOCOLATE BANANA!But wait, there is no chocolate banana! That's right, I now order two containers of Banana Cream, and one of Double Rich Chocolate, to make my 2:1 Banana:Chocolate shakes. I encourage everyone to try it, it's beyond delicious, even with just water.
