review/text: This is the only vitamin I can honestly say has done for me what the bottle said it would.I started using this to help with breakouts. Shortly after taking it my acne went away, now I only breakout once a month and it disappears shortly afterward. My hair and nails also grow noticeably faster(as one reviewer has stated, that is unfortunately ALL of your hair lol).Recently I ran out and didn't purchase any right away, big mistake. I broke out in three places shortly afterward and my skin has been horribly dry. A testament to the product :)
