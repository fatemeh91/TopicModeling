review/text: I used ultimate crib sheets with my son since his birth and searched for a replacement product once he got older and was sleeping in a big bed. We are blessed in that on most days, he sleeps 12 hours overnight. However, I don't think his bladder is quite up to that challenge, even with the help of a diaper and overnight pull-up. But this sheet protector works great for keeping the sheets dry. I was concerned that the sheet protector might not stay in place on the bed, but it has worked great in that regard also. I highly recommend it.
