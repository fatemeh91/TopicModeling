review/text: I've never left a review for anything but I felt like I needed to for this. I've had a bad breakout of ringworm on both of my legs for the past few years. I've tried every cream and spray but nothing seemed to phase it. After about 2 weeks of using this soap every day, my infection cleared up almost entirely. I really couldn't believe it. This product has been a real life saver.
