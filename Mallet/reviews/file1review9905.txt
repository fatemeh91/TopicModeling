review/text: Excellent for removing ingrown hairs. You have to be mindful of where you grab the hair though. If you grab too high, the hair will break. So, I learned to adjust my grip and grab the hair using the wider part of the tweezer and it works out fine. Because the point is so sharp, you have to be careful not to jab yourself or you will be a good bit of bleeding so I found out the hard way. I definately recommend them to anyone who has problems with ingrown hairs.
