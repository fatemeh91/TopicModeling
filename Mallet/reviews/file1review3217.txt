review/text: How can anyone tell you what you will like? I can just tell this is the second one my wife has bought. The first lasted for about 7 years. The motor still worked, the wires going into the battery case finally broke. If you like the idea of a rotating shaft and a very powerful vibrator, this may be the one. My wife has had/has other rabbits and they don't get used.
