review/text: This unit, the "Standard Mini-Wright Peak Flow Meter", arrived from the U.K. over one week ahead of the scheduledarrival date. It looks like the one my allergist uses to test patients at the office. I tried the meter, andit was within 6 points of my last test at the Dr.'s. office. I can now track my asthma condition without theusual office visit. The unit is well worth the price to me, (and reasonably priced) ! I usually find any productthat has the term "medical" associated with it, is very expensive. When I saw the price of this, I had to haveone.
