review/text: We used this as part of a behavior program that recommended supplements. When we added it, the changes were phenomenal. His rages were fewer in frequency and not as bad. He was able to handle things in life and started understanding social things that he didn't "get" before. He became nicer. It didn't cure autism or anything, but it did improve life by a good 40%, and I'll take that any day of the week!
