review/text: I took natures bounty hair skin and nails for two years it worked great until I noticed a huge growth on my skin and it was very infected it was not cancerous I went to the doctor and he send me to a surgeon and five different doctors had told me that it was a chemical in the vitamin to preserve it that caused the growth I had surgery. a year later I tried it one more time just to make sure after two months I had the same growth and infection this time I went to a specialist and he told me the same thing that it was from this vitamin. This vitamin works fast but it is very dangerous over the counter vitamin. If it is not prescribed by your doctor don't take it
