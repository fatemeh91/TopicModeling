review/text: I have tried quite a few natural deodorants and this is the best so far. I loved the smell of the citrus version but this one works much better. It takes awhile to get used to using a spray and I always use 2 or 3 sprays per arm. It lasts all day and I don't feel stinky except on a really bad day. I keep the small bottle with me in case I feel the need to reapply. It's definitly worth trying. I wasn't sure about it until I used up about half the small bottle. If you give it a chance it might work for you too. Great price and quick delivery from this seller, will use again.
