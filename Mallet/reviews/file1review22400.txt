review/text: I really like these covers. I have 2 of them, although I could probably use a third as they are easy to get dirty (as is anything on a changing table). Mine fit perfectly on the Simmons pad they are meant for and feel soft and nice, even after repeated washings. I am very pleased with this product, it makes the changing pad much more attractive than just the plain white pad.
