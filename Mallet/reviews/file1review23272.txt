review/text: This inexpensive little sweeper is wonderful! I hate dragging out my vacuum hose but I like to keep up with the dog hair and crumbs. This sweeper does the trick. There's no cord, there's no noise to wake the baby and it's small enough to get in the corners where hair collects. I still have to drag out the vacuum at least once a week. But, a quick swipe over the floors and carpets with this keeps the place clean and tidy and it's amazing how much hair and dirt I shake out of it. I love this!
