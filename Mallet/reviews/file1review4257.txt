review/text: Cartridges for most razors are pretty darn expensive. I've been using the Fusion for a long time and am still happy with it and the cartridges that are made for them. I'm really pleased with the cost of this 8-pack!The blades last long, and the trimmer on the opposite said does a decent job... a nice added feature.Hope this helps.
