review/text: I started wearing around 16w with triplets. It feels like it's hugging your belly and giving enough support to be comfortable. After reading some of the reviews about the size, I ordered a size larger and that was a mistake. I used safety pins to sinch the sides to make it actually fit. The over the shoulder supports were nice but definetely visible in all of my clothes! I ended up wrapping them under my bra.
