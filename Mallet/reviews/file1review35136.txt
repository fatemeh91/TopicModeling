review/text: I bought these, at first, thinking they would be useful in the car, and in my purse. But then I find these are to be used for CPR manaquins. Even at that, I found them difficult to use in a class with the manquins. I didn't think they were worth the money. The one-way valve resuscitator masks are much better and safer.
