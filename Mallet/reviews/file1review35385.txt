review/text: My husband can no longer drive. We have a car that has a built in grab bar on the passenger side. We recently purchased a second car without a grab bar. There was no way to install one in the new car. This item combined with the Medical Supply Swivel Seat makes getting in and out of a car so much easier for my husband who is a senior citizen and suffers from extreme osteoarthritis. We highly recommend both items especially for anyone with health problems.
