review/text: I bought this toothbrush and the battery "died" within the warranty period. I took it to the designated repair facility where the toothbrush sat for FIVE WEEKS waiting for repair. After calling Braun, I was told that the toothbrush battery replacement must be "stuck" in U.S. Customs. It was very frustrating to get the "run around" from Braun. After calling, Braun agreed to send me a refund by check, which arrived yesterday. Of course, the cost of the toothbrush in the meantime has increased. I believe the product is a good product, however, consider yourself warned in case your battery dies, too.
