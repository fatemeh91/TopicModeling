review/text: It's got the power of five,five blades that is!!! The Gillette Fusion is a great manual blade razor(the battery Power version is also great!),it's a bit costly,but you can find them on sale at a nice price if you look!!! I got a thick beard,and even with that a blade will last me over a week before going dull,and these great blades don't cut and nick my face up,just a nice accurate clean smooth shave!!! A truly great man's razor!!! Recommended!!! A+
