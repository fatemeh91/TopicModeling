review/text: I too spent my hard earned money on this stuff beleiving all Dr Jordan Rubin said, and ended up with worse digestiveproblems like I have never had before in all my 50 years!The bloating and gas were so horrible it caused me to miss work!Does the term "Swamp gas" conjure up what I am talking about?so so horrible.Maybe it doesnt do that to everyone, but this was how it affected me andat first I just couldn't beleive it was this product. But when I discontinued, it stopped. Then Ithought maybe I should try just one more pill and sure enough! PAIN! GAG! HORROR!DO NOT buy this stuff!!If you do, don't say I didn't warn you!!I now take bifidis and lactobaccillus and all is well!
