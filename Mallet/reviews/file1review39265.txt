review/text: Have been using one of these for years without a problem. Used to pay up to $25.00 for a generic haircut, not to mention the hassle of finding a barber shop that was open when I had time for a cut. Now, my wife cuts my hair at home, any time of the day or night, in 10 or 15 minutes, and it turns out great every time. We do the simple No. 3 guard, same length all over, and I'm very happy with it. Having said all this, the home haircuts were initially a little more of a hassle due to the hair trimmings making a mess until we discovered the essential accessory: the Wahl vacuum cleaner attachment for the trimmer. Now, we don't use a cape or even a sheet on the floor. The vacuum attachment, in conjunction with your vacuum cleaner (we use an Oreck XL), sucks up all the hair as it is cut and there's not a speck on your clothing, floor, or carpet. Things in life are generally imperfect, but I can't think of a single bad thing to say about this product. It will save you thousands of dollars and weeks of wasted time before it wears out and after about seven years of problem-free use I'm not sure when that will be.
