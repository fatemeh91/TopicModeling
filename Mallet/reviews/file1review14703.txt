review/text: Length:: 1:42 Mins*****This is a video review of the Juno Pelvic Exerciser. In my video I try to be as specific as possible without being explicit; I wanted this video to be helpful. I want to emphasize (although I mention it in the video) that if you are deciding which Berman pelvic exerciser to purchase, the Isis is a beginning exerciser; an advantage I saw in getting the Juno instead is that it is graduated so that it can be used as your muscles strengthen---as both a beginning and an advanced exerciser, which appealed to me.Thank you for watching.UPDATE: Please see comments for probable correction (according to Dr. Berman) as to the BEST way of using this exerciser, even better than the video!*****
