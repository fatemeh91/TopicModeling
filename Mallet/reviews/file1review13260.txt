review/text: I looked everywhere locally and online for a generously sized waterproof sheet protector but couldn't find what I needed. Size was the big issue - either too small or too big (full bed size). This product was exactly what I needed. It didn't leak, washed and dried well, stayed in place on the bed and wasn't "noisy" or uncomfortable for sleeping. I don't know if the price was good or not, but it seemed reasonable to me for what turned out to be a very satisfactory product.
