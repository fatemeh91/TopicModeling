review/text: My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters. These toe sleeves did not work for me. They slipped off the toe, they were not comfortable. After trying it for about a week I threw them out.I found a better solution that works for me. I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formula - .45 ozto put between my toes. They now glide against it each other rather than rub, and I don't have any blisters.This saved me a lot of pain, I wish I knew of it earlier. I hope this solution will help someone else with a similar problem.Ali Julia review
