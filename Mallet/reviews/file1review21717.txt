review/text: I ordered this snug-tub from BabiesRUs and just got it today and I used for the first time and I Love it! My 7 month old son had out grown his infant tub and I need to get him something else and I really didn't want to get him one of those swivel seats so I got him this. I would highly recommed this for babies who can sit up well on their own. It's so much fun! My son enjoyed playing with his little bath toys and splashing around in it. You can also lean your baby back and rise the shampoo out of the baby's hair. It's so easy to use, comfortable for babies, and cheep!
