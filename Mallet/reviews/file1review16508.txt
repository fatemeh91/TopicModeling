review/text: I'm about 3 weeks into taking a Stacker with breakfast each morning and the boost is great. I'm not taking it as a fat-burner twice a day so I can't speak to those claims. My wife has a low tolerance for products like this and even she's taking it regularly with no jitters or discomfort.
