review/text: This flavor really impressed me because I don't normally like nuts in my foods. I like that Clif Bars doesn't make their product overly sweet and leaving you with the feeling that your teeth are probably rotting as you chew. I often eat this bar with an apple or banana at breakfast or lunch and have plenty of energy for hours. It really fills you up, but not that bloated full that you get after having a burger with fries.
