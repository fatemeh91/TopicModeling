review/text: *** My Revised Review:(1 star) CAN I STILL RETURN THIS ITEM PLEASE? (Today is Feb 13, but my return policy was ended on Feb 10, only 3 days ago).The hot pack is not working anymore, after I put in microwave, when I got it our there was a HUGE bubble of air or something inside it, and it was scary. I let it cool down and the bubble is gone, but the surface is not smooth as before. I would be appreciated if you let me return this item now.*** My first Review:(3 stars) I got this for my dry eyes. It keeps the heat very good, like for 5 minutes. but its not in direct contact with eyes, there is a little space. However, it is very tightly touching around my eyes, and kinda burning. I heated in microwave for 20 sec as instruction said.I like the idea of rubber band used in this product. Also keeps the heat long enough. But I dont recommend for DRY EYES.
