review/text: This lube is great for any purpose. My wife and I love it. What makes it perfect is it isn't sticky at all, in fact you could kind of compare it to lotion in the fact that it kind of just disopears on its own over time. It isn't a sticky mess like other lubes. But it is still very slippery and lasts a long time.
