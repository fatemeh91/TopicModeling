review/text: I just bought this for my 3 year old daughter who just went to "big girl panties". This is great for the occasional "oops" at night. Protects the sheets great and super easy to wash/dry, not a single leak. It covers almost the entire width of her twin mattress which is wonderful because she is an active sleeper. It doesn't bunch under her although she only weighs 35 pounds. It works so well that I'm getting another one as a backup!
