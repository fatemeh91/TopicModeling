review/text: When I purchased this I was not even in the weight range. I am now 5lbs into the weight range and it is too tight. The other issue is that I am petite and the straps on the side are too long. While it relieves some pressure off my lower back I feel more pain in my upper back. I don't like it and could not recommend it, especially if you are a petite person. Also you have to safety pin it to your bra so that it is not exposed out of your top. Besides wearing a regular round neck t-shirt there are no other tops/sweaters/blouses you can wear with the cradle unless you pin down the straps.
