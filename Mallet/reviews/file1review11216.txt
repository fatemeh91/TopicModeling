review/text: I am not a mother, but am a vet student and use this thermometer to get fast, accurate rectal temperatures on cats and dogs. I imagine that a mad cat and a baby would equally apprecaite this product. I have double checked the readings I get against the standard ones our hospital uses and the readings have been within 0.1 degrees; so I consider it pretty accurate.
