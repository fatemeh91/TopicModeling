review/text: I am all for using green products but this stuff does not do the job, I ran one load of dishes through twice, using hot water, there was food on the dishes and the glass pieces were cloudy. I emailed ECOS, they said I need to run vinegar through the dishwasher to change the PH, and then it will work but frankly that is just a little too much work. We also have hard water so maybe that is the issue The person from ECOS said that it works great for her with fine china, antique glass etc, but I guess I am just not willing to experiment, I just want clean dishes. Note, My appliance repair guy said to put a full glass of distilled vinegar upright in the dishwasher, after 10 or 15 times the deposits will go away and the glasses will not be cloudy. Don't put it in detergent dispenser, it will not work. Kind of off topic but thought I would mention it.
