review/text: Please do not confuse this product, as Amazon reviewers have done, with the Jason 6-in-1 Shaving Lotion; its not the same although the 8 oz bottle is similiar.. The Jason 6-in-1 Beard & Skin Therapy, After Shave, is a very pleasant after shave, natural and organic, alcohol-free, which soothes redness and irritation. The only problem is that its hard to locate and buy from many of the popular on-line retailers. It goes a long way since you can, as the bottle indicates, add a few drops of cold water before applying to the face. I highly recommend this product.
