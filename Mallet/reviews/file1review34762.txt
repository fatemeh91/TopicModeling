review/text: This is the first natural deodorant I have ever purchased and I am very pleased with it. I am very happy that thanks to Aubrey Organics I could get rid of the toxic anti-perspirants/deodorants I had been previously using. My greatest concern was with the aluminum that most of these products contain (just read the label) as an anti-perspirant agent. The Aubrey deodorant is made from all-natural ingredients. It does not stop your skin from perspiring (which is one of the skin's natural processes), it only neutralizes the odor. The smell is very pleasant and gentle, but if you are used to the artificial aromas of most deodorants, you will definitely notice a difference. If you engage in heavy physical activity I recommend re-applying the deodorant every 3-4 hours.Overall, I am pleased with this product, and the peace of mind that I now have knowing I am no longer putting aluminum on my skin is wonderful.
