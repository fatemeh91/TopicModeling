review/text: I ordered both this 10X (sold recently on the Bernard Jensen site, but they sold out) & the 5X (after reading the other review & seeing the 5X was pretty inexpensive).For iridology, if you need something inexpensive, go with the 5X. When you look at the iris, the light is pointed in the correct direction to give you a magnification of the entire iris under light.This 10X, however does not...it distorts it & is only good for looking up close at a small part of the iris...you will not be able to see the entire iris in one view, magnified & illuminated with this tool!If you need something inexpensive for iridology, skip the 10X & go with the 5X...you'll at least be able to see! But if you have the $$ get the $50 welch allyn pen light on amazon & purchase a separate lens with 8x mag.
