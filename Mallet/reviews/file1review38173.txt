review/text: I have tried many different brands of maxi pads, but Always pads are simply the best. Their invention, the &quot;dry-weave&quot; material, magically funnels moisture away from you. Always introduced &quot;wings&quot; which are now copied by other companies, calling them &quot;tabs&quot; or other names that are just as lame in function as in title.There are also channels in the pad to further facillitate moving moisture away from you.These &quot;overnight&quot; pads are longer, so you don't have to link two pads together while you're sleeping. They are simply the best.
