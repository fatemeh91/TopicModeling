review/text: I use this on our farm with the horses. It is a super affordable way to get the larger quantities of Psyllium into them without spending the ridiculous amounts of money for the same product with a picture of a horse on it. Works great to help push out the sand that may be accumulating in your animals stomachs causing all sorts of distress.
