review/text: These batteries are incredibly bad. I bought them for my Nikon Sb-800 speedlight. Since they are 2900 mAh, I thought I was going to get outstanding results. I did not.I've used Impact 2900 mAh, Enegizer 2500 mAh, and several other 2700 mAh AA batteries. Results were fine. But thses Power 2000 batteries died almost immediately. I couldn't believe it was the batteries because it was so quick. I thought my SB-800 went bad. But, I replaced the batteries and sure enough, all was well.Don't buy Power 2000 batteries. They are very bad.
