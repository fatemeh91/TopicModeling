review/text: I've used Met-Rx for years, which some people love and some can't stand- but I like it. I'm in Hong Kong for a little while now and haven't been able to find Met-Rx here. A guy at a local nutrition store recommended UniSyn instead. I was leary- there are so many bad nutritional products out there, both in quality and in taste. I had never heard of Unisyn before, but I gave it a try. I love it! I was quite surprised when I first tasted it (I've only tried Vanilla)- it definitely tastes better than Met-Rx (which I don't think is bad), and the fact that it has no Aspartame is great. I think I may have found my new MRP- as long as I can find it when I get back to NYC. Good to know Amazon has it! Why only 4 stars? No MRP is perfect yet, but this is probably the best I've tried. Plus I haven't used it long enough to get a feel for how "effective" it is as part of my fitness program. No reason so far to think it's not as high quality as they claim though.
