review/text: At 35 weeks pregnant, I had been experiencing pain in the pelvic and groin areas for several weeks, on and off. After searching online for ways to alleviate pain, I was initially turned off by the way the "cradle" looked, and thought, no, I'm not gonna want to wear that weird-looking device. Well, after a day or two of barely being able to walk around, I reconsidered.My pre-pregnancy pant size was 6-8, and weight 135 pounds. I'm 5'3'', and currently weigh 165 pounds. I ordered the medium size, and it fits well on the smallest hook setting. I have the shoulder straps shortened as much as possible. If you are much smaller or shorter than me, I would probably go with a size small. It's hard to tell from the picture, but the hooks for the belly strap on like a bra, and it's easier for me to attach them first, then pull the belly strap down under my belly.The prenatal cradle is comfortable, supportive, and I felt better within just minutes of putting it on. The shoulder straps will be visible with many of my tops, so I may not be wearing this when I go out, but like my crocs, I will be sporting this around the house for maximum comfort!
