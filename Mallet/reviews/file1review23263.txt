review/text: I have owned several Bissell sweepers over the years and this one is the best by far. The sweeping head is slightly smaller than my other sweepers but this is great as I can get into spots I previously could not. The two dust bins are easy to empty and hold quite a bit. The handle is longer than my last Bissell and being tall, I really appreciate the extra length. The handle comes in segments so if you don't want the length, just don't install the final link. I bought this sweeper for low pile carpet sweeping and it works great for dust, dirt and cat hairs. Thanks, Bissell!
