review/text: Our first waterpik jammed within the first week, and we opened it up and pushed the little gear back in place several times. It would work for a while an then jam again. After a while, it would only last a day or so between breaks, so we took it back for a replacement.The replacement lasted about two months befor it stated jamming too. As well as spraying out around the head and not holding the head.It is loud and bulky, but I have to laugh at the other commenter who tries to get the whole apparatus under the tap -- You can fill the reservoir seperately and place it on the base later.It does feel good to use, but I'm not sure I can put up with the dismal quality. Can anyone recommend a good competitor?
