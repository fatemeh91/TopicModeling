review/text: I purchased this product last year. I still have the same toothbrush and am very pleased with the Oral B Triumph. I use to use a traditional toothbrush and on occasion if I am really in a hurry I still will, but I use this product every day and I especially like the toothbrush heads that have the plastic gum massagers on them. I went to the store to buy replacement heads and I think this toothbrush must be a popular item because it seems like the stores run out of these replacement heads and have all the others in stock. I purchase just a brush replacement head and was not as impressed with it. So stock up on your refills when you find them. You can always find them online also. When I was shopping around for this product Amazon came through again and I got the best price through them.
