review/summary: Weird taste and texture review/text: I had been using Sprouts b12 drops and had been fine with them but decided to try these and it was a bigger bottle for less. The taste and texture are very different and hard to get used too. I have taken lots of homeopathic and other drops before and these are quite different. I will use them but will not buy again.
