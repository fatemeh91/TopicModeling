review/text: I was very skeptical, but decided to try it. I own a few sonic-care electric toothbrushes and have written reviews about them on Amazon. The ionic bristles are very soft so I had to monitor my brushing as I have a tendency to want to scrub my teeth. I used this toothbrush w/ Restore toothpaste which was also new to me. After using twice daily for several days I can definitely tell a major reduction of plaque particularly at the back of the 3 middle lower teeth where I've always had a sandpaper feel to my tongue except after dental cleaning. Also I have a slight space between my front teeth and the bristles gently clean there. Since I used 2 new products together that may be the reason I find it so effective.
