review/text: My husband has been a courier for the number 1 non-union delivery service for almost 15 yrs. He does heavy lifting each and every day. He seems to be on a regular regimen of ibuprofen and acetaminophen, which rarely works, and also is doing damage to his liver. One day after having pulled something in his upper back, we stopped at the drug store to get some icy hot, bengay etc....after being referred to Australian Dream Cream by another customer, I decided to get it instead, even though it was $30 compared to the common menthol rubs for $8. It said Empty Jar Guarantee, so I figured what the heck? I must say I'm so surprised that there aren't more good reviews of this product, because after one application and 10 minutes, he had already seen improvement. Now I must say that he needed another application in about 3 hours, but it really worked without oral medicine and burning back syndrome. I definately recommend this product!
