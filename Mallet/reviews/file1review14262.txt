review/text: Based on other reviews, perhaps some units work better than others, but for the first week, when mine worked, it smelled nice, and could have been doing its job (not like my shower was in bad shape). However, the first trouble was it would do its 12 seconds of beeping and then not spray. I would have to monkey with it to get it to work properly on several mornings. Then it stopped working all together. I discovered the residue built up in the battery case, making the contacts full of goo. Cleaning that off, it would work for a while, then go back to the other problem of beeping but not spraying.Coupled with the rate at which it goes through solution, and the amount of maintenance I've had to put into it, I'm throwing mine out today. Going to use the refills I purchased for cleaning the normal way.
