review/text: I can't explain how Oscillococcinum works, but it does. I'm a nurse and I don't usually use homeopathic products - because I can't explain them scientifically! - however, when the bird flu scare hit and was at it's worst, I stumbled upon a book about the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 (could be off a bit on the date) and how only 5% of people treated by homeopathic doctors died whereas well over 60% of others died. The book is called "The Homeopathic Treatment of Influenza " with "special bird flu edition" by Sandra J. Perko, Ph.D.,C.C.N. The book goes over what homeopathic remedies were used by homeopathic doctors with the patients who had the Spanish Flu - and also has a huge section where you can look for specific symptoms and then the homeopathic remedies that would help those symptoms. In any case, Oscillococcinum was one of the remedies that was used. I also buy another product - Hyland's Flu. It's for children but I use it for me. Between these two products - the Oscillococcinum and the Hyland's Flu - all of the remedies which the homeopathic doctors used for their Spanish Flu patients are included. I have been taking both for many years now - start taking at the first signs of a cold or when someone close to me starts getting sick - and I have been able to either not get sick or it only lasts a day or two and is much milder. Again, I don't know how they work but I am sold on both products.
