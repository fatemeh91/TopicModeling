review/text: Bought this item a few years ago when I was having hip pain. I drive long distances for work..sometimes up to 4 hours there and 4 hours back...This has been a godsend to raise my hips and take the pressure off my hip flexors. Plus, it's made my 10 year old Accord driver seat tolerable. Hubby and his bony butt finds the relief when he drives my car. A good price/value.
