review/text: Yesterday, per our doctors recommendation, I used the Nix one treatment product on my 2 kids, husband and self for what I was told was a very mild case of lice infestation. I read the directions several times and followed them to the letter. Used baby shampoo to wash everyone's hair, applied Nix to damp hair, rinsed Nix out after exactly 10 minutes, dried with clean towels, used individual nit combs and everyone put clean clothes on. We each wore clean shower caps after the treatment and spent hours washing and vacumming the house. This morning I showered and just wet my hair. Just before lunch I felt something move in my hair, I checked the kids and actually saw several ADULT lice. I think this stuff actually helped them multiply and mature! Completely disappointed with the Nix product, $60 for 3 family packs down the drain.We are in the process of trying the Nuvo technique -cetaphil dried on the hair for 8 hours to smother the lice. Crossing my fingers this will work and cleaning the house again...
