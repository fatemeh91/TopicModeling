review/text: My husband and I love this face mask so much that we bought two more for my parents. We use it every night before we go to bed and it's great! My mom borrowed mine when she had a migraine - about 30 seconds in the microwave and it was warm enough to provide her some relief. I also love that the masks are made in the US. I would highly recommend this product. Also, it's been my experience that the seller ships it out very quickly - even on the weekend! I always have received the product earlier than promised.
