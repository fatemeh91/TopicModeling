review/text: I just got this product in the mail and I'm not thrilled about the scent. I know the ingredients are all natural but it smells a bit like public bathroom disinfectant to me. I'm going to try to remedy this by adding some lavender essential oil to it but the smell of the product is pretty strong so I don't know if it will work. Still three stars because the product works fine in that it helps prevent and mask body odor.
