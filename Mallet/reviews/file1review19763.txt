review/text: This potty seat has absolutely no rough edges. It keeps my skinny 19-mo-old on the seat comfortably. It is made of smooth plastic with an adjustable wheel underneath that allows bottom paddles to extend outward to sit tightly against any toilet seat. It has no fabric, so it's easy to wash with soap and hot water in the tub if needed. It is definitely worth the $$ for a seat that will last through kids and grandkids. If anything, I wish they'd put handles on the side--to hold onto and to prop up books :-)
