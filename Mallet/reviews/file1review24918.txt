review/text: "Since reading all of these wonderful comments (some which are not so positive-guess when something is going great, there are a handful who have to shoot it down!)..but anyway, I ordered this product last night in high hopes of conceiving! My DH and I have been TTC for 5 years and nothing! We did a cycle of IVF last summer and no success. My DH and I both have problems and were told we couldn't get pregnant without fertilty. Hopefully, we are not kidding ourselves with trying this product!"
