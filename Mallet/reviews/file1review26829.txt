review/text: I'm a protein fiend. I love protein, especially whey, and have tried many different products. For the past year or so, I was quite happy with the whey protein sold at my local Meijer grocery store...then all of the sudden they changed the formula and it now tastes horrible, like there's soap in it.This led me to search for a new protein powder. So I searched Amazon to see what had the best reviews, and ordered Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, 5 Pound jar. Thanks to Amazon Prime (which I absolutely LOVE), I had the jar two days later.Let me say this, THIS IS THE BEST FRIGGIN PROTEIN POWDER I'VE EVER TASTED!!! Ridiculously good. Could not be more pleased. Thank you to the manufacturer for creating such an awesome product. It's easy to mix, has 25 grams of protein, only one gram of fat, and the taste is fantastic.
