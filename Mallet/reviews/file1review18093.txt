review/text: I read in many places travelers saying great things about this mask, but I haven't found anything special about it. The strap is uncomfortable, with stiff velcro sometimes scratching my ears and doesn't hold at all, the mask slips off or at least the straps wander around. It is not possible to sleep sideways without moving the mask, and eventually removing it.Iis not bad as it blocks light and is wearable, but feels just like a normal airplane give-away mask with better place for your eyes.I have yet to find a side sleep mask comfortable enough for everyday.
