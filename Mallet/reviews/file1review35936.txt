review/text: I heard about the Soladey type tooth brush in a recent book I read (topic was cancer prevention and health). The claims the author made intrigued me, and the idea behind the way it works seemed that it would be worth a try. I must say that I am fairly picky in regards to what toothbrushes I have used and even more about which toothpaste as well. I discontinue using any products that leave a film or leave my teeth not totally clean. The very first time I used it I was somewhat surprised to say the least at how smooth and clean my teeth felt from such a soft brush and no toothpaste. The fact that my teeth feel so clean and tend to stay with the clean feeling longer throughout the day (this part was not expected because in all the research I have done on the Soladey type toothbrush, I have not read this to be a benefit - but it has for me)is enough to have me here buying some for the whole family.
