review/text: No one else has said it; and I do so with hesitation but...this product is great for the occasional symptoms that result from a night of overindulgence. I take two of these a day regardless, but one morning, after a party, I discovered that it really helps get rid of hangovers (or at least makes them more tolerable). It replaces a lot of the good stuff that you lose when you drink alcohol (vitamins, electrolytes, etc.) I certainly don't suggest relying on it for this reason, and do not endorse binge drinking, but if you find yourself feeling groggy, achy, and sort of empty from having a bit too much of the wrong kind of fun this will help get you through the day.
