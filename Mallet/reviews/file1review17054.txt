review/text: I have used a Norelco for the past 8 years. The battery died and forced me to move on. Quickly, the Remington is better when it comes to grip, height adjustment and balance in the hand. It is the same for cutting and trimming. The grudge I have is the sharpness of the cutting edge leads. When you move it across your face they are sharp and irritating. No doubt in time, my skin will acclamate. But it is noticable. If the battery lasts, it will have been a solid replacement.
