review/text: I have never written a review before, but this product was fantastic. I have a plantar wart on the bottom of my foot that was about the size of a quarter. It was a complication from having my previous wart at the location burnt off...the blister popped and the wart spread to a larger area. Having it frozen off at the doctor's office was unbelievably painful, so I thought I would try this wart stick. In less than two weeks, my wart is completely gone. I am actually in disbelief how fast it worked, and for the first time in over two years, I'm excited to get a pedicure again!
