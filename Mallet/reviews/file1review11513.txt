review/text: I have purchased multiple sets of these batteries - they're Duracell - what could go wrong - right? WRONG. I have tried recharging these batteries in multiple chargers and they wont hold a charge for a quarter of the time any other brand of batteries I have do - including batteries I have had for over 5 years and have been recharged hundreds of times. I would not recommend.
