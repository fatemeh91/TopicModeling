review/text: I have never used a supplement that actually makes a noticeable change in my health except for this one. I take fish oil and they say its supposed to be the most amazing thing but nothing. I notice nothing. I take it anyway. When I stop taking it nothing changes. When I feel a cold coming on I am sure to take Garden of Life Perfect Food and the cold goes away. Also, talk about anti-inflammatory and slimming! I feel it in my joints, it takes away the puffiness and slims me down too. My skin and hair also improve. I try to take it everyday when I remember. It tastes like plain spinach and collard greens but all you have to do is drink it. Sure, a hamburger might taste better, but really, it's no big deal and I actually like it.All the negative comments about the taste. Have we become such slaves to our appetites that it's impossible to stand a minute or two of something slightly awkward in our mouths? Does everything have to be about taste? Is it me or is the media (and others) trying to convince us that we have no control of our appetites? I am tired of it. Fatness is a disease?? Really? Where was this disease in the 1970s? Hmmmm . . . Maybe it's just easier to say it's a disease as we pull up to the drive-thru window at a fast food joint. MUST. EAT. HAMBURGER. AND FRIES. No control. Billions of dollars at stake in the fast food industry so why not tell everyone they have no control over and over? Oy veh!
