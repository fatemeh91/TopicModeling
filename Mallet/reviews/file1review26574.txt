review/text: Along with theCorflex Medic-Air Seat Cushion 15 1/2" X 17 1/2", I purchased this lumbar support for a recent flight from Hawaii to the East Coast. Usually, by the time we hit Atlanta my tush is numb and my back is hurting. The Back Booster, however, proved to be well worth the cost. I was much more comfortable and will never travel again without either.I did not bother with the straps on the airplane seat, however I am using it on my office chair and the elastic straps keep it in place without any problem. So far, I've had no problems with any leakage. It rolls up easily and fits into its carrying bag without a struggle. A few breaths gives it enough volume without being too rigid, and is easily adjustable.Excellent value, terrific product. I would recommend this to anyone needed a lumbar support.
