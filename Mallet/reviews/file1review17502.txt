review/text: I keep a very short beard that I trim weekly. I purchased this trimmer to replace a Panasonic (ER224S) trimmer that I had been using for the last two years. The Panasonic was a great trimmer but was poorly manufactured with a major stress point being made out of very bad plastic. After having to glue the part together several times, it finally broke on both sides which no longer allowed the trim height to be adjusted. I have used this Remington trimmer several times now with excellent results. The trimmer is well designed, easy on the hand, holds a charge very well, and is easy to clean. The tines on the trimmer (the most fragile part on all these adjustable trimmers) are thin, but the part that allows height adjustment seems well made and I feel comfortable removing it to clean the unit. The blades are very sharp and have not pulled or tugged my beard at all. I feel that with normal care I will get more than my moneys worth out of this trimmer and will look at Remington products again in the future.
