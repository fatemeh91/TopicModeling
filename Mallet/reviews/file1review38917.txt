review/text: This is a very good disposable razor. I've been using another brand, but this one seems to shave much cleaner and with less nicks (actually no nicks). I would definitely recommend this razor to others, and I did give a couple to my son who really liked them too. He usually uses an electric razor, but said that he'd use these for really close shaves. I'll definitely be using this razor instead of the one I used before the Test Drive.
