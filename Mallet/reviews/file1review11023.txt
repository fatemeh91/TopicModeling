review/text: Despite other reviews...I have to say I love the flavor of this...and so do my children. They ASK me for it. This supplement helps get rid of diaper rash, skin rashes, bacteria in the body (which helps digestion, nausea and fatigue), cleanses the blood (so helps with about any illness), is a very gentle source of iron, and is safe to give children. I've had a couple of other brands and this one has been our favorite. It does stain green...it is chlorophyll after all. The liquid is more effective than the capsules and easier for children to swallow...so we put up with the green lips. It doesn't stain lips etc if you mix it with water.
