review/text: After starting this product I developed a bladder infection, in which I have never had one before and drink plenty of water in a day. I usually don't drink anything but water in fact. Also it says that there are no allergies to the patch, well I now have a rash in two spots on my back that have not gone away. I am not allergic to adhesives either. The patch also leaves a sticky square where the patch was. I have also gained about 3lbs since using this product!!!!!!! Better luck to who ever tries this, I am off to another product.
