review/text: i should admit that this product arrived about two weeks ago, and i have only just gotten up the courage to try it out... so, BIG wimp about pain, obviously.having never waxed or sugared my legs before, i was not prepared for the pain when i started this baby up... ouch. the hardest part was creating a starting patch, which i admit was quite painful for me. basically i had to put the device to the area around my ankle, let it burn for about a second, then pull it away, wait a few seconds more for the burn to fade, then try again. after a few passes i created a clear patch, and started inching it up my leg. when the pain bothered me, i just inched it back to the patch i had already cleared.the inchworm technique is working well for me so far, and the pain does get less and less as you go on. it basically feels like a little pin prick, which rapidly fades. the pain-reducing attachment really helps (the epillating head is basically a lot of tweezers rotating very quickly).my very dark leg hair follicles are visible through my very pale/translucent skin, which is why i bought this product in the first place. and after just a short period of use, i can see a difference. i'm very impressed! the pain IS bearable, though it may not seem so at first.my advice:1)Take a nice, hot bath, open up those pores, and exfoliate.2)USE the pain-reducing head.3)Hold the device at a 90 degree angle, as stated in the literature. DON'T press it down hard; just hold it gently and let the weight of the machine press itself into your leg.bottom line: i'm very glad i bought it, and i'm going to keep at it until i'm an epillating pro.
