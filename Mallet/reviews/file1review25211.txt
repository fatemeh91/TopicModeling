review/text: The batteries I purchased (2) are not genuine Sennheiser batteries. They only last about one hour on a charge. The original Sennheiser branded battery lasted for several hours, and several years. This is the first replacement battery that I have had to buy in fove or six years. I expected the replacement to be of equal quality to the original, but it is not. In fact, I expected the purchased batteries to be Sennheiser branded batteries, since the Amazon listing said they were! I think I got ripped off! -- @%#^%$*&
