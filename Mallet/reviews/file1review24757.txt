review/text: As with most German products, they are well thought out,expertly manufactured, with quality packaging. This didn't letme down. The scent is subtle but very pure. It lathers well ifused correctly. A brief rub over existing beard, followed by thebadger brush, hot water, produces an adequate, but not overwhelmingamount of lather. Sufficient. I recommend this, even to my son!
