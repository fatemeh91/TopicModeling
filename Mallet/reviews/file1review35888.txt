review/text: This stuff really works for my seasonal allergies.... To get the best benefit from Source Naturals Activated Quercetin, you MUST take it on an empty stomach as the directions suggests.... It has not upset my stomach whatsoever. I take it first thing in the morning with an 8-10 oz glass of filtered water... eat about 35-40 minutes later. I also often take it before I go to bed at least 2 hrs after eating anything. I no longer need to take over the counter allergy meds.
