review/text: This is a great product as far as 'style' goes, however it's not entirely gold standard, nor 100% whey.The Amazon page comments on how it is 'Packed with whey protein isolates'. This isn't the case, it's a combination of isolate and concentrate and has a total protein content of only 75%.I usually use an isolate with an over 90% protein content, I'm currently using a 95% isolate. It's not acceptable to me to have a 'gold standard' whey 'packed' with isolate that is as high in cholesterol, etc as this product.That said it mixes superbly and tastes great with milk or water, but I'm not using it again. I used it as I was in the USA on business, I will stick to my specialist retailer's product, which is pure isolate, lower in cholesterol and lower in carbs.It would be good if Amazon could mention that the serving size is a 32g scoop, it'd put the 24g of protein per serving into perspective.
