review/text: I got this balm on a whim one day when I was looking for something completely different, but I'm so glad I did. I remember reading one review stating that they apply this every night before bed and it gives their lips a more plumped and younger look and they don't have to apply anything for the rest of the next day. Well, I tried it this way and I definitely noticed a difference. I'm still quite young but my lips did look fuller which would probably be due to the fact that it holds moisture in so well and it coats your lips pretty solidly so you don't have to worry about it rubbing off instantly (or even in your sleep!). Unfortunately I still had to apply lip balm during the day but I also never drink enough water and get all the good oils in my diet that I should so I can't blame the lip balm for that, it's not a magical balm crafted by wizards. The only downside for this balm is that it doesn't instantly soak into your lips, aka; if your lips are already severely chapped it wont instantly relieve your dry skin. This should be considered as a preventive measure. It's a great one at that. As I said, it coats your lips very well and doesn't rub off easily like every other balm, it's almost like it's formula perfectly bonds with your lips to last for hours and hours. If you live in cold and/or dry climates I would strongly recommend this balm. As far as balms go that instantly sooth dried lips and impart moisture instantly I would recommend Smith's Lip Balm: Minted Rose. That balm is also amazing, but it can't last like this balm does.One other thing; this balm wears like the old fashioned balm. It's just a tiny bit waxy when first applied (but not uncomfortable at all) and it doesn't have a shine or gloss so any man can wear it as well. It has an orange-herbal smell to it that it isn't sickly sweet and the smell dissipates quickly.
