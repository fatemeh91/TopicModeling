review/text: Love it. It is almost perfect:1. With HEATER!!!! This is an incredible and necessary feature. It actually heats the water. I simply fill the foot spa with hot water from the shower and soak my feet for 30-60 minutes. It stays HOT!!! The heater turns off automatically every 30 minutes but I turn it on if I plan on keeping my feet longer.2. Rollers: don't do much for me! Even though this is the best foot spa I have encountered yet, this is an area where Brookstine should improve.3. Jets: love them equally much to the real heater. They are strong and work miracles on massaging tired swollen feet. I wish Brookstone adds jets to the side and back (additionally 4 more). Right now there are only 2 jets on the front
