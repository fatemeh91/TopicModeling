review/text: My husband and I were at our wits end with countless calls and terrible conduct marks from our 6 year old son's school. We were on the verge of trying Ritalin in an effort to suppress our son's impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Before going the medication route, a friend of mine recommended homoeopathic remedies. We decided to order the Bright Spark along with the Focus Formula. The first three weeks were usual with no changes. During the fourth and fifth week, my son's symptoms began to cease. Gradually, the phone calls and conduct reports minimized. I wouldn't call this product a miracle (he's not perfect), but it has definitely made a difference in our child's progress at school, without sacrificing his immense fun loving personality.FYI- We only give one dosage per day. Two Bright Spark pills before breakfast and 6 drops of focus formula after breakfast. This system seems to work for us, not sure what affect it may have on other children.Good Luck!!
