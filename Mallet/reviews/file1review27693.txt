review/text: I bought the Strawberry flavor and it tastes much better than I expected out of a protein powder. I take a scoop with a glass of milk after every workout. It goes down easy and keeps me full so I don't feel the need to eat other foods loaded with carbs or junk food. The protein is a plus too.
