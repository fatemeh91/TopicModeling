review/text: My mother-in-law bought this for my 5 year old son who wets the bed and I can't tell you how much I LOVE this product...well so much that I now own 4 of these pads! They are almost the size of a twin bed so it covers completely. It doesn't move around while my son is sleeping and he is a "mover". We stopped putting pull ups on him, so when he does pee, it's ALOT! This pad has NEVER leaked even a bit!!! I am so happy I found this item!
