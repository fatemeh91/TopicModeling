review/text: I purchased this item about 2 months ago. My boyfriend certainly enjoys the feeling of the toy, however, we have used it maybe 6 or 7 times and the edges around the opening on both ends is ripping apart. I found a few small pieces that broke off and were laying on the bed??? I would think the material would be more durable, so I am a little disappointed in the product!!!
