review/text: I tried this product about a month ago and I must say I'm actually pretty impressed. Admittedly, my expectations for this product weren't that high prior to using it, but I think they exceeded those expectations in the end.I knew I wouldn't get the same gleaming results as I would by getting my teeth whitened at the dentist office; anyone who has those kinds of expectations from a $25.00 grocery store item is setting themselves up for disappointment. However, the results I did get were a lot better than paying loads more to the dentist.Like the box says, I noticed results after the third day and by the end of the week my teeth were very noticeably whiter. I'm 27 years old though, so my teeth were just starting to get that yellow-ish tint to them. I'm sure someone older than my self with a life time of say, smoking, drinking coffee or tea, would probably want to get themselves two boxes. However, if you're like me, and just had a bit of a yellow tint to your teeth and want to brighten your smile a bit, this product will do the trick.As other reviewers have stated, after a few days of using the product your gums may become a bit sore. It's not unbearable and it goes away shortly after you take the strips off. I did notice my gums were a bit sore while brushing my teeth a few days after the last day of the strips, but hey, no pain, no gain. That little bit of pain was worth it to me to have a better smile. I feel a lot more confident when I smile now, that's for sure.
