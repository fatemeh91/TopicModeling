review/text: I have been drinking this product for over a year on and off. I really enjoy the benefits to drinking it. The time i haven't been drinking it is just the times when i run out and don't get more for a while. The taste is awful, probably one of the worst things i have ever had to drink. There is no sweetness in this product, although, I have gotten used to slamming it down. This is an awesome product for those of us who do not eat enough veggies. It taste AWFUL, but works AWESOME!! I have no intentions of stopping the use of this product due to the flavor and I would recommend it to anyone!
