review/text: I love the Oral B Sonic. I've been using it for at least 5 years. My only gripe is that it's difficult to find the replacement heads. Luckily,I found them at a great price at Amazon.com. The retail stores could never beat this value but since most stores no longer carry them, it's a moot point.
