review/text: I had high hopes for this...at first it was great...then, after about 10 minutes, it started to shift. It would not stay put. The middle part ends up at your neck...try to fix that discretely at work! It definitely shows under your clothes unless you are wearing a sweat shirt with a hood. I need to find something else...
