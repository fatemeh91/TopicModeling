review/text: I've been on DIM since the summer, and I have to tell you its awesome! I'm in my mid 20's but I've always had a problem with my menstrual cycle. Not anymore! DIM is excellent and any lady with menstrual issues should try THIS before they get on birth control. Obviously you should check yourself out with the doctor, but if the doctor says your only problem is imbalance hormones, then give it a go! Also, great price and fast shipping.
