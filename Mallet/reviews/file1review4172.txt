review/text: I don't know about those who say "only four uses"... I use one blade for two weeks (14 uses)...Anyway, I like the smoothness of the cut of this blade. It's really nice. My only complaint is that the blade is so fat (wide) that it's hard to get those tricky places, like your moustache under your nose.Great product, and I do agree, that once you are a "Gillette man" you are always a Gillette man. :)
