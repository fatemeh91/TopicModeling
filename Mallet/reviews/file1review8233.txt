review/text: This is the first decent bottle brush I have found that fits through the neck of the narrow mouth Nalgene bottles. It's nice and soft, too, so I feel safe using it on my nice wine glasses. This brush was so hard to find so I was excited to find it here. Oxo better not ever discontinue this brush or I'll sue!!
