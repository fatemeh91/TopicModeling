review/text: Biokleen glass cleaner is fantastic! I was not sure what to expect since I typically just use vinegar water. However, I needed something to clean my stainless steel refrigerator. There is minimal to no smell (which is really important to me) and does not affect my daughter's asthma. I am so incredibly pleased and will continue to purchase this for my glass windows and stainless appliances. Please give it a shot.
