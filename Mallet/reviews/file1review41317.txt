review/text: I used this tape to wrap the arches of my feet for Tough Mudder. I needed something that would last for at least 3 hours in thick mud and a great amount of water/swimming. Despite all of the grit that got in my shoes, this tape did not unravel throughout my entire race. I highly recommend this tape, especially if you are used to just using regular Mueller athletic tape!
