review/text: Are you kidding? For the price these are great! Just because some people are inept with the use of their hands doesn't mean that the trays don't work. Read the title "D.I.Y." That means that you are responsible for the fit of the trays - No, a dentist won't show up at your house, they won't fit right out of the package. You have to make them fit. What ever it takes.I fitted mine several times before they were what I wanted. The instructions don't explicitly say that you can re-heat them and re-fit them but you can. I compared them to trays that my wife paid for from her dentist ~ $150 a piece! That's $300 for both. These are far better than the whitening strips - They do what they say; they hold the gel on your teeth. Stop whining. If you want "better" trays be prepared to pay.
