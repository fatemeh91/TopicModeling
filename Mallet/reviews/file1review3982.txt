review/text: Last year I received a free Fusion handle and blade in the mail from Gillette. Tried it and got the smoothest shave I've ever had. I immediately decided to switch from an older system that I had been using for years.That sample Fusion blade lasted about 3 months (I kid you not) and I do have a heavy beard. Wow, I thought. These blades are expensive, but if I didn't have to change them as often, it would actually cost less than I was paying for the Sensor refills. The great shaves I got from the Fusion really sold me on the product.I purchased my first 4 pack locally and replaced the sample blade after it finally wore out. What the heck? After about a week the replacement blade was dull. I went through the 4 pack in about a month and bought a second pack at another retailer. Same thing. One week=1 blade.Gillette must really think we're stupid. Give the suckers a free sample that's great and make them pay for crummy blades after they've committed to the system. Never again, Gillette.....I just ordered a Braun cordless from Amazon so you can just go pick someones else's pocket.Edited: Any suckers our there still letting Gillette rip them off? Yeah, I guess so since they're still in business. The Braun electric I mention above has recently been relegated to backup status to my Merkur double edge razor. Yep, one of those things like my dad used and that I learned to shave with. Blades cost about 7 cents each in bulk and last about a week. Let's see...that a penny a shave for the blades plus a few cents worth of TOBS shave cream. Give it a try and tell Gillette what they can do with the Fusion.
