review/text: This is a really good razor! This is the third electric shaver I have had, and this one is the best! The shaving portion works well, especially for those with facial hair that grows in different directions. Also, the trimmer works very well to keep sideburns clean and neat. Easy to clean, and can be rinsed under faucet. While there are three attachments, they are not small so they can be lost and not too large as to be bulky. Overall a wonderful deal!
