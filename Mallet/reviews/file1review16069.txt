review/text: I have been using CALM and CALM with Calcium for 2 months now. Because of my asthma, I am on many medications and often steroids. I had huge issues with foot and hand cramps as well as a constantly bouncing knee. I could not sleep for longer than 4 hours uninterrupted. Within two weeks of drinking a glass of CALM every night, my hand cramps stopped completely, my foot cramps occurred about 1-2 times per week, and I started sleeping better. Now, after two months of consistent use, my feet rarely cramp, and I can sleep for a straight 8 hours! What a difference in my life!
