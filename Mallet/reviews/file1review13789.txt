review/text: So many resturants are too dark to see anything, so the OWL LITE is a great help. It not only lights up what you are reading, but also magnifies it at the same time so you don't have to fuss around for your glasses!Also good to use in movie theatres and to find your car keys or key holes when it is dark out. I bought a bunch of them and gave them out to friends and co-workers who love them.They are credit card sized so they are narrow and small enough to fit in any wallet or even a shirt pocket.I will be buying more for Christmas. GREAT INVENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
