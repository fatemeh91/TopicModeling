review/text: I was concerned about the back buddy being plastic but when I received it I discovered it was very strong and unlikely to ever break.It works well. I wish it came with a dvd (there may be one you can buy seperately) because it took a few weeks of trial and error to discover how it works best. I find myself using it 3-4 times a day and it does offer some decent relief. It is not a miracle cure but it is one more tool in managing chronic muscular pain in the upper back and neck. It makes the time between massage therapy appts much more tolerable.
