review/text: I have a love-hate relationship with Oxo's detergent-dispensing kitchen brushes. Mostly hate. I've had three of them in the past six years, and they've often been more trouble than I would like. Detergent oozes out at inconvenient times, the brush heads break down, they're a nuisance to fill up, and the grip is not optimal. The Oxo Good Grips bottle washer, on the other hand, has become one of life's guilty pleasures. THAT brush works like a charm...on just about everything, not just bottles.So when I discovered that Oxo was offering aGood Grips kitchen brush, I grabbed it. I needed something that could apply more pressure than the bottle washer. And does this thing ever perform! The grip is wonderful, the brush is on a par with the bottle washer and is much better than the detergent-dispensing contraptions, and it is easy to clean itself. In other words, this brush does its job brilliantly and with classic simplicity.This might seem a bit pricey for a mere kitchen brush, but the few dollars extra are worth it to get something with great performance and durability. As for the detergent, I prefer keeping it in the bottle anyway until I actually need it--not in the brush. There are fewer goopy messes in my kitchen sink that way.This brush is currently underrated by Amazon's buyers. I expect that it will soon be discovered and will then vault to the top of the bestseller list.
