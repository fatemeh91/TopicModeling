review/text: Giving this one 5 stars because it's one of the few whey powders I have tried that when mixed with the correct portion of milk, taste good enough to look forward to a tasty treat. Flavor is mild strawberries and cream, fairly light and has a fair amount of sweetness to it.The taste combined with better-than-most protein content makes this a strong recommendation for anyone who wants a strong departure from the standard chocolate/vanilla flavors.
