review/text: Speaking on behalf of my husband and his approval of the product. He had asked me to purchase something to help and quite frankly, I was concerned that the OTC stuff he had been purchasing to "help" may have been adding to his problem. I was thinking allergy or irritation; as you know some people just have issue with the simplest of ingredients. After reading all the fine reviews, I ordered this; he used it and he hasn't complained since. Bravo for a fine product. He only uses until he has effective relief and it's been awhile now since he's had to use anything. That said, we have to rate it right up there. (No pun intended of course) ;)
