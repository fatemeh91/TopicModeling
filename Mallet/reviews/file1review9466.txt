review/text: I'm still relatively new to DE wet shaving. I've found Proraso to be an excellent shaving soap for sensitive skin at a very reasonable price. A cooling effect is quite nice and any of these top-notch soaps and creams are very competitive in price compared to the canned stuff when you calculate amount used, though American Crew and Nivea are somewhat decent among the mass market ware. But when you compare performance and price, I'd go with the traditional top-of-the-line soaps and creams over any American mass market concoction. Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort is quite comparable to Proraso Ultra Sensitive Skin in its performance outside of Proraso's cooling effect. Proraso is far less expensive, but it does take more effort to develop a rich lather. Right now I'm still exploring and a bit torn between the two. Honestly, I'm leaning toward the Truefitt which lathers much more richly and immediately with less. As always, the proper preshave is as important as the lather and I'm still in a cook-off there. Plus, the more you develop your technique, the more the product world opens up. I have much to try, like Art of Shaving and Tabak. But so far, if Truefitt and Proraso aren't the end-all, they're a fantastic place to start. One very important note: with the Truefit, I'm shaving more often.
