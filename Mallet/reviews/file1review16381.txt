review/text: I have been having problems with my spine. My chiropractor recommend I use this in between appointments. The compaction within my neck has caused me to have tingling in my arms and sometimes causing them to go to sleep. Use this about 1 a night with 3 short sessions has been great for my arms and neck. Cant live without it now.
