review/text: This is my first time using Animal Cuts. I am on day 4, and I have to say I am quite impressed. At first the side effects I experienced were fairly discouraging. But I did not give up on this product quite yet, I went online and searched for reviews and user opinions. After a few hours of research, I discovered that when I thought i was drinking enough water, I wasn't.When I wake up in the morning, before I take the pack, I will drink at least 10-12 ounces of water minimally, immediately following taking the first pack of the day I will drink the rest of the bottle of water (usually about another 10-12 ounces). Throughout my workout and rest of the day I am continually drinking water, and lots of it. Before I take the second pack of the day I drink almost a full bottle of water again. About 30 minutes following taking the second pack I will try to eat lunch. Since using this routine I have had no adverse effects from this product.On day 4 I am very impressed with this product, and will definitely use it again. I have already noticed a difference not only in how I look (might be in my head but I see something) and the intensity of my workout, I am pushing more weight, for more reps, and for a longer time.
