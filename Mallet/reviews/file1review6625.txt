review/text: OK, so I expected this thing to suck. It looks dorky and the person who's using it in the pictures looks attractive and weird at the same time. Actually, she's kinda cute. Anywhoooo...I like this thing alot. I have 2 bulging discs in my back and, because I'm old (late 30s) and run a lot, have lots of ridiculous mystery pains all over the place. I don't "massage" so much as find the muscular pain, put pressure on it and let the muscle relax. I usually use it in the morning to get rid of stiffness in my back and legs and it really works. It's akin to a masseuse finding knots and digging in with an elbow or thumb except this doesn't cost $90/hour. It's totally worth a try if you have pain like me. Right now, it's $30 and I think that's a pretty good price. Probably worth it up to about $50.It's very sturdy plastic. Not flimsy in the least. When I hook it over my shoulder or around my back and apply pressure pushing forward, it barely bends if at all. In fact, I stubbed my toe on it the other night and had plenty of choice words (see: "SOB", "MF", "GD", et al) for it's sturdiness.Any questions about it, let me know.
