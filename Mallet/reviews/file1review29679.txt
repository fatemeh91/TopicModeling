review/text: I decided to try these pads becuase I felt the disposable ones were expensive (since I wear them 24/7) and not environmentally friendly. Here is what I found:-They are a lot smaller in diameter than the Medela/Lanisoh pads :(-They shift around frequently. Since my son is 3 months old I don't leak during the day as much just a little at night. So, when these pads shift around it's pretty useless to even have them on. I just wear a camisole that holds them in place.-When they get wet the moisture remains on your skin. The disposables actually pull the moisture away from your breasts. But you could just change them more frequently so buy more than one set if you decide to use them- 3 pairs is not enough.I still perfer these over the disposable ones becuase when I use those I feel like I'm literally throwing my money in the trash right along with all the packaging. But as a new mom until your supply is regular the disposable ones are best. Also, it's good that these come with a washable bag so they don't get lost in the wash. Hope this helps.
