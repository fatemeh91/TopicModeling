review/text: I've tried GNC and Muscle Milk proteins and the Optimum Nutrition is my favorite so far. It has a good flavor, mixes easily, doesn't have any irritating side effects and it's a good value ounce per ounce.I took it down to four stars for two reasons: First- the flavor is good but it's not great- the Muscle Milk protein+ has a better flavor. Second- Shipping took a while. I ordered this and a shaker the same day and this took a full four business days longer to get here so that was a minor disappointment but that's more of a whine about the seller.
