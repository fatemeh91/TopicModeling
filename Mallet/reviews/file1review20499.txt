review/text: I've been eating these bars since I was a child. My dad introduced them to me when I was about 7. Then, they became hard to find. It's very hard to find these. Then, I saw that I could get them by the case at Amazon. Now, I order them all of the time. They are addictive. If you like energy bars, you'll love these.
