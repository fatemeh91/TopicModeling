review/text: I've taken multi-vitamins on and off over the years and have never noticed much difference in my health one way or the other. I usually don't bother taking these daily either, but have found that when I follow the instructions for taking larger doses when I feel myself starting to come down with something, I either don't get sick at all or I seem to get a milder version of whatever is going around than the people around me do.My family members and friends who have tried them have also successfully warded off illnesses.
