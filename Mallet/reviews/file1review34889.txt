review/text: Way better than Mineral Oil. Save mineral oil for Automotive and Industrial uses.I add beeswax to make it even better.1/4 teaspoon of beeswax to 1/2 oz of block oil should be enough for a large butcher block. I put the mixture in a small jar.Then I microwave the small bowl 2 oz water just before boiling. Put the jar in and let the heat melt the wax.Then Apply with cloth. After the wax mixture sets in the wood, you a durable layer.
