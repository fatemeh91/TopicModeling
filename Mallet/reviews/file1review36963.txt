review/text: I'm sure this item works great in the medical field, although I'm not entirely sure what it's for. But then again, like most of the other customers here, I'm sure you don't really care what it's intended for.What it ISN'T intended for, it also works great for. Delivers a light, pricking sensation that seems to crawl up and down your spine in addition to the applied part of the skin. Great for sensual play, or, with a little added pressure, even sharp play. Just make sure you clave it between uses, just in case.(Basically... buy this if your sub craves quickly repeated sharp sensations.)
