review/text: I was getting tired of spending $40+ on haircuts for my triplet boys. Really bad haircuts at a barbershop that charged $12 each was the last straw. I said "I can do better than that". I bought the Wahl clippers for less than one trip to the barbershop. Watched the video, read the directions....first boy's haircut was OK. By the time I got the the third one, I was doing pretty good! Next time, I'm sure I'll do even better.The clippers plowed through my sons' thick hair. I took about 15 minutes on each haircut, so by the time I was done, the clippers had been on for a solid 45 minutes. The handle was hot,but not burning.This was a great investment. Now I can cut my boys' hair anytime and don't have to wait for an appointment or take up a whole Saturday morning.
