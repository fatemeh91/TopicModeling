review/text: I love this lotion for protecting one of my old cats with very sensitive ears. He would have a ton of itchy bumps on both ears all crusty. When I put some of this lotion on the tips of his ears, it keeps the mosquitos away for a day or two. Then you just reapply as needed. He doesn't like when I apply it but it does the job. We are down in hot humid Houston with all the bugs....
