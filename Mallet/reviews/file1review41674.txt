review/text: I absolutely love this product. I've had bad experiences with electric tooth brushes in the past. I would say it was my fault for thinking that a $10 electric tooth brush would do the job. You get what you pay for and anything less than $40 will just make noise while you brush. I asked my dentist what she would recommend and this was it. I put it off for months thinking if I should really spend a lot of money on this. Then I started thinking that my oral health is at hand. I brush twice daily but brushing, like shaving is annoying, but it has to been done. Problem, is that I wasn't brushing and flossing well enough.Once I bought the Oral-B 9400, it literally changed my life. I enjoy brushing and the results can be seen fast. It really cleans well as if you were brushing and flossing in one shot. I also find it fun knowing that I've haven't brushed long enough if I don't see the Happy face on the LCD screen so I keep on brushing.My only complaint is that once at full charge, it can be pretty fast and strong. I sometimes think if it could cause a cut or canker sore. Also, when water gets into the brush head, it makes this sound like something is clogged. Either way, minor complaints. In short:It charges fastThe battery lasts a long timeVery sleek lookingExcellent cleaning resultsTeaches you to take your timeFun to brush
