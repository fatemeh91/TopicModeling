review/text: This product actually works fairly well. The only problems I encountered were that it hurts your arms, it rides up and becomes ineffective and if you put it in the washer and dryer it will stretch out and no longer work. If you hand wash it and put it over your bra, or an undershirt it works pretty well, considering the cheap price. If you have the money however, I would recommend shelling it out for better quality product.
