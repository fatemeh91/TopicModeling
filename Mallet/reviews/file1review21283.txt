review/text: My dentist recommended this and I had been watching prices to get the best deal when I saw this and ordered it. I really like the way it makes my teeth feel just like I had a real cleaning at the dentist office. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the vibrations, they make my nose tickle. It works great!
