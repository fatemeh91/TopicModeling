review/text: I strongly believe that every one needs to have a fully equipped First Aid Kit in their home as well as in their car. I have put together several kits for myself and my family and I am constantly adding new items to them. After several surgeries this past year, I found the gauze sponges to be the best for protecting wounds and keeping them clean and dry. These sponges work well on smaller wounds and are conveniently sized for my first aid kits.
