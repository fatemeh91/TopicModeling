review/text: Optimum Nutrition is a reputable and well respected company. This product is very affordable compared to other protein supplements. It is high in quality, containing 24 grams of protein out of 29 grams(5.5g of which is BCAAs), and will satisfy your protein needs. This product has an acceptional taste. Mixing this product is easy and conveniet. I recommend this product to anyone whose purpose is to add in additional protein content or for weight training. Overall this product is a great protein supplemnt for its price, quality, and quantity. Great buy!
