review/text: Receiving this product and then reviewing it for the VINE program was easy for me. I was already a happy Finish powerball user. I really do love this product. It takes dishes that even have dried on food or have been sitting out for a while and the food is really crusted onto the dishes, and gets them C-L-E-A-N....Everything from my nice glassware down to my pots and pans, get very clean. No streaking at all.The best part is how easy this product is to use.Just use one two colored (blue and white) tablet and put it into your dishwasher dispenser and out come your clean dishes. This is a recommend to buy this product. I think you too will be a satisfied customer.
