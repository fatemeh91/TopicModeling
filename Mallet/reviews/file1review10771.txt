review/text: I've used Rayovac Alkaline batteries for many years and I find that they do as good as the other name brand batteries at a lesser cost, plus they're made in USA and I like that. I've been buying my batteries at W**Mart, but as I'm finding out these days Amazon Prime is beating W**Mart on price/convenience. I like saving approx. $4.00 and having it handed to me at my door (I don't like having to drive to the store, plus recently I don't like the atmosphere in the W**Mart Stores anyway!).
