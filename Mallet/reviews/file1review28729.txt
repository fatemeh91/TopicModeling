review/text: I was looking for the older packaged version - as was advertised here. More specifically, I was looking for the version that had lower cholesterol per serving. It was advertised that the version shown here (in the description) had 10mg per serving. But they sent me the newer version (which has 30mg per serving). If I wanted the newer version, I would just have walked into the nearby GNC store to get it. I searched everywhere online, thought that I finally found what I was looking for, here on Amazon - only to be mislead.Other than the cholesterol content per serving, I am a big fan of this product (not the yucky Strawberry flavor though, but the vanilla versions).
