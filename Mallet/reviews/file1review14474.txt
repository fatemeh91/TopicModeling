review/text: i love everything from the happy company. especially the name. we are slowly growing our collection of microwaveable products this winter. and i have been giving them as gifts.a tiny downside, and maybe i'm doing it wrong, is that you have to touch the hot packet to put it in the booties. i have to find out if i can put the whole bootie in the micro-would be easier.highly recommended!
