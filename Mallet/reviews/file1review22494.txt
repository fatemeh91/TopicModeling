review/text: I've been taking these for years now. I find them to be very easy on the stomach, and, from what I can tell, effective. The natural food store that I used to get these from recently went out of business. Turned to Amazon and was able to find them for about $11 less per bottle. I know some people have complained about getting expired products, but mine show an expiration date 4 years in the future.
