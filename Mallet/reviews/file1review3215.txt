review/text: Sturdy, durable product. Shipped discretely. The handle on this model is longer than most like it, which allows for holding it easier. I purchased this a long time ago and it is still working like a charm. It can take a little careful positioning at first to figure out how to use it best, but once you figure it out, you will be quite satisfied!Thanks
