review/text: My 8 year old daughter got head lice. "No problem" I thought. I'll just go get some medicine to kill the lice and game over. After using this product exactly as described, twice, we discovered that her head lice are completely resistant, finding live lice every time we looked. Frustrated, I then started looking online and found that many lice in the US are resistant to the active ingredient in Nix and other over the counter "pediculocides". The prescription strength medicines (Kwell, etc.) are potent neuro-toxins and I am not ready to coat my child's scalp for hours in something that is known to cause seizures, paralysis, and death. We have now resorted to combing daily with a nit comb, hoping to get rid of the lice by attrition, and olive oilIt probably makes sense to try Nix once because it would surely be nice to have a one shot method to get rid of lice, but check carefully the next day for live lice since you probably won't be so lucky. If you find them, give up on the chemicals and start researching alternative ways (olive oil, etc). And invest in a good, metal nit comb that you can boil to sanitize in between combings or between children. You'll be needing it...alot.
