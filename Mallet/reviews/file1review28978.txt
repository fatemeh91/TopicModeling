review/text: This shaver will produce a close shave if you're willing to spend some time going over the same areas many times. However, a quick pass usually produces a shave that's close enough to suit me. The thing I really like about this shaver is the dual trimmer and the snap-on guard for beard trimming. It's very convenient.
