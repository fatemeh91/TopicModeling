review/text: This review is specifically on the flavor of cake batter. As far as the actually protein is concerned I have no complaints, however I recently purchased the cake batter flavor and was not impressed. I spent a little extra money to obtain the flavor cake batter since that is usually my favorite flavor. However I would say this version of cake batter tastes no different from vanilla, which is available for a few dollars cheaper. My recommendation would be not to waste the extra few dollars. I gave the review 3 stars, 5 for the protein and 1 for the taste. And 1 star not because it tastes bad, but because it doesn't taste like cake batter
