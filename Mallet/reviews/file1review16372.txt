review/text: I spoke to a seller about this at a craft fair. He maintained it was a great product and sure to not bother people's lips.This product made my lips peel and hurt after one day of use. It was very uncomfortable and took about a week to heal.I contacted the company to let them know about the problem and recieved no response.
