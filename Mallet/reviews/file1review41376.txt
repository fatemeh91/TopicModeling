review/text: The Superfeet 3/4 Premium Insoles are fantastic. They come with Velcro attachments so that you can move them from one shoe to another. I use these in all of my summer sandals. Sandals are open, of course, and I didn't want a colored arch support to stand out more than the sandal itself. These, as I said, come with Velcro, you can put them in your sandals so they are secured and they hold your foot (you can see they have a raised heel area), support your arch and do not detract from the look of the shoe. I definitely recommend these for those of us that have flat or fallen arches. Go ahead, get them, and wear those open shoes supported and comfortable.
