review/text: I recently had to grow a beard for a part in the play, Little Women. I need a full beard consistent with the 1860s period in which the play takes place. Since I play a distinguished gentleman, the beard had to be neatly trimmed. Rather than spend money on a barber or hair dresser, I decided to purchase an electric trimmer, which cost only as much as a single visit to a barber. I found it easy to use and wholly effective in giving my beard and mustache a well-tailored look, fully suited to the role. It will serve me for years to come, and was clearly a great investment.
