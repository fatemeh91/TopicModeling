review/text: After years of my dental hygienist asking me why I haven't bought one of these sonic toothbrushes, I finally broke down and bought one. Wow, what a difference! I am a brusher and flosser, but the results are very real. My teeth are whiter and no build up of plaque behind the front teeth. Amazing! If you are someone with the same problems, a regular brusher who can't seem to ever keep the build-up of plaque behind the front teeth, you will love this product. If you are not a regular tooth brusher (ew!) than you need this product. The timing mechanism is extra good, because it makes you really take the two minutes twice a day that you need to keep those pearly whites, well, pearly white!
