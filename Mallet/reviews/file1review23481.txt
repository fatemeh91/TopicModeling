review/text: I have used progesterone cream for years for early menopause. I also have all of my daughter's using it regularly. I usually pay $30 at the health store, so I was thrilled to see this at one third of the cost. I've only had it for 1 week, but it seems to work just as great as the more expensive. I love the pre-measured pump and the smell is nice.
