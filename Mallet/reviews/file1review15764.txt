review/text: I want to like this pen:It works fine. The feel is great.The problem (and this may just be me) is that I carry it in my pocket (front pant) all the time and I bumped into a table and the clip got bent. Completely my fault.But I got spoiled on fancier pens that have a spring loaded pocked clip that could withstand a little bump. This pen only had a fixed metal clip and got bent easily and eventually broke off. And not I can't put it in my pocket since it'll travel. While it's my fault, I would still like it to be more durable. I love the convenience of the multi-pen and that is what caused it to be carried all the time...
