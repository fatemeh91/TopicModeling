review/text: This toothbrush was recommended to me years ago. I bought my first one thinking that it was some type of hype and probably wouldn't work. I was surprised to find that it seemed to help my teeth feel and look cleaner during the day. I don't like the feeling of electric toothbrushes, so this is a good alternative for me. To use this toothbrush, wet your fingers and touch the silver band around the middle of toothbrush. There is a very slight metallic taste during brushing, but it it subtle and not unpleasant. I find that using this toothbrush keeps my teeth from attracting plaque during the day.
