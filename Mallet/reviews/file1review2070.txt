review/text: I use these regulators every night. It has kept my bunion from advancing like it had been. I am much more comfortable with it on. Of course- you should not walk in it and because it is made of plastic, it is very easy for my pupply to destroy- The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star, is I can't find replacement parts.
