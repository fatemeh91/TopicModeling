review/text: Being a bigger guy i go through this stuff real fast... this container lasts me 1 month... and as much as i like chocolate... i needed change. The chocolate coconut scratched that itch ') It's as good as any &#34;good&#34; protien mix, little sweet but the coconut is a good change for anyone who is getting bored with plain chocolate. I drink protien for the benefits not for the taste, so any perks (flavor enhancements) are just bonus's. Because lets face it everyone, you aint goina be comparing this to a chocolate malt from the diner down the road haha..
