review/text: Ear and nose hair, the curse of man! It takes a special tool to handle the heavy work and this is it. Having tried many different models and styles, I have found this to be the best. Reasonably priced, easy to handle, plenty of power and by design, you can't cut or slice yourself while trimming. I'd recommend this model to anyone who is conscious of their appearance and want to keep the annoying facial hairs under control.
