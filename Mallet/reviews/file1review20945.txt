review/text: This kit has most of the frequently indicated remedies for acute problems. Plus it has several doses of Osillococcunum, about which I had never heard before; tried it recently at the beginning of a sore throat but it did not help much; a more specific remedy that matches symptoms has a much better chance at prevention/cure, which was Belladona in my case. The box is great; it is compact, sturdy and well-designed. The 32 or so remedies plus the several doses of osillo fit in the top 2 drawers, leaving the bottom one for additional remedies. The cost per remedy is much lower than if one was to buy all the included remedies separately.
