review/text: I don't normally write product reviews, but this product has helped me so much that I want to share my experience. I had surgery several years ago for ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and fibroids. After I got pregnant with my daughter, I was on the pill for a few years to keep my cysts and endo at bay. I felt tired all the time and had terrible mood swings on the pill. My sister told me about DIM. I was a little worried about going off the pill to try it, but I have been on DIM for almost a year, and the cysts, endo, and fibroids have not returned! In addition, I am a much calmer person and I have a lot more energy than I did when I was on the pill. I have not experienced any weight loss like other people have who have used it, but I am thrilled with everything it has done for me. If you have an excess amount of estrogen and are suffering with similar issues, I would HIGHLY recommend trying this product!
