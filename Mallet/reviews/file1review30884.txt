review/text: Having acquired Parkinson's Disease 8 years ago it was always a challenge to take 6 horse pill size pills daily to achieve my dose of 1200 mg daily. The NOW product is high quality and dosed at 600 mg allowing me to split my dose into 2 pills daily. Works well and are easy to take.NOW Foods CoQ10 600mg, 60 Softgels
