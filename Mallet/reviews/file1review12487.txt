review/text: I work in a health food store and have tried numerous herbal cleanses as well as all the fiber cleanses and many combinations of both. None of those every worked very well for me. The Oxy-Powder worked great! The key is to find the right dose that works for you. The directions say to take 4 pills the first night and if you don't have 3 to 5 movements the next day to increase the dosage by 2 pills each night until you achieve the desired results. It works by liquifying the built up gunk in the colon so you will have liquid stools, but there was no cramping or gas like you would have with diarrhea. Obviously you want to make sure that you are close to home or at least close to a bathroom the week of the cleanse. Oh and be sure to drink LOTS of water when you take the pills! I drink a lot of water but not usually at bedtime, the first night I woke up feeling so dry I felt like I had turned to dust. After that I drank a whole large glass of water with the pills and felt fine. Also be careful not to eat anything withing 2 hours of taking the pills or you will just be cleaning out the food you ate and not what is backed up in your colon. If you use common sense and follow the directions you will end up with a clean colon.
