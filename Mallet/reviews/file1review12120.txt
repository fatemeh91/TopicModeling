review/text: Let me first say that I am not pregnant. I am taking these as a multi replacement and for nail and hair health. The results are amazing. My nails grow extremely fast and are hard and healthy. My hair, which I color blond, so it is damaged, is finally able to grow (rather than before which would break before it added any length). I feel great while taking these. They are not too big to swallow and have no scent.Also - an interesting note for men...my husband took one of these when his multi ran out and said he had so much energy and felt great! It has all the necessary vitamins and minerals and more. Highly recommended.
