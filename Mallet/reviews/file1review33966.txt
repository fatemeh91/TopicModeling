review/text: This is definitely one of the best and easiest protein supplements to use. Rich in BCAA, it is a complete product and has helped me add lean muscle mass in a short amount of time. As a natural enthusiast, I recommend this to anyone in a strength and conditioning program!Like most liquid supplements, you do have to have an acquired taste for the product. In time, it's not bad and as one other reviewer wrote it does for some reason settle your stomach. I eat about 5-6 eggs/day, and at times they would give me a bit of heartburn. Taking this supplement does ease that for some reason. It also does give you a bit of a full feeling for a short time. I am taking approximately 4 tbsp./day. I do a split session weight workout and cardio. Usually weight training in the late morning and cardio in the late afternoon. One tbsp. before each workout and one after, this works well!
