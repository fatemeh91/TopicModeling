review/text: Ok, so I'm not a breakfast eater. However, I do need something every morning. I have found that a protein drink works best for me. I have tried a lot of brands, and this one is the best. It tastes great. It mixes easily - without clumps. It is not thick and congealed. I actually mix it with hot water to make a hot chocolate drink. It satisfies my hunger for several hours. I like it.
