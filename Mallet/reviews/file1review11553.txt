review/text: After my Energizer and Sanyo rechargeable AAs were confiscated at the airport in Paris, I was forced to replace them. Both the Energizer and the Sanyo 2700s worked beautifully, held a charge for months and powered my camera flash reliably. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for these Duracells. This is a good example of how name brand may not always be the best. These batteries discharge very rapidly (within days if unused). I constantly have to recharge them and 2 sets are not enough for my needs- I previously never needed to take my charger with me on vacations of up to two weeks, but if I were to rely on 2 sets of these batteries, I would need to bring the charger for a weekend jaunt with scant flash photography. Don't spend your hard earned money on these batteries!
