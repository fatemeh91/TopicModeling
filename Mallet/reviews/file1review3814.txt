review/text: When I bought this tea, I did not have indigestion. I bought it because I had a sore throat and figured something with lemon and ginger would be good to ease the sore throat and clear up congestion as I've used a tea with fresh lemons and ginger before to help with colds.The tea was relatively good for the purpose of my sore throat and congestion, but I've been taking it for two days and developed indigestion. I constantly feel as if I need to burp. This rarely happens to me because I don't drink soda and when I do have acid reflux symptoms, it's usually a light burning feeling in my esophagus, not this uncomfortable trapped air and burping sensation. I am wondering if I have a mild allergy to one of the ingredients in the tea.So, I do think this is a good tea and it can help with certain symptoms, but you may want to test it out before taking it every 20 minutes as directed. (Note: I took the tea twice the first day and once the second day).
