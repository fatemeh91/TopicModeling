review/text: No complaints about taste. Too bad some people who reviewed haven't been creative or hardy enough to figure it how to consume something which is so beneficial to health.I add a scoop to orange juice, and gulp it down. Tastes even better blended with a banana. I feel great about easily supplementing my diet with a wonderful variety of health promoting vegetables and super greens. I will buy for years to come. Amazon seems to have the best pricing.
