review/text: I do not like Xylitol! I have tried Stevia without any issues, but decided to try Xylitol when my Stevia ran out as I'd heard good things about it. I have gluten sensitivities and this product, although it says it is gluten-free, made me feel all of my symptoms (nauseous, tummyache, diarrhea, gassy, etc.) This product is just not good for me.
