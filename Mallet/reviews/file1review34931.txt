review/text: A waste of money (especially at $10 from the local over-priced island grocery). I have been fighting sleep issues for years and gave up on the Big Pharma approaches (ambien, benzos) due to side effects and habituation. Melatonin has helped me before, so after reading an article that discussed TR, I thought I would give this a try. Awake almost all night, with no sense that this is anything other than a placebo... Not even a hint of the usual melatonin drowsiness, and I tried three nights in a row with similar results.(To clarify, I'm not going through any kind of rebound insomnia from that other stuff, which was quite a while ago... all bets are off when that is happening. Now just looking for a reasonably reliable sleep aid that isn't toxic.)
