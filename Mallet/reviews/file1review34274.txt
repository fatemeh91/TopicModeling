review/text: I mention the title because some of the few negative reviews may not understand that this is actually prescribed by master's degree level licensed acupuncturists and traditional chinese medicine practitioners, it just also happens to be available over the counter. This means that it works best in concert with dietary change, where there are certain foods that can aggravate things (typically spicy, hot, greasy foods as a rule of thumb - try cutting those out then eating huge masses of green vegetables in response, like 2lbs a day or even more replacing most of your complex carbohydrates like rice or potatoes) and may have additional chinese herbs meant to be boiled and taken internally as an additional part of the treatment for most effect.It's somewhat expensive, being a large box containing a pretty small 10 gram tube that might last 10 days under fairly moderate agitation, but compared to what.. something that doesnt work? Another western product with an 'H' in it you probably get 5-8x as much, but end up using twice as much, to almost no effect and very temporary if so. The H gives you temporary relief then it comes back - this stuff actually makes them GO AWAY as long as your diet isn't agitating it even worse, and sometimes combined with acupuncture or internal herbs. And it's a critical part of the treatment - the acupuncture/diet/internal herbs alone will take longer or not fix it then, this adds a huge amount of immediate direct relief. It can burn a bit though. This chinese stuff really works, and I don't think it's one of those scary "made god knows where" products if it's prescribed by ppl who know what they are doing, it's this exact brand.
