review/text: I have used these batteries many times before as well as other brands, they all work just fine. The price on the Amazon "deal of the day" was really great, so I bought them. For those who use mostly rechargeable batteries as I do, the reason for buying these is that some devises such as; some home heating/cooling thermostats do not work well or long enough with the rechargeable batteries.
