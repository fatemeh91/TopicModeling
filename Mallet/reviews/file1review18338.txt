review/text: I had hoped to add some healthy benefit for my dogs and this product failed miserably. I measured as the bottle says and administered into the dog water system. The dogs wouldn't drink out of it despite this being their only source of water while we tried it. After three days all four dogs showed sensitivity with red ears and paws; one broke out in hives on her stomach! It was a waste of money. Before you complain I did something wrong this was the only thing that changed, once it was gone so was the problems.-SRedwood Siberians(breed not known for sensitivity)
