review/text: This is what I needed for the last 5 years! I can work exactly on my trigger points and has substantially decreased the amount of medications for headache and neck pain. It is actually better than the massage therapist (no offense) because I can pin-point the places I need the most. However, I have to confess that this work extremely well for me because I am a health care provider with training in myofascial pain and trigger points.
