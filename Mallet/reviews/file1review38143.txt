review/text: I am very disappointed with this product. It consistently smears the lenses on my husband's glasses. In fact, after using them the lenses are worse than when dirty. Little beads of moisture are left after using the tissues and take a while to dry. I've repeatedly tried to reclean them to get rid of the smears, but using the towelettes doesn't do the trick. I've personally used a little hand soap and hot water for over 25 years for my glasses and gently dry them with a clean, fluffy towel. It works every time for spotlessly clean lenses.
