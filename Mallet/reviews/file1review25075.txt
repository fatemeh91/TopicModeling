review/text: When the security monitoring company called and reported we needed a new battery, I immediately figured "Here goes 100 bucks for a service call". Instead of calling an alarm company, I went online and ordered this battery. It arrived in a few days and was very easy to install (2 plugin connections). Perfect! Wish all my home projects went this easy!
