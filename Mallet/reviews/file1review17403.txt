review/text: Bought this to replace a Norelco rechargable that crapped out after 2 years moderate use. Like this MUCH better. More power, better speed. Works with cord in if you forget to charge it. Not like you ever notice it needs a charge until you are using it, and who wants to be walking around with a half trimmed beard?
