review/text: I have used this brand for several years, in different flavors. I have also tried different brands with various formulations of types of protein included (some cheaper, many not). I always come back to Optimum Nutrition, it mixes instantly and the Vanilla Ice Cream mixes well with anything. I especially like it in smoothies with orange juice....tastes just like a Creamcicle ice cream (Dixie cups). It only requires one scoop where other require 2, and it mixes quickly with only a spoon--no shaker bottle or blending involved & no lumps left.
