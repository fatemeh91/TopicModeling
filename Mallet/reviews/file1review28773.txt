review/text: This is one of the best tasting whey protein powder I ever had in my 20+ years of taking supplements. However, since it was my first time using it, I have yet to feel the effect of it as compared to a similar product I purchase from Samn's club. I'll have to order it again and provide better results, if any, at a later date. To date, it has been only a month since I started using this brand of whey protein.
