review/text: This is loaded with nutrition per serving but the taste is not all that great. Can't have it all, I suppose. Instead of suffering through 16 or more ounces of this mixed in water, I usually just pitch a scoop full of the powder on the back of my tongue and wash it down with water. Same benefits, faster and more enjoyable, at least for me it is.
