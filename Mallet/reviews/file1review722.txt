review/text: First off, if you expect this product to be "miracle" in a tube, think again. Scarzone works to an extent. If you really want to see results you must be very consistent and apply twice each day, rubbing the cream into the scar for about 2 minutes. That aside, I have been using this product for three weeks now and I see a difference. Not a huge difference, but very minimal. My opinion is this product would only work for newer scars that leave discolored marks on the skin. I highly doubt this product would work for old deeper scars (which is what I have) or anyone that suffered from longer-term acne scarring. This product also works by evening skin tone and reducing redness. All in all, it would work for anyone who has light scarring but don't expect a huge difference. I guess you can't really complain because it only costs 10 bucks.
