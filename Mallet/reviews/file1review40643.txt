review/text: I love this stuff. It is a wonderful multipurpose cleaner, and is usually stored near my kitchen counter for easy access. I've used it for cleaning counters, appliances, windows and even floors (works great to clean up after a messy toddler on wood flooring). It has an usual, pleasant smell. I'll be buying this again (and in concentrate, if I can find it).
