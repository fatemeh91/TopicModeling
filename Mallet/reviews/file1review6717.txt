review/text: I read reviews all the time yet rarely leave one. This product is worth writing about. My back always hurts. I do my best to avoid thinking about it, but it's true, the pain is constant. I bought the Back Buddy on the recommendation of a massage therapist. It is an incredibly useful and flexible design that allows me to find all of the sore points on my body (not just my back) and apply acupressure to those points. It hurts so good! The relief I'm getting is obvious. I truly recommend this product if you have muscle soreness and can't afford that weekly trip to the massage therapist. It costs less than a single visit for a massage or chiropractic adjustment . . . if you're on the fence, don't give it another thought and just buy it - you'll be very happy you did. This product is a winner. FYI: It stores really easily. I hang mine up in the closet with my clothes. It takes up a tiny amount of space and is always there when I need it. Enjoy!
