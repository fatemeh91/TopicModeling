review/text: I purchased this table fully expecting the best from Master, and I wasn't disappointed. The black Italia leather and memory foam feels great, the ergonomic multi-adjustable face cradle is absolutely AMAZING, and I've decided that if I ever need another table, the reiki end panels are the only way to go. They make working on a client's neck soooo much easier.The carrying case is even cooler than I expected, too. Because this table will stay in the office, I'm just going to switch the case with my portable table and make my life easier. The case has a large, long zippered pocket to hold a bolster, a deeper pocket above it to hold sheets, and two smaller zippered pockets to hold other stuff. The mere fact that it holds my bolster for when I travel is neat. Oh, and it has both wheels and a shoulder strap, but I'm not really certain how useful those wheels will be on a windy day...I haven't needed to use the therma-top function yet as it's summer in Chicago and still deathly hot, but it looks pretty easy to work and has adjustable heat settings and timer to shut off automatically after 45 minutes if it's left on the highest heat setting for too long. (I like that, it will prevent any damage to the table if you forget to turn it off.)Cons:* I don't like the arm shelf... purchased a reinforced universal arm sling from Master for about $10 here on Amazon.* I'm rather disappointed that I can't find a 33" table from Master anymore, but it's not the table's fault that it's only 31" and some of my clients are... portly.* It is expensive. And heavy. Don't recommend using it to do much traveling, as I'd personally regret when it got all banged up after my shoulder fatigue set in and I dropped it somewhere or smacked a corner accidentally.
