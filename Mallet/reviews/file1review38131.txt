review/text: As for the product itself, these wipes are pretty much perfect. They're of ample size, wet enough to clean both lenses and nosepads, and my glasses are crystal clear after using them.However, now that it's summer and it's getting warmer, I've noticed about every other tissue pad is bone-dry. It's strange though, as other ones are perfectly moist.I also try to keep two of these in my wallet at all times. [this isn't affecting the dryness, as I'm talking about ones never put in my wallet being dry as well]
