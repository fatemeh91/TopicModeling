review/text: I recently went back to using Irish Spring Original and I am glad I did. The smell wakes you up and the soap rinses cleaner than other soaps. I am happy with the quality and the fact that they haven't changed this soaps formula or updated it. I wish they would come out with a bodywash also.****COSTCO sells a 20 pack of Irish Spring for about $6.00. Great Deal!
