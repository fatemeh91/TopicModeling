review/text: I thought any flavor of whey could taste barely tolerable at best (Optimum's Chocolate was the least unpleasant, but still). Well, I just received Optimum's Coffee flavor, and it is killer! Even with water, it's so good, I actually feel like having another for no protein-related reason. It was a bit more expensive than the more available flavors of the same brand, but to me the difference is well worth the extra few bucks.For the record, I purchased the flavor listed as "Coffee", and the bottle I received says "Coffee - Limited Edition Flavor" on the label, while the product image on the Coffee listing reads "Mocha Cappuccino". There's also another flavor listed as "Mocha Cappuccino", with the same product image. They might be different products, though the one I have tastes just like those Starbucks Mocha Cappuccino bottles, so one of them is probably a newer bottle label.
