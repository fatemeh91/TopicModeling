review/text: I'm a big fan of Baby Bjorn products and this potty seat was worth the money. It's sleek and obviously, ergonomic for my 2 yr. old's bottom. The only time it's ever leaked was from her error of not sitting far enough back in the seat, so that her urine sprayed between the potty seat and the toilet seat. Otherwise, it installs so easily and remains clean so that if you need to remove it from the toilet you don't feel grossed out touching it. I'd definitely buy another if I needed to. We use this potty seat in combination with the Baby Bjorn step stool for the upstairs potty and the Baby Bjorn whole Potty Chair for downstairs.
