review/text: My brother in law started this brand of grape seed product (bone cancer)and it made a great difference in him.My dog has cancer and we thought before Christmas he would not make it. So I thought what do we have to lose. I bought it and within 14 hours he started to improve. His appetite is back and he he is moving around more and going outside more. His tail is wagging and he is now fallowing you around. It's amazing. Everyone wants to know what happen to him even his vet. He still has cancer but he is his old self. Just ordered the second bottle.
