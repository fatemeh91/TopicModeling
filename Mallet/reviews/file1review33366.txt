review/text: I tried these when first bought my Merkur "Fat Boy" razor. I thought they were good, however, that was before I tried Feather blades. Merkur blades are dull and not sharp from the get go, in comparison. They pull your beard and always nick you up. Feather blades from Japan, on the other hand, are THE best. Literally, "razor" sharp, they cut through a three day growth with ease. I will not buy the Merkur blades anymore, and will go back to the Japanese brand, which makes it a pleasure to shave. Which is exactly why I went to DE wet shave razors in the first place.
