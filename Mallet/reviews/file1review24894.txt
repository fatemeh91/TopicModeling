review/text: I am sorry I didn't see the reviews about this product making your cycle irregular prior to my purchasing it. I have now been bleeding off and on for a month. I have been trying to conceive for 2.5 years and was willing to try anything. I only took one pill a day too instead of the recommended 3 per day. I would urge anyone who is regular to proceed with caution prior to taking this product.
