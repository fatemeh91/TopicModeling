review/text: I don't understand the reviews that say this pad is not waterproof. I use this with my six year old son who has accidents at night. We recently adopted him and was using pull-ups at night which did nothing to teach him to hold his pee through the night. He's wet himself several times since using the pad. I found the pad had completely absorbed the moisture and kept the rest of the bed dry, even the top sheets. However, his jammies were wet and he was uncomfortable. After a few accidents, he started having converstations with me at bed time about how he was going to wake up dry. This is exactly what I was hoping for and now he's having more and more dry nights and I have a very confident and happy boy. He's even telling me he doesn't need the soaker pad any more. We let him go to bed without it and after he falls asleep, slip it back under him. Then in the morning I take it away, giving him extra confidence that he can do it. One last comment, cleanup is a breeze - I pull him out of bed, take off wet jammies, quick shower, new jammies, back in bed and soaker pad is thrown in washing machine ready for another night.
