review/text: Recovering from a hip fracture, I currently have the need for a cane. When I couldn't find the type I wanted in the urban area where I live, my husband suggested Amazon! And there, of course, I found it.It was very reasonably priced, and MedStock shipped it so fast I was amazed. Its only drawback is that it doesn't have soft foam padding on the handle like the ones at the hospital; I get cramps in my hand if I go any distance with it. But no one was offering that.Overall, the cane is fine, height adjusts very easily, and it's been a big help to me. I'll defiinitely shop Amazon if I need similar items in the future.
