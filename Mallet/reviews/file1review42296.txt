review/text: We purchased 2 bottles. One was GREAT; we like the product very much. 2nd bottle had the seal opened. We tried to exchange it with seller...not happening. We tried the manufacture, Nature's Plus. While they have been nice to communicate with (unlike the seller) we still haven't been able to exchange the bottle for an unopened one. 4 months and counting. So if the bottle shows up undamaged it's a great product, otherwise their guarantee is not worth much. Sadly.
