review/text: I ordered this product because, like another purchaser, I am pregnant with twins, and at times I just feel really heavy.I ordered the size based on the weight limits. I'm 6 1/2 months pregnant, 5'6" and I'm only at 154 pounds right now. I ordered a small which is supposed to support up to 175 pounds. WRONG! It supports me, but I had to remove the bottom part altogether because it was squeezing my undies into places I'd rather not mention (and that was at it's loosest setting!) Furthermore, even after removing the bottom, it's just too snug around my belly and there is no way to adjust it. It's especially tight when I'm sitting, so I have to raise it so that it's sitting on top of my belly. I could be wrong, but I could swear that my twins are even uncomfortable when I'm wearing it, because as soon as I take it off or raise it to sit on top of them they become a lot more active (no matter what time of day)It's nice to use when I have to stand for a little while or walk around, because I don't have to hold my tummy up with my hands, but it's already too tight and is just too uncomfortable to keep on for long periods of time.If you think you need a small, I suggest you get a medium (or a tall/small if you're about my height or taller).
