review/text: This is the second pill box of this type that I've purchased. I'm currently being treated for Lyme disease and have taken 30+ pills a day (antibiotics and supplements) for the past seven months so these containers have been an organizational God-send for me. I had read a review from a woman who purchased two of them so she could count out two weeks of pills at once. Genius! That's why I ordered a second one - - it makes for a lot less work for me in the long run. For the reviewer who said these aren't big enough for large pills, I'd have to disagree because I take several large pills every day and all 30+ pills fit (with room to spare). Also, another reviewer stated that the tops of each day's container aren't clear, but both sets I've purchased have clear tops so I'm not sure if they reviewed the same product. If you're looking for a handy pill container that's cleverly portable and large enough for LOTS of whatever you're taking, look no further because this is it!
