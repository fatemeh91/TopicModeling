review/text: I purchased this mattress pad almost a year ago for a toddler with occasional accidents at night. My first impression was that although is was not crackly and noisy like a lot of other protectors, the cover was kind of rough and scratchy. It did protect the mattress from wetness, but only when my squirmy toddler actually stayed in one place while sleeping. Most of the time it slipped, bunched up, or my son just kicked it off the bed on purpose because he says the pad is not soft. The top really pills up wash after wash and makes it even scratchier. Now as I return to this product page to write a review I am shocked to see some reviewers warnings about this product not being safe for children under 12. We have been using this product for almost a year and there was no sticker warning on the back when I purchased mine! The product page should have this information in the product description.
