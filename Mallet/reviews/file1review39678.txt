review/text: I have been using this style of flosser since I was in elementary school, and Flossaid's is great. Basically, you take a piece of floss, wrap it a couple times around the circular knob, stretch it up and over the forked part, and then bring it back down around the knob a couple more times while pulling it tight.I really don't like flossing the usual way (i.e., by wrapping it around both index fingers) because it cuts off blood circulation in my fingers -- not a very nice sensation. This little contraption maintains the tension of the floss without putting pressure on my fingers, thus allowing me to take more time to floss thoroughly and comfortably. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who finds flossing unpleasant, as well as to those who don't mind flossing. It does take an extra 5-10 seconds, but it makes the flossing process very easy and comfortable. Also, it's really cheap and lasts a long time.
