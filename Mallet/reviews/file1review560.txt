review/text: Although this chair is expensive, I've found it's worth the dollars! At the end of a long day at the computer, this will make you forget your troubles. It's like having a spa at home and with the programs, you can set the controls to exactly what you need for the day. This has helped my husband's bad back (years of broken bones from gymnastics) immensely.
