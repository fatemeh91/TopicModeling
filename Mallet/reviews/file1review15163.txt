review/text: Everyone in my family loved these bars. They were the consistency of the store-bought single-wrapped brownies, and equally as tasty, though twice as thick! My daughter and I both thought that they stuck to the back of our throats a little, but it just reminded me of the ""Got Milk"" commercials. They were delicious and satisfying and if I were looking for a quick and nutritious snack to grab, I would definitely buy this product -- and a carton of milk to go with it.
