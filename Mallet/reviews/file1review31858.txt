review/text: This product was reformulated sometime in the last six months. The scent now bears no resemblance to the old sandalwood scent. It smells like sweet baby powder. The consistency is noticeably thinner, and it is now a brown color. TAOS used to be one of the best, warmest sandalwood scents around, and now, this product should not even have the word sandalwood among its descriptors or ingredients.
