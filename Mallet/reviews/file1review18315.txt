review/text: Elemis Aching Muscle Super Soak - Deep Heat Aromatherapy for Sore Muscles 400MLI first tried this product in the Bahamas at a resort. I couldn't finish a Spa massage because my back muscles were too knotted. I was shown this product and I have been buying it ever since. It is pricey, but worth every penny. You just have to use a little, so it goes far. The product is just what it says, soak in your bathtub for 15 minutes. When you get out,you will actually feel the heat working in your muscles. I have found out I have fibromyalgia and I need back surgery. I can't live without this product. I just had to share my experience because of how much it has helped me.
