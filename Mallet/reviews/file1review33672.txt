review/text: Brought this for my grandson who was have problems with his gums. During his next visit to the dentist he was told he'd made a marked improvement. Don't know whether or this unit was the reason but my grandson said he was surprised how much debris a waterpik releases even after what he thought was a good brushing. I've used a waterpik for many, many years and realized the same results. Every family should have one (with pics for each member).
