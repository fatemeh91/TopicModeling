review/text: I ordered these pads for my 2-year-old based on the generally positive reviews, and was very disappointed. While they were a great fit for his bed and provided the coverage I was looking for, the first time he had a major leak it went right through the pad into the mattress cover below, and when I washed the pad it essentially disintegrated in the washer. Perhaps I had a defective pad, but I can't recommend this pad in any way shape or form based on its complete lack of performance.
