review/text: I never used a potty chair with my son because he always wanted to sit on the seat like mommy and daddy. He's 2 years old and already potty trained. I owe it to the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer!! He even loves to read while sitting on the potty...Daddy's little boy. He's aim isn't great, but we've never had issues with his urine going all over the place. He's never gotten hurt either (some reviews about other seats scared me!!). Overall, great training seat.
