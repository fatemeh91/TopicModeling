review/text: This detergent has never failed to get out a stain and it smells amazing! It has a very light lavendar scent that is unobtrusive but will leave you wondering, what smells so good? I also love it because it is environmentally friendly and, when purchased through amazon.com, comparably priced to traditional detergents.
