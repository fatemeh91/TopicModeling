review/text: I bought an 8pack in January 2009 for use in aCanon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoomdigital camera. The camera uses 4 AAs and would inhale the cheapie Costco branded alkalines. However, I could only depend on one set of 4 AAs, while the other set would last about the time it took to recharge the first set. Then, after a year, these AA batteries exhibit the similar problems. They charge up nicely, but within about 10 photos, the camera starts flashing low battery. The poorly performing set just teases me by to powering up my camera so it can turn off. I've been using theMaha Powerex MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzerall this time and have run it through the break-in cycle, but they're dead.I'm running now with the little IMEDION AA 2100mAh NiMH Rechargeable Batteries w/Holder- 4 Batteries Per Pack that I purchased at the same time, but never used. Low discharge indeed to have that much power after a year.As opposed to aklaline batteries, I've saved some landfill space by using these Duracells, but spent about the same amount of money without the confidence that a new set of cheapie AA can give you. Two stars.
