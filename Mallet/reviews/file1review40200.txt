review/text: Dazzling White, along with my Sonicare toothbrush, had my new dentist convinced that I had had my teeth bleached. I've used it for years after it was recommended by my old dentist. My sister uses it for maintenance after having her teeth whitened with equally excellent results. The Sonicare just boosted the results. The price is $3 less than what I have to pay retail locally. If Amazon is out of stock, it means that my order has been processed. I don't think I'd recommend trying the "Buy It Used" option to the right of the screen, no matter how much money there is to be saved.
