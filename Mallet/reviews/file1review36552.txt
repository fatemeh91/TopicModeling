review/text: It's hard to comment on the effectiveness of the product because I only used it once on my finger nail. It stained my nail so much it looked worse then the infection. I suppose I should give it a chance, but it's hard to walk around with a dark purple nail and explain it to people who ask! If you want to try it just be aware that it really stains!
