review/text: It was borderline 4 stars. If it actually works (improves muscle mass, or lean muscle, etc) I can't say. I eat well and have been training for 15+ years. I didn't notice any improvements while taking it.3 stars as it was too sweet for me and I haven't notice any gains in particular since using this and other Gold Standard products.
