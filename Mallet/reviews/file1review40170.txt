review/text: Consumer Reports tested all the toothpastes that promised to whiten teeth. Some of these brands were very expensive. If you should review these test results, you would find that there is no positive correlation between price and actual effectiveness.Ultrabrite was the least expensive and did the best overall job of whitening teeth. Who would of thought? The trick is finding Ultrabrite. I usually have to order it in large quantities on the Internet. My local grocery store and pharmacy don't sell it. I guess there isn't enough markup in the price!
