review/text: I know everyone has different tastes, but this stuff is fantastic in organic fat free milk. I haven't tried it with water and don't think I will. Mixing the product with milk does add some additional calories, but it also kicks in 7-8 grams of protein bringing a single 8oz serving to over 30 grams. Hard to beat that. I mix mine in the Blender Bottle (sold on Amazon) and have been very happy with the results. By the way, I'm not looking to gain a bunch of mass with this product, I'm using it more as a meal replacement in the mornings and to get some extra protein in my diet. So far, so good. Once the warmer weather gets here, I'll look at picking up another flavor, maybe the Tropical Punch.
