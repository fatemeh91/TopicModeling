review/text: The reviews on this product are numerous and thorough, so I'll try not to repeat what has already been said well. I tried an electric shaver for the first time 7 years ago and quickly went back to a blade. Then my wife bought me one 2 years ago and it worked reasonably well for a time, but cleaning was a hassle, and since the hairs on my neck somehow grow at crazy angles I could never seem to do a great job on them. Also, I started having a problem with ingrown hairs on my face. I searched Amazon and found the Braun 8585 and decided to invest in it. So far it has been well worth it; it's doing a much better job in just 2 days than my old, cheaper shaver ever did. It is excellent to have a shaver that cleans itself, and I hope that it continues working well for years to come. To me, it's definitely worth the price, even with the cleaning cartridges and replacing the foil and cutter block periodically.
