review/text: I don't get fancy haircuts when I go to the barber/salon and my hair grows fast so I decided to save money and get my haircut at home. I have had it for 3 years now and my wife didn't have a hard time learning how to use it. We now also use it for my 3 year-old's hair so its saved us hundreds of dollars so far. My only concern about the product is that it can get uncomfortably warm when its been on for more than 15 minutes (so it may be a little uncomfortable for the 2nd or 3rd consecutive person getting their hair cut with this). When (if) this item breaks I'd buy another Wahl Hair Clipper again.
