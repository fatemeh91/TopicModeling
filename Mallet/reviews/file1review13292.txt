review/text: My little girl has been having trouble with bed wetting lately and I just couldn't stand seeing her ruin her mattress. I bought 2 of these (one for a backup when the other may be in the wash) and they're doing exactly what they should be doing- keeping the bed dry! The "noise" wasn't a problem and after several washes, you can't hear the crinkles anymore when she gets on it. My daughter never complained about it sliding around on her, and we always found it just where it should be when we get her up in the morning even though she moves around a lot as she sleeps.
