review/text: I had my 8585 razor for about 2 years and needed to replace the foil and block. I saw they were selling them here for $30. I also saw they have refurbished 8585's for $59. I think for an extra $29 I'd like to have the security of having an extra razor (eg. use for travel) or if the battery or motor dies on one, I can use the other. Anyway, that's my $.02
