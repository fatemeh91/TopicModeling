review/text: I'm a skeptic! I've tried several (ok I'm lying MANY..lol) diet pills and this is the only one that works for me. I already have thick hair so I can't say it helped there.. And my nails.. Well I don't notice an improvement there.. and my skin is the same.. So I can't say this stuff is helping me in those areas like it says it does.. But as for weightloss.. oh Yeah!I'm 60inches exactly.. And I had a baby 1 year ago and I couldn't shed those extra baby pounds.. I want to be 120. I was almost 140 when I started taking NV which was almost 1 1/2 wks ago.. I just weighed myself and I am 126!!! So yeah it works! I didn't want to take them the first couple days because I didn't think it was curbing my appetite.. It actually made me want to eat MORE.. but after several days of taking it.. That subsided.. btw-I usually only take 1 pill a day.. I'm going to order the two bottles.. great deal.. My local walmart sells em 1 bottle for 23.00
