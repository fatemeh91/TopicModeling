review/text: I bought this tub because I was looking for something light, soft and with a drain plug (so I would not have to lift my baby to rinse her). It works great, it is very safe, it drains very well and dries fast. My baby can rest on the sides without touching the wall or anything. I am very happy with my purchase. a last thing, at the beginning the plastic has a strong smell but this goes away after 30 min once inflated.Definitely a "back saver" and "worry saver"!
