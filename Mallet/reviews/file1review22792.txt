review/text: First thing is this stuff works pretty good. It takes two packets for the best results, but you definitely feel the energy hit you within about 20 minutes of taking them. So, effectiveness is not an issue. They work. They work well.The problem is that you are spending around 30 bucks for less than a month's supply. I don't take energy boosters year round but I am usually taking something so for that amount of money, it is just not very realistic for someone with a budget to buy these too often. But it is always good to switch things up anyways so your body doesn't adapt.I am taking a green tea extract and yohimbine coffee combo right now,Yohimbine HCL 90 Capsules + Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules With FREE Pure Caffeine Powder 25 Grams. It gives me the same type of powerful energy kick that the Cuts gives me but is also half the price as well as lasts two times longer. You take those two with just a little but of caffeine and you'll be flying high all the way to the gym and back again.It just comes down to continuing to mix things up like I said, don't ever let that body figure out what your doing and you can continue to shock it and get the best results possible.
