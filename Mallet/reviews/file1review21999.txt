review/text: Tried these. I pretty sure this is a joke. I thought this was an herbal remedy, but it is a HOMEOPATHIC remedy, which I have learned the hard way are not the same thing. Educate yourself on the difference, because I did not and now I feel stupid. Herbal remedies contain herbs, which under research can be an active ingredient. These contain what? 1 billionth of a billionth of a few real herbs plus lactose sugar. That is why you can basically give these to newborns, because all it really is is milk sugar. My little boy stopped crying because he thought I was giving him candy, not because this treated him. I know there are those who swear by this....it is a pure placebo effect my friends. Again, your kids are getting a sweet, so of course they stop crying for a while. Ice those gums and give 'em a good teether, don't get sucked into this.
