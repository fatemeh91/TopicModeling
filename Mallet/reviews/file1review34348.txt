review/text: Thought I was cleverly saving a few bucks buying this over the Schiff product I used prior to this, but this is of VERY questionable quality to my senses...so much so in fact that I don't even trust this product enough to try ingesting even one of these into my body. Product is strongly foul-smelling upon opening bottle, enough so that it makes me question the quality of the oil inside. Additionally, gel caps are all oily EXTERNALLY, which they obviously should not be, which makes me question production quality of this product even more. Never had these problems with other krill or fish oils tried before. Should have known better, as twinlab is notorious for selling one-off quality products at one-off level prices...and I suppose there is a big enough customer base for them to thrive on...but to me that doesn't really equal good value since their products are clearly inferior the overwhelming majority of the time. Mine went right in the trash..
