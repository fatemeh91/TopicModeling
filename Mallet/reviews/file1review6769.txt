review/text: I've been suffering from severe shoulder, back and hip pain for years. Massage relieves some of it, but only is available once a week at most. As soon as I opened this product, I went to work on hitting trigger points for about an hour and received relief that nothing else has delivered through the years. It's easy to use, and the little instruction book gives you enough of an idea to begin right away. I also ordered the Trigger Points Therapy Workbook, and though I've not had much time yet to get into it, it points out that some areas can take up to a month of constant work to correct. Knowing that this is at my disposal whenever I need it is a real comfort. I highly recommend this.
