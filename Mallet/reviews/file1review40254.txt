review/text: One of the drawbacks of buying toilet/bathroom/commode equipment is that as a health condition changes/improves the owner may end up with unused, bulky gear around the house. That's why versatility and multi-use functionality can be a help. This commode is that kind of useful equipment. It can provide a commode for someone who can't make it to the bathroom. It can also make toilet use safer, by providing either a metal frame around the existing toilet seat, or by adding an elevated seat. This means that as a person's mobility increases or decreases, this piece of equipment can adapt. Can help with the budget and when limited space is available.Recommended especially when mobility restrictions change from time to time.
