review/text: This is a professional quality hair trimmer. It is built to last. I had a cheaper wahl that laster 10 years. This one will no doubt last my life time. Has nice weight to it and looks very nice. It has never gotten hot. i cut a friends hair who had a full afro and it ate through his hair without any issues. Wish i knew about this years ago. Truely a professional wahl hair cutter.
