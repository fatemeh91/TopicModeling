review/text: Bought this for our mother, who is a assisted care living facility.Everyone comments on the "beautiful" chair. It is a bargain for the money.The color & fabric are exceptional. One thing, when you sit in it -- it is a little stiff, so if you are expecting a soft seat this chair is not for you. Otherwise, we are very pleased.
