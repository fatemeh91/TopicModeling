review/text: This razor probably would have served me well when I was in my teens and had the whispiest of beards but now that I am grown and have a moderate but not heavy beard, the razor is a joke. Maybe it would work better if I wanted to spend a half hour shaving, running it back and forth, up and down my face but I don't really have that kind of time. The person who said that it shaves as good as a blade must not have used a blade in a long time because after using the ShavePro, I finished off with a blade and my face is no longer bristled. Don't waste your money on this unless you want to buy it as a toy for a child who wants to shave like daddy.
