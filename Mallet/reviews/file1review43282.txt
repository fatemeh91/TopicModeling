review/text: I only ended up using this a handful of times in my 6th & 7th months of pregnancy. It fit tightly (and I was just barely in the low end of the weight guide sizing wise), was extremely cumbersome to try to put on, was uncomfortable in the underbelly area, and dug into my lower back as well. I agree with the reviewer who said that it looks better on the computer screen than what it actually is in real life. If I had it to do all over again, I'd save my money and tough it out instead.
