review/text: I chose this vacuum because of the reviews that said it had great power and it has a power cord. I am happy with how it performs, with one exception. I have two cats and two dogs. I find that the filter and screen that covers the filter clogs very easily and has to be cleaned EVERY time I use the vacuum. This is somewhat burdensome.
