review/text: I am not a consistant flosser, but since I purchased the Hummingbird I have been flossing more often. I use both the floss and the picks. The picks work well on the back teeth, especially.I have a hard time finding fault with a product that encourages me to floss. While the flossing attachments still have some room for improvement, I am optimistic that Oral B will solve that problem and we will be able to buy better refills in the future. In the meantime, I'd say the Hummingbird will make my next trip to the dentist a little easier.
