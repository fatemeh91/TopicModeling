review/text: These OXO good grips line have really been a godsend. They have made cleaning up nasty dishes a million times easier.The soap dispensing handles are solid and easy to use. The buttons to dispense the soap are in easy to reach places and they hold enough for about a month's worth of cleaning. Refilling takes about 30 seconds and is usually done without spilling a drop. I have had one handle that had the rubber button get a hole in it, but that may have been feline caused as one of our cats love to gnaw on rubbery things.The brushes are also long lasting and do a great job of removing food. I am pretty rough on them when cleaning our cast iron grill and they still last about 6 months before giving in. Changing them takes about 30 seconds as well.Really ingenious product. Time saver.Highly Recommended.
