review/text: I bought these batteries think that being made by Duracell that they would be a good quality battery. How WRONG I was. These things can not hold a charge for more then a few days, and that is when they aren't even being used. I did a complete discharge and refresh on them hoping that this would help their charge hold time... it did not.Do not buy these things if you want to have a good functioning and usable battery. I gave them 1 star because Amazon forced me too, I would have preferred 0 stars.
