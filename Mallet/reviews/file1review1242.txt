review/text: I think the idea is good, but I'm not so sure about the execution. I usually use Parissa mini eyebrow strips, which are great and easy to use (and are white and can be reused more than once), but I wanted to give something else a try and this seemed to be a good price for the amount that you get.There are a few things I didn't care for about these strips such as them being hard to see when you're peeling them off their backing. I also didn't care for the size and shape of the lower portion, which seemed way too big (at least for me) when you have to contend with eyelashes, lid and all of the rest.Lastly, once you use it, you're done - as in no retries. This is a bit frustrating, since the adhesiveness of the strips themselves isn't all that great. Though I'm experienced with using similar strips and waxing in general, I found myself having to go through several extras just to get the job moderately done. Mind, this is with a dry yet freshly-cleaned, oil-free face and appropriate hair length.Overall, I think this is good for beginners or for those who want a completely pain-free experience and don't mind giving it a few tries. I can say that it didn't hurt, there was no mess and the strips are pretty forgiving if you place things wrong. I found I liked the top portion more for its shaping purposes; however, I'm not sure this makes up for how many you have to go through or the shape and size of things alone - at least in my opinion.Shipment came quickly, too, I might add. :)
