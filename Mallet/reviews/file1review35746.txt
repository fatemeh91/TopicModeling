review/text: I have a lot of pain in one shoulder so it makes it very difficult to dress. I had given up on wearing anything that zippers up the back until my mother suggested this item. It comes with little rings to attach to your zipper pulls but I didn't bother since the hook on the cord fits into the zipper pull fine. It was a little difficult to shake loose once I had the zipper pulled up, if the cord were a little longer it might be easier to get off but other than that it is an excellent product for anyone in pain or with difficulty reaching.
