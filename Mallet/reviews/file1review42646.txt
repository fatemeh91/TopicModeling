review/text: My mother was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease this spring, and needed a walker with a seat so she could sit down if she got tired of being on her feet. But she is only 4'8" tall and all the standard walkers were way to big for her. This one had the most features for an affordable price and is working perfectly for her.
