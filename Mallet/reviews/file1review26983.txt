review/text: This protein powder is very EASY to mix with a spoon. I wish I had discovered this earlier because it is very filling and does NOT require a blender, thank God!UPDATE:The Chocolate Mint is great tasting even though I have not found the scoop in the 5 lbs. container. In the 2 lbs. of Chocolate Malt, I found the scoop VERY EASILY and I still use it. The whey protein helps me maintain and build my muscle strength.
