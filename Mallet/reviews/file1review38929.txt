review/text: I have tried most razors on the market from older dual edge, single blade razors to the new three blade disposable razors (I have not tried any of the new quad-configuration razors, however.) Of all the razors I have tried, my overall favorite is the Gillette Sensor Excel. The combination of shaving closeness and relatively long blade life make this razor a good choice for most people.The bottom line is that these blades provide an optimum, smooth shave and last a long time, which is why I continue to use them despite the relatively high cost. The most economical way to buy these blades is in the 15-cartridge pack; so if you like the Sensor Excel like I do, this package is the best value you will find. I give the Sensor Excel five stars for technical merit, even though the replacement blades are quite expensive.
