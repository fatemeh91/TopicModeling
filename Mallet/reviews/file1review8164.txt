review/text: How much can you say about a bottle brush? It's flexible, has a fairly long handle, and a nice brush head that allows you to move it around some curves and right spaces, but it will not necessarily fit all the nooks and crannies in certain containers because unless you can manipulate the long handle, you won't be able to bend it enough to fit into the tight spaces. Otherwise, a great product.
