review/text: To review a product like this is not a simple thumbs-up / thumbs-down matter. Product effectiveness can and will vary between different people. The ingredients contained are all reasonably acceptable for human consumption (as the manufacturer suggests, always consult your doctor first).When I have felt under the weather I have taken Echinacea with satisfactory results. Quick Defense should give the same results. The manufacturer seems straighforward with their ingredients list and directions, making no wild claims. That is good reason to choose one brand over another.Will Quick Defense be right for you? Again, consult a doctor to be sure there are no conflicts with other medications you take or conditions you have that would suggest you don't take this supplement, and then make your informed decision to buy it or not.
