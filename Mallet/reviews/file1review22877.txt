review/text: The sweeping part of this Bissell works just fine but as many other reviewers have noted, the handle falls apart if you breathe on it wrong. My husband actually screwed the sections of the handle itself together but now it separates at the point where the handle meets the sweeper. And don't bother reading the directions about how to put this together. The handle problem persists no matter what you do.I'd recommend getting down to your local chain store (as much as I dislike recommending any of them for anything) and get a carpet sweeper with a handle that's in one piece. This one is not worth the hassle.
