review/text: Kiss My Face is well known for their environmentally friendly products, and their Moisture Shave is no exception. Unlike most shaving foam, which uses aerosols that are both harmful to the environment and flammable, Kiss My Face's Moisture Shave is a lotion which uses a standard pump similar to hand soap.The Moisture Shave itself lives up to its name, and has very little odor at all. It has a very pleasant feel on the skin, and works perfectly for shaving. This Moisture Shave even stands up to my thick facial hair if I've let it grow for a few days, something most foams fail at even with fresh razor blades.Switching to a lotion-based shave instead of foam may be a small step for the environment, but it's worth it when you have a product that works this well.
