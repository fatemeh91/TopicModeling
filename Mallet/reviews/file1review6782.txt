review/text: I have used the Body Back Buddy a few times since I purchased it. It can really get to the spots that you can't reach by yourself.The material is a very hard plastic and I think I would like it a little bit better if the plastic was a bit softer so that it "dug into the spot" better.I know I will use it when I feel like I'm really tight across my shoulders and back and it will help between my actual massages.
