review/text: I am an active subscriber to this product (every month). The product comes in tact, and in a timely fashion. I love using this product because it doesn't have any pefumes/dyes in it to aggravate sensitive skin (like my daughter has). I recently priced this product at walmart--for the same packaging, it is $7.49 and with free shipping and the discount from subscribing every month, it really brings the price down and I don't have to lug it home. It's a great convenience and who doesn't like that?
