review/text: I am not an expert on nutritional supplements but everything seems good. Came well sealed and appears as it should. My doctor has me taking Magnesium Citrate while on HCG weight loss diet. I purchased these to save money from buying directly from his office at around $15 for 30 pills. Lost 40 pounds so far and 40 more to go.
