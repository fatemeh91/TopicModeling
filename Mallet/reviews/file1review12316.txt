review/text: I bought the "blue mouse" version of the Itch Zapper from Amazon in 2006. I've been super pleased. It works very well for me.Previously I would suffer a lot from mosquito bites. The itching and swelling lasted about 4 days. I'd tried cortisone creams and creams with benzocaine, and other creams and ointments, and nothing worked.Now if I get a bite I use the Itch Zapper. The itching stops instantly. Sometimes the itching starts again and I use the device again. But after an hour or so the bite doesn't itch any more. There is never any swelling.The tip heats up and it does feel intensely hot for a very brief time, then the heat stops. There are two settings for the level of heat.The price is reasonable. This item takes a 9 volt battery. (Since I only use the Itch Zapper occasionally, I store it with the battery out, and only put it in when I'm using it.)As I understand it, a chemical in the insect's saliva is what causes the itching and swelling, and the heat from the itch zapper breaks down the chemical.I'm so glad I found this item. Thank you Amazon and thank you Itch Zapper!
