review/text: Thank goodness for Slim-Fast! I've lost 40 pounds in just four months on Slim-Fast! Chocolate Royale is great - very rich cocoa flavor! Powder is much more economical than the cans; more versatile, too. Through it in the blender and add 4 or 5 ice cubes for a cold, thick shake that satisfies! Or, reduce ice and add left-over cold coffee from pre-breakfast for a choco-mocha smoothie! Delish!
