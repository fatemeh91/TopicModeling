review/text: Do NOT buy this if you have a short torso. I have had severe PSD with this pregnancy, and this product was recommended by several people including a CNM and an OB. I was well within in the weight/size guidelines for the medium that I purchased. Yet, the lower support band was so stiff and thick that it cut into my skin and was painfully uncomfortable. The straps were way too long and the X that should have crossed in the center of my chest was way up by my collarbone. Even after trying to move everything around so that it was properly positioned, I had no support at all from the product. Somehow the stiffness of the material dug into my skin and still the product wasn't snug enough to provide any support. A very bad design in my opinion.
