review/text: This is my third epilator. I can't imagine removing hair any other way. It removes hair better than waxing..with the convenience of shaving. I use it for underarms, legs and bikini line. Yes, the first time is painful, but after that its smooth sailing. The Emjoi can remove very short hairs. If I can see a hair, I can remove it. With waxing, you have to wait until the hairs get long enough, and them you don't get 100% of them. I've been using this device for over a year, and haven't gotten the ingrown hairs that I got my older epilators. The shape is easy to hold and use. Stop shaving, stop waxing..but this product.
