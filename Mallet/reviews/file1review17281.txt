review/text: Works very well for trimming beards to 9 lengths including a close stubble look. The down side is the battery, NiCD, which suffers from memory effect if improperly charged. If you find a trimmer for about the same price with Lithium or NiMH batteries then get that since they are fool-proof to charge. If you're willing to put up with properly charging this and the price is right, you'll be happy with this one. Like I said it performs very well.NiCD batteries should be fully drained before charging, and fully charged before using; otherwise the battery life will shorten and if done a number of times the battery will stop holding a charge. (I'm guessing reviewers who say the battery stops working after a couple weeks didn't do this) Also during use, NiCD batteries provide steady power until they run out suddenly with little warning. The problem with that is the charge time is 14 to 16 hours, which means even if you use the trimmer the night before, if the battery dies you can't finish the job in the morning without fear of shortening the life of the battery somewhat.But overall it performs very well and if charged properly should work for years and is very cheap; so I only took off 1 star.
