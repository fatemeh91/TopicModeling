review/text: I purchased this Body Back Buddy for my Mom but before I gave it to her I used it for a couple of weeks. Man, I loved this thing. I have a spot under my right shoulder-blade that bothers me something fierce. It feels like it's on fire. My Chiropractor can't fix it and my wife, although she makes it feel much better, doesn't not have the power to press the spot as hard as it needs. The Back Body however gets the spot really well. Nice design, simple to use and very little strength is needed to make it work. This will definitely be going on my Christmas list.Oh, and one more thing. One reviewer said this was made of cheap plastic. That couldn't be farther from the truth. I put tons of pressure on this unit and there is no way anyone could break it. It flexes ever-so slightly but I think that's a good thing.
