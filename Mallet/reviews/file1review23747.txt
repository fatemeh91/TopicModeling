review/text: I have really flat feet, and unfortunately, I get knee pain whenever I walk or run for extended periods of time. I'm planning to get custom orthotics but I thought I'd try these out in the meantime. They've really helped reduce the amount of pain in my knees after a long day of walking or jogging.The only downside to them is that they're a little bit too thick for my flats where I probably need the most arch support. It squishes my feet too much.
