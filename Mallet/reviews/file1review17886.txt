review/text: I was skeptical to try these at first, not knowing how they could possibly help my snoring, allergies, and asthma. My allergies get so bad that it hurts to breathe through my nose at all- I thought some little adhesive strip couldn't possibly alleviate that. However, along with my normal OTC allergy medication, these strips are working wonders. I tried one on a weekend just to see how it worked, and I found not only that it wasn't uncomfortable, but it was actually helping! After the first night I wore one to bed, my husband woke up to tell me he hadn't slept that well since before we'd been married- I hadn't snored at all, and he felt like I was more peaceful and getting a better night's sleep.Not only do these relieve my breathing problems at night, but breathing clearly does indeed help me feel more rested. I absolutely recommend these! Be sure to wash your face immediately before applying a strip, and if removal is difficult, use a little warm water or baby oil to avoid getting a raw mark on your nose.
