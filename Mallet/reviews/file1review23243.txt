review/text: As I put this sweeper back into the packaging to return to Amazon, I could not help but think how much we have surrendered our country and quality to China. To save a few bucks here and there, we've settled for stuff that would have been laughed at a few decades ago. Bissell used to be a quality product, but now it's just another piece of light gauge, doesn't-fit, falls-apart, never-works manufactured crap from the Chinese. The handle kept falling apart at mid-section...funny part was I could not get the other part to come undone to fit into the package for return. If only the rest of the item was as well-built. I guess I will keep looking for a decent sweeper at garage sales and estate sales, hoping to find something made in the 60's.
