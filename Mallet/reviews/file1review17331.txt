review/text: I thought this would be cheaply made for the price I paid, but I am pleasantly surprised. The scroll wheel works great when adjusting the blade height. Take off the blade cover and it trims a fine line. It doesn't take long to charge and no batteries to mess with. The only thing I miss is a case to put it in, but for the price, how can I complain?
