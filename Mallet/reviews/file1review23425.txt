review/text: I have been a nurse for 20 years and I use my stethoscope many times a day as all other ER / ICU nurses do.I have had stethoscopes which have cost me more than $300.00,I have even tried my friends digital ones but I this thing is amazing.It is truethat one can even hear through dressings and clothing.I love it and it is especially great for PEDS patients because they like to look at it and put it on their chest .I believe because it is so colorful it is somehow less intimidating.I love it and so do my patients.
