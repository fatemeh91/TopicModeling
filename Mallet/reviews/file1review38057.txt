review/text: Although this is a good machine, unless you know CPR and you are not in panic mode, you MIGHT have problems. The BIGGEST downside to this unit is TWO PADS. My advice is to do some research on the ZOLL AED PLUS. It costs a bit more ([...]) HOWEVER we are talking about a medical device literally used to save one of your family members (or your) life. So in my opinion, this is not the time to try and save a few dollars.The biggest difference, and what sold me was that ZOLL uses ONE LARGE PAD for exact placement of the electrodes AND where to place your hands for CPR. Plus it tells you if your compressions are deep enough while doing CPR. It will tell you to push harder or if you are correctly doing chest compressions. It is literally IDIOT PROOF.If this is all you can afford, by all means buy it, but if you can afford the extra $[...] then I would seriously look at the ZOLL. My son is a Paramedic RN and he said ZOLL, nothing else, for us to have in our home and I trust his judgment on the easiest machine to use when someone is probably going to be a bit panicked. I did the research and he was (as usual) correct about the ease of use over ALL the other models I looked at.Hope the info helps.
