review/text: so far this is the only mask that i can use with my cpap machine and it is simply amazing.. I love the fact that there are raised pockets for the eyes so you can blink without your eyelashes hitting the mask. I see most complaints are that it is made cheaply.. I don't care if i have to buy one every few months.. it is simply better than any mask i have tried and literally have resolved much of my sleep problems since using this mask and light therapy in the morning.. getting up from a very dark space and then having the bright light therapy has changed my life. and i've been to sleep studies for years. The sleep study group at Cornell Medical Center suggested trying this therapy and i now am sleeping better than in years... i feel like it is somewhat of a miracle !!
