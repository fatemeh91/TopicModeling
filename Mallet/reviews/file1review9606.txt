review/text: These protein bars are ideal for me. Quite high in protein (a necessity, being vegetarian). One bar is my breakfast each week day. They taste good enough and leave no after-taste. To date (after two years), I have only ordered two flavors, chocolate chocolate chunk and chocolate fudge deluxe. I had tried most other protein bars and they did not measure up to Met-Rx.After shipping, etc., the price comes out to about $2.67 per bar. That certainly beats the $4 - $5 at a store.One thing to watch out for: occasionally I receive the box and all of the bars have been exposed to heat and have melted inside their wrappers. They are warped and turn to some crystallized goo. I am assuming that the shipped has let my package get exposed to too much sun/heat. Each time it happened, though, Amazon replaced the box. So I keep ordering them, going through 18 or so boxes each year. I follow the recommendation on the packaging to drink eight ounces of water after each bar.
