review/text: This is a good device for getting to those knots in your back. The material is has just the right flexibility and the two different size hooks are just the right size. I do wish one of the knobs were larger, but they are good none the less.The only con I would say about this product is that the instruction manual leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, just using it you will figure it out.
