review/text: I got this organizer to make the most of the tiny space we have in our home. It really is a nice design, and it has a lot of potential. I love this organizer, I wish that it came in other colors besides white and green. A blue and pink might be ideas, but for now it's green. I figure I will even use this after my tot is out of diapers, to store things like toys or little things in the closet if I hang it from the rod.
