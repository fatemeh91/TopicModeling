review/text: This sock aid has been in use now for about a month, following my total hip replacement. It is poorly constructed, with light-weight straps and poorly fitted fabric over the plastic body. The fabric is not bonded to the body, and stretches easily, resulting in wrinkles. It has already required some repairs to the seams. It took a fair amount of trial and error to figure out how to make it work, as well as selecting socks with enough stretch to accommodate the requirements of this device. I purchased a similar device at the same time, (Carex), which was slightly more expensive, but is very well made, with heavy-duty straps and securely attached fabric covering the plastic body. However, the Maddak actually works better when putting on a sock; it appears that the fabric, either because of the wrinkles or the type of fabric itself, adheres to the sock better, so it frequently completely installs the sock, while the Carex frequently requires pulling up the sock by hand after the sock aid detaches from the sock. So I would give the Maddak four stars for function, but only two stars for construction.
