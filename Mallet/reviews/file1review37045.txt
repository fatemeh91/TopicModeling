review/text: I didn't particularly like this deodorant. It didn't seem to last all day and I had a hard time telling if I had enough on because it goes on clear. It does stay clear all day so you can wear tank tops without having your armpits all white. That's the only advantage I saw though. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends and family.
