review/text: I bought this sweeper with the intention to use it in the bathroom to pick hair up off the floor in between bathroom cleanings and vacuuming. This sweeper was not very good at picking up hair from the tile floor. However, I found it's great for a quick clean up elsewhere around the house. Especially on low pile area rugs. It's quiet so the baby doesn't wake up. I'm amazed at how much dog hair and crumbs it gets. It's also light enough for my 22-month toddler to use. I finally have a cleaning helper!
