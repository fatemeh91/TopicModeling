review/text: I had used my previous Panasonic trimmer for over two years before it was lost with my luggage at the airport. I purchased the same model as a replacement, and as a previous reviewer has stated, the blade design has been changed from the earlier model. What used to be an efficient, quick trimmer has now become a waste of both time and money. Do not buy this model, spend your money on another product.
