review/text: The bandage feels like a quality product with the tape portion looking very strong, yet flexible on the skin... Steps ahead of the old plastic-like bandages. This product will work well for very small wounds, as the actual gauze portion is only a short strip within the bandage. Unfortunately, I didn't find it to be very effective at waterblocking, as it started falling off my hand after the first light handwashing.
