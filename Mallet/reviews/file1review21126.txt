review/text: I am so disappointed in this product. It sells itself as automatic, but it is NOT. You have to manually hold down the button to get it to produce heat. Who wants to have to hold down a button to get it to work? There were versions sold as manual that described this. I purposely looked for one that was automatic to avoid having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work. This product was sold as an automatic version (even the box says automatic). Having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work doesn't qualify as automatic in my opinon. I feel like I have been misled. I am very disappointed. I can only imagine use of this item on a regular basis would be very uncomfortable, defeating the point of trying to releave tension. Do not purchase this if you are truly looking for a hands-free item (beyond initially turning it on).
