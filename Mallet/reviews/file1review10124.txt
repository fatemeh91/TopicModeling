review/text: Yuck...this stuff tastes terrible. I have tried mixing it into smoothies, water, fruit juice, coffee and cereal, and no matter how I try, I can't get rid of the bitter, dusty taste. I find the taste to be a combination of bitter sawdust, cardboard and nasty herbs, that is impossible to hide in any food. I am sure it is very healthy and good for digestion, but I just cannot stand the flavor it adds to foods and beverages. It does not dissolve completely, so anything it is mixed in to becomes extremely gritty. I think I'll stick to ground flaxseed and wheatgerm to add extra nutrients and fiber to my diet.
