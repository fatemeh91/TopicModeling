review/text: This worked wonders up until the other day - I had been using it regularly for about 3 months, then was using it the other day and the rotation function stopped working. For me, this was a extra benefit, since I mainly need the vibrating bunny head part of it to finish. So I will continue to use that part of it. With the no returns policy on this, no replacement for a broken product. Other reason I am giving it a 4 is because it is a bit on the loud side when you have the rotation function on. I usually had to do this under the covers or when a fan on so my neighbors don't hear!
