review/text: I was tipped off about this product on a site ranking "best lubes for anal sex." I can attest, it works great for all types of sex, and for "conventional" (i.e. vaginal) sex, I haven't found a lubricant that even comes close. Use with toys, condoms, and especially on skin. Doesn't feel sticky, oily, and outlasts all other lubes. Lube stains on material will wash out with pretty much any detergent I've tried; but as one other reviewer noted, OxyClean always succeeds when other detergents fail. In summary, truly a great product.
