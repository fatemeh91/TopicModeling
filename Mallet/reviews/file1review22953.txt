review/text: I don't really know why this sweeper has such good reviews. It okay at picking up dirt but it's nothing special. The bristles aren't strong enough to be of much help and where the 2 tray is nice, it didn't seem to help when sweeping backward. I've had a few of these of the years and this is by far the flimsiest. Not only does the handle come off but the stupid brush doesn't want to stay on. I'm giving it 3 stars because it was cheap and met the minimal requirements. If I had it to do over I wouldn't even consider buying this.
