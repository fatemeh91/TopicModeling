review/text: This lip balm is almost too good to be true. I didn't know that my lips could feel this good!! Wow. I bought this as a whim, and I'm so glad that I did. I've been a burt's bees junkie for almost 10 years now, and I finally stepped out of my boundaries! Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth every single penny. I got mine for $8 at a local organic store, so check at one of those first since this particular one is a little more expensive. I put it on at night, and in the morning my lips are smooth and silky! It lasts all day, although it's hard to resist the urge to reapply. If you're looking for your Holy Grail, try this lip balm, you will NOT regret it!Ingredients: Sunnflower Oil, Shea butter, Cocoa seed butter, castor oil, olive oil, vegetable glycerides phosphate, hydrogenated vegetable oil, candilla wax, vanilla extract, camauba wax, tocopheryl acetate.
