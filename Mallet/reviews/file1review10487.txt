review/text: What are you going to do--you bought this expensive toothbrush, and now you have to pay for the heads. You have to take it apart EVERY DAY to clean it; I bought a sonicare cover to keep it dry. The brush heads don't last as long as they're supposed to, but I'm a vigorous brusher (they last me a month and a half at best)..
