review/text: I have used several products from this brand, Physician Formulas, and found all of them superior products. This particular product I decided to try along with my sleep disorder (PLMS-Periodic Limb Movement Syndrome, of which I have a severe case) rx meds (Requip)5-HTP 50 mg, 60 capshoping to not have to increase my dose. They worked so well, I went in and told my MD, who did some research and not only approved but said he was going to recommend them to other patients.
