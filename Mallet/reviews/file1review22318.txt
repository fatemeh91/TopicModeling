review/text: I love these wipes. I followed the directions of other reviewers and made sure I wiped whatever area I was using the wipe on so it wouldn't look streaky. I used an inexpensive microfiber towel. I had no problems and I'd say it made my stainless steel fridge, microwave, and oven all pretty clean and shiny. There were a couple tiny spots that you could still faintly see on my fridge that had been there from little fingers but you have to go up real close and stare before you'd notice it. I think they were there so long that it was really difficult to completely get rid of it. Overall, a great product and I'd buy it again. I'm considering buying the spray only because I'm thinking it might last me a little longer??
