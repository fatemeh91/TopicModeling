review/text: The flexible nature of the product created a gagging sensation, and no matter how it was adjusted always felt like I would swallow it during the night. I had a difficult time even trying to figure out which end went up & which went down. I tried it for one week, then gave up. I went back to the solid units which you boil. Do not believe the hype on these. When I tried to return it I got the run-around and when I finally sent it back the company claimed they neverreceived it, so I'm out $39.99 The company is as sketchy as their product.
