review/text: i am absolutely in love with this product! although the first couple times i used it, i was kind of afraid of this contraption, i have gotten use to it. the pain is barable, on you're thighs it does hurt more. the only thing is that i never feel completely smooth. i always have a few stubbles that are too short or thin and this epilator cant get it..
