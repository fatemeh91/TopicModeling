review/text: It is a good product. I bought it for my parents and so far they did not have any problem with error messages or inaccurate readings. However, one cannot measure the blood pressure on your own you need someone to help you put the cuff on your arm.I wish it was more easy for someone to do it by themselves and have it position well too. Overall a good product to buy.
