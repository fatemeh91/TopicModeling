review/text: Super-easy beard and mustache trimming - just set dial from 1 to 9 and go. I think I've had to charge it once, maybe twice in 16 months or so. If I'd known how handy this little device would be, I'd have bought one years ago. (I wish I could say the ladies have noticed the better-groomed look. (;-) )
