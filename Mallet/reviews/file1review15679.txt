review/text: I started taking Capisette Caps about a year and a half ago. After taking prescriptions my doctor recommended for over 5 years; swelling inmy ankles and feet kept getting worse. After surfing the internet, I pulled up Progressive Health site and read about Capisette Caps and how theproduct might help control the swelling. I talked to my doctor and he said for me to "go for it." I immediately ordered the product. I taketwo capsules each day. I have decided to decrease it to one tablet each day for a couple of weeks to see if it will be a correct dosage for me.
