review/text: I have been using this product for a number of years, and am just preparing to buy the third. I wore out the first two. After two other brands of rechargeable razors, plus many traditional razors and shave creams, the System 4000 just cuts my beard more closely than any other product. My wife does not get scratched from my tough beard stubble, and that is the final test. The charge holds for about 5 days, so on travel I carry the stand-up charger. The pop-up trimmer works great. My only concern is that Wahl may some day stop making electric razors then what would I do?
