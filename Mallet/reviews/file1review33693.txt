review/text: Do not buy it! It is a real POS... Worked for about 5 minutes. Then the spray stopped dead. Pump started to smell like burning out.There was plenty of water in the tank - and the tank was properly connected.On occasion - a weak spray would come out.Useless Junk.There is a reason for 47 one-star reviews - now 48.Its going out in the trash tomorrow. If I hadn't stupidly thrown out the box, I would have instantly returned it.2/3/2013 Update:After my disasterous experience with the WP-65, I went looking for another Brand - any Brand.. Didn't see anything I liked. There sure is an opportunity for someone to make one of these things that works..Anyway, I noticed the 'kids model' WP-260 has far fewer one-star reviews as a percentage. Controls are on the housing itself (The Pressure control is continuous - not just 1-2-3..). Maybe the pump is different - as its rated 110-240 VAC. Decided to take a chance - and bought one. (Saved box this time..:>)While the reservoir is smaller - it is sufficient. After four uses - it still works.. more than could be said with the WP-65. The pump is MUCH quieter. Top pressure may be slightly less than my previous old waterpik (would no longer hold a nozzle - stated blowing off everytime I used it.. reason for replacement) - but it is still high.If you - like me - found the WaterPik to be the only design suitable, skip the 65 and get the 260. Maybe it will at least last a few months. (I will update again when this one fails...)2/10/2013 - another week, and the 260 is still working! A minor miracle..
