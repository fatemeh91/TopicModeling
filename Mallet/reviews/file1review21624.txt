review/text: I used to love giving my daughter a bath when she was a newborn...it was so easy! Then as she started to become mobile, it was a little less fun - for me anyway! I got this tub when she was about 4 months old and I haven't looked back (she's now 14 months). It's SO much easier to wash her hair since she has something soft to lean back on. I'm also a bit paranoid about germs and it makes me feel more comfortable that she's in a tub that only she uses (vs. the whole family). It's wonderful to take on trips (especially to hotels...yuk), but just remember to bring a hand pump. Also, we're having a water shortage now in GA and this uses so much less water than filling the whole bathtub. Can't say enough about this product!
