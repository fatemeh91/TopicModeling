review/text: I have owned and used other eye masks but this configuration appealed to me because in was less bulky and lighter than what I have used. The outward curve over the eyes is great - no pressure on the eye lid / eye ball at all. And the light weight material and the smaller shape compared to other quilted eye masks, makes it cooler on the face. I would wake up sweating with the quilted eye masks and that is what appealed to me about this one - it covered less of the face and forehead. Anyone who is interested in an eye mask for home or traveling - this is the one to get!Bucky 40 Blinks Mask - Ultralight Eye Mask - Nouveau
