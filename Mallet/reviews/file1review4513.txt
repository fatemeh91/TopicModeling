review/text: This razor was a huge disappointment for me. Ironically, the Fusion is particularly bad at the two things it is advertised as being particularly good at: close, comfortable shaving, and shaving hard-to-reach places.The blades are terrible. Right out of the box, the blades caught on my beard and made it painful to shave. It felt as if the razor was very dull. I switched blades after two shaves and the replacement was just as bad. Comparitively, the Mach 3 blades feel great for as many as 10 uses for me. Not comfortable at all, and because of the pain, I couldn't shave as close.As for using this razor to shave hard to reach areas, they must be kidding! Compare the size of the Mach 3 with the Fusion. If the Mach 3 is a tight-cornering sports car, the Fusion is a school bus. To accomodate the five blades the razor pad is so large it's difficult to share accurately. And the "trim" blade on the back is simply dangerous - the placement makes it much more likely to cut your fiinger, but the plastic on either end of the blade itself makes it unlikely to shave your beard.Not worth the money. The blades arms race should end now and these guys should focus on sharper, harder, razor blades and simpler razor design.
