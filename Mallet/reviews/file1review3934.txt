review/text: My experience after using them 3 days: My teeth are getting whiter. No pain. No sensitivity. My hygenist said people with thin teeth or thin enamel experience the most sensitivity. The strips are very thin and shift easily so don't move your mouth when wearing them. I make sure the strips are on straight and I press the strips into the cracks between my teeth to insure even whitening. The peroxide will slightly foam in your mouth. I think the peroxide works best if you don't get too much saliva on the strips. I salivate like crazy with the strips in my mouth so I lay on my back and look at the ceiling for the whole 30 minutes letting the saliva pool in the back of my mouth. I occasionally swallow to limit the pooling of saliva or use a rolled up paper towel to blot out the saliva. The goal being to keep the strips from getting diluted with too much saliva and keep the strips from shifting around in your mouth. The strips seem to fit my teeth well and should whiten all teeth that show when I smile.
