review/text: I'm sure that this is probably a good product. However there are two things to consider when ordering: 1) this product has aspartame in it so anyone on a restrictive regiment or has a sensitivity to this sweetener should be-aware. 2) I ordered this product twice and twice they sent the wrong flavor. How chocolate looks like banana is a mystery. Had to return twice!
