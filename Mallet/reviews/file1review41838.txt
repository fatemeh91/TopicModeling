review/text: Overall, I think this toothbrush is a really good one. It leaves my teeth feeling really clean (much more than a manual brush), and it is fun to use. It is not too loud, in my opinion, and the battery life seems to be good so far (I have only had it for a couple of months). The polisher has also been giving me good results. This is my first power toothbrush, so I don't have much to compare it to, but as far as I can tell, it seems to be a good product. I only have a couple of minor complaints. I wish it could make a lounder noice when the 30 seconds for each section of the mouth or the whole 2 minutes are up. The sound it makes is so light that at times I don't notice it and keep brushing much longer. A cap of some kind would also have been nice. I am always afraid the toothbrush will fall on the floor and get dirty, so I have to completly remove the head and place it in its case as a precaution. I wish it could also be used for flossing, instead of having to use the separate hummingbird. It is also a bit pricy, but I guess it is worth the money.
