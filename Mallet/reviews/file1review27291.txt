review/text: I've bought several tubs of this protein and really enjoy it. I have NEVER had a protein powder that mixes this easily, which really makes a huge difference. The taste is awesome as well, maybe a tad on the sweet side, but that can be easily adjusted by adding a little more milk, water, etc. I usually mix a scoop with oatmeal every morning. A great buy in my opinion.
