review/text: This is a wonderful skin cream. I've been using it for about 3 months. No longer does my facial skin ever look tired or dry, and my fine-lines have faded significantly. And an unexpected bonus: I haven't had any stress-related acne since I began using it. I find the smell quite pleasant, and it absorbs so nicely. I've been recommending this product to all of my friends.
