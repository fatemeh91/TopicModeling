review/text: I guess I am guilty of having too high an expectation, or maybe just stubborn hair. Either way I am not impressed. I still have to tweeze after using the strips. I made the initial mistake of trying to use the stipps repeatedly on the same area when the the strips didn't get it all the first time....big mistake. I'll use them to do an overall, but tweezing is still necessary.Maybe I just didn't hold my mouth right...
