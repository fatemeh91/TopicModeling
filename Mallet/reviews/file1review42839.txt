review/text: I had been taking Primal Defense for almost a week, when I started getting nasty symptoms of being glutened. At first I couldn't figure out what the trigger was. I've been gluten-free for 12 years, and I'm a rigorous label-reader.Then I double-checked this product, the only new addition to my diet. It actually says "vegetarian, gluten-free" on the label, so it looks safe. But there's also this tiny asterisk on the nutrition percentages label that says, "The culture medium for probiotics is dairy; bacterial proteases utilize WHEAT, dairy, and soy. Culture mediums are generally consumed during the fermentation process."Not good enough, Primal Defense. Fix that label ASAP. Many celiac chat rooms show complaints like mine.So I'm tossing my bottle. Definitely NOT gluten-free. They may make a great probiotic, but if you are CELIAC, STAY AWAY.
