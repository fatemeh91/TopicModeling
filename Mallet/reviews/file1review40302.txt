review/text: I take these (3) just before a workout so I don't catabolyse my muscles and just after a workout (5-8 pills) to recover and lower my cortisol. I drink a little green tea with them before the workout, to help them go down easier. Sometimes my stomach is just a little upset for a minute or two, after I've taken them, but it goes away fast. I'm used to them now, and I would miss them if I didn't have them. I take a protein drink after my workout with them, and there is no upset stomach at all. I've read that these BCAA's are very good for you, and I go with that. Again, they're not a miracle pill, but with everything else I do, they have their place and I think they're working well for me. I have a subscription through amazon, so it lowers the price. I'm pleased with them.
