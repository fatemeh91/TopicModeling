review/text: After making a dramatic change in my eating plan and increasing my level of physical activity, my cholesterol dropped to a very healthy range. I was still taking the cholesterol medication I had been on for a couple decades. Under the supervision of my doctor, I quit taking the medication, and my levels adjusted to just beyond what's considered healthy under current standards. I added Cholestene to my daily supplements, and within weeks I was back within a healthy range. Would any other product have done the same? I don't know. But this one seems to work for me. I am no longer taking statins, and my bloodwork reports good cholesterol levels. Hooray!!!
