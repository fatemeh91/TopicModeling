review/text: This item is false. It says in the title that it is COMPACT HEAD, so I ordered 10, as compact head toothbrushes are hard to find. Shipping is very expensive. When I received the toothbrushes, they were NOT compact head, instead they are standard head. I cannot use these toothbrushes. Because this is a MARKETPLACE seller, I have to pay the return shipping if I return them, making these the most expensive toothbrushes ever. American RX is a very unreliable company. I would avoid doing business with them. A deceitful Amazon page
