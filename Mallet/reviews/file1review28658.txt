review/text: I started lifting about 3 months ago and i decided to get this mix on a friends recommendation. I bought the Double Dark Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream. I wanted to share my favorite shake recipes. The chocolate can stand on its own with just some skim milk. I will usually do one of these recipesChocolate Banana1. One Scoop of chocolate powder2. Banana3. 2 table spoons of plain non-fat yogurt4. Skim Milk5. IceMocha!1. One Scoop chocolate Powder2. One spoonfull of instant espresso3. 2 tablespoons of plain non-fat yogurt4. Skim Milk5.
