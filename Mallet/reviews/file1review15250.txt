review/text: Over the years, I've sampled probably 50 varieties of energy bars, and the Balance cookie dough flavor top the list. The provide the variety of nutrition I want in terms of the combination of protient, fiber, fats, and vitamins. Best of all they don't have lingering artificial taste I get from most other energy bars. Moreover, these don't require gnawing to chew and swallow. The only aspect I would improve upon would be the sugar content, which though not bad by energy bar standards, could probably be a few grams lower without sacrificing taste.
