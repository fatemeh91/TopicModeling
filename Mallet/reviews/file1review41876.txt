review/text: I have been blessed with good teeth my whole life. Most all of my dental expenses are for routine cleanings. The use of a good cleaning instrument is paramount for maintaining healthy teeth.The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 is a high quality electric toothbrush with a selection of utility tips for various applications. It sports a clean design. It is easy to use and clean. Over the years, I have brushed with most of the top rated electric toothbrushes. Oral-B is still my favorite. It works.
