review/text: (I purchased this product at my local grocery store, not here on Amazon if that matters at all.)Aw, I feel bad that so many people have had a bad experience with this stuff as I've had good luck with it so far! I've run a few loads now with this detergent and it seems to be working well for our household. I do rinse the dishes before loading them, but I don't do any crazy scrubbing unless there is some stuck-on or baked-on food that I know needs to be removed via hand washing. I also use plain white vinegar as a rinse aid, so perhaps that helps as well.I have seen some reviewers comment about the possibility of water type (hard water, well water, etc.) having an impact on this product's effectiveness, so maybe they're on to something. I live in a northern US coastal state with public water supply, so if you're in a similar environment maybe give it a try and see how you fare.To be fair, it does say right on the bottle that you should scrub any stubborn food residue before loading the dishes. Also, make sure that you're not overloading the machine, and that you're leaving adequate space between the dishes so that the soap and water can work properly. Rinsing your dishes briefly before you load the dishwasher is kind of a good idea regardless of which detergent you use just as a means of preventing plumbing issues with your machine.
