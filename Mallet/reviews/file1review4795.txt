review/text: I love miracle greens. I've been putting it in my smoothies for about a month straight now, and I really notice a difference. I have more energy, my hair is thicker and shinier, my nails are thicker. This may also be attributed to my overall healthier diet as of late but I'm sticking to the macro greens powder! I also use miracle reds daily, both are great products.
