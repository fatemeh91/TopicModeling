review/text: I have suffered from Irritable Bowel(IBS) for the last 18 years )have tried a litany of products to minimize the symptoms. So let me be clear when I say, NOTHING, but Nothing works better to manage the symptoms of IBS than this singular product (I've used the product for 9 years now). That said, at a minimum, it must be used at least twice a day (morning & evening) to derive any benefit. Otherwise, your results will be haphazard and mixed at best.Additionally, you'll derive further benefit if you can avoid your trouble foods (everyone is different... for me the worst culprit is High Fructose Corn Syrup, the most vile product ever added to the American Food Supply). You'll also derive more benefit if you keep your intestinal flora balanced. To do so, take a product like PB8 (a ProBiotic Acidophilus) conveniently sold here:PB 8 120 caps. Take it the same two times a day you do the Acacia fiber.Lastly, I'll comment to those who complain about the difficulty mixing the fiber with water. One, it helps immensely to put the product in before you add the water (counterintuitive I know). Two, You're not limited to mixing it with a liquid. Sprinkle it on your cereal. Put it on your Spaghetti. Its pretty tasteless and won't alter the taste of any of your meals. The point is to get it into your system so it can do its work. For those who think its too much trouble, I'd ask what is more inconvenient. The 20 seconds spent mixing it with water or the 2 hours you're going to spend locked in the bathroom groaning and hating your life? The math is pretty simple from where I stand.So, give it a try. Follow the directions, use it regularly and you WILL FIND RELIEF. Promise.
