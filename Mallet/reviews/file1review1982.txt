review/text: These bibsters things are just great, though they can get pricey. We reuse them if my son doesn't make too much of a mess. They're big enough to protect his clothing, and leakproof too. Just try feeding your baby outside in a public place, and you'll see why these things are indispensable for today's parents.The velcro-like neck seal is pretty strong, though my son _can_ pull it off after some effort at 10 months.
