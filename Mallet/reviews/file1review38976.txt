review/text: What does it take to get this razor back in the stores? Just like the other comments, it is the best razor I have ever used. Is Schick losing money on it because of it's efficiency and durability? Could that be why poor quality razors are only available for the same price? I would rather pay a couple more pennies and get a quality razor than pay less for nothing.Please return the Personal Touch razor to the stores.
