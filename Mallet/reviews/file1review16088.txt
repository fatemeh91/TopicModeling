review/text: These plates are perfect. We are using them for regular meals and they hold us very well.Notes:High Temp Food: Use 2, just save the lower one before discarding.Microwave: No problem. Follow High temp if there is any sauce or liquid in the dish.Storage and/or use: Place a paper towel under the stack. Put the stack of plates face down, so its more hygienic when you use them, (without touching the next unused plate)
