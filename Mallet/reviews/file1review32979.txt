review/text: There are only two of us for laundry, but the box lasts us over a year. When we bought our washer and dryer in 2006, the salesman told us we needed to a different type of soap than we were used to. He also said not to use too much, just one spoon (included in box). I've always found detergent to call for more than necessary anyway. If it's a really dirty load I do use more, but that's rare. I have compared prices for this type of detergent at local stores and this is a way better deal. My husband gets his work clothes pretty dirty and they always come out clean. I have never used a different brand in my high efficiency machine and never will if I can help it.
