review/text: Well, I went ahead and ordered this product b/c I thought it would be my last resort. I thought I could shed these 10 pounds I've been struggling w/ in the past few months, but I haven't had much luck. I was jogging, swimming, eating right...nothing was working so my motivation started to sink into the hole.I finally received my long awaited package in the mail yesterday and went ahead and popped one. I couldn't believe it! I wasn't thinking about food, my cravings for sweets were put on the back burner, and I've already lost 1.5 pounds in 1 day, although it may be water weight, but who cares. It's now keeping me motivated to lose those last 8.5 pounds.I tried Dexatrim a long time ago when they came in those red boxes, but I didn't think they worked and I didn't get my hopes for this product. But, I must say, I have to give these 5 stars. How exciting!! :)
