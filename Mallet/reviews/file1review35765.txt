review/text: I have bought all kinds of orthotics; even custom made and these are the best for me. I don't leave work in all that pain in my feet as I did before and I love that. I have an hour ride home from work and when I get home I can barely stand on my feet, it was like trying to stand on sharp stones and nails in your bare feet. Not now! I love them!
