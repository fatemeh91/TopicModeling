review/text: I bought the Body Back Buddy after a friend of mine let me borrow their Thera Cane, which I loved. I bought The Body Back Buddy thinking it would be superior to the Thera Cane due to the advanced design. However, now having used both, I would have bought the Thera Cane instead. With that said, I do use my Body Back Buddy often.
