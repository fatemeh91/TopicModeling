review/text: I have had this product for over a year now. I love it. It is girthy so it takes some getting used to, but the rotation is very powerful and the vibrations are also great. The down side is that sometimes the clit stimulator can be painful as it is not very soft and flexible. The lowest speed is also quite intense so sometimes takes a few minutes before I can apply it directly. I use this on a very regular basis as my husband is deployed. He and I have played with it on multiple occasions as well. The handle is long enough for him to hold which is awesome. Obviously it has gotten alot of use and still looks new and shows no signs of breaking. The battery life is very good. It is quiet and powerful. The only downside is that is never really "breaks in" Very stiff and can at times be painful. For the price this is the best "Rabbit" on the market hands down.
