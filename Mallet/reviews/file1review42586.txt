review/text: BACKGROUNDThe first protein powder I purchased was from GNC. It was both over priced and had too many calories. After spending a couple days looking at a wide range of protein, I came across this option. The main benefit it has over other protein powders is that it only has 117 calories per 24 grams of protein. As I have NO trouble putting on weight, minimizing my calorie count is a main focus.ACTUAL USAGEI have now been using this protein for three weeks and it has given me very satisfying results. I workout in the morning before work: weights/cardio for 90 mins M,W,F; cardio 60 mins Tu,Th; cardio 60 mins Sa,Su; and then I have a protein shake as a meal replacement for breakfast and a supplement for lunch. Even working out as hard as possible I feel fine all morning after the gruesome 45 mins weights / 45 mins cardio workout on M,W,F and only this protein shake for food (note: I take two scoops of M5 Extreme by Cellucore 35 mins before my workout). Adding the protein shake just before lunch enables me to eat a much smaller portion without feeling abused. This then allows me to eat a great dinner of 1,200 to 1,400 calories and maintain solid weight loss and muscle gains (note: I weigh 236 lbs and have lost 12 lbs in 21 days of this workout regimen).Hope this helps someone out there!
