review/text: These bibs are great while on the go. They are disposable which is even better. No need to carry around extra bags to keep dirty bibs in anymore! They are lightweight and take up almost no space at all! They are even good in the house when all the bibs are in the wash. We've ended up doing that quite a few times and we have over 30 washable bibs. Too bad no one thought of these earlier.
