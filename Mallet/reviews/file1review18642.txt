review/text: Was great to be able to purchase Oster combs in the shorter hair lengths (1/4, 3/8) without having to buy a full kit. These combs just snap on and work very well for grooming my dog in a puppy clip/ summer shorter haircut when it's warm. They are durable, too, have never broken one in years of grooming with larger ones (3/4, 1" sizes)
