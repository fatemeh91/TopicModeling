review/text: I am a bit of a dental hygiene freak and was using a Sonicare AND a Braun (model was about $60 when I bought it 5 years ago) electric toothbrush before I bought this one. This has more than replaced both of them.The brush head on this is larger than either of the other two were but I have decided that this is actually a benefit for me; I have a tendency to push too hard on my toothbrush and the larger size of this one has trained me to simply rest the brush head on my teeth and let it do the work rather than applying any pressure.I keep my mouth in good shape but I have had a couple spots on back molars where the gum was beginning to recede. Using this brush has actually reversed that process. I don't know if it is the action of the brush or just that I don't press so hard while using it, either way it is an improvement. Since using this, my mouth always has the "just had your teeth cleaned" feel.It is a little pricey but it is very well made and functions extremely well, so I consider it well worth it.
