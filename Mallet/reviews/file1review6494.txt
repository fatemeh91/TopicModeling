review/text: I saw one of these sitting in a friend's office a while back, and I had to ask what it was. Well, it turns out that I was having one of those days where I had slept wrong, and I had a massive knot in my back. Voila!I don't suffer from this malady often. Perhaps two or three times a year, I get one of those massive knots that restrict my movement for about a week. And then I move on. I guess I always thought it was just a part of life, but this tool has taught me otherwise. I have found that if I really dig one of the knobs into the knot, it helps to relax it and smooth out the pain. I have to be honest, though. A tennis ball in bed works a lot better. But I don't always have the luxury of running home to lay on a tennis ball to relieve my occasional knots. So I keep one of these at work, and it is extremely helpful.I have even found that just because I wake up in the morning with a knot doesn't mean I can't go golfing later in the day.
