review/text: This product is overpriced but I kept it because it does work. I don't use it often but it's nice to have something to activate those unreachable pressure points in my neck and back now and then. Now I don't need to rely on my wife quite as often. I'll come home from a bike ride and use this device to work out the pain in my upper back and lower neck. I'm sure you could come up with something cheaper that would do the same thing as the Body Back Buddy but I don't have the time to look around or make my own device so the $35 was worth it. Therefore, it gets a hesitant endorsement.
