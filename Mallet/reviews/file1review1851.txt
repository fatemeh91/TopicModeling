review/text: This product is wonderful. I easily develop fungal rashes on my arms and legs and this is the only thing that works. I have been to dermatologists and they couldn't find a antifungal cream that was strong enough. It takes a couple of weeks for the rashes to disappear, so be patient, but after dealing with these rashes for years I have learned that this is the only product to use. I only gave it four stars though because I can't stand the eucalyptus scent.
