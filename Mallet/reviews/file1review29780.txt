review/text: I bought this for my dogs. My intent was to cut them open & squeeze on their food but they love o chew them. I just toss one in each of their meals & they love them. I'm sure these would be good for me too but I the gelcap are kinda large....anyway. Reccommended if you dogs needs joint health.
