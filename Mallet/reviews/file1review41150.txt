review/text: I've tried many products in the past that were both in the refrigerated section and as well non-refrigerated. I've been told that you have to be very careful about that.I've done background checks on different companies and Country Life has nothing but the best to offer! They actually have designed many products that I've tried before with GREAT results! This one is no different.I tend to do a lot of product research as there is SO much to offer online.. If you research the different forms of bacteria in this product, it offers specific strains of bacteria that allow an increase of your already exisiting forms as well as introducing new ones.I've had less gas, bloating and more regular visits to the bathroom.I have read that you need to take in a lot more water when you take products like these to increase the effectiveness. I found this to be true with this product as well.
