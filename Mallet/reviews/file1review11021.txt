review/text: So far it seems to be working....I've tried just about everything to cure my chronic bad breath..I brush & floss twice a day, I also scrape my tongue, I use mouthwash, & chew gum, & for years nothing has worked. Based on people's reactions, it seems to be working. I haven't had anyone in the past few weeks cover their nose or casually offer me a piece of gum or a mint. I'm going to use my family members as the true test & ask them to take a whiff. If I pass the sniff test with them, I will be 100% sold on this product. So far I take 2 capsules in the a.m. & 2 in the evening. I'm going to try reducing down to 1 in the a.m. & 1 in the p.m. & see if it still works. Nonetheless, I reiterate so far so good. Also, another reviewer posted that there is one side effect & that is that it makes your bowel movements green...this is true, but if you can live that, the benefits of not having horrible breath far outweigh that one side effect.
