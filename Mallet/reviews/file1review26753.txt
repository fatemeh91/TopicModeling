review/text: I have been training with weights for many years, and protein supplementation has always been an important complement to that.In the old days, I got a large portion of my protein from cans of tuna I would carry (along with a can opener) in my lunchbox to work every day.The advent of protein powder changed that, and I have used several different brands of whey protein isolate over the last ten years, all of them of good quality.But I think that this Optimum Nutrition product is the best of them. I recently ordered my third 5-pound container of the Double Rich Chocolate flavor.The flavor is the best of any chocolate protein supplement I have ever had. The product mixes better than any other powder I have ever used, mixing completely and leaving no clumps (I always mix it, with ice-cold water, in a BlenderBottle, another excellent product which I highly recommend).Additionally, when ordered from Amazon in the 5-pound container, this is an excellent value.I highly recommend this excellent product!
