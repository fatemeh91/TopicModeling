review/text: The taste was slightly chalky but altogether pleasing. After all, it's NOT a candy bar! Also, it would be a great idea to place a set of instructions for use in with the product. I ate one bar for breakfast and one for lunch, but I had no idea if that was a reasonable use of the product. Finally, the bars are easy to open and easy to carry in a purse or a backpack. I'll be buying more Balance Bars for my meals of the future!
