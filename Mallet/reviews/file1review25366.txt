review/text: I got this scale because I started working out with a trainer. Now I'm not a real athletic person (a stay-at-home mom), but I needed to get into shape for an upcoming holiday trip. Well, I was getting a little upset over the fact that though I've been working out, the weight hasn't been coming off like I want. My husband and trainer both say I'm getting toner and to just stop looking at the scale.So I got this scale and darnit wouldn't you know, it was right. My muscle tone has improved and while reading the manual it said not to get frustrated over a lack of losing weight while your muscle mass gets firmer (something like that). Anyway, I love this thing. It's great. So even when my weight fluctuates, I can keep track of my body fat, which I'm happy to say is well within the healthy range.So, yes. I highly recommend this product, especially for those who want to get fit, not just trim.
