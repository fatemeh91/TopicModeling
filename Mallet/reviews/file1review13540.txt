review/text: I wear these inside my paddock boots when I ride my horse and I love them. They give the same calorie burning & toning effect that my toning sneaks do, which I like because I'm wearing riding boots 3+ days a week, and I do feel (and see) the difference when I wear these. I love them so much that I want two more pairs, one for my show boots and one as a back-up! Once you put your shoe on, you can't even feel them, but you know they're working. Plus, because the negative heel technology, which automatically makes your heel lower than your toes, they help with keeping your heels down in the stirrups...a must for equestrians like me!! I'm very happy I purchased these insoles, great buy!
