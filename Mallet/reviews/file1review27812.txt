review/text: Was recommended by a friend and now my turn to recommend it. I really like this product, the chocolate flavor is delicious and the price is right. It is not expensive but that does not mean it is not good. There are other products cheaper but do not recommend them. Not a good taste!!I have used it for several months and these muscles have been growing naturally. I take it with milk, but also I have taken with water or soy milk. Always tastes good!The protein dissolves perfectly smooth.I can tell you that the product is not the best but I give it 4 of 5 stars.There are several flavors to choose which they like Extreme Milk Chocolate, French Vanilla, Double Rich Chocolate, Vanilla Ice Cream, Cookies N 'Cream, Chocolate Mint. I have tried them all and are good and soon find their Favorite. Mine is the Double Rich ChocolateI drink a glass of milk in the morning before going to work and a cup in the afternoon after my workout.
