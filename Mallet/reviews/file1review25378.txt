review/text: If you want low calorie ketchup that actually tastes like ketchup, stay away from this product. It tastes more like a vinegar or cocktail sauce than ketchup. If you're looking to cut calories in the ketchup department, a better option may be Heinz One Carb ketchup (which, though they don't tout it, only has 5 cals per serving while regular ketchup has 15. The buzz on the net is that this stuff actually tastes like original Heinz. I said it with Walden Farms Chocolate Syrup, and I'll say it again with their ketchup: I would rather eat less of normal ketchup than eat larger quantities of Walden farms ketchup.
