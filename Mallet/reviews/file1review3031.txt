review/text: I made the mistake of purchasing a large quantity of these on sale instead of trying a few to see if we liked them first. Now, I'm stuck with 97 condoms that are all but useless. Maybe we'll have a balloon party.First of all, the packages can be difficult to gain access to. I wasn't intoxicated while using these, but they are more difficult to open than our usual durex and sometimes magnums.The fit on these is tight, specifically the girth. While the material is very thin, I can feel the restriction and it is distracting. The length is average and adequate.Worst of all, these lost all lubrications in 5-10 minutes. Twice I had to apply extra lubrication (think baby powder dry) and the most recent time I just gave up and called it a night.Shipping was fairly prompt from the seller, but the questionable packaging, small fit (must have done their product testing in Asia) and extreme lack of lubrication make these the worst condom I have ever used.
