review/text: I had light skin and I thought it was because I was getting older it was getting darker. I went to the dermatologist and he gave me a compound cream that would most likely burn my skin away. I have real bad hyperpigmentation due to some health issues. I was getting really selfconscious, I felt like my skin was turing yellow to match my eyes. So I bought this cream and noticed lighting right away but didn't fix my dark neck or darkness around my mouth. Had to use it more but will keep using till I go through menopause.
