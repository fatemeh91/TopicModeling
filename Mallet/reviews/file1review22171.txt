review/text: I had first ordered this for my bulldog that was having some digestive issues withfrequent bowel movements. I had read during my research that sometimes adding fibercan help with this issue. Well, it didn't seem to help my dog..but later on my dad'sdog was very constipated to the point of not eating for several days. I gave himsome of this and after a couple of days she was back to her old self.
