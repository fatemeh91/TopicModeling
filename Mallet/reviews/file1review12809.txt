review/text: This mask is ultra cold when you take it out of the freezer, to the point where I put a hand towel between the mask and my face. It keeps it's chilly temperature better than many other gel masks I have had, and is pretty good comfort-wise. The heat is more warm than hot, and dissipates rather quickly(about 15 minutes or so), but this is about the same as all other gel masks I have used for heat. All in all this is a great mask, especially for the price. If I decided to buy another mask, so I can always keep one in the freezer, I would probably buy another one of these. Not perfect, but pretty darn close.
