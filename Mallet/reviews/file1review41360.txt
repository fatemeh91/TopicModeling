review/text: These were recommended by my podiatrist as an alternative to $400 custom insoles and to prevent future problems. The fit in all of my low profile flat shoes. They do cause imprints on the insole when it has some padding already.Pay more attention to width than size. I wear a 10 WW. I got the 8.5 -10 thinking it would be right, but needed the 11-12 size so the insole would be wide enough at the heal. If you are on the line and sometimes or usually wear a wide shoe you should go up a size.
