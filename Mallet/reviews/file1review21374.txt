review/text: I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Oral-B Sonic Complete, but I do not love paying $20+ for 3 replacement brush heads at the store. Searching Amazon I found a variety of cheaper options, but most of them seemed to be off-brand and didn't have the best reviews. Then I found this gem, the original Oral-B product at a super duper discount! Yee-haw, I hope they are able to continue offering this product at such a great price.
