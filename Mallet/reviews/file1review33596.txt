review/text: This is phenomenal. I googled and checked all kinds of reviews from different sources and over and over again I heard how good this unit is. It exceeded our expectations. I am very conscientious with my great electric toothbrush and flossing; however, this thing makes my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have and it actually flosses. I also just got two bridges and this is ideal for flushing. It is extremely high-powered at maximum and I have used it there and at the lower speeds. Works amazingly well wherever it is set. If something goes wrong with it, I will immediately get another. I've had other Waterpiks in the past and been very happy with them, but this one is leagues better and I won't buy another one except this.
