review/text: I absolutely love these things. My buddy had some a while back and I've been looking for them ever since.He originally called them, "Cuban Walking Sticks." Took me a while to find these chew sticks.Love the menthol.Love the flavor.The toothpick is also very sturdy and won't fall apart.
