review/text: We recently purchased a second toilet trainer for our other bathroom because we liked the first one so much. This toilet insert is totally adjustable by moving a plastic dial so you can get it to fit snugly on your toilet seat, which means it does not move around on your toddler when he is trying to sit on it. We have used ours on an elongated toilet seat and on a round toilet seat and it worked great on both seats. This toilet trainer is a million times better than all the others found in stores which move around on the seat and scare young children because they aren't stable. I returned two other types of toilet inserts before finding the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer. It is definitely worth the money!!
