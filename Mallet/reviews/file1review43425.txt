review/text: I ordered Dynarex Triangular Bandages, I received Ever Dixie triangular bandage. I contacted seller he tells me they are Dynarex, I have purchased Dynarex triangular bandages before. Dynarex puts there name on everything they sell, these were just generic in a plastic bag no labeling at all. Unless you knew what they were you would not. Would I buy again NO not only did they lie about the product they charge way to much for shipping
