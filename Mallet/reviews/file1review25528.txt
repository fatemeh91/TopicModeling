review/text: Everyone has an Uncle Walter. Great sense of humor, helps you fix things, wears Aqua-Velva. You just love him to death, but he's got twigs growing out of his nose, and more hair IN his ears than around them.Well, now you can help get that fella on the road to suave. Get him a Panasonic brand Nose and Ear Hair Groomer.You see, I too had that problem. To solve it I tried the small, blunt scissors--Nope, too many nosebleeds. I even tried that German Spring Clamp thing--imagine an Epilady for your nose, yanking the hairs out by the roots! In desperation I nabbed a Panasonic. And I am VERY pleased with the results.Helpful Hint: Always use a battery with some juice left in it. If you use a tired, half-drained one, the blades grind slower and the result is more like the Epilady thing.The Panasonic is also very easy to clean. It has a nose-friendly design, works well to trim that Uni-brow and it evens out your mustache very nicely.It may cost a few more bucks than those 'designer' groomers you see around, but in the long run you'll be happy with a well-designed tool that does the job well.
