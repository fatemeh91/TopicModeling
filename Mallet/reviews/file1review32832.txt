review/text: it's taken me nearly 2 years to start losing my baby weight. tried various ways, but too much effort is involved any other way. it suits me so well as i ADORE milk shakes and chocolate. plus i'm lazy - not with my kids, but with myself. i was skipping breakfast daily - now i look forward to a shake when i get up. i'm definitely hungry 4 hrs afterwards. but i haven't gone 4 hrs without eating for so long, that's a miracle within itself! i blend it with loads of ice - the vanilla and chocolate royale flavors are delicious - though the chocolate is also good, but the royale is slightly better (the chocolate is slightly less chocolatey and more milky). i find this easy to stick to - i eat a fair amount at night and also snack at night - weight is still coming off. i've been doing it for 6 wks and lost 18lbs (started at 187lbs, now 169lbs) still got 29lbs to go, but not daunted by that any more. this is all done with NO exercise. once it slows down i will try and exercise too. FYI there are so many people now that get paid to write reviews i am always dubious about any good reviews - I want to assure you that i am not being paid. i understand that this diet won't work for every one as there is a lack of variety - but that's fine with me as long as chocolate is involved!
