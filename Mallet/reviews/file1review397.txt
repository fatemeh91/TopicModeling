review/text: I've seen a few reviews complaining of the smell of this product. It does have a slight rubber smell but its certainly not overpowering and I don't even notice it except for when I first take it out of the package. It IS however on the large size. Some sort of lube would definitely be recommended. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase. Totally worth the price.
