review/text: This is a great product to keep at your desk in the office or in a briefcase or laptop bag. It is very handy and works well in getting stains out immediately after spills. I have used this on several shirts and pants and it has always got the entire stain out.It works by pressing the tip down into the clothes, which releases some of the liquid stain remover. Then, you use the tip of the pen to rub the liquid in and remove the stain. You are able to control how much liquid stain remover you use by how long you press on the tip. Very Useful!I used to keep one in my car also, but I think the heat caused it to dry up quicker. So now I keep it at my desk or in my laptop bag.I haven't used this on any "Dry-Clean Only" items, but I don't think it is meant to be used on those types of fabrics.
