review/text: I got this diaper pail when my first daughter was born almost 4 years ago. I really liked it and it work very good. Yes the instalation of batteries was a little bit of a pain, but luckily mine didn't required a battery change too often. The ball, although could get dirty, we really had much issue with since we always manage to containg everything inside the diaper, unless it was an explosive one, then we would use an extra wipe if necessary. I also like the fact that if you wanted you could use it manually by just moving changing the switch in the back to manual (which was handy if the batteries dies and I didn't have left any at that time).About the odors, I have to admit I was a little dissapointed as the odor was a little too stronger and the filters didn't seem to help much, besides the fact that they were very expensive.What I really had issues with, was then the lid broke; since it was under warranty and as with all my products, I had this one registered I contact Graco and they send me the replacement part in no time; however, there was a problem with that part. It did NOT close properly, so by leaving a little gap, not only the diaper was getting stuck but also the smell was really coming out of it. I called Graco to let them know about the issue with the part and they told me that they would exchange it, but for that I needed to sent the part (which is pretty big and heavy enough to run you a good chunk in postage) paid by my own pocket so they can review the part and if they find that the part was in deed defective, then they will send me another one. That would have take a long time without the lid to avoid the smel to come out plus a lot of money from my part for a product that I have already paid for to begin with and a pafrt that should have been working properly. Since money was an issue and return not a possibility, we ended up using it like that in the manual option for a little bit longer, but since even in the manual mode the lit did not closed properly, we ended up just having to put the diapers aside until baby was ready and then bring them all the way to the trash can outside!I still think is a good idea and since my first lid was working really good I have to admit that if there is an updated option I will most likely get it.
