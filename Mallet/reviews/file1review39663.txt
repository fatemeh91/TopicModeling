review/text: I have been using floss picks for a couple of years now. Sure it was convenient but such a waste. I was so pleased when I came upon FLOSSAID, a reusable floss holder!It works like a dream. Easy to install with regular floss, no special floss heads like the other brands. Long handle to reach the back teeth and you can adjust the width of the flossing arms (just tighten the floss).And it is well made and will give many years of service. This is a great device that cost the same as one bag of floss picks!! Will pay for itself many times over.
