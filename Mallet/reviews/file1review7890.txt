review/text: I have written a similar review before and have to say this is the best wax product I have tried and I have tried many! The wax consistency is light and silky, it smells great, it is gentle on the skin, yet incredibly effective. I cannot understand why Nair and other companies keep making those ready-to-use strips that do not work. This is the closest to salon quality.
