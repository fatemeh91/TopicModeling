review/text: I was reluctant to buy this because I read of people saying that it tasted bad, but in buying and trying it I think it actually taste good. Its kind of like a kiwi puree, tangy type stuff. I can definitely taste the pineapple as well. I do feel a sense of well being and healthiness that is for sure. I can always throw it in a cup to go with any drink and create something new packed with nutrients. I am glad that I bought it and I think that I will stick with his vitamin for now.
