review/text: Hi,I recently tookRechargeable NiMH Batteries, 2650mAH, AA size, 8 batteries per pack DC1500and I am feeling ok with it...We went for a trip recently and with myCanon S5 IS camera...I am able to take (using 4 AA batteries) around 200 pictures.I expected more because it is 2650mAh, but I would say its fairly OKbecause the images are taken with a higher resolution (3264 X 1832) with a sizeof around 1.89 MB.So..I took two sets (8AA ) of the batteries...here.so, when one is empty after 200 pics, I had an option to use the other one immediaetly....
