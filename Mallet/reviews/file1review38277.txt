review/text: I like these vitamins- my last vitamin needed 6 a day, this only 3. Great ingrediants and quality. And it does help increase my energy level- I don't get run down by the late afternoon like I used to. Without being too detailed, I can say I know that I'm digesting them. I highly recommend!
