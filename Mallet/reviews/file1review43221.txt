review/text: I was worried about liquid leaking from bottles, but in retrospect it's unnecessarily wasteful to have each individual wipe, especially since they started to dry out towards the end of each tub. Nice smell, and I like method products. However, there were some issues with sticky residue.P.S. Even if it seems like a good idea at the time, do not use multipurpose cleaning solution on floors. Soap and water is probably a better bet.
