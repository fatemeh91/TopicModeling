review/text: This thing has kept me and my beard happy for 4 years now. The only warning I would give is that the battery DOES NOT LAST when it is not hooked up to the wall. For instance, don't charge it and put it in your bag and expect to shave when you get to your hotel, it WILL be dead. The ONLY reason this thing is cordless is so that you can unplug it from the wall immediately before using it and then not have to fuss with the cord, and then plug it right back in afterwards. The battery is NOT so that you can haul it in your pack and shave on a mountain in Glacier National Park. This of course makes sense though, it takes a lot of power to get those blades moving and this design of battery is not the same as in your phone or laptop. This battery has to deliver a pretty high speed and lengthy amount of mechanical work, not just lights or computation. So I'm fine with the battery failing when it sits idle for a long time. The battery is only so you can shave without getting tangled in a cord, despite standing directly next to an outlet.
