review/text: This funky looking contraption is named Body Back Buddy appropriately. When used with the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Claire Davies, you can take control of your own muscle health. While its named for the back, this fabulous tool can be used on any part of your body. It's the best way I've found to get control of those hard to reach places with the least amount of effort and the most leverage. You definitely need this in your self-treatment toolbox.
