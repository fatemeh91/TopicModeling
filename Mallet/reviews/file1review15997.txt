review/text: My husband sits by the pellet stove to relax. It's in the basement which gets musty, once in a while. I thought the cedar incense would be a pleasant masculine scent for him. We both love it. I took some to use in the living room. At Christmas, I burnt these every day to add to the spirit of the season.
