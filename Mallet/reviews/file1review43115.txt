review/text: I recommend this product to anyone who is pregnant and suffering from back/pelvic/hip pain. I suffered a 12mm pelvic separation from the birth of my first child 2 yrs ago. The pelvis has healed but the ligaments never tightened back up the way they should have which has been the source of the pain. I am 32 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child and it has given me relief. I still have a lot of pain, but definitely not as much without wearing it. I wear it everyday and find it very comfortable. I read many reviews before buying it and I have to agree that buying 1 size larger was the way to go. I like that it is adjustable because as I have gotten bigger, I can just adjust the size up.
