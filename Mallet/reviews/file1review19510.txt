review/text: This is a wonderful potty seat! I just purchased my second one (I have twins that always have to "go" at the same time!)and it works wonderfully. It fits the toliet seats very snugly - we have an elongated toliet seat, and makes my boys feel very secure. It is also very easy to take off and on - the boys can do it themselves which encourages independance. Well worth the money!
