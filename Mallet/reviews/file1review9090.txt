review/text: I used to smoke a pack a day, Ive never done well in school because of attention and energy issues, and I rarely ever exercised, I never really understood how everyone else did so well. I started taking this stuff once a day, or every other day. Three years later Ive been riding about 10-15 miles a day, and up to 50 miles in one day on my road bike, I can run about 9-10 miles, I have not smoked a single puff in over two years, and Ive been making solid straight A's and almost have my batchelors, going for a masters or higher. I literally feel like a completely new, better person. Careful coming off of it though, it can make you itchy. You are what you eat folks, plain and simple.Ps. Ive tried other cheaper superfoods, to save money, none of them work like green vibrance.
