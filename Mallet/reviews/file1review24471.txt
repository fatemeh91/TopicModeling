review/text: I send this to my 89 yr old mother in Illinois whenever she can't afford the drink. She lives in a Mobile Home & lives on Social Security which isn't a lot. I talk to her quite often & she lets me know when she is low on money & I order from you. I am very happy with the UPS Delivery, as most times they know now that she is older & they will either leave the Box in between her screen & house door if shes not by front door when they come, otherwise if she is nearby & she can get to the door in time, they will bring it inside & put the box on her kitchen table where she can put it directly in her fridge. She is a Diabetic & loves the Glucerna Straberry 8oz Bottles in a 24 Each Box for only $40.00 & no shipping cost thru Amazon.com!
