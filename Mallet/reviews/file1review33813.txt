review/text: Very good. I bought this mainly because it's significantly less expensive than the Littmann models, and I generally don't use my personal scope that often. It looks and feels comparable to the Littmann Classic II, and I think it performs nearly as well for blood pressure and breath auscultation, even in the (pretty loud) back of a moving ambulance. No complaints at all.
