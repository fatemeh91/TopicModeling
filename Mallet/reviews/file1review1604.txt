review/text: My 5-year-old daughter has had warts on her hands for a couple years. At her last checkup, I had gotten a referral to a dermatologist, but hadn't followed through yet. This summer, as a last ditch effort before calling the dr, I searched amazon for wart removal products and found this stick. I kept putting off using it because my daughter kept taking the bandaids off. Then I realized that even though she wouldn't keep the bandaids on, it was working anyway (and this was with not remembering to put it on every day). For just about a week or two I've been making sure to use it every day, and most of her warts are almost gone. This is with just applying it once per day and not putting bandaids or anything over them. The bigger ones on her fingers are totally gone. She had two little ones on her forehead and it wiped them out in just a couple applications! (I think it says not to use on the face, but it didn't irritate her skin.) I can't believe this inexpensive little stick saved my daughter from having to see the dermatologist!
