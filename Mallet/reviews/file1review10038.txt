review/text: For it's intended purpose it's good until the novelty wears off. I have found however that it is a powerful aid in physical therapy. I recently had serious trauma to the middle of my left index finger. Even after closing up and being healed for the most part, I still had almost no range of motion to my finger. I was following the instruction from my physical therapist, which was to use a heating pad and massage to loosen the finger. Then to practice moving the joints. With this device I can get the first part of the process done in a quarter of the time with little pain. This is far better than the excruciating 10 minutes of manual massage with the same outcome. So basically what I'm saying is that if my masseuse popped this out, I'd laugh, but if it were my physical therapist then I might be up for it.
