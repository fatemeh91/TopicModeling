review/text: I have these extra fine point pens in purple, black and blue. The ink doesn't dry immediately, so occasionally smudging is a problem. Seems like it's more of an issue with the medium point pens rather than the extra fine. I use these in my Moleskine and they have a really nice flow to them.
