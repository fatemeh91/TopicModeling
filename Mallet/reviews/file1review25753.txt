review/text: The Panasonic ER411NC groomer will give you a very clean trim in a short amount of time, but at the occasional cost of comfort.Its greatest strength is the motor power, which will quickly take care of the most bristly of hairs. Unfortunately, this power causes the unit to vibrate in a way that seems tickly at best and painful at worst. After using an older Wahl for years, I had a lengthy adjustment period. Many mornings I still come away with involuntary tears streaming down my face afterward - ah, the price of vanity.I've found a couple of tips to minimize this discomfort:1. Wet the blades down before using the groomer. This seems to minimize the occasional tugs that really cause the pain.2. Keep up with your grooming regularly. The ER411NC really penalizes you for letting things get out of hand. The best defense against discomfort is to use it regularly enough to keep hairs short to begin with.All in all, it's been a worthwhile investment and it does the job, although it isn't recommended for those with sensitive skin or a touchy tear reflex.
