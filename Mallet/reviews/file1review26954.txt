review/text: I'm a 40-something mom who works out regularly and wanted to start using whey protein as a recovery meal after working out. At 24 grams of protein per serving, it's hard to rival as a quick, low-calorie protein source. I've had a few other protein shakes before that were barely palatable, but this shake tastes great and I actually look forward to it. I prepare it with milk and a few ice cubes in the blender. My two teenagers love it and usually have at least one shake/day. Sign up for the auto-ship option-it's a great deal! I laughed when the 5-lb container arrived: it's huge!I'm a big fan of Jillian Michaels and have had incredible results with her 30-Day Shred DVD. (If you have a sluggish metabolism, this workout will kick it into gear with a 20-minute workout.) I also follow Dr. Mercola on the web and he stresses the importance of whey protein within an hour of your workout. I'm hoping that adding the whey shake will help me maximize my workout efforts.
