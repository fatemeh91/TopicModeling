review/text: The price and quality really can't be beat. If you're looking for this type of Vitamin B, I highly recommend going with the Vitamin Shoppe one. The upside is that the pills are in capsule form. I tried taking a 500 mg tablet and it was awful - it's just too large to go down comfortably. Also, the capsule form will definitely help cut down on stomach irritation and digestion problems.I've tried the GNC and Solaray brands as well and all three have been fairly identical except in price - the VS ones really are the best buy.
