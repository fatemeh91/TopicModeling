review/text: I purchased this as both a test for those nights after extended dinners to better understand if driving is a good idea or not and as a novelty purchase. It seems to be pretty accurate. The key is definitely time between your last drink and blowing. Blow right after a drink and you're going to be way high (which is probably better than reading low). How it compares to a legit cops breathalyzer, not sure; but it does give a good enough read in my book.What has been very interesting is to see what you blow after a hard night of drinks. I was amazed to see how close to not legal I've been even after a good 8 hours sleep.As for novelty, everyone loves it! I'd purchase it again. Use and play with it but please do so safely.
