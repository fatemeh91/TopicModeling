review/text: The sunglass repair kit actually works with prescription glasses too. My 7 year old's glasses needed a new silicone nose pad, but I didn't want to go to the optometrist to have it replaced because of the hassle it would be. This kit had the nose pads, plus bunches of screws and the tiny screwdrivers (both phillips head and flat head). I wish though that it came with a description of the different pieces in the kit.
