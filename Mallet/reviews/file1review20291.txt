review/text: Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby. But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought "cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations."I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality. After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my "diapering diapers" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!
