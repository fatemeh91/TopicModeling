review/text: I love this pen. I primarily write in pencil - I'm a college student and I like my notes to be neat, so I like to be able to erase when I need to - but I also like having a pen on me. Now all I need is this one pen and I can write my notes, sign things in black pen, and correct papers in red pen. Writing in pencil always seemed a little bit too elementary school for me, but this pen looks far more adult than any of those brightly colored mechanical pencils. The quality is really good, I haven't had any problems and I use it all the time. I haven't needed to get refills for the pens yet, but I have stores nearby me that supply them and for the pencil I use regular .5 lead. I use the eraser sparingly because I'm afraid of using it up, so I only use it for smaller erasings (e.g. one word) and save anything larger to be erased with a large, separate eraser.Overall, a really great combination in a pen that is made to last and looks great.
