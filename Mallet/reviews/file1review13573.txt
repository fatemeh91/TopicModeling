review/text: I was skeptical about these insoles, but I thought I would try these, rather than spending the $200+ on MBT shoes. I've worn them at my job now for a month, and while I'm on my feet all day long, I have not noticed any benefit regarding being "anti-cellulite". The good news is, I feel I am standing up straighter. Bottom line - if you're hoping for a shaping up of your buns & thighs, I'm not sure this is the product for you.
