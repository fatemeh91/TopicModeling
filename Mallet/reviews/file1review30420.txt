review/text: I have been using this Dermalogica Special Cleaning Gel for several years. My skin is fair, dry and sensitive as well. Prior to using the Special Skin Gel, when I washed my face with other products they left my face drier and some left a film of some type. They didn't seen to "clean" my skin.This product, is oh-so-gentle on your skin yet, cleans it gently and leaves it feeling soft as if it had never been cleaner!As this product is rather expensive, you'll be happy to hear that you ONLY need about a nickel size of the dispensed gel to achieve these terrific results. A large bottle will last you at least 6 months and probably much longer!You first wet your hands and then your face. Place a nickel size portion of the gel in your hands and rub your hands together, then rub all over your face. Yes, it is so gentle that you can even open up your eyes while washing with it, and my eyes are very sensitive. If you get a great amount of suds in your hands, you're using TOO much of the product. I then follow up with a light scrubbing with a washcloth and a rinse of water and then pat dry, If you feel you need moisturizer feel free to apply. But I'm finding that the Special Cleansing Gel leaves my face so clean yet so soft, that there are many days where I skip my moisturizer altogether.Well worth the prices and I'm certain you'll enjoy the touch and feel of your skin.Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel, 8.4 fl oz (250 ml)Also available in 16 oz pump bottles
