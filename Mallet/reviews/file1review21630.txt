review/text: I recently purchased the Snug-Tub for my 5 month old daughter. This is the perfect transition tub. It fits snuggly within your existing bathtub without moving. There is a suction cup on the bottom to help prevent this from happening. It is soft so if you baby does bang his/her head nothing will happen. It is longer than your typical baby bathtub which allows my daughter, who is tall (28 inches) to stretch her legs. She has also realized that there is enough room to splash and kick...something truly fun for a 5 month old. I like that you can hang it on the wall to dry and to keep out of the way.I will be buying another to use as a pool in the summer.
