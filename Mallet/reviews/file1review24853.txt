review/text: TTC for two years, I've tried Clomid, injections, and one IUI so far. We decided to take a break and give FertilAid a try. When I'm not being treated by a doctor, my cycles are fairly regular at 35 days. On Day 22 my basal body temperature was still low, so I went in for an Ultrasound and discovered a functional cyst on my Left Ovary (an egg *tried* to ovulate this cycle, but turned into a cyst instead). There's no way to know if the cyst was caused by FertilAid, but just in case I have stopped using it. I'm happy for the many women who have had success with FertilAid, but I suspect it really depends on each person's individual cause(s) of infertility. These herbs are supposed to do weird things to estrogen & progesterone receptors, and in my particular case I don't think it's beneficial. If you're in the mood to try something different and are sick of doctors (like I was), then give it a try. I do like the 3x per day vitamin aspect.
