review/text: I was excited to see that you could achieve a brown color with a henna product. Or so I thought. The information on the web site doesn't contain important points that would enable you to make an informed decision to purchase this product. There is a very detailed color chart included with the product that is not provided on the web site. This would be the first step in making an informed decision to purchase. The color chart revealed that in fact, this product will not produce light brown results, but a variety of reddish tones.The web site also doesn't explain the lengthy, cumbersome, messy and complicated process involved in actually using the product. Well at least I think it is all those things, because frankly I won't even be trying the product based upon the instructions. It wasn't that expensive so it is not worth it to return it, but I hope that better information is provided in the future to avoid someone else having a disappointing purchase experience.
