review/text: I wanted to love these, but I just don't. I am returning them. I wear a size 9 shoe, and these were actually slightly floppy on me. Additionally, the beads in the bottom do not lay flat across your entire foot when you have them on, which kind of defeats the purpose of keeping your feet warm. I took them off and shook them around until the beads were spread out uniformly, but the only way they stay like that is if you then just place your feet on the floor. If you want to prop your feet up, the beads then all shift down again and refuse to stay in place. I love their other products, but the design of this one is off. I'll just stick with my old Gap slipper socks for now.
