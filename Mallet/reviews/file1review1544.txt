review/text: I am so happy I found this product! It just works!I was horrified when I found not one but two plantars warts on my 7-year-old's feet. I'd had such warts myself in the past, and removing them was a painful and not always successful experience. I saw this Wart Stick, was impressed by the 40% as opposed to usual 15% active ingredient, and thought that the wax base might keep the medicine in contact with the wart longer (an issue with an active kid!). Over the course of a few weeks I rubbed the stick onto my daughter's warts, and occasionally used an emery board to take down the surrounding callous and dead wart off the top (which was a painless experience for my very sensitive girl, hurray). The first wart fell off her foot last week, and the second is about to break off. They just dry up, darken, and fall off! What a relief! I'm always having some of this on hand. No pain, no smell, no mess, and the warts just go away. What more could you ask? I'm a very happy customer.Kathy in S.B.
