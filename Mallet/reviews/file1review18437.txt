review/text: Bought this as a gift for my husband and it turned out to be a fun idea. While it didn't seem to be 100% accurate, he had a great time using it and will continue to use it in the future. The one reason it may not have been entirely accurate may have to do with the fact that you have to calibrate it at a time when you haven't had a drink within 48 hours, and as a third ear law student, that never seems to happen. But still probably one of the best middle of the road breathalyzers out there.
