review/text: There's not much to say, most girls like this. And I do too. It's the perfect little pocket vibrator to have. I actually use it as a regular massager sometimes when I'm stressed and my back hurts.Likes:Size- its small, it fits anywhereColor- it honestly blends in and just looks like something other than a vibrator, I dont know how it even ended up in my purse, but its been there for the past few months and I use it whenever needed- usually for guys who aren't as "orally gifted."Power- the name 'rocket" is not an over exaggeration... it really is strong.Dis-likes:Noise- sometimes its sorta loud, but its amazing that all the strength comes from something so small.Levels- it only goes at one speed, which is cool, but can be Alot for a first time vibrator buyer and annoying for an experienced one.Waterproof- most of all I hate that its not waterproof, because sometimes with all its little strength I want to insert it, but since its not waterproof and since the top has the little gold metal grooves, you really shouldn't...Again I love that I can use it as a general massager and I honestly have on several occasions... it feels so good on my back and stuff, and its nice to have because you can use it on your significant others back as a massager as well.Overall: it's the perfect bedroom and purse toy to have. It's multi-purpose, compact, and inexpensive. Plus Doc Johnson has some of the best adult toys, AND this is classic.Be sure to purchase the eneloop battery back for your vibrators-Sanyo 277265 Eneloop Power Pack with Battery Charger, 8 AA & 2 AAA Batteries Plus 4 C & 4 D Size Adapter (CostCo Kit #2). Anyone not using rechargeable batteries is doing a disservice to your budget and the environment.
