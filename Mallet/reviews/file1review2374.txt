review/text: I purchased TheraTears for my eye discomfort from contact lense wear. I was taking 3 pills in the morning, just as directed on the label. I noticed I was getting migraines from taking the pills after the second day or so. I began to get headaches every day. After about the 5th or 6th day, I thought it could be from the TheraTears. I stopped taking them and the next day or two my headaches were gone. I have since discontinued use altogether. Unfortunately, due to the side effects, I wasn't able to use the product very long to assess if it helped with my dry eye. During the short period of time I did use it, I did not see a difference. By the way, this product is not FDA approved.
