review/text: Took a chance after reading some of the other reviews. They were right. This stuff smells fantastic, and works just as good as the harsh chemical cleaning products. When my box arrived, I ran around the house with a bottle trying this on everything - tile, counters, stovetop, inside the frige, and even on the glass doors. This was my second Earth Friendly purchase and I am very happy with this product. I will keep buying Earth Friendly branded products for life!
