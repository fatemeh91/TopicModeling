review/text: The Seventh Generation Natural Laundry Detergent is ultra concentrated, tough on dirt and stains, non-toxic, biodegradable and hypo-allergenic. How often do you read all those items in one list?I have purchased bottle after bottle of this Lavender scented product. Now I look forward to doing the laundry. It is more like a Zen experience. The lovely lavender scent is much milder than regular harsh detergent scents and they have a matching Lavender softener.You may also notice this product cleans your clothes better and your skin will also notice the change. If you have any allergies to regular detergents, you might want to try this for a few months. You can also use less detergent, 1/4 of a cup is quite enough for most loads or you can use up to 1/2 cup.~The Rebecca Review
