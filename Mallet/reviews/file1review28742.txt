review/text: There are over 1000 reviews so not much more to say. Purchased the vanilla ice cream flavor. Its very mild and almost tasteless when mixed with water. I'm ok with that and would rather my protein have less additives. I got it at a great price here on Amazon but not from Amazon. Amazon would not let me publish my first review when I mentioned the seller, I don't now why but that is. Its the only other seller with same price and free super saver shipping. Put two in your cart and proceed to checkout you'll see a nice surprise.
