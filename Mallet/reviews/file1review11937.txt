review/text: I am so happy that I purchased these vitamins. I have felt extremely nauseous after taking other types of vitamins, but these are easy on my stomach. I still eat something when taking them, but it can be small (granola bar, banana) so I'm not worried about getting hit with a giant wall of nausea.These do not have the recommended amount of calcium in them. They also don't have DHA, but this isn't an issue.....I just supplement with the others (after much research, there wasn't a vitamin that had every quality that I was looking for. This is the best).DHA recommendation:Prenatal DHA - Unflavored - 180 - Softgel
