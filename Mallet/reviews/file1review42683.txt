review/text: I've read lot of bad reviews about those batteries, but i bought it anyways.. and they're pretty good! I'm using them in a camera( Canon SX150IS) and they actually lest about 1hour taking a looot of pictures(mostly without the flash) and recording a lot.. Most of the batteries are gone in about 30min using this way.. just love them!
