review/text: Think of this as an organic, concentrated variation on Airborne: an immunity system booster you're supposed to take when you start feeling a cold coming on, or whenever you think you may need a boost. The ingredient mix looks good to my layman's eye, especially the fact that the standard echinacea root is combined with the other herbs included here, but how do you really know whether something like this works or not? I'm sure it doesn't hurt, I'm sure it actually may help to some extent, but exactly how effective is it? The description is too vague, the results are unproven, and at almost $1 per pill and (per the instructions) a whopping TEN pills per day, this is a very expensive proposition.
