review/text: I love this protein shake! It's absolutely the best one I've found. When I drink it for breakfast, it sustains me until lunch with no hunger pains. I enjoy drinking it two ways: One, mixed in a blender with almond milk, ice cubes, 1/2 banana and a handful of berries. Two, with almond milk and the mix by itself.I used to find the lumps and clumps like many people are talking about when I started drinking this 10 years ago. So- How do I keep the lumps out? I pour the almond milk into a metal cocktail shaker then I add the milk. I put the cover on the cocktail shaker and shake. Easy! I either drink it then or pour that into the blender, add the other ingredients listed above and blend. Try it! A cocktail shaker costs less than $10 and it works well, is much easier and tastier!
