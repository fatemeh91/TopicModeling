review/text: For its functional use, this watch is great. As a nurse I find having a time piece hat allows me to keep exact time for documenting events with a push of a button extremely useful. Having to wash my hands repeatedly, I need a watch that offers some resistance to water damage. It is also inexpensive and the price makes it all the more appealing.
