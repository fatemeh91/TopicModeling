review/text: The Congoleum Bright 'N Easy No Rinse Cleaner - 32 ounce bottle arrived within the time alotted. But, the cap wasn't screwed on tightly and had leaked a little. I got this product via Amazon because I couldn't find it in the stores near me. During the first two years I had my Congoleum flooring in the kitchen, I just swept. But, I decided it was time to wash, and so, I invested in a mop and was using vinegar and water as the installer had recommended. Soon afterward, I started to notice the stickyness. I washed with plain hot water, and plain cold water, but I couldn't get rid of the stickyness. I was afraid to use ammonia on the shiny flooring. So, I e-mailed Congoleum and they replied that the sticky floor is actually caused by "white sand" that is tracked onto the floor even when you aren't near a beach and aren't aware of it. Also, this "white sand" can actually scratch the Congoleum floor. They told me that it is very important to sweep the Congoleum flooring. They also recommended their no-rinse product for when washing was needed, but said that other products like "Top Job" would be okay, too. I didn't believe the sand thing, I don't have sand around me! And to be sure, I looked for their Congoleum no-rinse product, but couldn't find it in any of the stores near me. So, I ordered the Congoleum no-rinse product via Amazon. But, before it arrived, I swept the kitchen floor and noticed the white sand and I was surprised how much there was! I had never noticed it before when I swept -- thinking it was just dust. After sweeping the floor and sweeping the bottom of my shoes, the stickyness disappeared! When the no-rinse cleaner arrived, I did use it, after sweeping first, and the cleaner left I nice, clean smell without having to rinse. But, I now realize that sweeping is very important in keeping a Congoleum floor from getting sticky -- and scratched. Washing does not really get rid of the "white sand", which causes the stickyness.
