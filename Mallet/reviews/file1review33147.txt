review/text: I can't really say how they're working because I take medicine for allergies, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, and an hiatal hernia, and I take other health supplements, but Source Naturals Wellness Formula was recommended by my doctor so I ordered it and started taking it about two months ago.To the glory of God, my blood pressure is great, and I have been feeling better lately along with exercising!
