review/text: I just purchased this product and felt compelled to write about it. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it to be very well made. Yes, if you drop it, it will probably break...but what won't? Even though it is made of plastic, it appears to be very durable plastic. Some reviewers made it seem as if you look at this product wrong, it will crumble right before your eyes. Not so. Also, while I did notice that it pulled out a few hairs here and there, causing some slight discomfort, overall it worked MUCH better than I expected. The slight discomfort felt by a pulled out hair or two is well worth it. The end result is absolutely amazing. I have never used a device made especially for nose and ear hair removal, I have always used scissors or tweezers, which cause immense pain and can be dangerous. I would recommend this product 100% over other methods. The one drawback is how loud it is. It's a little too loud when putting it in your ear. I would like to see Panasonic maybe insulate it a little better. I would be willing to pay extra for that feature. But overall, I give it five stars and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants CLEAN AND NEAT nostrils and ears! A terrific product!
