review/text: Bought this item after seeing Dr. Berman on the Dr. Oz show. I didn't do Kegel exercises while pregnant and have a small bladder control problem. Yes, you can do Kegel exercises without a weight, but this helps me to remember to do them. I just leave in in the shower and do them once a day. The exercisor has 4 weighted balls. You begin your exercises by using the smallest ball and supporting the bottom of the exercisor with your hand. When you have built up the strength you switch to the large ball with support and then without support. The item is approximately the length of my hand, 5 in. I recommend the item and would buy it again.
