review/text: Odorzout Cat Litter Additive Powder we added this directly to the litter boxes to eliminate the odors between changes. (While we didn't apply it directly to our pets, you can do this to eliminate odors and to deter fleas and ticks.)Odorzout Pet All Surface Granules we used this on our cattery, which sometimes our cats use as an outside litter box. Now, it no longer smells like one! (You can also use this in crates, kennels, bedding and even your car.)Odorzout Cat All Surface Granules we sprinkled this on the carpet in the studio where the studio cats like to hang out. It no longer smells like a cattery in there! (Can be used on cat posts, window perches, carpet, etc.)Odorzout Laundry Additive Powder (our favorite!) you add this to your washing machine with your regular wash load. (We also used this on clothing that had been left in the studio that was getting a little musty!)Odorzout All Surface Pouches we put this in the studio refrigerator (you know how the community refrigerator never seems to get cleaned out!) and it helps to keep fruit and vegetables fresher and longer.Odorzout is 100% safe for pets and people too, which is very important to us here at Animal Radio. You can eat it, roll in it, or lick it. And, their products are "Green," made from recycled plastic and paper.We found the use of Odorzout Products endless - just use your imagination!
