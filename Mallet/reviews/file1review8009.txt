review/text: I'm sensitive to mint and cinnamon (causes gum irritation and even cankor sores) so finding toothpaste and floss that doesn't irritate me is a nightmare. I love this citrus flavor floss. The flavored coating cleans better than unflavored floss--it seems to grab more plaque. I had fewer 4 and 5's at my last cleaning--mostly 3's now!! My hygienist noticed the improvement and said to keep doing what I'm doing. My local drugstores no longer carry this flavor, so I'm glad it's on Amazon!!
