review/text: I would definitely use this product again. I've used this toothpaste for yearssss for mouth ulcer issues (and Crystal Ice is my fav), and I've not had an ulcer since!! But since I'm not able to find it in any local stores, I was "forced" to find it elsewhere and Amazon came to my rescue again! The packaging was great (no damage), delivery was in a very timely manner, and the pricing was good compared to others. I'd definitely use them again.
