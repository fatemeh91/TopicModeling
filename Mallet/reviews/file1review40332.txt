review/text: Being a mom of a first grader, I come down with colds and the flu fairly often during the winter months, so this is a product I was very interested in trying.First, visually this comes across as a very high quality product. Very thick, heavy plastic bottle, nice packaging.But of course, the important thing is the results. I waited until I had the tell-tale signs of sickness, sore throat, feverish, aches and pains. I felt lousy all day at work, came home and started the regimen. Woke up the next day, still felt blah, and continued on taking two capsules every three hours or so. Felt fine by the third day, no signs or symptoms of cold/flu, so in my mind, this product is quite promising. I will be trying it again the next time I come down with the flu to see if the results repeat themselves.
