review/text: I bought these as an alternative to spending a hundred bucks on those fancy workout shoes that everyone's into lately. I thought these would be similar. Eh. Kinda, but not really. I have bad knees and these insoles definetly improve posture and walking patterns (the package tells you to 'step into the gel with your heel and roll your foot forwards'. Once you do this for a while you will "unconsciously keep doing it". I feel like... that's the only way I know how to walk, so how is that going to help?)Granted, they help posture, are good for people with bad arches, and redistributes the shock forces of your actual foot hitting the ground so you don't feel it in your heals so much. But as for a work out tool and toning muscles? Not convinced. Yeah, if you use them to workout, you'll get muscle tone. But that's because you're working out, not from the shoes... silly.Buy it if you have bad knees, bad posture, or low arches. Otherwise don't expect too much...
