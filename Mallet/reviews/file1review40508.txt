review/text: I had Gastric Bypass Surgery 5 years ago and have been drinking protein shakes ever since. I have tried AT LEAST 20 different kinds and never found one that I really loved. I would "suffer" through them, sometimes actually gagging on them, just to fulfill my daily protein requirements. Well, about 6 months ago I tried Whey Gourmet Arctic Cappuccino and really liked it, then tried the Dark Chocolate and liked that even better! But, just recently tried the Milk Chocolate and it is heavenly!!! Finally, a protein shake I can truly enjoy. It's thick and creamy and not too sweet. I add about 10oz of water, 3 ice cubes and 1 1/2 scoops of the protein along with a tbsp. of instant espresso powder. If you like them sweeter just add splenda and there you go! I HIGHLY recommend this shake, even if it is a little more expensive, it's totally and completely worth it!
