review/text: The jets are strong and the heating element is excellent..that alone gets the 5 stars. Cold water has always been my complaint with cheaper models. It also has a valve to drain water when you're done so you don't have to flip the whole thing over awkwardly. My only complaints would be about the bottom of the basin. I would rather there were "bumps" or maybe a wavy surface to roll your feet over. What is on the bottom is a roller which I don't find soothing. I'd also chuck the pumice stone. And lastly, if the basin bottom was tilted up..so your toes were slightly above your heels..it would feel more natural, rather than having your feet flat.
