review/text: it's small enough, and the chassis seems strong enough. The tip warms up a bit with use, but that's to be expected. it comes with a head with a bunch of knobby bits on it, and if you take off that cap there's three round metal things, but be careful using them as a surface as one of them pulled a hair when I tried to use it. There's only one speed, but it's good enough. I like it well enough, but I'm still searching for something... a little more fancy.
