review/text: I have sensitive skin. Products like benzoyl peroxide aggravate my acne problems and my dermatologist advised me to stay away from it. I am also very fair skinned so every red spot shows immediately. I have had good luck with sulfur based products, so I tried this soap. The soap does dry my skin out, but I have also found that any cleanser that has helped my acne usually does. At first some spots on my face broke out a bit, but there had been some latent spots that probably needed to be "pulled out" so to speak. In the past few days these spots have started to dry up and lose color. I will alternate use of this bar with a gentle cleanser like Purpose, but I think it has helped my skin a great deal.
