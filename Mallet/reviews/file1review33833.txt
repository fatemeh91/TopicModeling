review/text: I want to start out by saying that I have absolutely no medical training. I bought this stethoscope for the sole purpose of listening to my unborn baby.I absolutely love it. It works great. I've been able to hear the baby every single time (at varying volumes, depending on the babies position). I'm very happy with this stethoscope and very glad that I didn't have to spend more money than I wanted to.
