review/text: I have no doubt that this product may work well for some people. Unfortunately, I have to echo the negative reviews on here. This product makes my eyes sting, makes them feel sticky, and ultimately worsens my dryness symptoms. I have no problem with other brands such as Blink or Systane - the latter of which works best for me. All eyes are different though, so try to find what works best for you!
