review/text: I bought this after seeing it on Dr Oz. Since I am not good about getting enough veggies in my diet, I feel this is a good alternative. I put it in my morning protein shake and at first the taste was different, but edible. Now I don't even notice it. Sometimes I even throw in a banana. I would recommend this product. Price is also good compared to other sites
