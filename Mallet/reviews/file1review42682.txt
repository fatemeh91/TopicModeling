review/text: So I don't know how Sony did it, but these are hands down the best rechargeable AA battery around. I bought about 20 of these batteries when they were on sale about 2 years ago, and last week I bought some Eneloop batteries last week and they both were put into nightlights which come on simultaneously and go off at the same time as well. Anyways, the Cycle Energy batteries were brighter for longer and were just fantastic all the way around.Also in a Canon 430ex flash, (one of those big stick out the top of the camera flashes) the sony gets significantly more flashes per charge than the eneloop.Sorry Sanyo, these are just better.
