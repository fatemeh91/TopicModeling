review/text: Bissell Carpet Sweeper - I have used this item several times and it is exactly what I need for quick cleanups. Now I only vacuum every other week, because I don't have to worry about cat hair, crumbs, etc. If you push the handle in tightly, it will not come off. I understand this has been a problem for some. I would recommend this product.
