review/text: The new E Plus High C scent is a definite step down from the previous one I used for years and had gotten from Amazon and the local health food store. I gave it one more shot because the ad for it showed a blue cap and described it differently--but what I received is the same old (new) one with the dark green cap and the unappealing scent. I'm thinking of switching to Weleda Sage--more pricey but seems to work well, and it smells better.
