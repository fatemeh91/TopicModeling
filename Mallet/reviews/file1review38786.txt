review/text: I had planned on using this for breakfast/lunch everyday to aide in weight loss. I did not do that, but every once in a while I'll use it for breakfast/lunch on a weekend and I'll switch between this and cereal for breakfast during the week.If you can stick to it every day for at least breakfast you'll start to notice a bit of a difference. It is pretty healthy for you as far as vitamins go, and I personally enjoy the taste, though the powder doesn't dissolve well in cold milk.I recommend this for anyone looking for a weight loss aide that tastes good. Try heating up the milk in the winter and it will be like hot chocolate for breakfast (and to help dissolve the powder), otherwise the undissolved powder still tastes fine.I got this for about 1/2 of what it normally goes for and it was very worth it, I was finally going to stick to it every day and the price went up, but its still reasonable.
