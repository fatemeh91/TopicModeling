review/text: I used to always get swollen lips when I went into the sun for longer than a half hour. Now I put this stuff on and can be outside for hours and not get swollen. Of course I re-apply once an hour or so, but its so worth it. It is a little chalky looking on lips due to the zinc but again, I would totally trade hugely swollen and painful lips (for days after being in the sun), for a little chalky-looking chapstick. p.s. You can always put a lipstick or gloss over the chapstick to lessen the color.
