review/text: I have used it few times when I go for water sports; so far, I think it does its jobs, sun-protection & moisture, and I like its pleasent light smell and non-greasy feeling. I have been researching for a great one to protect my lips under the sun without worrying too many during water activities. It's pricy for a lip balm, but the money is worth.
