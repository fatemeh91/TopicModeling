review/text: these suppory hose are everything as described. My legs felt better and were less swollen after wearing them for 8 hours a day as a nurse. The only porblem is that because they don't stretch out like normal pantyhose, they have a tendancy to creep down my legs. Like most pantyhose, the crotch wanted to be somewhere around my knees and insisted on taking my pant with them. Difficult to work like that. over all a good buy for the price.
