review/text: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOTHER WHO IS BLIND AND AT 70 YEARS OLD IS LEARNING BRAILLE. IT HAS HELPED HER VERY MUCH AND SHE EVEN CAUGHT UP WITH THE REST OF HER CLASS WHICH WERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AHEAD OF HER WHEN SHE STARTED. SHE USES IT TO PRACTICE HER LETTERS AND TO SPELL WORDS.THANK YOU
