review/text: I have very oily skin, so I am always looking for products which will help control my constant shine. I first tried this product when I received a sample in a magazine, and although the gel formulation felt a bit odd to the touch, I was immediately impressed with the way it felt on my face: it left my skin feeling soft and smooth without feeling oily. I followed up by purchasing the product, and I've used it before applying my makeup, both alone and under foundation. It definitely helps to reduce my shine and keep my skin feeling smooth, but on the other hand, it certainly did not &quot;eliminate&quot; my shine, and I still needed to use other products such as powder. This product might be a better option for someone whose skin is only slightly oily; in addition, the book Don't Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me recommends this product as a moisturizer for combination skin types.
