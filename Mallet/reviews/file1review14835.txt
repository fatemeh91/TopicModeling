review/text: I have used this product for over 20 years as a meal replacement. For me, a lot of breakfast foods are heavy or fattening; bacon, eggs.....plus toast, pancakes, waffles..on and on...(essentially bread). Of course butter was usually involved somewhere. When I would eat these breakfast foods (of course I enjoyed them)in about an hour I started to feel too full (bloated) and felt myself losing energy. Even though I did not "stuff my face" at the table, that was always the end result. As an adult, it definitely was not helping my personal weight issue.That's when I started to look for a substitute for those foods. I use this meal replacement drink mix now instead. I have one shake for breakfast, and I have enough calories and energy to carry me through until my next meal; plus an excellent source of supplemental protein. I like the vanilla. I often add strawberries or bananas to it. I eat meals for lunch and dinner, but I never have to feel guilty if I have a second shake in one day. When I found this product on Amazon.com, I was very satisfied by the price & the large quantity.Meal Replacement Drink Mix Original Vanilla 40 pckt
