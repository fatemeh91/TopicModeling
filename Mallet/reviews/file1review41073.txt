review/text: Prolab whey protein tastes great and is easy to blend. I love the vanilla powder since its flavor mixes well with real fruit. Compared to other brands I tried, this product has a great price and great taste without a lot of suger. It tastes a little bit too sweet by its own. But I always add something else, i.e. non-fat milk, fruit, and plain yogurt. So the sugar in it makes it taste just right. I never feel uncomfortable after drinking it, and it really energizes my body after a hard workout.
