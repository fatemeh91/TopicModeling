review/text: I personally have been using this fountain for three years now and PLEASE read the instruction manual PEOPLE! ( im only saying this because I know for a fact ppl did not do it correctly and made a bad review for their ignorance)You have to put the pump in the water for it to cycle the water back into the machine, once the pump is placed CORRECTLY you will hear no sounds of the pump. You also can control how fast you want the water to flow , which is wonderful. You may have slow flow which sounds like a slow moving creek or turn the water up and you can enjoy sounds of rain, from sprinkles to raining hard! Hope this helps, and everyone please read manuals when you buy something, haha :)
