review/text: This is a great product, unfortunately the seller is suggesting you will recieve a 60 day supply based on the image they've shown for the product. That would be a great deal (to good to be true) instead you'll only recieve the 30 day supply & two single serving packets. Not any bargin at all in fact when you concider in shipping the price comes out to be higher then most healthfood stores can sell it for. Don't be fooled like I was. There are better deals on 60 day supplies from other sellers who aren't trying to fool you!
