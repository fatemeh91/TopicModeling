review/text: I love this product - it makes as close to a real milkshake as you'll find in a protein shake and it's so easy.This protein powder provides 48% of your daily protein needs in one serving. The 5 lb container has 77 servings. I also purchased a single serve blender to have at my office to make these during the work day. For best results, use frozen fruit such as strawberries or blueberries and a banana and lactose free milk. I use fat-free, lactose-free, calcium added. Occasionally I add a package of Trivia for a sweeter taste.
