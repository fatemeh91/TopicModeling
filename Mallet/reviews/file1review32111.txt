review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: IT WORKS - NO WASHING - NO WETTING THE STAINED AREAIt use to be that if you were out having lunch or on a coffee break at work if a little of what was intended for your mouth got on your shirt, THERE WAS A PROBLEM - MAYBE EVEN A CRISIS!That has changed. Before I even opened the package that 'Tide To Go Instant Stain Remover' came in, I had tomato sauce all over my clean white shirt. Please don't ask how! Ordinarily, I would have raced to the nearest restroom and soaked my blouse with soapy water as a sort of improvised soaking/pre-wash. The trouble is this is both stressful and embarrassing for obvious reasons. This time, when the sauce hit the white blouse I pulled out the 'Tide To Go' [still sealed in its package] and voila -- NO STAIN!TAKING CONTROL OF THE SITUATION LOOKS AND FEELS GOOD: LIKE WHITE-OUT FOR PEOPLEInstead of feeling sorry for me or just nodding in disgust, people asked me how I did it? "WOW" - was the most common remark and I felt good about the incident rather than dejected and embarrassed as I had in the past.WHAT 'Tide to Go Instant Stain Remover' IS GOOD FOR REMOVING:-*- WORKS WELL ON: TEA, WINE, GRAPE JUICE, KETCHUP, BBQ SAUCE, CHOCOLATE SYRUP & COFFEE-*- WHAT 'Tide to Go Instant Stain Remover' DOES NOT WORK WELL ON: BLOOD, INK & GREASEBOTTOM LINE: KEEP IT HANDY & USE IT QUICKLYCarry 'Tide to Go Instant Stain Remover' with you as you would a pen or pencil and pull it out and put it into action, [by simply rubbing the stain] at the first chance you have after a potential staining accident occurs.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]
