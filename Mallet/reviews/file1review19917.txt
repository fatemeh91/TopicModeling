review/text: My son used this when we transition from the potty chair to the toilet. This helped him tremendously and made the toilet more comfortable. He didn't have to fear falling in the toilet with this. I hung mine on the bathroom wall and he would take it down and put it on the toilet himself when he had to do #2 and then put it back when he was done.
