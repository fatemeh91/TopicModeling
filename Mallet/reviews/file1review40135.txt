review/text: I purchased this kit mainly because I needed the blocks and the strap. The added benefit was an additional mat and a bag to carry it with. The entire kit is fine quality, although it's taken some time for the vinyl smell to recede from the matt. For the price, it's a great kit.The only drawback is that I wish it had come with a bolster. None of the kits seem to include that.
