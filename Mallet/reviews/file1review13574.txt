review/text: These are nice good quality insoles, but I don't see them doing anything else for me at this time, maybe this will change over a few more months of wear or something but as of right now all I have is new insoles. Felt nothing like "a burn" etc on my legs or anywhere else. Not saying they are not a good product, just not worth the price for a set of insoles for your shoes.
