review/text: My husband and I have been battling with cold sores since we were young. Nothing has ever really worked like H-balm does. This herbal remedy is amazing!! From the moment you feel that tingle or bump on your lip or face you apply it to the area. 9 times out of 10 the cold sore will not even appear. If it does surface it is very minimal and gone within a day or two, and without all the discomfort and agony that is normally associated with a cold sore. It also seems to reduce the frequency of future break-outs. We hardly get them anymore.I do recommend using a cotton swap and dabbing it on the area to control the amount you use. H-balm is a clear liquid substance and not an ointment. It has a strong smell/taste.
