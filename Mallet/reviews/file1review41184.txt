review/text: I purchased this Australian Dream Cream a while ago for my husband who has a lot of pain in various areas due to injuries and arthritis. I was searching Amazon for something that would give him some relief from his pain, I decided to give it this Cream a try and see if it was worth the price which is rather high compared to other products. Well I can tell you now that it is worth every dime, my husband got almost immediate relief for his shoulder and lower back, so we make sure we keep a supply on hand, it doesn't take a lot of the cream to apply to an area so a large jar lasts a while. Also our orders at Amazon arrive very quickly which is a big help.
