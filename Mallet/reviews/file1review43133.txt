review/text: I just went out to Babies R Us and bought two packs of these and boy do I regret it. I only wanted to use them as burp cloths, and wasn't even planning to use them for diapering, but I don't even think they're suitable for burp cloths. I should have opened one of the packages in the store because then I would have realized that they're paper thin and you can see right through them. You might as well let the baby spit up on your shirt. Not to mention the fact that the material is so scratchy I would never put my baby's face against it. I'm off to return these and find something that's better quality.
