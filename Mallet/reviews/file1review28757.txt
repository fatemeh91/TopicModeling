review/text: I've been using Optimum Nutrition products for years. A couple of years ago I found a couple of jugs of whey protein I purchased didn't mix the greatest. It would leave large clumps in the blender. I figured maybe the switched the recipe so I switched to another brand for awhile. About a month ago I decided to try ON again and was pleased when it mixed up smooth.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is the strawberry flavor left kind of a funky aftertaste and its gotten a little pricey. Just in the time since I purchased this product the price has went up $6. I had heard the price of whey went up but the other brand I buy is $10 less for the same 5 lbs jug so its hard for me to justify spending the extra on the ON brand. If it comes down in price I would defiantly purchase again.
