review/text: My immune system was so low this last winter I had to do something. Being a picky eater, I couldn't just completely change my diet overnight, but I did start to change it some. I have tried daystar botanicals, ALIVE!, and now this Garden of Life product. The other products worked well to get my immunity up (I haven't had so much as a sneeze or cough since January), but I thought I would look for a product that didn't cost as much per bottle (free shipping too!). I have now taken the product twice (mixed with apple juice) and both times I have had to really focus in order to keep it down (remember the picky eater thing). I am going to try this for a few more days just to really give it a chance. I was impressed by the ingredients and would like to see if there is a difference in the way I feel compared to the other products. I will try to update this in the next week.
