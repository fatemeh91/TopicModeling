review/text: I have a tiny half bath on first floor that we put this in/on, so if space is limited its OK. The fully potty is MUCH better especially for beginners. He can't get his pants down, climb up on the stool and hurdle the splash guard to get up on this one, in time hopefully it will be better. Says universal, however no matter how much cranking I do on the dial to tighten it, it still seems to be loose. He also seems to pee between the toilet seat and the potty seat sometimes. He also doesn't really like it and prefers to trek upstairs to use his full BabyBjorn potty.
