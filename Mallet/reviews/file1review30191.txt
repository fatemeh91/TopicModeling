review/text: I purchased this vacuum for cat fur removal from my couch and the kitties beds. It works okay, but is a bit awkward to use with the pet hair brush attachment. It's not a solid connection and moves up and down, which makes it more difficult to use. I would have preferred it to be stable. Still, it works better than my canister vacuum, so I would recommend it. It's powerful and the suction is very good. It's just that cat fur is very hard to clean from the type of materiel of which my couch is made.
