review/text: I have been using the ionic tooth brush for about two years. I haven't had my teeth cleaned by a dentist or dental hygienist in over ten years. I tried to volunteer myself for a dental hygienist so she could get her state license. I didn't qualify because my teeth were TOO CLEAN. Interesting because I only brush my teeth once a day. By the same token I don't eat garbage and I use a daily dental regimen taught to me by a hygienist over twenty years ago. My teeth are far better than most people mostly because of the ionic toothbrush.
