review/text: A quick sweep of the room, this works for us. When rolling this around, I kind of wonder if it really is picking up anything, but when I go to empty it, stuff does come out. It comes with a little comb that clips on the handle to comb out the brush. It's also good for kids to sweep the room with. I think the handle on it was just fine - actually one end of it was slightly crunched and I couldn't get it to thread on, but my husband fixed it without a problem. He thought this sweeper is pretty handy.
