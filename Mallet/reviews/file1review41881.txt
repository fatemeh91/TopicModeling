review/text: I received this as a Christmas gift. I currently use a standard Oral- B but the Triumph was alot more powerful. It really is dentist feeling clean. I liked the 2 minute timer. and the smile face that pops up. It's the little things in life that make me smile. LOL I'm so happy I got this as a gift!
