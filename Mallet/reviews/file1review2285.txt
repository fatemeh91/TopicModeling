review/text: I unfortunately bought a bunch of these as well, and even though they are packed in Gillette packaging (foil printing and all!)... they are not the real deal.As a longtime Mach 3 user and head shaver... I can tell you without a doubt that these are discards or bootlegs.The "gel strip" is fake or poorly done and the blades are not very sharp, which resulted in me, unhappy and bleeding.I sent a pack to Gillette, waiting for their reply. Contacted seller... no response.buyer beware.
