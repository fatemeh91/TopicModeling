review/text: my title says it all. This is an excellent product, BUT the container/dispenser is HORRIBLE! it is big and clunky and takes up way too much room. it is also extremely difficult to open and close and, if not closed properly, the cloths dry up. I will not buy this product again until they improve the container.
