review/text: This is a good yoga mat, sticks well to the floor and comes with this great bag. Just what I wanted. I havent used the blocks and straps yet. There were other slightly cheaper yoga mats on Amazon by other vendors, but I bought this one with something else and got free shipping, so worked out to just the same price.
