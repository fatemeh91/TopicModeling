review/text: first of all, this product does not look like it does in the picture as it does in person. (it is lacking the the white wand with the on and off switch). It is very difficult to set up onto a shower head and once it is set up, the stream is so small and strong it's like a power washer! thus hurting more than pleasuring.Also, it has an option to switch from your regular shower head to the love jet so you don't have to take it off and put it back on every time you use it, which sounds like a good idea, but who wants that unsightly thing hanging from your shower head every day... what if your mother comes to visit!?This product is a good idea, that just wasn't well thought out, and definitely not worth the trouble.
