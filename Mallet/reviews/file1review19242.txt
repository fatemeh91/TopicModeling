review/text: I've taken many kinds of weight loss pills, and this is the only product that has ever given me somewhat negative side effects. I started taking it and within 5 days, I dumped the pills in the toilet. Of course, it did work as an appetite suppressant because it made me jittery to the point of nausea. It also made me have rapid heart beat, like to the point of thinking I was going to have to go to the hospital. Like everything though, it may work for some people, but it definitely didn't for me.
