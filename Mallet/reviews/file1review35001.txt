review/text: I use this product a lot. I love being able to wax at home. But the issue I have with this is that there's no way to keep wax from dripping into the heating area.I think at this point if I want to remove the tin of wax, I have to heat the entire thing up before being able to pull it out.Other than the drippy factor, it works really well. I've never had to worry about it over heating, since usually I turn it on and leave the room until I know the wax is completely warmed through.The pegs on the bottom of it don't balance the thing entirely well, but it doesn't skid around or tip over at all. But if you're unfortunate enough to not have a proper counter and just a stand-alone sink that you place it on, you will risk dumping the entire thing into your sink.
