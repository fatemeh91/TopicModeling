review/text: Two of my fingers don't uncurl when I sleep . The doctor told me to get a presciption for a custom brace....a hard night board to sleep in so my fingers would stay staight. She said "you'll get used to sleeping that way" . I could not fathom that.... I found these gloves. They are so comfortable to sleep in,I don't always have to wear them all night.They reduce swelling and when I sleep in them my fingers don't "STICK " in the a.m. Sometimes I wear them to drive too! they feel so nice. I just wish they weren't black I would wear them in public more often.
