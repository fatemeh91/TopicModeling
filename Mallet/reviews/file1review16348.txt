review/text: A few years ago, as I was replacing my cookware for the third time, I thought hard about what was most important to me, besides function and quality, and added a third uncompromising element: the piece had to go into the dishwasher. This is because I am now in my sixties and am sick and tired of washing pots and pans. Consequently, I put together an eclectic set of saucepans, skillets, and dutch ovens to meet my specific everyday cooking needs. These brands include Wearever, Cuisinart, Farberware, Maitre Chef, Simply Calphanon, 9-Element, Winco, Oneida, and Proctor Silex. The one thing they have in common is that the manufacturer guarantees that they are dishwasher safe. The caveat here is that yes, I rinse all food off the pans before putting them in the dishwasher; no detergent is going to get off stuck on, fried or burnt food (not me so much, but my husband, that is another matter).Almost any dishwashing product available these days can get your glasses to sparkle. Finish powerballs do that, of course, but they are also unparalleled in going the extra mile on metal items. Over the past week, I have run about 10 loads with this product. Without exception, my pots and pans are immaculately clean and shine as well. It is important to note that nothing is scratched either. My silverware, used for both for everyday and company, is 18/10 stainless Dansk Torun, over 20 years old, and it looks brand new. The only quibble with me is that a load costs between 18 and 19 cents to run; however, you get what you pay for. By the way, as far as the smell goes, it was negligible to me. I actually had to put the tablet up to my nose to smell anything, and there was absolutely no smell in my dishwasher or on the dishes.
