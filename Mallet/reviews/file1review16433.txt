review/text: This is a great natural powder to help with rashes on humans, and even hot spots on dogs. The powder is just as pictured, but it arrived with no seal or anything,and that kind of bugs me. I think it should have a seal or even tape on the top of the bottle. But oh well.. for what it is (good stuff!), I give it 5 stars. 5 Stars for the product, 4 for the packaging. I know the review is for the product, so I gave it 5 stars... but I thought I'd share a little about the packaging for those wanting to order it here on this link.
