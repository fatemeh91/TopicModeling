review/text: This is a good, sturdy bath lift. It works smoothly and the battery stays charged for a quite a few days. The bather is always in control of the rate of the lift and descent into the tub. The price on this is excellent. I priced bathtubs with built in lifts and they cost into the thousands. The only caution; If your tub has any kind of patterning or graininess in the base, the suction cups won't work. The suction cups on the bottom of the lift adheres to smooth surface tubs only. On a smooth surface, the suction is very powerful and the lift is very secure. This is a good lift for injured or older people. A paraplegic person can use this. Using it allows for independence in bathing or bathing with very little assistance. The remote is very simple to operate. Set up is very easy...no tools required. Battery needs a 24 hour charge before lift can be used.
