review/text: Received as described and great quality product. I've had three outpatient surgeries for Kidney stones over the past 6 weeks and have been sweating and leaking at night like crazy at home between surgeries. My wife was changing the sheets and washing them every day. We purchased 3 of thesse pads and now she just washes them every three days.
