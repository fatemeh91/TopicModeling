review/text: I bought this product about 3 years ago from Rite-Aid where I first saw it. I couldn't swallow pills at the time so I thought this would be perfect for me. I put my first patch on in the morning after I got up (6am) and by 1pm, I was starting to feel a little weird. My stomach was bothering me and I was hot and cold. A couple hours later, the side effects became really bad. I layed in bed the whole rest of the day because I felt so crappy. I was tired and was so cold that I was covered with 2 comforters and a quilted blanket and still shivering. I lost 6lbs the first day only because I didn't eat anything because of the side effects and was in the bathroom all afternoon with diarrhea. Not worth it...don't buy!
