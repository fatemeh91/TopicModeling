review/text: Most garlic supplements are "aged" and thus have the most important beneficial compound removed - allicin. These pills are individually blister-packed because they actually smell like garlic! I was a bit concerned about the dreaded garlic burps, but thankfully have never experienced them with this product. One per day is all you need.
