review/text: My first electric razor.I used this razor for a month and then one day during a grooming session one of the plastic snapped off. My embarrassment was great, as I am a 23 year old man who does not know how to effectively operate an electric razor. My razor which was designed to remove unwanted hair from my face had suddenly removed one of the plastic pieces from its own self. I finished up the best I could on my face; however my thoughts were that this razor does such a good job of cutting that it accidentally cut itself. I put the razor away with a renewed respect.However, a few weeks later I needed to shave again. As I did so, another tine flew off to evermore decorate my bathroom floor. This made shaving increasingly more difficult. Every few weeks my beard was developing a strange look that I best defended as "trendy."I was going to call Remington and see if they could help, but I felt a little embarrassed as they could probably guess that I did something wrong with the razor. Not sure what I did, but Remington makes great products and they would never sell me something that is easily broken.In conclusion, people who do not have to shave their faces very often are really screwed over by 30 day guarantee programs.I ended up getting another electric razor, but I keep this one around out of respect. It sits on a little throne underneath my sink which is probably what it wanted all along.
