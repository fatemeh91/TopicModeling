review/text: Stay away from the Optimum Nutrition Whey, Chocolate Mint flavor. It smells fantastic. But, no matter what you mix this with; Whole Milk, Skim Milk, Ice Water, Tap water, it tastes just plain awful. I can't even describe it. If you don't want to take my word for it, at least buy the smallest size available before committing to a 5 lb. tub. Now I'm stuck with forcing this down with castor oil-like efficiency.
