review/text: This is a good travel support cushion. It folds up small so it will fit in a purse or backpack. It doesn't take too much effort to inflate. I'll use it sometimes if I know I'm going to be at my computer desk most of the day. It worked great for me for about a week, but I think it may have a small leak already somewhere.
