review/text: I hate shaving my legsMy hair turns to stubble an hour after I shave and it's so uncomfortable.Now that I have an epilator, I really don't have to worry about my legs anymore!No more shaving every day, I just epilate every few days and it looks like I'm born without hair!Sure, the first time was really, really, really painfulBut if you stick it out, it's so much easier after that.I personally would not get it anywhere near my pubic area without novocain.Although, I use it on my underarms and I don't have to worry about shaving under there either! Just use some lotion after you epilate and your skin stays so smooth!I know some people who can go for weeks without epilating again, but I feel most comfortable touching up quickly every three days or so.The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that it has more trouble gripping the hair after you've been using it for a few months. Other than that, it's great!All-in-all, if you hate shaving like me and are willing to take a little pain (not nearly as much pain as razor burn), get this product.
