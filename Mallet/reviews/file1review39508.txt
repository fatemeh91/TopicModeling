review/text: I really enjoyed this Test Drive!! This Skintimate Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin not only had a great smell, but it made shaving a breeze. Unlike soap and water, which I use a lot, this gel becomes a thick lather that helps the razor glide over my legs. Even with a new blade, I didn't get cut!! It helped make shaving quicker, as well, since only one pass was needed, instead of a few like I've experienced with other methods of shaving. I'd recommend this gel to everyone who enjoys a close shave with little effort and a lot of ease!!
