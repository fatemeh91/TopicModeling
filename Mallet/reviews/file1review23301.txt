review/text: I'm a low-voltage contractor. I usually work in office buildings where I remove and replace ceiling tiles in order to install cable. I bought this little gem to clean up the crumbs and small debris that always fall from the ceiling tiles. WHAT A GREAT PERFORMER!! It does exactly what I wanted it to do! And its QUIET and dustless, which is very important around offices where the phone is in use or meetings are being held.Now, don't expect too much! This IS NOT A VACUUM!!! It's a push-around spinning brush with a pan to catch what it picks up. It's GOOD ENOUGH to get the floor looking good until the night crew comes through with the real vacuums. I guess that means that it's a terrific little "light cleaner". Don't expect it to get up dust (like spilled flour) or dog hair.As to the persistent gripes that the handle falls apart, the handle is shipped in 4 segments in order to keep the box small. The ends are tapered so that they fit into one another, with a rubber cap on the top and a female threaded pocket at the bottom to attach to the sweeper's yolk. The first time I put them together, they separated after a short period. I then smacked the the top of the handle very hard (downward) against the floor and they have never budged again! If the problem ever comes back, I'm confident that 4 drops of super-glue would do the trick.It works best on medium pile carpet, can be a little harder to push on thick carpet, and performs "OK" on bare floors.In summary:-Handle is fine if you possess any amount of common sense-Works best on smaller to medium debris (crumbs, etc.)-Works best on medium weight carpet-Is NOT going to replace a real vacuum, but for what it does, its great!As always, my Amazon order came quickly!
