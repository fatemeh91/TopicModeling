review/text: I'm very impressed with the Rembrandt Natural Whitening Toothpaste. I've been using it for about one week now and I can see a measurable improvement. In the past, I've tried other whitening toothpastes and was NOT impressed. By the way, I'm a smoker and a coffee drinker so I have a problem with discoloration that Rembrandt improved noticeably. A number of my friends commented on my whiter teeth and asked if I had them ""professionally"" whitened. They were very surprised when I told them it was due to Rembrandt. I was also pleasantly surprised by the taste. Some of the other whitening products were nasty, whereas, Rembrandt had a pleasant flavor with no aftertaste. All in all, I'm very happy with Rembrandt and have and will continue to recommend it to my family and friends.
