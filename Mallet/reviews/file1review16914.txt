review/text: I had been using a Norelco Reflex series razor for about 1 1/2 years when I decided to advance to the 8825XL Spectra. First thing I noticed was that the Spectra shaved my neck area much better than the Reflex...and my neck hair is really tough to shave close, since it sort of grows sideways.I also LOVE the fact that I can just rinse the Spectra under warm water to clean the blades and heads...it's so much more convenient than using a brush with the Reflex.The comfort control is a nice feature...it doesn't really seem to affect the shave per se, but the more sensitive settings do make the shave more comfortable, which I like since I have pretty sensitive skin.
