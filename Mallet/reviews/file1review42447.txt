review/text: We got our kitty from a shelter. Right from the start she had diarrhea. At first, I wasn't too concerned, new house, new food. But, after about a week I saw blood, so I took her to the vet. To make a long story short, we tried antibiotics, no canned food, worming, and changing her dry food. She still went liquid and had alot of gas. Then, the vet suggested yogurt. The cat didn't like it, so we had to squirt it in her mouth, which was just added stress, with no improvment. I decided to look at probiotics on Amazon and ordered Forta Flora. To use any of these powders, you, really, have to mix it in a little canned food, so I mixed it in a little friskies. After a few weeks, there was no change. So just for the heck of it, I changed the canned food to Wellness because I was, also, now, reading about better foods. Within three days of the change, there was improvment, and normal within a week. But, I know the friskies wasn't the whole problem because I hadn't given her any canned food for over a month before I gave her the Forta Flora.When I ran out of the Forta Flora, I tried the Probios which came as a sample with the Forta Flora. I like it much better than the Forta Flora. First, it's much less expensive. Also, the Forta Flora comes in little packets. Because I feed her twice a day, I, always, had to guess about half a packet, and had the rest lying on the counter until the next meal. Probios is just a loose power you measure with a spoon. I find it much easier to just level off a 1/4 t. spoonful each meal. (Check the measurement for your cat's weight.)In closing, I would say this is an excellent product. I really think my cat would still have severe diarrhea if not for probiotic products. I, also recommend the Wellness canned cat food. If your cat has diarrhea from stress, extended antibiotics or no apparent reason, definitely, give this a try. I wish I had tried it sooner.
