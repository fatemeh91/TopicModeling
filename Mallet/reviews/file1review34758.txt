review/text: Bought this for my husband, who is trying to stay away from all the chemicals in typical deodorants/antiperspirants.This may be all natural, but that's the unfortunate problem with this product along with others like it (ie Tom's of Maine).And doesn't do anything for wetness or odor. In fact, it stinks! Waste of money. Better to go without.
