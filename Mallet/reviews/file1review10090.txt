review/text: Glade's "Crisp Waters" air freshener spray is not as watered down as some people may tell you it is. This freshens the air rather quickly and the scent is pleasant without being too overbearing at the same time. In addition, the can keeps the spray fresh for months after you buy it. I haven't been disappointed with a single can of this yet!I recommend this air freshener for anyone who needs to get rid of unpleasant odors in their home.
