review/text: I own about 2 packs of these batteries. They are wonderful. I have saved a lot of money by investing in these batteries. Why pay $4.00 to $5.00 for one pack of batteries that get used once and thrown away when you can purchase these and reuse them 1000 times. It is true that they don't quite have the power of normal duracell alkaline batteries so they might be an issue for certain things that use a lot of power. For example Digital Camera's take a lot of power. But for the most part these work really well and I have used them for 3 - 4 years now. I highly recommend them to everyone.
