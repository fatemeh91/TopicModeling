review/text: The ER411 is very good at nose/ear trimming...the best I have used... Highly recommended but...Today I have to replace my two year old unit because the little plastic rim that holds the trimmer head snapped off! I will be VERY GENTLE with the new one as Panasonic apparently uses el cheapo plastic in their product (or whoever makes it under their brand name).
