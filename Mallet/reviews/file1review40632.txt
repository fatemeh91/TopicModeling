review/text: We use only organic foods and cleaning supplies in our home whenever possible. So, I was delighted to give this dishwasher gel a try. I loved the scent and thought a gel would be clean-rinsing and gentle on dishes.It wasn't long before I noticed my dishwasher had started leaving residue on my dishes. I became more diligent about pre-washing and made sure never to run anything through the dishwasher if it had any dried food on it whatsoever. In spite of my best efforts, the dishwasher was actually dirtifying my pre-washed dishes... depositing residue all over my dishes. I would unload the dishes, soak extensively, re-scrub and re-wash, load the dishwasher again, and run another cycle, only to get the same filthy results. Our water bill increased about 30% during this time.Frustrated, we were actually seriously considering buying a new $800 dishwasher... but I decided to switch dishwasher detergents first.Suddenly, my dishes were coming out clean and sparkling again! As happy as that made me, I'm utterly appalled that a dishwasher detergent would clean so horribly to the point that it's actually worse than not cleaning at all.While I did give two stars because this dishwasher gel is organic, what good is "environmentally friendly" if you're having to run the same dishes through 3-4 dishwasher cycles every time (and even then they don't come out clean)?
