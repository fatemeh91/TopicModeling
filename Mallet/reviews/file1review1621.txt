review/text: I haven't been using this one very long, but so far it seems to be working great. Thankfully there is no pain. It may take longer to work than the freezing a doctor would do, so be patient. The planters warts on the bottom of my foot have been there for a long time. Thought they were calluses until my doctor told me otherwise. I started treatment as soon as I got it in the mail. So far it seems to be working great.
