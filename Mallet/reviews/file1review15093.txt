review/text: I was hopeful when I purchased this product based on the glowing reviews. After fully using one vial of the Brite Eyes according to the package directions, there was absolutely no change in my elderly dog's cataracts. I was really hoping to clear them up somewhat so that she would be able to see better. It has been very disappointing.
