review/text: I love this! It doesn't take up any room (meaning if it was off, it's just empty space). I used it a lot on a recent trip to Disney, it holds 4 frozen water bottles, and a small sippy cup. The adults were very happy to have really cool water, as opposed to paying $3+ for a bottle in the parks. If you don't put your stuff in it, it completely holds lunch and sippy cups for baby. It keeps everything cool all day. A great accessory!!! And one less thing to "forget" as it's already attached, and doesn't interfere with folding, even if full.
