review/text: The arm straps are very tight and press hard upwards against your armpits. It feels like it's cutting off circulation to your arm. The material is also kind of rough so there's a burning feeling wherever there's pressure/contact. It leaves marks on your skin after wearing it for only a few minutes.It's also very hard to wear it like the picture. The band wants to crawl upwards to your neck, which in turn would pull your neck down, and hurt your posture!I'm just a average built guy, but I tend to slouch. So I think most people would experience the same difficulty with this as I did. The only reason I bought this was because I was intrigued after seeing it on a Sky Mall Catalog. I couldn't find any customer reviews for it, so I took a chance and bought one (for under $10). I guess the lesson is: you get what you pay for.
