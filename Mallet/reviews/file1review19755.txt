review/text: We just potty trained our daughter 2 weeks ago, and having her sit on the big potty has been a challenge. We'd much rather her to her business on a real potty than the plastic Baby Bjorn potties that we also have.This device is simply fantastic. What you would expect from Baby Bjorn. Well priced, well made, and very functional.
