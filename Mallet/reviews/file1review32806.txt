review/text: Several mornings a week I make a smoothy with a 1 1/4 cup of skim milk, 1/2 a banana that I have frozen, a a handful of frozen strawberries or blueberries, and a scoop of Slimfast French Vanilla. It is quick to make in the blender, tastes great and gives me a good headstart on the day's nutrtion. I keep the frozen berries on hand and freeze the bananas in sandwich bags with 1/2 a sliced banana in each as soon as they start to get brown spots. 10 sandwich bags of banana fit in one gallon size freezer bag. When fresh peaches are in season I use one instead of the berries. The same smoothy recipe works nicely when a craving hits during TV in the evening. Losing weight is hard, it is nice to have a product that lets you have a treat without ruining the diet.
