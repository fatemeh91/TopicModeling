review/text: I used this on my 5 cats to worm them this month. It worked great as the dispenser is long enough to get to the back of their tongue without my fingers having to do the job and get bit in the process.All that said, this is a two person process. One person wraps the cat in a large towel (beach towel is perfect)and holds the cat firmly for reassurance and with all legs/claws covered.The second person puts the pill in the dispenser, opens the cats mouth with tip of dispenser and their fingers. Put the end of the dispenser to the back of the cats tongue and a quick push of the plunger dispenses the pill in the back of the cats tongue/throat area.The person dispensing the pill will need to blow in the nose/face of the animal while dispensing the pill. Just blow in the animals face. This helps the animal to breath in and swallow which is very handy as you are putting in the pill.Lastly, have a syringe (without the needle)of water. After the animal has swallowed the pill make sure to give them the water, as a dry pill can become lodged in the animals throat. Just think how you would feel with no water to help the pill go down.My dogs are easier to give pills, roll them in a ball of cheese, peanut butter or hot dog and they will usually take it.Cats are not so easily fooled.The pill I use for worming is just a tad too big for this dispenser, though the dispenser is a nice size, so I just broke the pill in half and dispensed the pill twice to each cat.If your cat spits out the pill, just try it again, it may take them, or you a couple of tries to get the hang of this dispenser.
