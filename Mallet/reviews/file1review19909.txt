review/text: We have two of these toilet trainers: one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Love it! Easy for my two year old boy to use, non-slip, and does not attach to the toilet, so you simply lift it off to use the regular seat. The raised part in front is great--we don't have any aiming problems with this potty:)
