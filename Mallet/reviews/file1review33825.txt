review/text: Great for the price. I work as a nurse in a medical/surgical unit and this more than adequately meets my needs for a stethscope. I usually lose about 1 a year and the price of $30 makes it much easier to bear when I will lost this one! The colors are fun and whimiscal. Thinking I will go for a red one next time around.
