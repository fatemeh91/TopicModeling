review/text: I was having such bad low back and pelvis pain, I could hardly walk. This cradle is amazing! it doesn't take away the pain completely, but sure helps. I can walk more, move around more, and can wear this sitting or standing comfortably. I cannot figure out how to keep it from showing at the collar of all my maternity shirts, but there have been a few days I just plain didn't care. I did try using bobby pins to keep the straps with my bra straps, but that didn't work. Might try pins at some point, but that would show through the shirt too....I'll keep trying. This is totally worth the effort.
