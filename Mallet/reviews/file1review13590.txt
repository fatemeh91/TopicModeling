review/text: So I don't really want to eat my 5 1/2 month old but she does smell awfully good with this stuff on. The rosemary and lavender are a pretty awesome combination - who knew? Better yet, she sleeps better when rubbed with this during her cold, than with the Dr. recommended 1/2 tsp of children's benadryl (yes - not prescribed usage but what the Dr suggested for her bad cold). I don't know if it's the smell or the very nice action of the medicine but she's both calm and coughs a LOT less (like 1/2 cough the whole night) compared to the night before I used it on her and her waking up 3 times from coughing. I highly recommend and I may try it on her feet to see if it works even better. Plus you can use it on babies under 2 (unlike Vaporub age indication).
