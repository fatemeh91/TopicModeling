review/text: Honestly, I don't remember even seeing these in my first search for a waterproof mattress pad for our 2-yr-old potty-training daughter. The first two we ordered leaked straight through on the mattress, so we returned them both (different pads, both with high ratings). I came across this pad on the 3nd round of searching and decided to give it a try. Finally!! I waited to write a review until she had about 3 accidents--and while two of those soaked the sheets, comforter AND an extra blanket on top, the mattress itself was DRY. The mattress pad's cotton/quilted first layer was soaked, of course, but nothing made it through. Our daughter loves it, she likes how soft and padded it is, and hasn't complained at all about any additional warmth, etc. My husband always lies down on her bed with her to read her books at bedtime and he didn't know I'd bought a new pad, but commented the first night I had it on about how much softer her bed felt, "for some reason". ;-) It washes up and dries easily, as well. You do have to dry it in the dryer, but I've been surprised each time at how evenly and relatively quickly it dries.
