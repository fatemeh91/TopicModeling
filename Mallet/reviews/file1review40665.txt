review/text: These bars are delicious, you really believe that you are eating a chocolate bar, it's not a lie, its flavour is wonderful. I broadly recommend them. My favourite flavours are chocolate peanut butter and chocolate chip brownnie. The cookies and cream flavour is to sweet for me, I don't like it so much. They are a good option for snacks and before the exercise.
