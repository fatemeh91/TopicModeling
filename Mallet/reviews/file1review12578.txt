review/text: Well, I have used this and would love to use it again, but you can barely eat dinner if you want to use it. You better have an empty stomach, which means you have to eat your last meal four hours before you use it. If you go to bed at any decent hour, this means eating by no later than 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. Or if it takes time to get home, get the kids, take the dog out and then eat dinner. You are screwed. If you do not wait four hours you will have horrible stomach cramps. I rated it three stars for ease of use or lack thereof.
