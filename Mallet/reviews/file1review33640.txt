review/text: This is a must-have for everyone who cares about dental and gum health. I had the same model purchased about 10 years ago, and the new one is a lot lighter in construction, weights a lot less, feels less sturdy. It came with the tongue cleaner which is great, but only one flosser, but the ones I had from the older Water-Pik fit perfectly, so no loss there. There are other brands in the market, but I recommend the original Water-Pik from Teledyne. It has been around for over 40 years and still going strong.
