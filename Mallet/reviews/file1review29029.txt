review/text: I used the first Braun Cruzer 2000 which is a four year old product and have loved it every use. The Razor begun to turn blunt so I bought this instead and I am very happy. The trimmer works perfect and the small trimmer head is very versatile, more then I thought it would be.Great purchase, will recommend it for everyone!
