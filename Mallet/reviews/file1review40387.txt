review/text: This is a very good product, with allot of Echinacea, Ginger, and other herbs.I gave this to my Grandson when he came down with a bad cold.He did not take it as soon as he got the sore throat leading up to the cold,which could have been the reason he did not get well as soon as he should have!!It says to take 2 capsules 5 times a day, for two days.This may seem abit pricey, but if this gets you well fast, it is worthevery cent.
