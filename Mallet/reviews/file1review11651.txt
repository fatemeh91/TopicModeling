review/text: This product is great because it allows me to add DHA to my child's lactose-free milk. She wasn't getting the DHA when we originally put her on soy milk. I am happier that she is getting this vital nutrient for brain development, especially since she is less than 2 years old. I can mix it with her milk and she doesn't complain. It smells like strawberry, but my son says that it doesn't taste like anything. I personally haven't tried it. Since it is cod liver oil, it does leave an oil slick on everything. Which leads to me questioning how much my daughter really gets out of the dose. Other than that, it is a decent product.
