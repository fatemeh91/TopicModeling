review/text: The taste of the Pina Colada shake mix wasn't that good. It tastes better if you just mix the formula and the milk together then add a few ice cubes. But if you blend it together with ice cubes then it does not taste as good. Also it does taste a lot better with a banana blended with it. I would prefer the chocolate over this one. I haven't all the flavors yet. But out of all the flavors I have I think this one is my least favorite.
