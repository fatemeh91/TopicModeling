review/text: I have been taking Herbalife products for about two yrs now. The first time I took them, I would eat a regular breakfast, lunch and shake for dinner. I am 5ft4in and weighed 190 lbs when I started taking them. Within six months I was down to 145lbs have felt great and maintained the weight lost! I went from a size 16 to a size 8! People that I had not seen in a while didn't even recognize me anymore!! The shake is delicious and I look forward to drinking it! Also, the herbal concentrate tea is also yummy and it gives me tons of energy, something I surely need by the evening when I have a messy house to clean and three kids to bathe, change and get ready for bed! It also helped me not be constipated, which I suffer from. Best of all I dont get any nasty side effects. I have tried phenthermine recently only because my sister in law works at a weight loss clinical and recommended it to me, all i can say is I did lose weight but felt AWFUL the wohle time I was taking them!! I became tachycardic (very fast heart rate), hypertensive (I have NEVER had a BP of 138/95 ever!), insomnia, migraines, dizzines, and almost passed out a couple of time, NO THANKS!!Therefore I am sticking to Herbalife! Its a great product and it works to keep you full, lose weight, and feel great at the same time. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the products are pretty expensive!! Wish that would be different :(
