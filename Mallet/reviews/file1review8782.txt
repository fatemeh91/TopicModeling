review/text: I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome about a year ago through a heart rate variability test and blood work. The blood test results showed a low white blood cell count and high AST/ALT levels. Ever since I began a daily regiment of Green Vibrance, my WBC count and liver enzyme levels have improved incrementally. Furthermore, nothing else has changed in my daily routine besides the addition of Green Vibrance to my diet. The taste is truly awful, but this should not be recognized as food, rather, it should be considered medication.
