review/text: This is a handy little sweeper, light weight, narrow enough to fit between the legs of dining room chairs, etc. It does a great job of picking up pet hair and the type of gritty dirt we get in our area. It's one problem? The handle fits to the base by pushing on rather than screwing. No matter how hard I try, even bopping it with a hammer, it still pulls off. I may resort to gluing that just for the irritation factor, but the sweeper itself works great. No cord. No batteries to charge. Just an old fashioned sweeper like mom had.
