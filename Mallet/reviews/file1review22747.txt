review/text: I liked these diet pills, in fact they worked very well for me. If you're training for a marathon or are an endurance runner and want to get to 7 minute/mile runs, but can't because of the weight, then this is the product that you can use (very short term) to address the extra weight. Now I would only do 1 pack. Also, I don't suggest taking this on an empty stomach, but rather with a strong breakfast, meaning right after it, and followed by ingesting at least 1 gallon of water throughout the day. This will help shed any cellulite and fat, getting you super cut and defined, also a good 2 hour cardio, at the least, and 1-2 hour weight regimen, works great. In other words, you have to be really into working out for this to work. I only did what was necessary to loose my last 7-10 pounds, and then got off them, so it was very short term. It did help my timing, I went from 8.30 minute/mile to 7 minute/mile. Plus I had very defined abs.
