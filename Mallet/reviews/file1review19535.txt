review/text: This product is so great! My daughter is 23 months and we have started the potty training process.The seat is so comfortable and fun for her, she asks to go just to sit on it.The ergonomic design is ideal for their little bums and the way it sits on any of our three toilets (all differnt sizes and shapes) is genius!I can't recommend this product enough!
