review/text: I receiced 1 bottle not 12 bottles as the description states Reckitt All-Purpose Cleaner, Lemon, 12 32 Oz Spray Bottles/Carton. I paid 4 times what I would have paid at my local grocery store for the same product. This was misleading and deceptive. Texas has a Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) & this difinitely falls under that heading. Extremely disapointed in the description and receipt of this product.
