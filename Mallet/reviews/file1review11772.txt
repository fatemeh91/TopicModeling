review/text: I had gastric bypass surgery for weight loss. Afterwards I was told to use a protein supplement. I tried at least 10 different products and they were awful. I finally found Champion Nutrition Pure Whey Protein Stack and it is great. It provides 26 grams of protein with only 1 gram of sugar. It dissolves easily in water and the flavors are pretty tasty. You can rotate the flavors to give yourself variety. It's a good value for the money and I highly recommend it!
