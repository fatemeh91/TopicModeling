review/text: if you are averse to cleaning your shower, this is the product for you! the smell is heavenly, and i only spray it every other day, so a box of six bottles has lasted me 7 months. if, like the other reviewers, your husband actually uses it, you'll probably go through it pretty fast. but consider yourself lucky if your husband actually cares about the cleanliness of the shower. it really does keep the soap scum and mildew down in my shower, so i have to clean it less, and that makes me happy.
