review/text: My old Norelco trimmer just gave out on me, after 8 years.I've had the t765 for about 4 months now, and I'm very happywith it. It trims my beard and stash effortlessly, and a singlecharge lasts very long. This model is a little smaller than mylast trimmer, it's very light, and fits comfortably in my hand.If the t765 lasts half as long as my old trimmer, I'll be happy!For $20.00 you can't beat this Norelco trimmer!
