review/text: I haven't had this that long, but so far i enjoy it.This is essentially clippers, the same one you may get your hair cut with at a barber shop or hair salon. The extra feature is the adjustable length you can set it to. You simply roll the dial on the side of this device and it adjusts the measurement device at the end and you go to town.It's all pretty easy and convenient. It advertises that it auto sharpens and you don't need to oil it, which is great because I hate doing that stuff for something like this.If you want to keep your facial hair a certain length, this is absolutely a great start especially for the price.I haven't had any battery issues yet, but if i do I will surely update my review.
