review/text: 5/28/10While sitting at my desk I heard a hissing sound and found the Duracell leaking a gas. I wrapped it up in a sock and threw it outside. The battery was very hot.I've had the Duracells for under a year and These batteries never really held a charge for long but was good enough for the convenience. I emailed Duracell today to see what they want to do about the faulty battery. I have 12 AA and 4AAA.6/4/10 Duracell has yet to contact me. The problem has been reported to them so if someone gets injured by their batteries they have failed to follow up on a potential problem.
