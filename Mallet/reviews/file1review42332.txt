review/text: My Mom has severe rheumatoid arthritis and getting in and out of the shower causes her pain. She has a shower chair but she has nearly slid off it twice. With this product she doesn't have worry about falling out of the shower. Not only can she bathe with it but she can use it to wash her hair. She smells nice and clean. Great product!
