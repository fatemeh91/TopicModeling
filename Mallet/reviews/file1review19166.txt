review/text: I've used a lot of different natural cough medicines over the years and they all help, but I still cough to some degree after I've used them. I don't know if it was a fluke or not, but the two times I took this stuff I coughed once right after I took it and that was it for about 8 hours. I tried a different cough syrup in between and it helped, but still coughed. I'm now buying the biggest bottle to keep on hand. I'm very impressed!
