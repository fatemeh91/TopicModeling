review/text: I f you are not from the Chicago area, you might pass this off as 'just another brand.&#34;I've been using this product since the 1960's, and can attest to it's greatness.It will leave absolutely ZERO streaks, as long as you finish very LIGHTLY with a paper towel, or if you prefer not to use paper towels, a window squeegee. it is ammonia free. It will not take off the lettering, or turn any of your black audio / video equipment a permanently ruined whitish hue. Super safe on TV's. It is very strong when attacking really hard, set in stains, or the gummy gunky residue left from the factory tags on new windows.Once you try this product, you will laugh at all the times you thought Windex was the best.Windex is not even in the same class as Sparkle. Nor is anything else.
