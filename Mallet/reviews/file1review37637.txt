review/text: This product had absolutely no scent. It went on very smoothly with little effort -- no need to rub too much. I had no skin irritation from this, even when I used it just after shaving. It did an excellent job as an anti-perspirant. It didn't leave an excessive amount of white powder under my arms, so it'd be fine to use with sleeveless clothing. I'd definitely purchase this product.
