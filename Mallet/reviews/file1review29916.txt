review/text: It works good for TV watching! For computer use, you can't magnify the screen much (by moving the lense farther away from the screen) or else it gets too blurry to read fine text/etc.. For TV use, I don't notice any blurring. There is glare. I can see my own reflection, which, mind you, is a beautiful thing to look at, but it's not something I want to see when I'm using my computer or watching TV, especially when I haven't shaved or showered in a while. There seems to be a slight blue tint to the lense, probably just a property of the kind of plastic they used, but I truly cannot notice it affecting the TV or computer colors. I made sure I didn't eat any smurf cereal in a while before double checking on this. The more enlargement you use, the more you have to be watching it from straight in front of it, probably obvious. I'm sure it could be improved technologically, to have some kind of anti-glare coating, and to not have any blur effect for computer use. But, I'm using it and pretty happy with it.
