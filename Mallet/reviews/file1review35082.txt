review/text: We got a rescue dog over a year ago. She was not socialized, had never been on grass, didn't know how to climb stairs and was fearful of everyone. She is very much improved. However she is still frightened of my husband and has anxiety attacks during thunderstorms and for firecrackers. The drops and spray help her with anxiety for storms and noises but have done nothing to reduce her fear of my husband. Any suggestions? sue
