review/text: I started taking these after my mother in law recommended them to me and they are great! My husband and I take 2 of them daily as an immune system boost but if we feel something coming on we up the dosage right away and we can normally fight it off or at least make whatever it is go away sooner! It is a great addition to anyone's routine on top of your multivitamin! Try them out!
