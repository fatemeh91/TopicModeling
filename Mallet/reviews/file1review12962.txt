review/text: This neck wrap is awesome. It has a nice weight, fits nice and snug without strangling you and so far I've had it on for a half hour and it's still super cold giving me relief. This is my first day with it but I can see many years of use ahead and will definitely purchase some of the other products. It's hard to get cold relief so nice and tight on your neck at home while walking around.
