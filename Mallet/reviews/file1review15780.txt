review/text: I use each pen for different purposes,academic, personal, and work-related. Between two different professions I have to write a lot of reports. Most reports need to be written in black ink, and some blue ink only, others detail notes highlighted in red. The pencil works well when writing drafts and for accounting or changing inventory. I wont use any other pen.
