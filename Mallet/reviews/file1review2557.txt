review/text: After reading some of these reviews, I was expected it to hurt a lot, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've used it on my legs and it didn't hurt that much at all--much less than waxing, and a lot easier and cheaper too! I'm so glad I don't have to deal with razors anymore, and it only took 20 min out of my Saturday. A great buy!
