review/text: The memory foam cushion is very comfortable for my back. However, I found the "massage" function irritating. It's more like a vibrating mode that gives me a headache after a few minutes. I can only turn it on briefly to "massage" and turned it off before it bothers my head. Overall, I used it as a cushion to support my back when I spent hours on my computer. In addition, the battery compartment is very tight that putting in or removing batteries can be very difficult. I put in Duracell batteries and hopfully I won't have to change batteries for a while.
