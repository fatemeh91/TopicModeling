review/text: Seven months ago, I bought this for my mother, who has extreme heartburn and hasn't found any relief using prescribed medicines. This has worked wonderfully! At first, she tried taking it as suggested - taking one softgel a day for 10 days - but found this to be too strong for her system (which is extremely sensitive). So, now she uses it whenever symptoms start to appear and it has consistently stopped the pain and other symptoms! She is also finding that symptoms don't show up nearly as often. This is such good news.
