review/text: I have had the original Sensor for almost 12 years now, and it still works the best of the ones i have tried. The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads. The two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving. Don't waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better.
