review/text: This is a great product for beard trimming or as a body groomer. Plastic head can pop off, or stay on and is the easiest adjustment possible. Great blades, attractive design, and works corded or cordless. One caveat may be obvious, but do not plug into 230V abroad -- blew it out in Ireland.
