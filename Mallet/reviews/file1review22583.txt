review/text: This product does leave a mark on your skin as it implies. However the "ink" is very gummy and hard to get a good coverage on the design. The package states that the design will be a bluish black, but after leaving it on the skin, it looks like washed magic marker. it is not dark at all. the covering that you must put over it to set the design prevents you from seeing if any of the ink has seeped out side the design area, creating the problem of stray splotches of "ink" other than the design. i do not reccommend this product at all.
