review/text: This product mixes very well with just a shaker and tastes great. I work very long hours and dont always have time or the ability to pack the proper lunch/dinner. It is so easy to carry in the truck and just make a shake to get me the proper nutrition I need. i highly recommend the optimum nutrition whey protein. There are so many flavors to choose from there is a flavor for anyone. I prefer the stawberry and tropical punch.
