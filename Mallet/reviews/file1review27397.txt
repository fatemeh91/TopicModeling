review/text: French Vanilla Creme was just bearable. It wasnt very bad, but just bearable enough to keep intaking this for the next 2 months. Will i purchase this again? Nope.I thought this was going to taste something like mocha flavor, but i was totally wrong. It taste like vanilla with bannana and less tasteful.I have a very good taste bud since i like to try every food in this earth, including hot and spicy stuff, all meat, pasta, and, maybe, insects.It can range anywhere from Hindi, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mexicans, Thai, Fiji, and Italian food.Alot of the foods that i eat are very delicious.But, this is just bearable!
