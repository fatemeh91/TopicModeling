review/text: This is excellent soap. I had one foot that was all cracked and blistered. I used it once and the foot started healing!! It is completely healed now. I am so impressed that I intend to keep some of this stuff around in the medicine cabinet for those times when you get itchy feet. It instantly stopped the itching and burning.
