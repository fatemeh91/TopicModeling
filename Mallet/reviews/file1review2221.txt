review/text: I was excited to get this after reading many positive reviews, and the first time I used it I was impressed by how little discomfort there was (as compared to waxing). However the more i use it the more I think it just breaks the hairs instead of actually plucking them. In the month or so that I have had this thing...I've yet to have perfectly smooth legs. I'm actually really bummed because I hate getting waxed and shaving is too irritating :(
