review/text: well where do i start?.....well my husband and i bought this product in hopes of conceiving well we havnt yet and are hoping to soon. its just so dissapointing. i read all these wonderful stories of other women getting pregnant and even those who didnt conceieve but it has made their periods regular and damnit...i didnt get either of those things. dont get me wrong but im not downing tghis product but i will keep taking it in good faith and hopefully something will turn up soon.
