review/text: My teeth are very tight and flossing has never been a joy of any kind, so I often don't do it! Then I got this little buzzer thingy and things have changed. Even though I still have trouble getting the floss between my teeth, once it is in there, I can feel it is doing a superb job of getting the tiny bits and goo off my teeth in areas regular flossing just doesn't go, and it does it in a third of the time regular flossing takes. I thought having a battery powered tooth pick was the height of arrogance, stupidity, and conspicuous consumption to the Nth degree, but I have changed my mind. The toothpick also gets into others spots the flosser can't reach. I will now be PROUD to visit my dentist.I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the floss, although very good, still shreds a tiny bit, due to my tight teeth;however it DOES last an entire flossing session, unlike regular floss. Over all, this is well worth the price and the very slight learning curve.
