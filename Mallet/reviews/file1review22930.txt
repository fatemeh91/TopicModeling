review/text: This scroller is very conveinent and efficient, I have had it for months, and I used it on carpet every day, I used it as often as a broom for the tiled floor. I have two kids and one dog, and now it's the season my dog falls hairs, I can use this scroller pick up dog hair every time I used it, which my vacuum could not pick up. I don't have problems with the handle, it was formed by 3 pieces but it never fell apart.
