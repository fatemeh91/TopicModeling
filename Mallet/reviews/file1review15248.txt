review/text: I usually love whatever I buy from Amazon. However, I have to say that these Balance bars were a disappointment. Our family loves Balance bars and we thought these tasted pretty good--however, after running out and buying some at the local Safeway, we realized that the locally bought bars taste quite a bit better because they are FRESH. Turns out the chewy taste we were used to from the bars we purchased here are in fact, stale. They still taste decent, but from now on, we will watch for sales and not buy these online.
