review/text: My $100+ Norelco razor died after nearly 7 years so I decided to give this mid-range panasonic razor a try since it uses different blades. The thing vibrates like crazy and it gave me razor burn. The separate adapter only works on 120V which means you can't use it in Europe or Asia - Norelco's voltage converter was integrated and could be used seamlessly with 120V and 220V and the cord was coiled for easy storage. Its also made in China, which usually means &quot;low-end&quot; today. In short this razor falls short of my expectations and I hope to be able to return it and get my $50+ money back.
