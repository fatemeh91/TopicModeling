review/text: I bought a can of this for my mom who suffers from chronic diarrhea due to an inflamed colon. It may have helped or not. My mom refused to take it after a short while (she is 84 and very stubborn). I was careful to marker-out the little tab saying the product was "Made in Africa." My mom would never have taken it otherwise. I liked how the fiber was packaged with the extra top insert inside the can. I thought the fiber would stay very dry and useable. Now it sits on the shelf half empty. I may try it myself.
