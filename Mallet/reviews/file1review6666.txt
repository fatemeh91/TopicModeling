review/text: I've had a Body Back Buddy for several months and it has changed my life. I've practiced self-massage for years and always struggled to reach the deepest knots in my back and shoulders without causing stress on my other muscles trying to reach them. Using the Body Back Buddy I can precisely reach the exact muscles that are knotted and hurting the most and apply as much pressure as I want, without having to contort my body or strain other muscles doing so. The "side-by-side" knobs are perfect for working out all those hard to reach muscles in the neck and lower back. I wish I had one of these years ago. If you're thinking of buying one, don't hesitate!
