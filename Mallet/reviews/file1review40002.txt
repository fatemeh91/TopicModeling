review/text: Solgar is the only brand recommended by Mary Enig (Nourishing Traditions, Eat Fat Lose Fat). She stipulates that you do not want a brand that is processed with high heat, and some other criteria that I can't recall at the moment, but it's not like they put this information on the label. But I do know one thing for sure. They're big chalky pills, the kind that you feel like will get stuck in your throat and choke you. They're easy to chew, but really bad tasting. If you know a brand that comes in easy to swallow gel caps or something, please comment on my review to let me know.
