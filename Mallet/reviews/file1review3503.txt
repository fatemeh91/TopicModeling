review/text: I suppose that like most women I had always assumed that I produced enough lubricant naturally, and that bottled lubricants were for older women or those with some sort of a physical problem. Well, I have learned differently! During extended foreplay a woman's natural lubricants aren't always enough to keep her experiencing the optimum of pleasure. A lubricant such as this one reduces or eliminates unpleasant friction, and it makes everything slide smoothly and pleasantly along.ID Glide is a water-based lubricant, which means that it is unlikely to promote a yeast infection, and it is quick and easy to clean up. Unlike silicone and oil-based lubricants it is friendly both to your body and to your toys.Also, beyond all that, I have learned that ID Glide makes an excellent massage fluid. Its thick formula means that it won't simply run off, but can placed where you wanted and then spread out and into the skin. ID Glide is both flavor and scent free, which means that it leaves no trace behind and gives it a natural feel to it that I love.Overall, I love the feeling I get when I use ID Glide, and know that you will too. I highly recommend this product to all adults!FYI: In general, there are three types of lubricants and each has its pros and cons. Water-based lubes are easy to cleanup and are unlikely to cause yeast infections, but on the down side they do need to be renewed every half hour or less due to drying. Oil-based lubes tend to have maximum slipperiness and last longest, but can lead to yeast infections and tend to break down latex condoms and toys quite quickly. Silicone-based lubes fall in between these two, being slicker and longer lasting than water-based lubes, but they do require longer clean up times, can stain sheets and clothing, and will eventually break down silicone toys.
