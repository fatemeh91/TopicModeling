review/text: Ordered four of these off Amazon because my dishwasher was making a loud grinding sound during every load.When they came in, I read over what was in them. Basically the main ingredient is lemon juice. Why am I paying this much for lemon juice I wondered.Anyways, I put the first one in like the directions said and ran the washer. After it was done, I could still hear the loud grinding. So I put the second one in and ran it again. This time the grinding went away but a new sound has popped up that I don't like. My washer is now overall louder than it was before. The grinding is gone but the overall sound output has gone up. Inside it does smell lemon fresh though thanks to all that juice that I paid over seven dollars for.I think I'm going to find a different brand next time my dishwasher gets dirty. I'll live with the sound output for now as long as that grinding is gone.
