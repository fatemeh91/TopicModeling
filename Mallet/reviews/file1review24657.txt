review/text: Does a great job: nice energy boost maximizes workouts. I can take two in the AM and it keeps me productive all day. I love em, been taking them for about a year as needed, and even got a few close friends taking them too. It's not a magic skinny pill, but it does what it says: energy up appetite down. Great tool if you're trying to stay on track with a diet and exercise plan.
