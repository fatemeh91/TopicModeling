review/text: The bristles on this brush are softer than you would think. The white bristles are pretty soft, and the blue ones are a little more stiff. It just feels like when using this to brush out my hydration bottle, that the bristles are so soft, they don't do much because they just bend to the core of the brush instead of sticking out and actually brushing the bottle. After one use of this brush, my blue bristles are already bent out of shape and stuck to the core of the brush...would not recommend to anyone else....
