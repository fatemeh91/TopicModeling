review/text: I needed a beard trimmer and opted for this model over the newer lithium-ion model based on various reviews. First off, forget the reviews that say to get this model over the newer model because this one supposedly works better. I combed my beard thoroughly before using this trimmer, and it still pulled on my hairs painfully a few times whenever I shaved. It seemed to be a lot worse the longer my beard was.Second, if you use this trimmer more than twice a week or if you do a lot of trimming, you're not going to be happy with this one. The battery is about good enough for 2-3 longer sessions, or 10-12 quick trims, and since it's a NiCad battery, there's no such thing as quickly topping it off. You have to run the battery down to zero, then charge it for more than 12 hours. And of course, if you let it sit for a couple months without using it, it'll be dead anyway--so you need to plan at least a day in advance of ever wanting to use it. Since I rarely grow a beard, I suppose this will get me by, but anyone who trims their beard or mustache regularly is going to be annoyed at the battery's inconvenience.Third, the product listing on Amazon is inconsistent. In one place, it says this trimmer is rinsable, and in another place, it says it is not. As it turns out, this trimmer is absolutely not rinsable. It also does not include a detail head, which is included with at least one of the newer models in about the same price range.Overall, I'd say I'm disappointed in this trimmer. I knew ahead of time what sacrifices I was making, but other Amazon reviews had led me to believe the performance was so much better than other models that this one was worth it. It isn't as awesome as other reviewers have suggested, and it definitely wasn't worth the tradeoffs. I'd much rather have had the rinsable lithium-ion model with detail trimmer.
