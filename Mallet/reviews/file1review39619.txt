review/text: I am very happy that I found these! I so hated the idea of using something disposable, that I need to use frequently throughout the day. Non-disposable flossers are simply not worth the money.These flossers, however, are definitely worth the money. Can you say Cha-ching!!!, as in I'm happy to spend the money on it. These flossers are functional, well constructed. Without a flosser, I had a very difficult time flossing my back teeth. No problem with these flossers! If I could give it more than five stars, I would.
