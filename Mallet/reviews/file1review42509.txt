review/text: Hello,I drink the chocolate flavor of this shake. It is a great source of amino acids, and has helped improve my dietary deficiencies. I also feel very relaxed and good after drinking it. It digests well. I will continue with this shake until they come out with a better one.My biggest problem with this shake is how thin it is. I have to put alot of ice, milk, bananas... something to thicken it up. Otherwise it is as thin as water and not palatable.Its great for people with blood sugar sensitivities- it has little to no sugar. The only sugar is most likely from what you have to put into it to make it thicker and tastier.My favorite tasting shake is the old Spirutein (not whey). It is a soy shake. I am not into soy anymore as it has been associated with estrogen dominance (hormone imbalances), and thyroid problems. Unless you are estrogen deficient or post-menopausal Soy should be limited in your diet. For men, I'd say to take soy very sparingly. However, I always compare shakes to that one because it was so thick and yummy.Elite protein powder is still a great find. Recommend it.
