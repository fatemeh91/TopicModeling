review/text: I have two cleaning cloths: one from my eye doctor and this one. The one from my eye doctor is similar to this one but its pouch has already started coming apart. I have had no problems with the pouch this one comes in. I'm surprised I wasn't able to find a lens cleaning cloth like this at my local stores. Price wise, I'm not sure how this one stacks up against similar products because, like I mentioned, I have not really seen cleaning cloths like this in my local area.
