review/text: It is not easy to find cruelty-free eye drops, but finally I found these. I don't have much to compare these to, as I am a relatively new eye-drop user. But, they seem to do the trick. My eyes definitely feel less dry with continued use. I like the product packaging, too -- the drops come out in a very controlled fashion. The only thing I find bothersome about this product is that it is recommended that you throw it away after 30-days due to the fact that there are no preservatives. It takes me about two months to finish a bottle -- so throwing it away half-full seems very wasteful. However, I continue to use it until it is gone and have not had any ill-effects. I don't necessarily recommend that you do the same -- but just wanted to mention it. I will continue to repurchase.
