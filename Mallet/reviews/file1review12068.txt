review/text: The reason I love these vitamins is that they're easy to digest due to the added probiotics and they are specifically designed with women in mind -whether you're trying to conceive or not. Many other brands contain exagerrated amounts of each vitamin (eg. 8,000% DV of thiamine), and that just doesn't seem right or healthy to me. I've been using these for about 2 years now and combined with omega 3 fish oils, I have noticed an improvement in my energy as well as my skin and nails. I feel it's important to note that these vitamins won't cure anything and they will not cancel out poor eating habits or inadequate water consumption. If you eat poorly, you'll continue to feel poorly no matter how long you take these, but they're great supplement and I highly recommend them!
