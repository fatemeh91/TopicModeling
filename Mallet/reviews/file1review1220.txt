review/text: Well lets face it, who doesn't like a nice warm muff? No seriously this thing is great. It warms up nicely in about 5 minutes in the microwave and stays warm for a good 10-15 minutes, which is plenty of time for me to warm up my wrist before stretching exercises. Also, it smells great, although some in the house have complained that the aroma is overpowering - get bent. It looks to be well constructed and I expect it to hold up for a long time. Sure it was a little pricey considering it's a freaking bean bag, but it definitely performs as promised so I can't complain.
