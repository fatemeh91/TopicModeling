review/text: I'm wearing this thing as I type. I've had tendinitis in both elbows for about the last 10 years now. Hurt my back a couple of years ago and stopped being active entirely for a year in exercises that require the use of arms (lifting weights, basketball, racquet sports). The pain mostly went away, except that I still felt it a little bit of an ache whenever I flexed the gripping muscles. So I started exercising and playing sports again. Much to my chagrin, the pain came back in spite of taking care to warm up and stretch. Perhaps I did not do those things enough, but the pain returned very quickly. So I decided to try this support.My pain isn't debilitating. I can still play sports (in my case, basketball and badminton) fine, but the pain is always there.After a few hours of wearing the straps, I could feel some relief, which was very good. However, the edges of the strap that is in direct contact w/ my skin is a bit rough, and thus irritates my skin somewhat. Also, because the strap is the same for both arms, the buckle will also obstruct movement in one arm depending on whether you have golf or tennis elbow. I'm inclined to return this and try something else, but I'll probably give it a week and see if my condition improves some.Edit:I played around a little more with this thing and wanted to make a correction to my previous statements about the buckle (since I thought about it after I submitted my review). You can turn it around and the buckle will NOT end up on the inside of where the elbow bends. I was wrong about that. Still, it's not the most comfortable brace out there, and the rough edges still chafes my skin some.
