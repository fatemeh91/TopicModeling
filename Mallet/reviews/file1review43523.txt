review/text: I bought a bp monitor because my doctor suggested having one at home so I could monitor my blood pressure. I looked at many bp monitors online and decided on the HEM-711AC because of its features and price. It is easy to use and has a large readout. It comes with a small carrying case and AC adaptor which makes it very portable. After comparing it with my last bp reading at the clinic I found out it to be accurate.
