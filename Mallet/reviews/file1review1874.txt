review/text: I read most of the reviews about this product and normally I was very skeptical about buying something like this. I received it very quickly and tried it right away. It made my skin feel very clean and the itching was gone in 2 days. I wear boots all day long (military) and hate how my feet are always sweaty and hot and this product really helps keep fungus at bay. There are so many different types of toe fungus and this product might not work for all of them but I have taken pills and used every over the counter product and this product is the only thing that works. Only use a little bit, this product goes A LONG WAY! The smell is great too! I am going to tell my friends and family about this product and hopefully they find it useful as much as I do. There is a smaller size too if you do not want to buy so much at first.
