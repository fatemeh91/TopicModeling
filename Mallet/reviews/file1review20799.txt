review/text: Over the past 15-20 years I've had three Braun razors. This 8585 is my most recent and highest end model. I suppose I've had it about 3 years now (1 foil/cutter change and another change due). The prior Braun's I've had were middle of the road models and both worked fairly well. In fact, I didn't think this razor worked that much better and it had the "new" foil design which was one of the reasons I purchased it. I initially used the "self-cleaning" method but after awhile it seemed like a waste so I decided to just hand clean every day (20 seconds). The self-cleaning does work very well initially, but once it fills up with hair/dirt it doesn't clean as effective. Another thing to watch out for is if you don't use the self cleaning it will just evaporate. (Kind of like ink in your printer.) So, if you think you can get 3 months out of it doing it every 3-4 days, think again. It won't last. The alcohol evaporates.One big con is this high pitch noise the razor makes. It makes it when charging and it also makes it about every 8 minutes (beep-beep). The "every 8 minute" beep, which is probably doing a battery check, is quite annoying. Every once in awhile while in my bathroom I would hear a beep-beep. For many years I've heard this and it wasn't until recently that I discovered it is the razor. So, a big disappointment. I'm surprised it got through the Braun QA.Anyway, it is a decent razor but if you every hear a high pitch noise--check the razor. Every 8 minutes it will make it.
