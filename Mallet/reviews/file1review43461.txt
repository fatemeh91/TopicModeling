review/text: Easy to use, but gave inaccurate readings. Took it to my Dr's office and reading was 20mg higher than doc's. At home it said my wife's BP was 140, hers has never been over 120. I returned it for a full refund and would not recommend purchasing since there are many other reviews saying this product has accuracy issues.
