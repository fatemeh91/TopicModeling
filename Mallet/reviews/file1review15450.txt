review/text: My good friend was diagnosed with osteopenia, where the density in bones is lower than they should be (a precursor to osteoporosis). After two years of taking this product along with vitamin D, her bones are back to normal.Diagnosed with osteoporosis earlier this year (2012), I started taking Ionic Mineral Calcium about 4 months ago. I have not had a subsequent bone density test, so I cannot speak to its effectiveness personally yet (it takes a while to rebuild bone density). I can, however, say that it is the easiest way I have found to take calcium supplements that are 100% absorbable (hence the seemingly small amount of calcium) without overloading my system with hard to process calcium pills or powders.I take it along with Vitamin D AND Vitamin K (which helps bones to stay flexible -- a great hedge against breaks).It has virtually no taste, goes down like water.
