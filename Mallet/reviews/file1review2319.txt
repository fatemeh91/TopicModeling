review/text: I have used this product for years. I'm a 70-year-old woman so dry eyes can be a problem. With this product, I seldom even need to used eye drops. Through the years from time to time I've tired of taking the three pills a day (along with all my other meds) and wanted to save money so I'd stop taking it. Every time I regretted it--my eyes began bothering me again. I highly recommend the product.
