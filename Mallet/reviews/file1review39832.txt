review/text: Got this for my parents. Plan to return it. It looks flimsy. Could not fold w/out probably breaking it. Had to use two hands to old tight enough to get small box from the upper shelf of pantry. A neighbor of my parents had similar tool they were raving about, but it obviously was NOT this one! Not impressed.
