review/text: I can't believe this trimmer is still around. I bought this exact model over 10 years ago and today I dropped it on the ground and it stopped working so I've been looking on amazon for a replacement. This was my first and only trimmer and it's performed nicely during that time. I don't know if the ones being made today are of the same quality but mine gets 5 stars for longevity.This trimmer has a plain and boring look to it but it cuts nose hair pretty well. Never had an issue with it pulling on hair unless the battery was low. You might have to push a little harder in the bend near the tip of your nose to get a close trim but it's not troublesome.Towards the end of this trimmer's life it did start having issues turning on. I found out the battery contacts were getting corroded. If you look at the contacts and see a bluish greenish coloring on them, it's corrosion and is preventing contact with the battery. To remedy this I took a cotton swab and dabbed it in vinegar and wiped the contacts. The corrosion will come off and it should work fine again. But eventually the corrosion will come back. It wasn't a huge problem for me and I was able to live with it.But now it's time to find another trimmer. This one has performed very admirably all these years but I'd like to try something new. Plus, this one is more expensive than many of the other trimmers. Maybe the extra cost is for the long lasting durability? Anyways happy trimming!
