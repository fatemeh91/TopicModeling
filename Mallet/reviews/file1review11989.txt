review/text: After doing a lot of review reading here on various pre-natal vitamins I went with these and have no regrets. They dissolve well and I have not had any indigestion or burping with them. They are not any bigger than the multi-vitamin I was taking before pregnancy, and I don't have a problem swallowing the pill. I ordered them on Amazon because they had the lowest price, but it did take about 2 weeks to arrive after they shipped.
