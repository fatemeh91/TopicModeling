review/text: I ordered this cane for a friend after a knee replacement. It was less than half the price of the quad cane at the medical supply store and was delivered (for free) more quickly. This cane has a flowered pattern on it and quickly was nicknamed the "tattoo cane". I would highly recommend it.
