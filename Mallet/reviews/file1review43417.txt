review/text: when youre pregnant and needing to use the bathroom every 30 minutes, the last thing you want to do is unstrap an entire body device. also, i got this for pelvic girdle pain and not varicose veins, but it didnt help with the pelvic pain for anyone who is looking to get it for the same reason.
