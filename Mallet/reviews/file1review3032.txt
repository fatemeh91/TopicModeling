review/text: I live in a Hollywood apartment and sometimes have females who enter my dwelling. I try to look hip and smooth so that they'd dig my style and offer me some of their sugar. So aside from always wearing yoga pants and having a sweet 3D TV smack dab in the middle of my living room, I places boxes of Okamoto Crown throughout my house so that it really looks like I am a big timer. You know the ladies like it when you made it big time, right?Well, one day I was watching Transformers Revenge of The Fallen on my sweet 3D TV, and I was like "hey, maybe I should put on one of these condoms and see what it is like". So I did. And baby, let me tell you it felt good. It felt like my penis was reinforced. You know what I said? I said, "why not test this baby out, and see how she performs". So I went outside in my yoga pants, with my condom on underneath and went for a jog. I'd figure this is the best way to simulate intercourse. So I worked up a sweat, and checked the condom. No rips... good. When I finished the jog, I went back to my sweet apartment in Hollywood. I checked to see how the condom was doing. Pretty good, it was dangling off the tip of my knob, but thats probably b/c I lost my erection half way through the jog. What can I say, huh? Maybe I should work in some viagra into my jogs.So now I know what these things feel like. Before they were just strangers to me, laying around my apartment as bait for impressing chicks. Now, they are a part of me. Its like we have been together. Anyway, if you ever walk into an apartment with a sweet 3D TV, a couple of boxes of Okamoto scattered on the floor, and a cool dude wearing yoga pants smiling at you, you'll know whats up (in my yoga pants).
