review/text: I have keloids from ear to ear on my face and several on my chest. I have been using these for the past two weeks. Since I work full time, I only use these during bedtime and wear all night. The first week was rocky because as mentioned they kept rolling up and falling off. But my new approach is to focus on one area at a time. I decided to just work on applying them to my face to get those keloids under control. I have very oily skin so the fix was to wash my face with an oil free solution. I use Purpose which helps keep my skin acne and oil free. I wouldn't recommend this soap for normal to dry skin because it really strips all the oil from your face and body. After washing my face, I apply the patches directly to my face and I notice that it bonds tighter to the skin and stays on through the night. I actually change them out every 3 days as recommended in the directions and I save the plastic disks that you peel off and reapply those to the adhesive strips to keep them clean and dust free. This seems to be working. And I've noticed remarkable results on my keloids. They are smoother, more uniformed in appearance and seem to be strinking in size. I will keep you updated if this works for the keloids on my chest.
