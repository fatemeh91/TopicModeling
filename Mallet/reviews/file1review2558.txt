review/text: With my German "hairitage", blade shaving just wasn't cutting it. ;-)Epilating was the answer for me back in the 90s. I went from the "whirling coil of death" aka Epilady original that felt like sticking your leg in a wasp nest to a then-Norelco Satinelle fixed-head epilator, which I affectionally dubbed "spinning disks of doom" because it hurt a *lot* less but I used it nearly everywhere - legs, arms, underarms, bikini, and there are some places that it does still smart to use. When the motor on that one tanked, I bought a Satinelle Sensitive with interchangeable head and little rubber nubbly things that were supposed to make epilating not hurt... I think by then for me it didn't matter, and eventually one by one the rubber nubblies fell off anyway so they're a waste of money for anyone who can tolerate epilating already. I dropped the Satinelle Sensitive once too often and a plastic cog inside broke in half, so the discs wouldn't spin. I tried my daughter's Philips epilator but for some reason it didn't catch the shorter finer hairs as well as mine had - the discs on mine seemed to be tighter or something. However, the heads were interchangeable (!!! YAY !!!) so I used my old SS head on her base and it worked. I saw the price on this unit and figured I'd give it a try, and lo and behold my trusty SS epilator head fit this base unit as well and works like new at less than half the original Satinelle Sensitive price (if it *were* available, which it isn't), so I'm a happy camper. :D At this price, I'll be buying another as a back-up, and Amazon.com got it to me very quickly. I also figure I have enough parts to put together another one should these fail and Philips epilators go out of production. :D
