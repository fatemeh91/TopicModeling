review/text: These little strips are worth a buck to pee in a cup. I tried the first test a week before I thought I thought I'd start my period this month...negative result. So I figured I'd should expect aunt flo. My cycles are long (35-38 days), but at day 40 I thought I'd test again. I got a faint result line. Excited but leary, I bought a store baught test and it too had a faint line. Happy to say the doc has confirmed I'm 5 weeks pregnant. Yaye!Tip: Since my cycles are long, I didn't know when I was ovulating so I used this company's ovulation strips. I got a positive ovulation result 2 days in a row last month and hubby and I did our thing the second positive day...it worked!
