review/text: I wanted to like this support belt, especially after reading all the positive reviews from others who were pregnant with twins. However, it is terribly uncomfortable.- First of all, it is difficult to adjust and as others have stated, the hooks at the bottom are spaced too far apart.- Secondly, for me, being short and pregnant with twins at 25 weeks, there is no more room under my breasts. I cannot even wear a bra with underwire at this point, and the straps on this that go under your breasts are very very uncomfortable.- Thirdly, it did not provide either the back support or the under belly support that I was specifically looking for with this belt. The underbelly band feels too narrow, and I felt like my large belly is just hanging out there.After spending 43 dollars on it, I gave it several chances, and tried every which way to adjust it, but it just doesn't work. As this was my 3rd support belt and I am now on my 4th, I wanted to share my experience with the most recent one I got which is working well, just in case there are others like me who have severe back pain and feel miserable and heavy.It is from BabiesRUs and the brand is BabiesRUs. It is this one:[...]It is only 30 dollars, but hey at this point I would have spent 300 if it meant I could get some relief. This belt has both large a large underbelly band and an extralarge back band to give excellent support to your back and your tummy. It is mildly complicated to put on because it has 3 parts, but it's better than this Prenatal Cradle contraption that made me feel like Houdini every time I tried to get in and out of it. It is soft and doesn't snag on clothing. And it's been great for both sitting and walking around.Good luck!
