review/text: This product is NOT VEGAN. LEGALLY, something cannot be labeled as vegan if it has BEESWAX in it. I am using it because I bought it and I opened it without noticing the label so some bees suffered somewhere for it for no reason if I throw it out, but I am really ****ing pissed that this was labeled vegan and it is not.
