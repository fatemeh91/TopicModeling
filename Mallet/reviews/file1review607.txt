review/text: My husband suffered a heart attack a few years ago becoming unstable on his feet. His first walker/rollator had 8" wheels and was handy and lightweight, good, but not the best in Alaska's winter snows. Also the seat was not adjustable for height and it wasn't exactly the right height for my husband. We purchased the Cosco rollator because of it's sturdiness and even larger wheels and it is the most versatile item we own. As it is designed for use, the wheels are wonderful for crossing all kinds of terrain, level, snowy, or gravel. The seat adjustment is easy, quick, and comfortable. The Handles also adjust easily without having to take any screws out and move parts, as we had to do on his first rollator. It folds easily and transports in the back of our pickup without a problem. It is 'slightly' heavy compared to other lighter weight walker / rollators, but it's versatility outweighs the 'slightly heavy' aspect. For those who are more active its great for hauling things. I am able to stack several pieces of firewood on the seat saving my back and arm muscles from fatigue. It enables my husband to do this chore too which he would not be able to do otherwise. When company comes I use it as my 'spare chair', handy and comfortable for me. I also use it as a foot rest since the lazyboy is always occupied.This is the second Cosco Rollator I purchased because of frequent loaning the first one out to others as needed. Now we don't have to be without a Cosco. Bottom line - I just love this rollator and would keep it around even if it wasn't needed for walking purposes.I was able to purchase by new blue Cosco rollator from Amazon, on sale for $107.-00 - a terrific price!
