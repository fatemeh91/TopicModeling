review/text: The rash I bought this soap for is going away but I'm not sure if Fungasoap was responsible. My athletes foot went away but I was treating it with something else, so... who knows?This soap has a very strong odor but it doesn't linger long on the skin and does not transfer to clothes or bedding. It rinses off well and leaves you feeling clean.Try it, it may help.
