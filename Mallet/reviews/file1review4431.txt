review/text: I paid about $26 dollars for the 12 count package, the local CVS had a 4 pack on sale for $14. Enough said about the price, awesome deal! Received the package in good order and they were Gillette Fusion blades, no bait and switch. Ended up going with the subscribe and save option as well.
