review/text: I was surprised to really notice a difference the first day I took it. I've only been taking one capsule per day, but have noticed a difference everyday that I've taken it (with some skipped days in between). The bottle says that three capsules can be taken per day, but I didn't want remember too much all at once, that would be nuts. Or would it, I can't remember.
