review/text: I have owned an 8585 for a couple of months now and I am diappointed with it. I'm a long-time Braun fan, but this foil design is no improvement over previous Brauns, for my beard. I used a 7000 model for well over 5 years...through one battery/motor replacement...and I loved it. The plastic case finally failed and I gave up the ghost. But I still have a Braun 6000 series and it shaves closer than the 8585. It seems to be the foil...probably not as thin now. The new 8000 series is quieter, seemingly more powerful and a little more comfortable against the skin than previous series, 6000 and 7000, but again, it clearly doesn't shave as close. Over a decade ago I tested a Norelco rotary and was disappointed by a not-so-close shave. I discovered Braun which beat Norelco and Remington, for me. The new 8585, and probably the 8595 is no better than other brands. My advice: for the closest electric shave find a Braun pre-8000; that's what I'm looking for to shave close on my fair, caucasian, red-hair beard.
