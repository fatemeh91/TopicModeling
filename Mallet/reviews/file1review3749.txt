review/text: Have used this product on my 14 yr old son and husband for about five years now. They normally take one capsule twice a day on an empty stomach and it is the only thing that keeps them regular. They both have a slow transit colon which makes it impossible to have normal bowel movements without this product. I hope they never go out of business. What a blessing. Works even better with a cup of tea with lemon for those days that you are really backed up because of traveling or whatever. No, cramping or gas. It takes a couple of days to work. Our Chiropracter told us about it, and said that intially, it is recomended to take a high dosage to flush everything out, and then mantainence of the one capsule twice a day.
