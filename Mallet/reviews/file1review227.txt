review/text: I don't see how this is any different from the conventional (non-pet) lint rollers, except maybe that the handle is green? My dog likes to chew on this one more? Regardless, it works well (just as well as the regular version) for pulling coarse dog hair off just about everything. And so far, the handle has stood up to a few good chewing sessions.
