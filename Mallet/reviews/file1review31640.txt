review/text: Good quality product, got more burn time than I expected, but still a bit pricey. Compared to typical scented candles, i.e. Yankee Candle lavender, this is not as strong, won't fill as large an area with scent, but it's a more pure lavender scent, quite pleasant. Works best in a small space, i.e. a bedroom or bathroom.
