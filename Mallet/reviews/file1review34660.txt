review/text: I didn't receive the jar for over 2 weeks. I sent them an email about it and never got a reply. The product is great however. I have used it in cooking *Yummy brownies!) and my skin. It is solid but starts to melt into an oil in your hand. The smell isnt that strong but it does smell like fresh coconut.
