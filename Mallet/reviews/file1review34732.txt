review/text: I had been searching, and trying, several organic deodorants because of the harmful chemicals in the regular deodorant & antiperspirants....with that being said this product has one of the best smells I've found in the natural deodorants I've came across, and in deodorant overall. The only unfortunate thing is that I perspire a lot, and since this is not an antiperspirant it didn't help much...but I didn't expect it to (hence it being just a deodorant) -- I'm not sure of the proper number of "sprays" to get optimal performance of the product, but the musty odor would come along probably about an hour of spraying five times under each arm. So, I would have to respray a few times in order to cover the odor...not sure if that's what I should expect but that is what I've found so far in natural spray/liquid deodorants -- not the sweating issue, but the must odor issue occurring. I am assuming it's just my body and I need something stronger.The product though, in terms of smell is amazing.
