review/text: Great protein.I have seen some solid gains while using it, however, it is a few dollars more than the 'generic' brands of protein you can get from say Walmart. If I had more money I would stick to this, however, I suppose I will just switch back and forth between the inexpensive stuff and this brand. The taste was probably a 10/10 and has a much better consistency than the cheapies.I enjoyed it.Recommended.Use it!
