review/text: Did you ever spend $20 on something wondering if it even does what it says on the box? That's how I feel about this product.I wonder if the extra blades even do anything useful during my shave. But the real question here is whether the "power" part of this product differentiates it at all from the non-"power" version. Really, what's the difference? I couldn't tell any during my shave.But... Compared to the Schick multi-blade razors, the Fusion is incredibly better. The wire that holds in the Schick blades makes for not as close a shave. The Fusion's extra single blade is a great innovation, something they should consider for their single-blade model.Still, this all leaves me wondering if I shouldn't just get my own straight razor and avoid this monthly razor tax.
