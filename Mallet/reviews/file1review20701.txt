review/text: For those of you (like me) who have noticed a significant decline in the Braun Activator replacement blades, I decided to take one for the team and try and see if the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo would work in my Activator. The fit is perfect, and the blade style is of the thinner variety formerly used in the Activator. I had an immediate improvement in shave closeness--with none of the hair pulling of my old replacement blade. If you own an Activator and you're about to toss it out because of the terrible quality of these replacement blades, you might want to search for "Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo" and try my route first. Hope this is helpful.
