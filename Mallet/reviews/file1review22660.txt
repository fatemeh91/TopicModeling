review/text: Not only will she not expect this, but this will be the gift that keeps on giving. It's not a diamond, but based on the reaction I got, it's pretty darn close. Definitely a must have for anyone with back problems as well. In short, who would NOT benefit from having one of these?By the way, speaking on its quality, the Jeanie Rub is very sturdily constructed. It is made in the USA. I don't foresee ever having an issue with mine, based on how I've seen them perform. My chiropractor uses this too. You gotta get one.
