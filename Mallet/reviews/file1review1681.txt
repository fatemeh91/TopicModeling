review/text: I have been fighting dry cracked heels for years.Mine have gotten so bad that they crack open and feel like I'm walking on a nail with every step. I have tried tons of different creams to try to alleviate the painful cracking and this stuff works by far the best of any I have tried in the past. I use it with the Visco-GEL Heel-So-Smooth Heel Sleeves which I got on Amazon too. Together they are awesome!! Don't know if the cream works as well by itself because it works so well with the Visco-Gel sleeves I haven't tried it any other way.
