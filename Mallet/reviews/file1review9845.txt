review/text: I had been suffering from some in-grown beard hairs for the last couple of years (not realizing it was due to using a cartridge razor with eleventy blades in it) that were really frustrating to deal with &#34;normal&#34; tweezers. (I've switched to wet shaving with a safety razor and hopefully won't need this very often, but very happy with them anyway.)
