review/text: This is a really good price on these razor cartridges. Getting the 12-pack is certainly the most economical, but the 8-pack is probably an easier price to swallow. You get two 4-packs, basically.As for the razor itself, it's good. I shave in the shower with no shaving cream or gel, just hot water, and it leaves no rash or burn. I can usually get about 7-8 shaves out of one razor cartridge, which isn't a ton, but I guess is par for the course. I'm not actually super crazy about the "lubrastrip" as it leaves a slimy film on the first couple shaves. But I get that that is meant to help have a smooth shave. Overall, this is one of the better blades on the market.
