review/text: This is very well made and I suppose would work well if it stayed up. If you have large thighs, it will not. It rolls down. I would like to add that it is pretty true to size, if anything maybe a little on the larger side and not smaller. I wish it would have worked for me, because it is well made for the money. It's just going to sit here and not be used:( Shipping was quick too! This is not the companys fault, if your a larger person, these things happen.
