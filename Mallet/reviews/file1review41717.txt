review/text: This is by far the best electric toothbrush we've come accross. We give them to our ortho patients as part of their treatment and also highly recommend them to all our other patients. The storage parts are dishwasher safe.I love how clean it makes my teeth feel and it makes my gums feel fantastic! It stutters to tell you its time to move to the next quadrant and when your 2 minutes are up, you get a happy face on the display for brushing!
