review/text: Have been using on whey for a while, usually the double chocolate. Decided to change it up and get the chocolate mint because i love mint chocolate chip ice cream. This taste more like light chocolate with a slight after taste of mint, not good at all. Would recommend this product , but in a different flavor.
