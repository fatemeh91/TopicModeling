review/text: I read these reviews and wondered how the Bodybuilding Federation could endorse a product that got these bad reviews.So, I bought one. I love it!Now, I can see how some people may not have been able to use it effectively, because it only opens a few inches and is probably more for fit people than for heavy people. Bit if you are fit and just want to see how fit, this is the device for you.I find the results very repeatable. Each of the three measurement sites have been repeatable within 1mm over dozens of trys.The Myotape is also cool. Use it and mybodycomp.com to get your body fat percentage and see just how close the number is to the number the calipers give you. Amazingly, for me, the number was identical.Great product! Much better than my body fat scale which gives me double the number that this gives me.
