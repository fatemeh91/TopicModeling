review/text: While shopping for a beard trimmer for my husband for Christmas I was offered a bundled deal with this little trimmer. Wish I had bought one years ago. It accomplishes the task safely and quickly and without the vibrations that a friend had reported made him sneeze when using similar device from a different manufacturer.
