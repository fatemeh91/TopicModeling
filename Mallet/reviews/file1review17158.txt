review/text: This thing whistled across my thick, thick beard like it was nothing! It trimmed everything on the first go-around with ZERO pulling. Maybe I am partial because my previous one basically tore half the hair out of my face, haha, but this product definitely does what it is supposed to do! Definitely worth it!
