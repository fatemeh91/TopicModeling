review/text: I keep it near my desk at work and work out tension in my neck and shoulders, a couple of times a day, before it gets bad. This thing reaches any part of the body. No more waiting until someone's available to give you a massage (and by that time, you've already got a tension headache or very tense muscles). I carry it in the car on long trips.For about half the price of a massage, this is a must have. It's big and kinky looking and everyone will ask you about it, but I haven't seen a better-designed product for the job at hand.
