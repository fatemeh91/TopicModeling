review/text: I am concerned about this product because my doctor said that raw cruciferous vegetables are hard on your thyroid. Unlike other DIM supplements this product has "protectamins (spinach powder, cabbage powder and concentrated broccoli powder - 100 mg)" added to the DIM - 100 mg. I don't know if this means they are cooked or raw.Vitamin E - 9 IU is also added. I like that because it is one of the 3 EFAs - essential fatty acids - (as are Fish Oil and Borage Oil.)In any case thank God that we have DIM to help get rid of that bad estrogen which is building up in our bodies thanks to our city water with all the contraceptives people use, and also the plastics, and many health and beauty products. (Parabens are xeno-estrogens. Google for a list of them all.)
