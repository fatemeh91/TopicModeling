review/text: I leaned back in the chair & the leg snapped!!! I fell to the floor & was injured! My back & elbow were bruised & I haven't even received a call back from the company. They promised me a new chair with a metal base but 3 weeks have passed & NOTHING! So be careful, I wouldnt want anyone getting seriously injured from this chair.
