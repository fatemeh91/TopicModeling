review/text: Bought this to replace a Norelco Accutrol 900 that I had for a couple years. The new Remington trimmer works great and the length adjustment stays were you put it.As a warning - the operating instructions say to hold the trimmer so that the length adjustment wheel is facing away from you. This is INCORRECT because if you do that the blades are the same distance from the guide no matter what setting you have and the only thing that changes the depth of cut is the angle you hold the trimmer to your face! Hold it so the adjustment wheel faces towards you!!I think most people would spot this right away but in case you haven't used a trimmer like this before, it's good to know before you make a mistake that'll last a week, lol.Had it for about a month now and it does a great job, still haven't had to recharge it since the initial charge. The only downside compared to my previous Norelco is that this one doesn't have a smaller pop-up detail trimmer...overall no big deal and I would highly recommend the MB-200 to anyone looking for a good beard & mustache trimmer.
