review/text: I've been using this product for many years during flues and when I would get sore throats. Gurgle your throat with salt, spray this in your throat and don't eat for a few hours. If you catch your sore throat during an early stage, you can CURE it with this spray. Otherwise, it will become a lot more manageable.
