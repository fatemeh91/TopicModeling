review/text: I've been using various rotary and micro-screen shavers by Norelco, Braun, and Remington for nearly twenty years, but the Braun 8585 is by far the best one I've ever used. I can't believe I get such an amazingly close shave with it with absolutely no skiin irritation. Plus, the self-cleaning system work great. It really does feel like a brand new shaver every time I use it. I hope this thing lasts forever, because I cannot imagine ever wanting to use a different shaver.
