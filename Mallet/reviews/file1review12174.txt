review/text: Purchased these multivitamins for a friend via Amazon Prime (sold by Electronica Direct) last week. The supplement facts posted in an image here on Amazon are NOT what is posted on the Rainbow Light web site nor does it match what is on the bottle. THE DIFFERENCE IS SIGNIFICANT. As of this posting, the correct information can be found here: [...]Also, my friend has had one or two severe migraine headaches per year for several years. She took these two days in a row and within 8 hours had absolutely debilitating migraines...to the point that she would have been rushed to the ER if they didn't ease up within an hour or two. Yes, she took them with a meal (breakfast) and with plenty of water. No, she is not taking and has not taken any other prenatal vitamins. She did not take one today and so far so good. She will be visiting her healthcare provider in the next few days to see if they can figure it out. She's 6 weeks LMP so about 3 weeks gestation.
