review/text: Pros:-DurableCons:-Difficult to hold on to with wet handsI used this brush for the first time to clean about 1000 sq feet of grout lines over about 3 hours. It does a pretty good job and appears it will hold up to do the whole job again a few more times. Once my hands got wet, it was difficult to hold on to and finding the right angle to apply brushing force was nearly impossible. The solution to this was to keep my hands dry. I tired to use this brush for other tasks as well, but it is really only designed to do straight back and forth scrubbing. I will buy this brush again when the time comes for a new one.
