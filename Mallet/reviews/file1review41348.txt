review/text: Before I used this product along with my new purchased "Bissell 2080 Quick Steamer Powerbrush Lightweight Upright Deep Cleaner Carpet Cleanser", I thought my carpet was quite clean as I often vacuumed. I was WRONG!!! I was schocked when I first used this, to see how dirty the water got!!! After a couple of cleanings, the water did not get that dirty and I felt my carpet was almost brand new - even better than professional cleaning - clean & fluffy. Another good thing about this priduct is that it is earth-friendly formula which means it is gentler to human body as well. LOVE IT!!!
