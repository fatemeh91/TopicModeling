review/text: I still believe that Gillette has not done anything spectacular since the Sensor razor blade. All the upgrades since just seemed more gimmicky to me (lotion pad that wears after 2 uses, extra blade that makes the razor too big), and based on previous changes I would have ignored this one. However I got the razor and 1 blade free in the mail and gave it a try. I have been using the same blade for 4 weeks now and I love this thing. I feel like that thing performs wonderfully well. The shaves are close and it has minimized the need for shaving in reverse which i need to do. Also i feel that the strips on this last longer because i still get that squeeky clean and smooth feeling each time. Another big plus is how easily the hair is cleaned from this blade. The running water removes all hair thanks to the design that leaves the front and back of the blades fully exposed. I must say that this product exceeded my expectations. However, i have taken off a star due to its expensive blades (almost $3.50 per blade, retail). When i go back to my original shaving system, i will decide if this price is worth paying but somehow i doubt it
