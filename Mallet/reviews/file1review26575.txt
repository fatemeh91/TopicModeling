review/text: I ordered the Back Booster on a recommendation of a friend. I manage a restaurant and am on my feet all day and am spent at the end of a shift. I use the Booster in my car for the rides to/from work and I get out of the car feeling great. I now take the Booster in the house to use as well. As a result, I sleep better and have more stamina to chase my 3 year old around the house. Ive told my coworkers about this item and can't stress how much it's made me feel better. I wish I ordered this a long time ago!
