review/text: I have to say BUY THIS RAZOR. I cut easily, and I've tried them all, you name it, and I've tried it. This is the first razor that 1) doesn't cut me 2)gives me a great, close shave, even after 2 or 3 days growth 3)leaves no bumps or scrapes.I thought this was a marketing ploy, and while it very well may be, the product still produces. In 2 words "IT'S GREAT".I can't say enough about this 5 blader, other than it does make sense that the 5 blades leave less space between the blades to catch your skin in. I've only tried the manual, but since it does the job as I've said, I'm one happy guy who always hated to shave.I know I must sound like a company member but I'm not. I'm just a consumer that gets surprised when something radical comes out on the market, gets alot of ad space and promo time, and is actually as good or better than the ads and promo says it is.So I say again, BUY IT!!.MarkCleveland, Ohio
