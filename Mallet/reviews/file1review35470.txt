review/text: About a month ago (when our dishwasher was about a year and a half old), the dishes on the top rack started coming out dirty. I pulled out the manual for the dishwasher and made sure I did everything right (like running hot water before starting the dishwasher), but the problem kept getting worse. Just before I called my appliance repair guy, I googled "dirty dishes top rack dishwasher" and found a post that mentioned Dishwasher Magic, so I decided to try that. I used one bottle, and the dishes were completely clean again! I paid $3 and change for the Dishwasher Magic (on sale at Target), and probably saved at least $100 by not calling a repair person.
