review/text: The soap formulation itself works well, like several other 3-5% sulfur soaps I tried over the course of several months. It has a 3% sulfur concentration so it's on the milder end. The sulfur smell isn't too bad--you'll smell it, but it isn't as overpowering as some topical sulfur creams. However, the bar itself has a wide and thin shape, which meant that it wore down to a sliver more quickly than the other bars I tried. Consequently, I'd recommend a more compact-shaped 3% sulfur bar or, if your skin can tolerate 5% sulfur, the Derma Klear bar.
