review/text: These are the BEST multi-vitamins that $ can buy! Just quit taking them for a few days to remind yourself how you felt before discovering these amazing vitamins! Lots of people ask "How do you have so much energy!?" or "man, you're like the energizer bunny!" etc. These vitamins with their "whole-food concentrates" are the key to doing more with less and feeling at the top of your game no matter what your schedule is. Since Im 6 foot 5 inches, and about 250, I found that taking 2 in morning and 2 at night right at bedtime works the best for my body size, etc, everyone is different, as self-employed small business owners we're going 12-17 hrs a day and 6-7 days a week, couldn't keep up without the amazing formula in these vitamins! You will be so happy to discover these!
