review/text: I use these tweezers for ingrown hairs all over my body, and they work wonderfully. They're great for probing under the skin for hairs that have turned back into the follicle and started growing under the skin. The only drawback is that the points are VERY sharp, so they can cut the skin pretty deeply, causing scabbing and possibly scars.
