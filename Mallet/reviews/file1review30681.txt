review/text: Like a lot of guys I was using the Mach 3 razor before and then I switched to the vibrating six blade razor (tag line: The World's Most Dangerous Vibrator - For Your Face). And then I took to the Zen simplicity of this safety razor. During my first few strokes I almost reached smooth skinned nirvana but then the cat knocked my badger brush over.
