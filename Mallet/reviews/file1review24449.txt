review/text: My mom was diagnosed with HER2+ lump, mast and lymph removal. Someone told me about these drops and she was allowed to take them throughout her treatment. She always did really well and swore by these drops. Now she is off Herceptin treatment and we are hoping she stays healthy...she is still taking her drops.... thank you..Nature's Answer!
