review/text: I have tried a lot of different brands of fish oil. These are amazing. How can you beat 100% WILD Alaskan Salmon oil?! Other brands usually don't mention if the fish was wild or farm rasied. They also don't mention what kind of fish oil it is or what percent each type of fish oil is. OmegaFactors brand also contains no artifical preservatives, color, or sweetners, no corn, dairy, gluten starth, wheat, or yeast. This brand doesn't give me fishy burps too :) I will only buy these for my Omega 3 needs, I am a loyal customer of Natural Factors now.
