review/text: The best deodorant around. I use white vinegar first to eliminate bacteria (cheap, safe and very effective). Then this product (pleasant with no overpowering perfume scent and also very safe). I order 4 at a time. Try just one. Smells sort of just like Vita Bath but far less expensive. This is my 3rd year of using the product. Highly Recommended.
