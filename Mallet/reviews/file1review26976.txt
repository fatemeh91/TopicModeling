review/text: I'm making my way through the various flavors and have yet to be greatly disappointed with gold standard. Okay, tropical punch was a bad idea and i knew that before I got it, but have tried double chocolate, french vanilla, and vanilla ice cream as well and all have been phenominal with milk, water or in a mixed shake.
