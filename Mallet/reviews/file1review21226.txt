review/text: Length:: 1:45 MinsThis video shows the performance between 3 typical sonic brushes: Sonicare e3000, Oral-B Sonic Complete S-200 and Vitality Sonic. The Vitality barely moves, totally garbage. The other two work closely well, both are very powerful.We bought 3 Sonicare brushes in our family several years ago, per our dentist's suggestion. They cost over $100/ea and they all died in a year or so (actually just the battery, but no way to replace just the battery). Since then, we were scared to waste hundreds of dollars again.Then I found the Sonicare e3000 that uses 2 AA batteries, thought it could solve the battery problem. What a nightmare, water leaked in and broke them one after one.Hopelessly, my attention went to Oral-B. First I bought a Vitality Sonic to give it a try; what a beautiful piece of garbage made in Germany. No vibe at all, as you see in the video. As reviews here say the Sonic Complete is as powerful as Sonicare and replacing the battery is possible, so I decided to give it a try when I saw the S-200 for less than 50 dollars shipped with 30-day return offered.Cannot be happier. The timer does not shut off the brush at 2 minutes like the Sonicare does. The brush bristles are a little harder than Sonicare. Both are very good things to my tea teeth. It is indeed as powerful as Sonicare as you see in the video. Made in Germany, including the charger. No hassle to remove and clean the brush head; had to do those with the Sonicare each and every time, or it would get really disgusting. Both the brush and the head cost significantly less than Sonicare.I have no idea why people are still buying Sonicare while this S-200 is so perfect and cost so little. I also wonder why Oral-B still bother to make garbage like the Vitality Sonic for $20 while this one only cost $20 more than that.
