review/text: I bought 2 of these on a Friday sale for my children (5 and 7) I loved the idea of washable and we are going to be traveling quite a bit soon and wanted to try them. My kids LOVED them and for the first time since she was 3, my daughter fell asleep in the car while using it. It fit them perfectly and the sachet was not overpowering, just enough fragrance that even my older boy liked it. The only concern is that the fabric is kind of fuzzy so for cooler weather it will be great, but a bit warm around the neck during warmer months. I'm so glad I bought them!!
