review/text: Compared to most caffeinated candy which equal a cup of cola for the whole tin, these things just take three little mints. They are great to keep in a pocket or satchel for when you just need a little punch in the face of energy.Of the three these are my favourite because while they are not overly chocolatey, the chocolate knocks the mint down enough so you aren't walking around exhaling ice crystals for the duration of your mint consumption experience. I don't really care for overly minty mints.
