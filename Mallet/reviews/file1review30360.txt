review/text: SLOW DELIVERY: This item arrived over a month and a half after I purchased it. It was way past due delivery date.Moreover, it is NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. I ONLY GOT 22 OUT OF THE 24 PACK OF CONDOMS PROMISED, AND SOME OF THEM WERE NOT LARGE-SIZED!All I got was this:2 Trojan Magnums4 Lifestyle King XL4 Kimono MicroThin AquaLube (which is NOT a large-sized condom!)4 Lifestyle Pleasure Tipped (also NOT a large-sized condom!)4 Durex XXL2 Durex Love (I do not think this is a large-sized condom, either)---22 condoms, not 24! And yes, I can count.The last reviewer also said the item was not as described, AND he/she got different condoms than I did. It seems like they just threw some in, stuff it in a bubble wrap envelope and ship them away, not caring about the customer's expectations at all.The company is Green Web Properties, but they are actually CondomMan.com.CondomMan.com sucks.
