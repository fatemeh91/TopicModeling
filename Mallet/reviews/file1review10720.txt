review/text: I have to take almost a dozen different things 3 or 4 times a day and needed something that would help keep everything organized and after much deliberation I settled on this item... and I'm SO glad I did! This thing is perfect! The compartments open easily (although they might be more difficult for the elderly) and the size accommodates everything I need. This organizer has been instrumental in helping me remember to take everything at the right times throughout the day.
