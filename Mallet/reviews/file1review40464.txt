review/text: I feel bad posting a less-than-glowing review for this, since so many people love it, but it just did NOT live up to my expectations. First, this balm is waxy and heavy. Not quite as bad as old-school chapstick, but pretty close. It made my lips feel gummy and almost (but not quite) sticky. I also find the ingredients list questionable, because the vanilla scent ("vanilla extract" on the label) is very strong and extremely artificial; additionally, I felt a mild stinging with repeat applications. I do have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, but I've never reacted to vanilla fragrances or true vanilla (by which I mean diluted vanilla essential oil). This was a dud for me.
