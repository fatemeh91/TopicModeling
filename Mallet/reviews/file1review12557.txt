review/text: This product really worked! After reading a few reviews about users experiencing stomach cramps, I was a little apprehensive about using Oxy-Powder. I did research and learned that in order to get the full benefits of Oxy-Powder many people did a three day Juice Feast.I tried the three Juice Feast then incorporated Oxy-Powder into my diet. I also continued to eat three servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and two fruit snacks. One the first day I had five major bowel movements. I do not want to get too graphic, but lets just say it poured out! I didn't experience any stomach cramping.In the past I have tried Juice Feasting, but felt constipated after a few days. I had great results using Oxy-Powder. Oxy-Powder does exactly what it claims to do!Today is my fifth day using the product and I'm still having 5-6 movements each day. I already feel like I have more energy and my stomach is flatter.
