review/text: When it came to shaving I always used to avoid products that came with bells and whistles; thinking that these are just another marketing/sales gimmick... You think for shaving "all you need is a blade and a shaving cream", Right?... Wrong! ... I'm glad my wife convinced me to use these Gillette Fusion blades. They are just amazing! No cuts, smooth shaving and they actually last longer than the normal 2 blade cartridges. I have been using them now for almost a year and I'm really happy with the product.
