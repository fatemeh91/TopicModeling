review/text: While this supplement was not necessarily ineffective or bad-tasting, a bit of research led me to some unsettling findings. First was that this protein supplement contains trace amounts of cadmium, arsenic, and lead. Although below the legal limits, there are plenty of supplements that contain NO heavy metals.For reference:[...]As if that weren't enough, there have also been documented side effects to whey supplementation. I personally experienced bloating and cramps on several occasions after drinking whey. Whey is also not advised for those with liver problems.(On a personal note, I was often constipated during my forays into whey.)Personally, I prefer to play it safe with organic supplements. Hemp, brown-rice, cranberry-seed, goat-milk, brazil-nut, buckwheat, and pea proteins are all viable alternatives to the traditional whey/casein combo. Each of the protein's merits and shortcomings can be found here:[...]For those who are interested, Nutiva's has two types of hemp powder available, currently around $20-25 for a three-pound bag. Although it doesn't taste nearly as good as "double chocolate," Nutiva hemp protein powder is easily metabolized, nearly complete in all essential amino acids, high in fiber, and rich in omega-3s fatty acids, which stimulate healthy brain function; a lot more than proponents of whey protein can claim.Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein 50% Protein Per Serving, 3-Pound Bag(On another personal note, the fiber in hemp truly does its job! And no, you cannot get high or fail a drug test from ingesting hemp; it's 100% legal as a supplement!)To be fair, whey protein gets the job done. I did notice an increase in bulk muscle after supplementing my workouts with it, but the fact of the matter is that this product deserves the 3 stars I gave. Put simply, there are cleaner, safer, and more natural products out there. Look into organic supplements; your body will thank you!
