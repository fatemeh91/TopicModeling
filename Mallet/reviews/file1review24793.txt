review/text: When my husband was diagnosed with arthritis, the docs all recommended the glucosamine supplements, etc., which eventually, made him ill. They made him feel loopy upstairs so finally, he stopped taking all that "stuff" and just went to aleve. Well, he's feeling better than he has in 5 years and the pain is kept at a standstill. Can't recommend this stuff enough - you even get to take it less often. Highly, highly recommend!
