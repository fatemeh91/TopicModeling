review/text: This thing is great! I have a spot alongside my shoulder-blade that likes to bug me every so often (too much time at the computer, I suppose). I grab my "buddy", give the spot some attention while I sit at my desk and viola! Relief!This might not "cure" a problem (for that, I'd need some structural bodywork, realignment and improved posture and probably a vacation to somewhere tropical), but it gets me through the day and keeps me from "calling out" every so often, when I have more problematic pain. In that, it's a money-saver, in itself!I wish it was a bit smaller (I know they do make a smaller version, but I thought this would be better. Turns out, it's a bit unweildly at times)I wish there was one knob that was a bit bigger. I'm considering attaching a tennis ball to one end, for a more "widespread" touch.In addition to the knobs and balls, I have also used the flat part to massage larger, flatter areas (directionally towards the heart, of course).I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. :)
