review/text: For whatever reason, it's become difficult for me to swallow calcium in pill form in recent years, so I began searching for a good liquid product. I tried one that formed a brick in the bottom of the container, and another one or two that weren't satisfactory for this reason or that. For a while, I was using another Nature's Life Superabsorbeze Calcium Magnesium that I really liked, but then I noticed they had loaded it full of vitamin D, so I gave the cranberry one a try, which (so far) doesn't have so much vitamin D added. At first, my reaction was the same as that of the person who hated the taste: yuck! It has a weird sort of chocolate-berry-mint sort of thing going on. But it seemed wasteful to toss it out, so I resolved to finish the bottle, and by then, I was finding the flavor tolerable, and now I actually quite like it! It never, ever clumps up, either, so this is my favorite such product.
