review/text: I have been using ON Whey for about 2 years now- and my opinion on this is remains the same throughout that time: its a great product at a good price.I will rate this on what I think sums up a good protein powder (on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 the lowest):Mixability - 4.5 - this product requires a decent amount of mixing, or it will get clumpy in your glass. Same with a shaker bottle.. but all in all it mixes in fine with about 20 seconds of stirring/ shaking.Taste - 3.5 - definitely NOT my favorite part of this product, but I should mention that I have only tried 2 other protein powders, and one tasted worse. The chocolate is ok - it tastes like a chocolate milkshake with cardboard in it. Stay away from the vanilla.Price - 5 - in conjunction subscribe & save Amazon offers a pretty good deal. I should rate this as a price to performance ratio- so the score will remain the same.Effectiveness - this product has worked VERY well for me. I have put on over 40 pounds since using it and I believe it works very well as a supplement to a good diet.All in all I would give this product a 4.5, but since I cant select that on the star rating I gave it a 5- as the taste is subjective.
