review/text: I have to say this one has little treatment for my Tinea Versicolor on stomach. I have used two bottles for 6 months, but it just very slightly goes better. I also used other tree oils, but still no effect. maybe it's because mine is a little bit severe since it's already there for like 4 yeas before I decided to treat it. But it's no excuse. it's should be used to treat this kind of gray skin. I'm disappointed.
