review/text: This brace provides fairly light support and compression. It provides more lateral support than just a knee "sleeve" -- but not substantially more. I would definitely not recommend it for anyone with significant knee weakness. By itself this would merit a 3 or 4 star rating. Unfortunately, on my third use of the brace the top portion tore. I cannot tell if this is due to the relatively light material out of which it is constructed, a design flaw, or a flaw in the manufacturing process (or some combination of the three). Given that the brace is tight (it must be to serve its function), it should be built substantially enough to hold up to more than three pulls (which are required to put it on). Not a horrible item, but there must be something better on the market.
