review/text: Well, I was dumb enough to try this epilator again. Lo and behold, after a few months, the crazy thing stopped working ... already. My friend purchased a Emjoi facial product six months ago which sounds like it is on its last leg as well. We definitely won't make the Emjoi mistake again, and we won't be lured into Emjoi again with discount coupon deals. There is a reason that manufacturers offer seemingly nice discount coupons, and the Emjoi reason is that their products just don't last. As other people have posted, Emjoi products die early deaths. It certainly is disappointing to waste so much money.
