review/text: Received condoms but not in a box as I expected. Condoms were received in mailer only with instructions on a card. The packing was ok but I'm kind of wondering why the labels say "Made in Thailand". It may sound a bit silly but I'm not sure they are supposed to say that on the back. I've never bought condoms before so this will be a first in everything. I bought these online to avoid that awkward moment in the store and due to price. I did receive all 36 and the packaging wasn't leaking or anything.
