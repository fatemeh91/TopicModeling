review/text: I love this toothbrush! I have had problems with my gums for many years and, at a friend's urging, recently switched from a Sonicare to the Oral B 9400. My gums have never felt better. I haven't been to the dentist for a cleaning yet, but I am confident that my results will be obvious and measurable. [I also added a water-pik (Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet) to my dental regimen at the same time, but there's no doubt in my mind that the toothbrush is the major contributor to my success.] Get yourself one of these, your mouth will thank you!
