review/text: Happy to find them at a reasonable cost & unbeatable with Prime shipping! Gluten-free and they don't make me nauseous like some other multivitamins.So far I have not experienced the gas issues that some other reviewers report, but I have only been taking them for a month so maybe it takes a while. For now - this is my vitamin of choice!
