review/text: Reviewing something as mundane as a cleaning rag may sound strange, but if cleanliness is important to you, then it makes sense. I love these not only because they clean well, but because they dry quickly. I think this is much more sanitary, because a damp cloth breeds bacteria. With a toddler in the house, it's important to me that I can dry and put away my cleaning rags quickly.
