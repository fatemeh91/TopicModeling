review/text: The product itself is good and contains everything you'd expect from a cheap eyeglass repair kit; however, it's just too expensive when shippping and handling is added. You're better off getting the same thing at a local drug or convenience store for a much lower price, no more than 3 dollars. I happen to be on a military base overseas that didn't have these in stock for a while.
