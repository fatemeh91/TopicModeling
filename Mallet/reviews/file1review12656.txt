review/text: This thing stunk to high hell. And I tried everything to un-stink it. Baking soda, vinegar, time in the sun, time in the cold. It's just a very chemical smell that doesn't go away. So I threw it away. I'm sorry, but this reflects on Doc Johnson Company. Hence, they are off my list for any future purchases for even letting something like this hit the retail market at all.
