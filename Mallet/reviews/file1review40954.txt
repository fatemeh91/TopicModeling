review/text: The main reason I bought the patch was for appetite suppression. The first day, I didn't feel any different, so I put 2 patches on. I still didn't feel any different, for the exception of an itch on my back for a week after peeling the patch off. The patch will work if you stick it over your mouth. If you want to loose weight, eat less and exercise more. I can't believe I fell for this product.
