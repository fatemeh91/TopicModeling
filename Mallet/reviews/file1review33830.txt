review/text: I have never been so disappointed in an online experience in my life. The supplier, Medex Supply basically are crooks. They sold me a stethoscope that was supposedly brand new. When it came it was in an unsealed box and did not work.There was no auscultation or sound emitted from the bell of the stethoscope whatsoever. When I contacted them, they told me to contact the manufacturer. Medex took my money, and then refused to refund me. I had the stethoscope 1 hour found out the problem and immediately e-mailed them. They took 2 days to respond to say they would contact me in the future, then they contacted me two days later to say contact the manufacturer which was ADC.This was a total waste of my time, and robbery of my money.
