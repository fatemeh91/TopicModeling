review/text: I have owned these Wahl hair cutters since April 2004. They were $22 back then. They're still a great buy.I have saved so much money on hair cuts in the past 1-1/2 years that I could throw these away and still be ahead. (no pun intened) I won't throw them away of course.Not much to add to the other fine reviews. The Wahl works great; they're as quiet as the barber's trimmers. Cuts as smoothly....They are made in USA; clearly marked as such. Strange, one comb is made in USA the other in China. The oil container in my kit was made in China... But the hardware is made in USA and great quality. My cutters are as sharp now as they were 1-1/2 years ago. I oil them with each use. The attatchements are plastic clip-ons but work as intended. I have not broken one yet with my big paws; I was sure I would have by now. Ha ha....You can't go wrong with these hair trimmer/cutters. You don't really need all those plastic attatchments but the ones to cut around the ears make it easier to trim that area.So, buy a set and start saving money!
