review/text: I had my doubts when I ordered it, but I was tired of drawing blood trying to trim myself with a barber scissors, so I decided to give it a try!To my surprise, this trimmer worked perfectly. It works equally well on nose and ear hair, and is also ideal for trimming the occasional whisker on the chin or lip that gets missed during shaving. I've used it for 2 months and am still using the original set of batteries.So if you're tired of hacking yourself up with a scissors, give this a try... you won't be disappointed!
