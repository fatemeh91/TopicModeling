review/text: These flake bars have clearly traveled the world and are a little worse for wear. They're more than a little beat up and broken and the chocolate has a whitish tint that indicates that it's been through multiple transitions in temperature. Most of the writing on the bars seems to be in Arabic but I'm not 100% certain what language it is.With the foggy country-of-origin and Cadbury's recent recall of melamine tainted chocolate from world markets, I'm afraid that the rest of these flakes are destined for the dustbin.
