review/text: Hi---This is the product to buy !!!My husband and I are both in our 60's and periodically check our blood pressure.The biggest problem with our former Omron Monitor was that the bulb had to bemanually pumped and was frustrating to work with because of the continual Error messages.This IS an extremely easy monitor to use as it is automatic---reading in a few minutes and off you go !!!
