review/text: I've been using ON whey for years now. It mixes extremely well in a shaker bottle or with a spoon and it tastes good (not great, but good). It provides an excellent amount of portein per scoop and is very cheap on Amazon. The only downside is that it can taste a bit thin or watery, but that's still better than the chunky taste most proteins have.
