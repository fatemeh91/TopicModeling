review/text: I was skeptical at first but after a few tries I caught on and was able to use it satisfactorily with a wet brush. I thought that it might be real handy for air travelers who face unreasonable limitations on what they can bring. I still think I would prefer my conventional Kiss My Face cream or a good mug soap because it provides ready lather for the second or third passes where with this stick you would have to rub the stick again and again. All in all you do get a close comfortable shave.
