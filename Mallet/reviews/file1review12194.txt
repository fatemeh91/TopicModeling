review/text: I started using the vitamins years ago for hair growth. I always buy them in stores, and finally got the bright idea to check on Amazon. So much cheaper and same great vitamin. Oh, also I started using the regular Women's vitamin from this brand because of the ginger. All other vitamins made me throw up literally every time I tried to take them. These are wonderful.
