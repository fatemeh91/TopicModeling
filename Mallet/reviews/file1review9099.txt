review/text: This stuff is fantastic. I eat a lot of greens in my daily diet, but it can be hard to stuff pounds of greens in during a busy schedule. This give me the added benefit of what is good for me in a fast and easy drink. I mix it with orange juice or apple juice and I actually think it taste great now. I crave it when I haven't had my daily dose.
