review/text: I have had a pink version of this for a little over a year, a record for me, as I tend to burn through the little guys. I do not find the girth to be much more than the average, but way more than the traditional slim, discrete, "muscle massage" vibes.I find that it has good intensity at all three levels of the rabbit, but as someone mentioned the proportion can seem a little off as to the placement of the rabbit ears, but I have found them to be flexible and with a little practice have learned to get it just right for me.I do not usually use the rotation feature but have no complaints from the times I have.Now my pink one has gone to it's grave, the motor died, I am looking forward to the replacement getting here!!
