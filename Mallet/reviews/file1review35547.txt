review/text: I have tried both the vanilla and the cookies and cream flavors and love them. I am a fan of peanut butter and chocolate mixes so I expected this to be great. It wasn't. The smell of the powder alone made me cringe. The other two powders smelled wonderful to me and tasted the same so I suspected it would be bad. I mixed half a scoop with half a cup of skim milk and tried it. Gross. It doesn't taste like chocolate or pb. All I can taste is the spirulina and vitamins. This flavor is a miss. I will continue to mix my chocolate whey protein powder with pb2 powdered peanut butter to fill my chocolate and peanut butter cravings.
