review/text: I usually really hate protein shakes, so my goal in trying a bunch of samples was to find one I could drink without visibly grimacing. I haven't tried most of their lineup yet, but I just tried the Chocolate Mint, and it's magic. Not only did I not hate it, I really like it! I'm annoyed there was only one in the sample pack! So if you're like me and you're tired of seeing "tastes just like chocolate milk" reviews only to end up with something that tastes like gritty chalk, try this. It really does live up to all the claims the cheap stuff makes.
