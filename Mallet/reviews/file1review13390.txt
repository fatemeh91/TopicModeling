review/text: This product is awesome. I have a son with special needs who is incontinent and moves all over his bed. I used to use 3 disposable chux and 2 bed pads, but now this is all I need. It hasn't leaked through yet and hasn't shifted much. It covers more area than the 2 pads I used together before. Would highly recommend it!
