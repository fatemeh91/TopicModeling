review/text: I researched breathalyzers thoroughly and decided on this AlcoMate Prestige based on the fact that it's self-calibrating and quite accurate. However, the product is not exactly as pictured by Amazon. The picture of the product as sold by Amazon shows a silver breathalyzer, a few mouthpieces, a small pouch, and a larger carrying case. The product as delivered did NOT include the larger carrying case. Note that the same product without the larger carrying case (i.e. as I received it) is available from other sellers on Amazon for $20 less than the Amazon prices.
