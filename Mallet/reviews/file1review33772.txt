review/text: I wasn't sure about this product based off some of the reviews. I've always suffered from ugly razor burn & irritation from shaving my bikini line. This product works sooooo great!! No problems at all & smooth as can be!!!! I don't use a cotton swab because I feel like half would be tossed away-I use a dab on my finger tips & rub it in. It does have a small stinging sensation, but it doesn't last but a few seconds. I will be buying this product again in the future. Finally something that works!!!
