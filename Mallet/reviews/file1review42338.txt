review/text: My son had a horrible diaper rash and this product was suggested by my sister, who works in the hospital. The hospital uses this non rinse soap for peri care (washing bottoms of incontinent adults). She suggested I use it for my son instead of baby wipes since he would scream when I did. It worked PERFECT. No more screaming at the diaper changes. We use it all the time now.
