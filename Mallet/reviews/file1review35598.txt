review/text: We ordered this for after my husband's spine surgery. He was very unsteady on his feet, and couldn't get up and down from a chair without help, so this was a very necessary purchase.The toilet seat was simple to put together. I did slip off one of the blue pads from each arm (there are 2 on each side) so the feet would reach the floor more easily. I'm keeping the extra pads for future use, if needed. Our toilets are round bowl 15" high, so with this product on top, our toilet seat is now 19", which is much easier to get on and off of, especially if you're tall like we are.The toilet seat is easy to clean (just wipe it down), and disconnect and transport (I move it from the bedroom bath to the central bathroom twice daily). The locking bracket in the back keeps it secure when sitting or getting on or off, but slips easily out when you need to move the seat off the toilet.Compared to the elevated toilet seat my elderly mother uses, which does not have legs that reach the floor, this is far better for stability. There is no worry of tipping off to one side, and you can use just one hand to get on and off instead of two -- that's how stable it is!Although purchased for my husband, I have tried it a few times and found it to be very comfortable. My husband agrees:he said, "Even when I'm recovered, let's keep using it."I highly recommend this raised toilet seat. I think it is the best on the market, and it sure is a lot less expensive than buying and installing a new higher toilet.
