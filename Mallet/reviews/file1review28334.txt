review/text: Great taste!! I use this stuff mainly as a post-workout supplement, and sometimes in a morning protein shake. If I'm watching calories, I mix it with good ole H2O, and it still has a good taste. If I'm not watching calories, I mix it with nonfat milk, peanut butter, and bananas, and it's absolutely incredible! Try it!
