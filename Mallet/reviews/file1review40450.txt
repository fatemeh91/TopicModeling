review/text: This is simply the best lip balm available. I've tried many different kinds, Bert's Bee's, Blistex Herbal, even the often-touted Dr. Hauschka's Lip Care Stick. None of them come close to being as good as this lip balm. Say goodbye to chapped lips and having to reapply constantly. Karite Lips will leave your lips, soft, supple, and the moisturizing properties last and last. It also has a pleasant vanilla smell, and the stick is large enough that it will last you a long time. Hard to find, but seek it out. This lip balm is #1.
