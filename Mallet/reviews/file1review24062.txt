review/text: I like that these do not need to be refrigerated. Most others seem to need refrigeration and as others have mentioned they are not shipped or stored refrigerated.I had no problem with these and they seem like a good product however going forward I plan to try these instead:[...]As they are reported to deliver a greater quantity of living flora to the gut.
