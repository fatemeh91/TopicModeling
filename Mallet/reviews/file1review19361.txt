review/text: This is a wonderful unscented product for those who have allergies to scented ones. What I like best about this product is that I'm into BPAL perfumes and I'm able to make my own scented products by adding a few drops of BPAL oils to the mix. I'm sure this would work for any oil blend, too.What is most remarkable about this product, to me is how unscented it is. It actually does not have a smell. It also makes for a wonderful massage. : )
