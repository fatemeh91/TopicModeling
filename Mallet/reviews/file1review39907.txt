review/text: I wanted a proxabrush holder that was strong and would last a long time, like my last one did. It was still working great after years of use -- I just wanted a newer one. The Butler Gum Proxabrush Handle is really flimsy and has a poor design. It doesn't even close tightly to hold the proxabrush in place, so I have to hold the closure while I'm using it. It's so flimsy, I think it will be bent out of shape before long. I did wonder why they sent six, since all you need is one good handle -- now I know. It is hard to find a good handle but it's worth looking around more. I don't recommend this one.
