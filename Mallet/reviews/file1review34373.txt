review/text: For nearly 15 years I've been a loyal consumer of glucosamine, with what I believe to be great results for my poor knees. A few years ago my cousin, who is a pharmacist told me that while the jury is still out on the effectiveness of glucosamine yet MSM is a sure thing and suggested that I take the glucosamine-msm mix and forgo the condroitin. She even said I could achieve the same results on MSM alone for comfort for arthritis & joint health.For the last year and a half I have experimented by taking only MSM and yes my joint relief continues and my odd arthritic "weather predicting" ticks have subsided.Jarrow is not only a reasonably priced product but its effectiveness can be attested too.
