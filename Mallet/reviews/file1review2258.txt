review/text: I've tried all manner of shaving systems in the 40 or so years I've been shaving and I've never come across anything that can better or even match the Gillette Mach3 system. I have a very tough barbed-wire beard, but the shaves I get are consistently smotth and close. Recommended without reservation!
