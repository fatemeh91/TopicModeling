review/text: I have been using More Milk Plus for three months now and started using it when my son was a couple of weeks old. My first son fussed while nursing causing me to be frustrated with it and pumping upon returning to work was stressful. I nursed him until he was a year and couldn't wait to be done with it. My three month old doesn't have a problem at all nursing, every three hours my breasts are full and ready to nurse, I pump every morning to store additional milk (I'm now up to 200 oz. in the freezer) and I take More Milk Plus three times a day. I will not stop taking the supplement for fear of my supply decreasing. Anyone out there looking for something to help, this is your answer. The taste is pretty bad but mixed with 1-2 oz of OJ make it bearable. An 8 oz supply lasts me about a month and a half.
