review/text: I bought this because of the reviews here and on Bodybuilder.com. I am familiar with protein shakes and I know they are not created equal. I typically get vanilla so I can mix it with other things. I could not stomach the flavor of this. I tried it three different times. The first time in a fruit smoothie. Using same ingredients I typically use for a smoothie, it tasted weird. I couldn't finish the smoothie. Thinking maybe some of the fruit was bad, I tried it again with 8 ounces of almond milk. It mixed fine in a shaker cup but tasted watered down and just ... weird. I can't explain it other than just saying the taste was unpleasant.I tried it one last time with just 5 ounces of almond milk. Still gross. My son said it tasted like rancid pudding. I wound up giving the whole tub to my boyfriend.
