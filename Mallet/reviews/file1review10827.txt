review/text: This is a great scale and an excellent value ! After calling Taylor directly with product questions - I was extremely impressed by the knowledge of the person I spoke to about this product and how it measures Body Fat %. Be sure you are fully hydrated when you take a Body Fat Reading to get your most accurate Body Fat measurement. How do you know when you are properly hydrated? The scale will tell you with the Body Water %. The best time to take the Body Fat reading is later in the day - before your last meal.The weight measurements have been consistent. I think this product is just plain excellent!
