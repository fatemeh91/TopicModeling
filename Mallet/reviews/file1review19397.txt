review/text: When I received this multi I was shocked to read the label and find that the percentages of vitamins listed on the bottle were FOR 6 TABLETS DAILY!!!I do not intend to take 6 tablets of a multi every day. And on top of it, the amount of vitamins and minerals in 6 tablets is just average, meaning that if I take only one I am hardly getting any vitamins at all!This product is a rip-off and very misleading.Shame on Rainbow Light!
