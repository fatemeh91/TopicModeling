review/text: This was my first electric razor though I have tried many others in the past. I have a thick beard and am usually clean shaven. This model caught my eye because of the wide and small angle pop up trimmers as well as the trimmer attachment. Overall, it is very good. A shave as close as a mach3 is achieved on the face, though the neck and jawline are not as good, but adequate. The razor is best if you shave everyday or relatively often, otherwise you might want to look at a rotary. However, the brauns and other foil razors are usually best in terms of closeness. The trimmers work well to an extent, if you are doing heavy trimming, get a dedicated trimmer. The wide and narrow pop ups are great.The razor is sturdy and looks a little flashy but is washable which makes cleanup easy. I just rinse it off with hot water or use compressed air to blow off the hair. Once a week, I will soak the cutting head in alcohol and oil the trimmers and foil. Unfortunately it is made in China not Germany. It holds a charge for over a week, more like 2. Also the quick charge option lets you charge it for a single shave quite quickly, though if it does run out it will suddenly stop grabbing the hairs on your face.Cliffs: Great all around razor, trimming pop ups and attachments are great, worth the price despite a few flaws.
