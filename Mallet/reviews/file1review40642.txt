review/text: i've been buying and using Parsley Plus for a couple of years, and have slowly substituted it for all the other surface cleaners i had.Parsley Plus cleans stainless, marble, tile, wood, glass, mirrors and porcelain without streaks leaving a fresh clean scent.my local store changed ownership and quit carrying Parsley Plus, so i started buying it online and i trust it so much that i buy it by the case.
