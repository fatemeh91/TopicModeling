review/text: I have been a person who likes to have clean glasses. After being told that cleaning glasses on a shirt or other fabric can cause scratches, I wanted to make sure I always used high quality products on my glasses.The Microfiber Cloth by Apex Healthcare has not disappointed. My glasses are always clean, and I don't have to worry that I'm causing lasting damage to my glasses.
