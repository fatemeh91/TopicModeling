review/text: This was my first vibe, and still my favorite. Tiny, not too loud, and portable, but it definitely gets the job done. I've tried to replace it with more expensive toys and keep coming back. I hate having to replace batteries, but that's the only downside to this one. I recommend this for beginners or someone looking for a discreet vibrator, and it is definitely worth the price (over and over!).
