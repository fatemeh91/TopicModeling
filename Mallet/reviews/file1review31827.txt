review/text: I received the shipment quickly; however, I was a little disappointed when I opened the box as it was only a 5 ounce package. I bought another color of sprinkles from a different company, paid the same price and got 16 ounces. The seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price. I took the risk because I needed the sprinkles and couldn't find them. I will know next time to ask the question before purchasing.
