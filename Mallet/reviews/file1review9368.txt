review/text: Love the colors, but I still lose the pods. My cat loves to take them off of their holder and bat them around...not good! Cats don't need estrogen. I live on a boat and they roll around everywhere. I secured them with a rubber band, and they don't hold, unless all of the pods are in the rack. Most of them are in my purse or at work. I feel like I look like a laugh reel in a frat movie! Still love the colors though.
