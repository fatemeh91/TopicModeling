review/text: Guaifenesin is a terrific expectorant, especially if you have trouble with mucus lodging in your throat and it makes you cough forever without effect. Opera singers love this stuff. It sure helps me. Start with 600mg orally, twice per day. It is a white powder, and has the look and feel of icing sugar. It has a very bitter after-taste and should be taken with lots of water. 500 grams of this stuff should last me a year. Great value. Scales are a must, for accuracy in dose.I ordered it on a Sunday. and it arrived at my door Tuesday morning. That was fast.
