review/text: Three years ago I had Lasik. I also had one of the "possible side effects" that you are warned about but never think will happen--extremely dry eyes (this occurs because the Lasik procedure slices the nerve in the cornea that controls tearing. If it doesn't grow back completely, the result is extremely dry eyes. They don't tell you that part). I was in agony for months. I couldn't open my eyes in the morning without severe pain and went through gallons of eye drops. The clinic suggested I try TheraTears. This product has been a godsend. I take six a day and it has cured 90% of the problem. If I stop taking them, the pain comes back after about four days. AND--all that fish and flaxseed oil has been great for my cholesterol!
