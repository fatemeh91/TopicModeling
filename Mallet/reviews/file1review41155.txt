review/text: I am semi disabled due to severe joint wear and Arthritis, basic movements like walking, bending, reaching etc. are very painful for me. Of course the Bio-Freeze can not cure my problems but it does help give me some relief of the sore muscles that are the result of having to strain them to compensate for the joint problems. My whole family suffers with this problem to some degree so we save a few bucks by buying the 1 gallon size jug of Bio-freeze and refill our smaller personal bottles.
