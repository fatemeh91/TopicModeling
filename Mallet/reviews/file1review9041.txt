review/text: I'm 34 and have had acne for 20 years. I've been taking Green Vibrance for a couple of months. I stopped drinking coffee two weeks ago and continued with Green Vibrance daily. I'm happy to report that the acne has cleared up remarkably well. My energy levels are top notch even without the coffee.
