review/text: I take one pill a day to boost my immune system and to ward off colds and the flu. This product works wonders. I am a member of the clergy and come in contact with a large number of people, especially on the weekends. There is no way I can always remember, or have the time to wash my hands, after greeting people as they leave church. In the past this has resulted in three or four colds each winter. Since taking Wellness Formula I haven't had a cold. What a blessing this is, especially around Christmas time when I can least afford to be sick. Yes the pills have a terrible smell and they could almost choke a horse when you try to swallow them, but the trade-off, good health, is worth any inconvenience.
