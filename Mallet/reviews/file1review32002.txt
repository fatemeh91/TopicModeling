review/text: First off, this stuff is full of good energy. I drink it in the morning and I know it satisfies my body's hunger for nutrition because I don't seem to eat as much as before I started drinking it. I first bought this at a local health food store and then looked on Amazon to get ideas from the reviews on what to drink it with so that it tasted good. A nice side discovery I made was the price is very good on Amazon. I experimented with different juices and what I found to work the best for me was simply to mix it with any sweet juice and warm it up in the microwave (even orange juice ... looks and sounds gross, but actually tastes pretty good). Before I discovered this, I had to down it pretty quick (even when I mixed with any juice) but now it tastes pretty good ... give it a try.
