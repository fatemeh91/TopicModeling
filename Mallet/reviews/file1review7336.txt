review/text: I have been having fairly bad foot pain for several years.. been to doctors and such.... and was in the market for a heated foot spa.The reason I thought this might help, I have a membership to a gym and the heated hot tubs always felt great. So, I decided to look here on amazon for a product.It was hard to make up my mind. There are plenty of offers.. but I was looking for a heated foot spa. I had read a review on this one that stated this foot spa gets 'very hot'.This is true.This foot spa gets very hot!!Pro's: The foot spa gets HOT!!! In fact, it gets so hot my feet appear to be lobster red when I pull them out of the spa. If that is a pleasurable experience for you, then this spa is the one you want. I love the hot, hot water... it makes my feet feel great. However, it isn't for everyone I suspect. My wife does not like it this hot.The Remote is great. It is not necessary. But, it is nice. And it works very well.One point should be made about the size. My feet are a size 9, and fit very well. I would this size 12 feet would be the max, but that is a guess. Lots of room.Cons: It was noted that the water takes a long time to heat up. This is true. Takes about 20 minutes. However, you can shave that time in half by putting hot water INTO the device and not putting cold water into it. So, to me, this is not a real CON in that sense. 10 minutes is not long to wait to get hot, hot water.I don't have a lot of pro's and con's because there isn't much going on here.. .the water gets hot, there are responsive controls (heat on or off, air inserted in the spray or not) so.. really there should not be too much more to say. I would buy it again. And it if it dies in a year or so, I will get another one.NOTE: Even though it has a splash guard, I put a large down under my spa. I have hard wood floors and the towel gets a bit moist by the time I am done.Have fun.***************UPDATE******************after two months of use, it died. Beware.
