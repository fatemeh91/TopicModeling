review/text: I hadn't used a roll-on deodorant for years because they always seemed to leave a ""wet"" feeling after applying. Dry Idea didn't leave that same impression. It applies nicely, drying almost instantly. It worked well all day, even while I was working in the garden! The only negative, I feel, is the scent, which isn't that appealing to me. I definitely would encourage others to try Dry Idea, especially if they haven't tried a roll-on recently!
