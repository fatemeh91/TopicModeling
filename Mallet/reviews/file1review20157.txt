review/text: DIM was suggested by my doctor when my estradiol levels came back high. Basically my estrogen levels were to high and DIM helps both women and men regulate this.I originally purchased this at a local store. Needless to say, after purchasing that bottle I came to Amazon to see if I could find it cheaper where I found it for half the price with free shipping. The DIM was shipped and received in good condition and just as good as the bottle purchased in the store.I will and have ordered several more bottles of this product. To get the full effect you have to take 300mg to 400mg a day making this only a 30 day supply. But well worth it in my opinion.
