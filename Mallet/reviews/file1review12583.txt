review/text: This product is highly effective and there are NO negative side effects! :) I've never been regular and when I started having hard stools and blood when I wiped, I got scared. I knew I didn't want to deal with this forever so I bought Oxy Powder and decided to change my eating habits. Oxy Powder worked on the 2nd night. The first night I took the recommended 4 pills but nothing happened the next day. They recommend you eat clean foods so I ate salad and fruits most of the day and that night I upped the dosage by 2 more pills as recommended.....and I was up at 2 in the morning "getting it all out!". Needless to say, I panicked a little and the next morning I called the 800 # and they told me to go back to 4 each night so I could wait till the waking hours in the morning to go. Then the rest of the week went as prescribed. After my week, I was feeling less sluggish, and less stomach cramps and gas (I was always gassy and bloated). I stopped eating certain foods together and I increased my soluble fiber. This was back in April of last year and I'm still completely regular with nice, comfortable to pass BMs!!!! I almost can't believe it. It's the best feeling. I still have most of the bottle left because I haven't had to use it again. I recently recommended it to a friend of mine who had a colonic but is still not regular.
