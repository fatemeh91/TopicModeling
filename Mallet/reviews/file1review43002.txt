review/text: I bought Mrs. Meyers shower cleaner under the impression that it is a regular cleaner. However, when I read the directions I realised that it really not for cleaning but maintaining a clean shower. If you clean you clean your shower with some other product and spray this on everyday it helps keep it cleaner. To me it is an unnecessary expense. I won't buy it again.
