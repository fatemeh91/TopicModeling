review/text: Just having some swab etc. wet will oil would do the same job. But this thing gives the oil evaporation an oomph because of the heat. I just have to remember to pull it out a bit when exiting the car, as the lighter outlet doesn't power down with ignition. no big deal though, since I have a nice smelling interior ready for the next ride.I have had no problem adding my own oils to the existing tablet, once it goes dry...
