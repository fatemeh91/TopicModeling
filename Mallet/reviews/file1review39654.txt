review/text: I hate flossing... am in my 40's and have never gotten used to it. I have a small mouth & several crowns, the floss shreds...all that. But I want to keep my teeth, and refuse to put up with any more periodontal work. This is the best tool I've ever used to get to the back teeth for flossing, allows me to use my favorite floss, is stiff enough & long enough. It's nice not to struggle anymore with putting my fingers in my mouth. If you're on the fence, give it a try.
