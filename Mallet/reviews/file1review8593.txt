review/text: Used this brush with a steam cleaner on grout lines. Those suckers are almost impossible to clean, and I didn't want to use harsh chemicals. The combination of a steam cleaner and this brush made short work of the dirty grout. The handle is good, and the brush is stiff enough to loosen the dirt and grime.
