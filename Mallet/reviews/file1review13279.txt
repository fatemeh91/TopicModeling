review/text: I bought 4 of these pads for an incontinent dog. I am so glad I looked at the reviews and decided to buy. These are GREAT! Yesterday one of my dogs came in the house after swimming in the pool. He made a beeline for my leather couch. I just happened to have one of these pads nearby and I grabbed it and put it on the couch just in time. My dog was dripping wet and he leaped on to the couch with the pad. I took him outside and checked my couch. BONE DRY! I am so impressed. They wash and dry easily. No mess. These pads make life easier. Thank you for your excellent product. I just bought 4 more.
