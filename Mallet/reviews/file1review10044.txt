review/text: This is our second Interplak toothbrush. We bought it to replace our old one, which lasted through a few years of use by two people before the battery finally lost its ability to hold a charge. We loved it.Like the previous one we had, we find this is great at keeping our teeth clean. But I would certainly like to meet the genius who designed this so that every time you use it, water gets down into the main housing. This means you have to remove the head each time and dump the water out of the base. This isn't a huge deal for us -- since two of us share the base, it gives us a reason to take our personal head off and put it in the handy storage rack each time, leaving the base ready for the other. But if I were a solo user of this brush, I am sure I would get tired of having to dismantle the thing after every use.UPDATE: After 8 months, the product failed. It would no longer hold a charge at all. To their credit, Conair (the manufacturer) replaced the product quickly. I had to pay to ship the defective one back to them, of course, but that's pretty standard. Also, the model they replaced my defective one with was not exactly the same -- instead of a compartment for storing the heads when not in use, it just has a rack to hang them on.SECOND UPDATE: It's been another few months, and now the replacement unit I was sent is starting to go bad. It's clear to me that this product is not durable. Given another chance, I'd only rate this 3 stars for this reason, although I still think it does a great job of cleaning.
