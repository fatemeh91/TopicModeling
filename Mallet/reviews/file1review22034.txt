review/text: Palmer's lip butter is a fantastic product. I get so many compliments about having pretty lips, & what I use to keep them so soft & moist! When the Walgreens in my area had they were closing out on this product, I purchased every tube they had!! I keep one in the car, my purse, & at work!
