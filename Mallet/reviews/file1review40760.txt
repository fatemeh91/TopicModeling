review/text: I have purchased two of these, one being a gift. When I opened mine the battery was already in need for replacement. So, I exchanged it for a new one. The new one also said it was in need for battery replacement. The one I gave as a gift doesn't work unless you hold the piece with the screen on it in your hand and push it together. If you don't, there is nothing on the screen at all. I would like to return both of these items. For the price, there should be a full battery ready for use.
