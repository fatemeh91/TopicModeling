review/text: Pros;1. Made in the US,2. Three choices for the replacement screens depending on skin type,3. Inexpensive replacement screens & cutters if ordered direct from Wahl (double advantage)Cons;1. Only fair trimmer. While better then the Braun design, this isn't as good as the Remington Microscreen version,2. Uses a ineffecient 'brick' transformer as opposed to a switching design which is what most of the better devices are using now. It's not heavy, but it is still a old style transformer,3. Doesn't seem to cut as well as the Remington, but better than the single head Braun. I perfer a head that is at a 90 degree angle to the body, not a 45 degree as this is,4. That separate round trimmer didn't really impress me.5. Non repleceable battery (?).Summery; With some modifications it would be a good shaver.
