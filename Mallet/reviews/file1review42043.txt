review/text: I first discovered Thieves oil from a friend in my Women's Chorus. I had gotten sick and a week later I was supposed to sing in a concert. She gave me the rest of her spray bottle and she advised me to spray it at the back of my throat. I started getting better almost immediately!Now, every time I feel like I am getting sick, I spray it at the back of my throat a couple of times a day. It works equally well if you are already sick, or if you are coming down with something.Now I have to keep it in my purse. It also works for fungal and bacterial infections on the skin (acne, etc).
