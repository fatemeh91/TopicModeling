review/text: this was my first vibrator and i did rather extensive research before deciding to purchase it. the pocket rocket lived up to its praise, exceeded my expectations, and is my recommendation for friends curious about buying their first vibrator.there are only a few drawbacks that i can think of*there are several small ridged around the top that catch if you're not using the 3 nubbed tip exactly positioned, doesn't hurt but startled me several times*it's actually pretty loud when used in open air*only one speed unless you have several batteries in varying states of use*while it's excellent for clitoral and general external stimulation, it's internal uses are minimal and would, i imagine, be uncomfortablebut other than that, it's wonderful.
