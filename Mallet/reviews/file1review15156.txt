review/text: I have been eating the Balance Mocha Chip bar for several years now (it is my afternoon snack in the office).Now, there is a "Best By" date on the box. However, the fact is that even within the sealed packaging the bar starts to dry off well before the "Best By" date.The ideal condition for the bar is that it should be soft and chewy and not dry and hard.When I buy these from a store, I test it by pressing one of the bars. If it can be pressed using slight pressure, it is good.The problem is that not many stores carry this flavor.I joined the subscription program with Amazon thinking it is a hassle free way to get these.However, they shipped me a box in March 2009 that had a Best By date of July 2009.Whereas, I had bought a box in Feb 2009 from the local store that had a Best By date of December 2009.Needless to say, the bars from Amazon were hard and dry.I cancelled my subscription and am going back to buying these from the local ACME store.
