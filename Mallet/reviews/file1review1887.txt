review/text: I have embarrassing toe fungus on one of my toes, and have had it for years, and tried what seems like every otc fungus treatment you can buy, and nothing has worked. I figured I would give this a shot, and I have had it for probably about a month or more, and have used it almost everyday, sometimes i forget to use it. Well I'm still waiting for the results. I have seen a little bit of clear up, but not a whole lot like some of the reviews have experienced. I have seen faster results with using vick's vapor rub on my toe, but I'm not going to give up I'm going to keep using it, I bought it, I'm not going to waste it, if I see anymore clear up, I will post it.
