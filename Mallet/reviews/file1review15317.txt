review/text: Bought this as a gift for my girl friend in the hopes it would preserve the lighter through continual use since she is a smoker. Fast forward two months she stopped smoking and hasn't found a use for the lighter. The pouch actually helps to prevent deterioration of the etchings that I customized on the light. After sitting on the shelf it seems alot of weathering has affected the pouch but hasn't damaged it so if you are looking for a product that can shield the lighter from regular use I highly recommend this product. The clip also helps if you wear a belt and need to sling it as you go.
