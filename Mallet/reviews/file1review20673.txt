review/text: To be fair, I have not tried this replacement product, but I would recommend carefully checking out all the reviews here on Amazon. One or two negative reviews can be expected with any high volume product, but this replacement foil seems to be a poor substitute. Given the high volume demand for the original, Braun should have had no reason to discontinue the original. In fact, when I contacted them regarding their reasoning, they referred me to a vendor who supposedly still carried the original but in fact does not.
