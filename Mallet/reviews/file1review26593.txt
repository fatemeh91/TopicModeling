review/text: I bought 2 of the back boosters because my husband and I both have had back surgery and need lower back support in the car. We were both very disappointed in their function. To much air makes them hard and a little air is very uncomfortable. One of the booster leaks and is always flat. We would like to return them for a refund if possible. Thank you
