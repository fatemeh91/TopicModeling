review/text: My 2 year old is a voracious eater, but has failed to keep weight on for the last year plus. Starting when he turned one, our pediatrician recommended giving him a pediasure a day in order to get him on the growth charts.As some other reviewers have written, the ingredients are far from *healthy*. However, it's a taste the children love, and it does provide the necessary nutrition. My son is now around 15% thanks to a pediasure a day...I am not sure why the other reviewers are bashing Amazon for the price. At our local grocery story, it's $11.50 plus tax for a six pack. That's $1.92 per bottle. I rarely find coupons in our paper for pediasure. Our budget store sells it for $9.50 for a six pack. That's $1.58 per bottle. With subscribe and save, I get 24 for under $36, no tax, and I don't have to make a trip to the store. That's $1.48 per bottle, plus convenience.
