review/text: Love my Body Back Buddy [which I still refer to as a Theracane], YES worth every penny, shipped out & arrived quickly, appreciated that they used paper rather than foam or other packing peanuts to ship it, the Theracane is very light & portable, I'm a musician & have been bringing it with me to gigs when my shoulder has been kicking up - I go out to the car for a quick tune-up between sets to help relieve the pain - SO grateful!!! Easily hooks onto stationary objects for more position options (the door-jam, for example.)Easy to use & versatile.
