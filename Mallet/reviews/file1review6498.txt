review/text: For many years I've had low back herniated disc issues. Injections only work for so long and if at all. I can feel all my muscles tighten from my glutes through the hips, lower back, and up my erector spinae. My recent chiropractor feels most of my issues are related to these muscles tightening and focuses his work on me with myofascial release rather than adjustments. I've tried other products and a few do- it- myself things with moderate results. I'd seen this product, but never pulled the trigger. I'm so happy I decided to purchase it! It allows one, on their own, to target the problem areas. The precision, leverage, and accessibility to the areas it provides is amazing. I'm considering purchasing another for the office and one as a gift. Highly recommended!
