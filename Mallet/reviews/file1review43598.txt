review/text: Two of the previous reviewers noted that their monitors didn't accurately read their blood pressure. I'm wondering if they made the same mistake that I made with my first two readings. My first two readings were 20 points higher than normal!! And then I read the instructions and realized that the air pump had to be on the same side as the palm of your hand. Tried a third time, making sure I had the air pump properly positioned. The next reading was normal. What a relief.When I was researching which monitor to get, I debated between the Omron HEM-780 and this one. For whatever reason, the HEM-780 sells more on Amazon. The only advantages I could see, however, were that it had a larger cuff, a so-called Comfit cuff, and saves the last 90 readings rather than the last 60. What sold me on this unit, however, was a feature that the HEM-780 doesn't have -- an irregular heart beat indicator (not mentioned in the Amazon.com description but shown in the PDF of the owner's manual at www.omronhealthcare.com). Since the 9"-13" upper arm cuff was fine for me, I bought this unit and it's perfect for my needs. The Omron technology is otherwise the same for both units and the cuff on this unit is also comfortable so no need for the Comfit cuff. If you need a larger cuff (up to 17"), buy the HEM-780. If not, save the $12, get the same technology with the added bonus of the irregular heart beat indicator.
