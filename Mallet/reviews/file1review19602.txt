review/text: We have an elongated Toto toilet with an angled toilet seat. I bought a standard potty seat initially, which slid back and forth on the toilet seat. My daughter was terrified and refused to sit on it. After reading the reviews online, I bought the Baby Bjorn. Fits perfectly, does not move. I read another review that said the "wings" that the dial uses to latch on to the seat need to be removed to fit an elongated seat, but we did not have that problem. Put the Baby bjorn on our toilet seat, twisted the dial, and viola, the seat does not move. Highly recommend this potty seat!
