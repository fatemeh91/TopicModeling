review/text: We have been trying to have a baby for 3 years. We did chlomid, IUI, 2 IVFs and all without any success. We thought to wait for some time till we try another IVF. I searched for some fertility supplements and read reviews saying many people got pregnant within 3-4 months from taking them. I ordered fertility blend for men and women and FertileCM: for Fertile Cervical Mucus. We did not believe that it would help us but it was cheap comparing to IVF and we did not mind to give it try. On a third month it happened. Positive HCG test yesterday. Great product!!! I don't understand why fertility doctors don't prescribe them if they are so effective. They probably scared to loose very profitable IVF business.Fertility Blend for MenFertilAid for Women: Female Fertility SupplementFertileCM: for Fertile Cervical Mucus
