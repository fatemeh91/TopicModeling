review/text: The product is slightly wider at the head than the shaft. If you're going to use it for anal, it may take a while to get used to it. However, now I find it to be just the right size. Maybe I'll get a bigger one ;)It has a suction base, which comes in handy when you want to ride it, but you can't move too wildy or it won't stick very well.The only con is the smell. Every time I break it out, it smells of rubber, and it's something that hasn't washed away with having it for over a month.Overall, it's a great toy, and I recommend it to all ... unless the smell of rubber makes you feel nauseated.Have fun!
