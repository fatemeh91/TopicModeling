review/text: I took these for several months in an attempt to boost my metabolism and lose a little weight. Did not help me lose weight, but did generally improve my mood. I have stopped taking them, as they are kind of pricey, but I never experienced any unpleasant side effects. Vegetarian-friendly capsules. Seller shipped on schedule. May buy again just for improving mood.
