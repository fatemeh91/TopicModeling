review/text: they stink like hell when you get them out of the box, but add a little Fabreeze (ok, a lot) and then let them air out in the garage or on a patio....and voila...they stink a lot less. hardly at all.but who cares? they are really worth it. My feet are flat, but I don't have any real medical issues, except I have flat wide feet. and so, most shoes that I get have zero support and my feet get tired and hurt.so, I got these and they work great. no more foot pain, no more tired feet. and plenty of arch support. so much that I'm ordering more.
