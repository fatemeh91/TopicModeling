review/text: I've been using Athletic Greens for over a year. I got sick of being on their autoshipment program because either I found myself stockpiling the stuff (because I had gone out of town a couple of times and stopped using it) or I would run out (because their shipping department takes a week to get it to you). I wanted to find an Athletic Greens alternative so after finding this product on Amazon, I decided to give it a go. I've been using the stuff for about a month now and it's great!I can tell you that it's more drinkable than Athletic Greens. I mix it in Orange Juice every morning. I notice the mornings when I skip my Vibrant Health drink, I feel it in lack of energy and overall well-being. This stuff really works.Now I don't have to worry about paying an arm and a leg for Athletic Greens (which costs MORE for a 30-day supply than a 60-day supply of Vibrant Health Greens does) while being stuck on some auto shipment program just to drink a nasty shake every morning. I am sticking with this product because I can order it when I want, it tastes much better, it's much less expensive, and it gives me more energy.
