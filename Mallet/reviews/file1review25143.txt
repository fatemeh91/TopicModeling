review/text: We had a diaper genie with our first child, and it was such a pain to change the refil, and it would get jammed. Then I saw this at Babies R Us and had to try it out. It works great. Uses standard garbage bags, you could probably use the bags from the grocery store too. So simple to use, and no smell. So far so good. We have had it a week, and it's been filled up once. So simple I think my wife could change the trash bag.
