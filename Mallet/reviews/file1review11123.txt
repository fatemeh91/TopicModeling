review/text: I've tried several different flavors of Emergen-C. They all taste great when mixed with 4-6 ounces (the average glass of water is about 8 ounces) of water as per the manufacturers instructions given on the box. At 20 calories per serving, the Emergen-C Super Orange, 30-Count Packets tastes great, dissolves almost completely and goes down smoothly, with no medicine taste or bitter after taste. Each packet gives you 1000mg Vitamin C, 24 Nutrients with Antioxidants, Electrolytes and 7 B Vitamins.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.
