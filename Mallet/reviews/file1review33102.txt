review/text: So I had this horrible sinus cold for over a month! I was at a Mind Body and Spirit Fair, and was told to try it. It was sold out in most health food stores. I have been taking if for three days now. I have been taking 3 tablets (P.U. they are stinky) every four hours. So far, I have noticed my coughing is a lot less, but still there. The for sure thing I notice is a increase in my mood. I feel more energetic and happy. Now maybe it is just my mind playing tricks on me. But so far, I think it is great for my well being! The cold is about done, but the cough kind of lingers.........so time will tell. I would recommend this to friends for a feeling of energy and well being.
