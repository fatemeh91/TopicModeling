review/text: I own five of these. Why, if not that good? Unfortunately, it's the best I've found so far. I've been unable to walk for the last two years and have these all over the house. First, the gripping isn't very strong, and my arms are. However, compared to so many out there that don't even have rubber contact surfaces, it grips much better. Plus, at least most of it is aluminum. I've had several of the flimsy plastic ones self-destruct just picking up things like socks. Second, the folding joint is silly and very poorly made. These will indeed break in short order. Just do like I've done-take a piece of metal cut to the proper size, put one on each side of the joint, and tape the sucker up. They work like a charm after that. Third, there is a locking switch on the handle that is supposed to lock the device in the grip position. It is not trustworthy enough to really use, but it is very easy to trip it exactly when one doesn't want to use it. I haven't figured out a way to permanently defeat it. Fourth, the little rubber suction cups are only held on with plastic rings. These will also break in short order. You can rig a better bolt and washer through each suction cup.Again, I'd happily pay three times the cost of each of these to have one that is truly made for daily use. Just beware buying some of the cheaper, all plastic ones. They're even worse!
