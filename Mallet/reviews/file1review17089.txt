review/text: Remmington's MB-200 trimmer certainly is not among the most expensive mustache and beard trimmers on the market, and it's fairly minimalistic, but it works well, holds a charge quite well, and seems sturdy enough to provide months and months and months of service. The trimmer does have a few quirks, though. Although the numbered wheel that allows the user to dial in the correct hair length works well, it is placed just where the user might think the on/off switch would be. The other quirky aspect of the trimmer is that it really provides the most consistent beard length when it's used in what some users might think of as an upside-down position. Once the user gets used to these little oddities, though, the MB-200 is fully usable and well worth the price.
