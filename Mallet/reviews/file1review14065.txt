review/text: I was searching for an organizer like this for WEEKS and found this and the Dexbaby one (apparently the only 2 made on earth?). This one STINKS and I ended up returning it - then bought the Dexbaby one which is terrific.The problen with this one if that it looks nice and rigid in the picture but you can't put anything in the compartments without it collapsing onto itself because the compartments need to be rigis but they are just canvas. I should have read the reviews first. Simply have no idea and would be so curious to know how a company could create something like this and sell it - if they simply made a prototype and tried to put a box of wipes in the top part they would immediately see it doesn't hold it!?... A discrace to still sell this on the market. Buy the Dexbaby one! Same price - great looking - I got it 48 hours after I ordered it! :)
