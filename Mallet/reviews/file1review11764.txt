review/text: My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/mzd2W , with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I tried 2 other 5-HTP supplements from other brands at the 50mg capsule level and felt benefit, but nothing dramatic. But I felt I still needed something else. I had figured out that two 50mg pills at a time was best, so when I finished the other brands, I decided to just move up to the 100mg capsule level. In so doing, I decided to try Best 5-HTP since it seemed so cheap and popular. Wow! What a difference! During the first day I felt that it dramatically helped my anxiety. I realized that certain tasks at work that I feel mild dread toward seemed to not be such a big deal. The 5-HTP alone would not be enough and vice versa. But they seem to work really well together at helping me get through the day and sleeping at night. Certainly better than effexor risperidone ever did, and minus the horrible effexor side effects! I take 1 capsule of this 5-HTP in the morning on an empty stomach when I wake up. Before bed, I take another single capsule along with Melatonin.
