review/text: My family has also used this product since it first became available. It truly is a remarkable product. No need to carry seperate bug repellants for adults and children. Ends the need for lugging around age appropriate sunscreens and facial moisturizers too. This is a family product and comes in 2 formulas. The childrens formula is milder with less bug repellent and has spf 45 protection. Both work great. We always keep a bottle on hand. It is the best smelling non-staining formula. No more stings and burns from a spray can of OFF. Which by the way we've had many compliments about our secret Bug & Sun perfume smell....boy if they even knew???? And it's waterproof and isn't something you must keep reapplying every 15-30 minutes.
