review/text: This is good stuff, but I'm still iffy on major differences in the noticeable effects on the "outside". I did great with NOW Foods ALA in regards to shifting fat off the parts of my body that I was exercising.With these types of products, one really has to be in tune to get the benefits. Some days, you just know that it's not working and some days it feels like I've wasted it... I take it intermittently now. I'm gaining some weight, but it doesn't look bad - which I attribute to this product. I can't afford the others, which is what I'm really getting at. I know that it's helping the free radicals for sure.
