review/text: I just got it in the mail and used it once, but just after one use, my teeth feels so much cleaner and I can feel the gaps between my teeth more than before. It says it takes several uses before you can feel a big difference and to be honest, I can't wait to brush my teeth again. That's an odd statement to make I know, but I love the feeling after I brush my teeth and yeah... I can't wait to brush again.The brush is a soft brush where I am use to medium, but it doesn't seem to be a problem with how well it cleans.The one thing I must mention is when I brushed my tongue, it tastes like metal for some reason. It's been over an hour and I still can taste metal in my mouth. Small price to pay I suppose.
