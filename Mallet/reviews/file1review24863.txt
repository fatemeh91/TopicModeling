review/text: These vitamins are horrible. I had a regular menstrual cycle and after taking one bottle of these, I have not had a period in 3 months!!! I have taken 2 pregnancy test 2 weeks apart from each other so I know I am not pregnant. I blame these pills for messing up my system.I got pregnant so soon with my first child and had grown impatient that I had not conceived another. I decided to buy these on a whim thinking they would help us conceive sooner.If you are regular save your money and start eating a very healthy diet, exercise, get your rest, and take a really good prenatal vitamin. These don't even contain calcium which is a vital nutrient in conception. This alone should help your chances of conceiving tremendously! Also, focus your attention on something else besides trying to conceive. The stress can hurt your chances. If exercise is not enough of a de-stresser for you, add yoga and meditation to your daily routine.I did my own research and am now folowing those rules.If you have irregular periods save your money and take vitex with a good prenatal vitamin instead. After doing some research online it seems the herb most often recommended for fertility is vitex. It may take up to 6 months to take full effect, but it's totally natural and in the long run is probably much safer than taking a man-made fertility drug.I hope this helps! Good luck on all of our pregnancy dreams!
