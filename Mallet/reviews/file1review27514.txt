review/text: Although a great protein supplement the price has been sky rocketing for the past few months. I bought this thing for 27 bucks around 3 months back and then it went to 36 about a month ago and now its 41!! I'm sure there isnt a a good reason for this price hike. The sellers are just trying to rip the buyers off for a good tasting protein. It seems my days with this protein are over. Will have to research for a new protein now.
