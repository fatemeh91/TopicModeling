review/text: The product came in the estimated amount of time which was a plus.The taste isn't as good as I heard it would be but it's bearable.I use this when I can't get a meal in after morning workouts before school. 24 grams of protein a scoop is great and works well. Also was cheaper ordering from here than say certain supplement stores.
