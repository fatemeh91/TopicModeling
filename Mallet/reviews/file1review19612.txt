review/text: I don't have a ton of experience with potty seats. I only have one child, who was recently potty trained last week - there's a new baby coming and we had to get it done. However, I did read a lot of reviews before purchasing. And after my experience with it so far, I am convinced there are none better. I couldn't have imagined a more easy-breezy potty training experience.-Easy to tote around - it has been to several different houses.-It has fit securely on any toilet seat we've tried. I usually don't even use the adjustable dial, but it still feels secure.-Little ridge in the front keeps urine from leaking.-I LOVE that I don't have to clean out a potty chair basin. Gross. Really, I can't imagine too many worse things at 8 months pregnant. Flush it down and GONE.-It is comfortable for her to sit on - she's never objected using it.-Since she has been trained on a real potty, she will sit on a regular toilet seat without hesitation when we don't have the BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer with us. I believe it has helped eliminate any fear she might have had using a real potty.I was really dreading the potty training. Actually, I was petrified, until one morning my husband woke up and said to our daughter (without us even discussing it), "Let's wear your big-girl panties today." So I just went with it. Without reading any books that I had planned to pour over before attempting the training. That was 10 days ago. She hasn't had an accident in 6 days - #1 OR #2. She even wakes up with a dry diaper (still wears a diaper to bed). And once woke me in the middle of the night telling me she had to go. Champ. I realize that the potty seat isn't wholly responsible for this. However, I really appreciate the ease of use for her and me and think that it has made her transition much more comfortable. So happy with this purchase. Will be recommending it to all of my friends!
