review/text: Of all the soap-and-scrubber combinations, this is easily the most rugged. Perfect for cleaning pots you've used to bake in, it fits into every round corner with ease. It fits right in the palm of your hand, so it's particularly good for heavy-duty scrubbing. It's quite unlike OXO's own alternate design, the Soap-Dispensing Scrub Brush. Though you'll get to keep your hands out of the muck with that cleaning wand, it's much weaker and won't let you get into hard-to-reach corners. Spend the extra few bucks and get a soap-dispensing scrubber that can handle the toughest of jobs.
