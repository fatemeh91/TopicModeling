review/text: I have several Siberian Huskies - so shedding is a daily and voluminous occurence. This is the first broom - and I've tried over 6 - that works to sweep up the dog hair and doesn't just send it flying across the room. I'd never buy another kind again. I've owned one now for several years and it still looks brand new.
