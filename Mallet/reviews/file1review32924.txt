review/text: The product has a great potential for people not wanting to get hooked to normal fiber intact supplements like Metamucil or Miralax, or just the consistent pressure of wanting to go to the bathroom. Senna Tea has its laxative properties imbued with a little bit of discomfort when the urge to go arrives and can be quite painful, and the continued use of it can lead to bowel cancer and other unspeakable horrors. The only reason I gave it two stars was the fact that it doesn't put your body in a state of requiring fiber supplements, for example after 1-2 sessions of the tea you can put your rests aside and look forward to gaining all your intakes from eating right.
