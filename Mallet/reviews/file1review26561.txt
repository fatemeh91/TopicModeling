review/text: I bought a few lumbar cushions b/c I needed one for the car/airplane, one for the office, one for the home office. So I tried 3 different kinds (all through Amazon). I liked this one the best for the car b/c my subaru outback has really weird uncomfortable seats and this one allowed me to deflate it so I had the right amount of support. It also worked well on an airplane for the same reasons. And it folds up quickly. I am buying a second one for my husband because he has tried to steal it!
