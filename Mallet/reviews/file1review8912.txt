review/text: I finished the 60 day supply and didn't really notice any great benefits from it. It tastes awful unless you mix it with Apple Juice and water. Typically it would make me have to go to the bathroom pretty shortly after. Other than that, it was pretty expensive and I didn't feel much impact which was disappointing after reading all of the great reviews. I tend to eat pretty healthy though so maybe it works for those who don't like their veggies??
