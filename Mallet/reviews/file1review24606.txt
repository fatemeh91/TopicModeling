review/text: I've been using Zantrex 3 for years and prefer it much more over other products I've tried. I mainly use this product for an energy boost for my busy, stressful job. I only take 2 in the morning and it's enough to keep me energized throughout most of the work day and keeps my mind more focused on the tasks at hand. I also used it several years ago along with a strict diet and exercise routine, and lost 35 pounds and got down to a size 4. It's doesn't work as well on loosing weight after your body gets used to it, but overall I thinks it's a great product!
