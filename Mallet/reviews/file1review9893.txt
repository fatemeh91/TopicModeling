review/text: I wear contacs and I will get these extremely fine eyelashes that grow under my eyelash line and poke/irritate my eyes. I can only see these eyelashes with a flashlight, they're so fine. They slip between any tweezers I've ever used. But THESE tweezers were my lifesaver. They grip even the finest hair. You won't be sorry.
