review/text: I have been looking for black currant candies and recently tried this item. I was unfamiliar with this brand and therefore wasn't expecting the tinge of mintiness they have, but my 14 year old son loved that added little "punch". He said these pastilles were "off the bomb" (meaning, he LOVED them!). That "freshness" may just need to grow on me the longer I keep eating them (since I ordered 15 individual boxes from someone on Ebay recently). By the way, these boxes are very small... smaller than I expected when I received in person.
