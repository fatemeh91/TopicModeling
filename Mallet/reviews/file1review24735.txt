review/text: The spray coverage is absolutely fantastic. From end to end, I'm estimating it covers 35-40ft on each swipe (maybe even more). Settings are good and you can pick from various coverages.My biggest gripe is that it's a little flimsy. The hose connector has broken off twice and I bought the sprinkler again just becuase of the coverage it gets. You need to be extra careful with it and not toss it around after each use because it will break very easily.
