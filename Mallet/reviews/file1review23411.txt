review/text: I purchased this stethoscope for home use with my daughter who has asthma & BPD. What I love most about it is the comfortably fitting ear pieces. I've had other stethoscopes but been unhappy because they hurt my ears. This one has great sound, feels great and my kids love the look of it with the clear heart. I would definitely recommend this product.
