review/text: PRO: I have been recently told by a new dentist that I have excellent teeth, no gum disease, tight gums and no cavities. I immediately burst out in praise of water pik. It's not your teeth that rot, it's the food stuck in your gums that rots.CON: The pressure control slider on the handle goes from mild to very, very strong with no real middle ground. It may feel like a fire hose in your mouth, even a little painful, but listen to me folks:Massage your gums every time with the water blast inside and outside of your gums. The enhanced stimulation will tighten your gums, reduce impaction of food particles between uses and it feels great. A little blood at first is only clots being released.... That's a good thing. Get the inside of your teeth and linger with the blast. Let it shoot between each tooth vigorusly. Then shoot through the other side of your teeth. Your dentist will be impressed and your teeth will last a lifetime. Use it 2-3x daily. Get addicted like me. I am 50 years old, my dentist said I have the teeth of a 30 year old. I give major credit to Water pik. Expect it to last a year or two before the motor starts failing, but hey, 40 bucks every two years is very cheap dental insurance. Try half a teaspoon of bleach in the tub of water with every 5th use. It's the secret sauce that dentist put in their water piks. Get the food out, get your gums in line. Go with Water Pik.
