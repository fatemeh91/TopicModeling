review/text: I'm so glad I read the reviews about this product before I bought it! It was definitely as I expected- no miracle or anything, but after reading the review that says to make sure it's right-side-up, helped me out so much. I was aware of the possible mix-up so I made sure I was wearing it like the picture displays (no pic comes with product, just looking at the one online). Also, as others have stated, it serves more as a reminder to keep your shoulders back rather than actually doing anything. I suppose if I wore it all day for several days in a row I would start to naturally keep my shoulders back but I'm not that dedicated!Worth the price
