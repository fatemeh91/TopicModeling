review/text: I remember buying this product 3 years ago, being excited that it would work but it never did. The patches are not sticking properly and if you sweat a little, they can come out - and leave some nasty stuff on your skin (like a chewing gum). When it comes to cravings - I personally did not notice any changes in my appetite (meaning I still wanted to eat :), neight I lost any weight. I personally will never buy it again, I have even trashed the rest of the patches.
