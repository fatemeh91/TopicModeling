review/text: These are not the diapers I remember. In fact, you could not possibly use them as diapers - they are very very thin and even when folded would not hold in what needs to be contained. Obviously the company has changed the material they use in this product. I'm not sure why.They are however great for putting on your shoulder when burping your baby. Great for wiping up spit-up and drool. Great for tying around a toddler if you don't have a bib handy. And great to have in the car for spills. They are also okay for dusting furniture.Wish they were diapers though - since that is why I bought them.
