review/text: The flavor of this protein powder is great. When mixed properly, it has a good rich chocolate flavor. This is the first protein mix I have ever purchased. When mixing it never does dissolve 100% but the little bits that don't dissolve are not bad tasting or anything. I had to get used to the texture at first and even the smell. I am mixing it with cold whole milk and usually use it as a meal replacement when I am in a hurry. I do not like to eat large meals after 6:00 pm, so if I come in late, this is my meal for the night. For me it is all about the flavor and the price and Dymatize Enterprises - Elite Whey Chocolate has both. I am on my second purchase and my opinion has not wavered. No regrets.
