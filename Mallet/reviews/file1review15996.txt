review/text: The AlcoMate Prestige is a very accurate breathalyzer for the price. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I really like the fact that it doesn't need to be calibrated every 6-12 months, but has a replacement "pod" instead. The best part about that is you don't have to mail your unit away and risk losing it or being without it for a few weeks. The ONLY negative thing I can about my order was the large black case which is shown in the picture DOES NOT come with this breathalyzer. It's not a big deal, but the way it's pictured it should be part of the package.
