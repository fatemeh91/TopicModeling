review/text: I've purchased things off Amazon for several years now & this is the first product review I've actually written. I'm just *SO* pleased w/this carpet sweeper, for several reasons, that I felt moved to share w/all you good folks out there.I purchased this sweeper because: I have wall-to-wall carpeting. I have health issues which affect my ability to clean house (fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, a TBI, & a few other things thanks to a work accident). I'm also a cat foster parent for a local rescue group--I have 13 currently in care & 8 available for adoption. I use Swheat Scoop cat litter. I was looking for a small (so that I could tuck it into the upstairs hall closet), light-weight(so that I could clean more frequently), non-electrical (to save money on the utility bills + get some exercise) sweeper to use upstairs so that I didn't always have to either lug my heavy 2-piece Kenmore up there whenever I could physically manage it (about every 6 weeks even though it should've been done weekly) or try balancing the 2 Kenmore pieces & me onto my electrical staircase chair-lift and riding upstairs w/it all (pretty crazy, but needs-must). I also have long hair. This sweeper picks it *ALL* up from the carpeting, no problem. And the removable comb for the roller brush works great, too! I read all the Amazon reviews prior to purchasing and decided to give this one a try--am very glad I did.I do agree w/the other reviewers about the handle, though; but for it I would've rated this sweeper a 5 instead of a 4. I do agree with them that the middle section does have a penchant for popping apart in mid-stroke sometimes--only sometimes, though. I just need to remember one of these days to dig out my rubber mallet & electrical tape and put them together permanently as a few other reviewers recommended. Then again, wonder if super glue would work....hmmm... :)
