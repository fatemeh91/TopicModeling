review/text: My husband and I are looking to start a family soon and I wanted to start early on the vitamins. Especially that folic acid! I am not very good at remembering to take pills so a one-a-day was crucial for me. I keep them on the kitchen counter and take them in the evenings, usually after dinner.The Rainbow Prenatal One tablets are a tad big, but that's to be expected. Aside from a light hesitation I haven't had any trouble swallowing them. They have a nice nature smell to them.. I can't think of a better way to describe it! Not much of a taste at all, but I'd have to describe that as kind of grassy.. in a good way. I like it.I've had no issues with stomach pain or discomfort after taking them, no side effects at all that I can detect.. Even when I take the pill well after meals.All in all I am very satisfied with the tablets and I've signed up for Amazon's subscription program to have them delivered every three months. With the Amazon Prime membership it's a no-brainer.. 15% off and I'll never forget to get my vitamins again!
