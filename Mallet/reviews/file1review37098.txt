review/text: So after having to have the undersides of my gums scraped one by one, I had to face my hatred of flossing. I hate the breakage, the wet nasty floss and fingers, all of it.This implement works pretty well. The vibrating is a nice touch, and I'm hoping it helps increase blood flow to gums, but it's not that big a deal. The heads can be rinsed and re-used as other reviewers have noted.It has a nice reach and a good angle - interestingly, I find that I can reach the tricky teeth more easily when I mount the floss head facing the wrong way, but either way works.I do find myself using this almost every night, which is not something I was good about when I didn't have this. When I consider the low cost and the relative ease of use, this product is well worth it, especially compared to the alternatives - halfhearted flossing regimens that are nasty, not to mention the painful and costly visits to the dentist. I also recommend picking up a refill pack of the brush heads so that you're stocked for a while.Happy Flossing!
