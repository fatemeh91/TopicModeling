review/text: I purchased this unit based on reviews and that it is corded (more power). Well I pluged it in and it worked for about 1 minutes worth of vacuuming up ash from my pellet stove. It quickly over heated and shut down. I returned it and am now looking for a different, good hand held vacuum.
