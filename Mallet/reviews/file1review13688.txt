review/text: I have Plantar Fasciitis in both feet and I wasn't sure whether this would help, but it has been very nice. It has not cured me of my foot problems (and I didn't expect it to), but it does bring temporary relief that lasts for hours.From the pictures I wasn't sure how this massager would feel. It has little plastic projections that come out and vibrate at different speeds depending on the intensity level you set (there are 15). I thought that the plastic might be too hard and uncomfortable, but that is not the case at all. When it is vibrating it feels like little fingers massaging your feet. I like to start out at a low intensity like 2 and slowly work up to something like 10. Some of the intensities you can feel go up your calves or even higher.It does not cover my whole foot (I wear a men's size 10 shoe), but I like moving my feet around so I can get at every little aching spot. The plastic projections have different shapes and sizes so you might want to experiment with different foot positions. There is also an infrared heat function (there are six different levels) that I thought I would really like, but with my swelling feet I find that no heat actually feels better.There are three different auto programs that you can choose from. These are OK, but I prefer to change the settings myself at my own intervals. Since there is a remote included you don't even need to bend over to do this. There is an auto shutoff function. By default the massager turns off after 10 minutes, but you can change this to 15 minutes or 30 minutes.Finally -- a very minor issue -- even though the massager has heavy rubber grip pads on the bottom, I found that it moves around a bit at the higher intensities on a wood floor. Putting the device on carpet or applying more pressure with your foot completely solves the problem.
