review/text: I'm a new glasses wearer and quickly realized the need for a cleaning cloth. As I needed to order some things off of here anyway, I threw this in the cart without much thought. Thankfully it has performed the good work of removing the various smudges, fog and what have you well. A perfectly competent product. If you are in the market for a new microfiber cloth, this may as well be it.
