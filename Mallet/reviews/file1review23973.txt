review/text: When the battery arrived, I placed it in my Camedia C5060 camera. No power available. OK - into the battery charger. The battery charger has a red light for charging and a green light for charged. When I put the battery into the charger the red light came on. Several hours later, the red light was still on. This concerned me because my old battery only took a couple of hours to charge up and bring on the green light. I removed the battery from the charger and put it into my camera again. The camera turned on normally so I knew that the battery was getting some benefit from the battery charger. I returned the battery to the charger and went to bed. The next morning the battery charger's green light was on - indicating that the battery was fully charged. At this time I have not tested the battery with the camera beyond a few test shots.
