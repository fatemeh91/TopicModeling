review/text: Right up front, I want to say that this and other brands have worked wonders for my ability to get a better night's rest. I have allergies and am overweight. The net result is that my nasal passages are easily clogged and I end up breathing through my mouth. These sorts of strips do really work.Now for my review of this particular product. I thought I had a largish nose. So I have always used the large size in tan. I did not like the fact that the strip really stuck to the thin skin along the bridge of the nose. When removing the strip, the strip would really pull at the skin leaving a red mark at bridge. I tried two generic brands (yes Virginia, there are generic knockoffs some of which work well) which were a wee bit cheaper. I liked those better. On a whim, I tried this one: Breathe Right in Clear for SM/MED noses. WOW. What a difference.I cannot believe how two models from the same brand are so different. The small/med fits my nose so much better. More importantly, the adhesive on this clear model seems to stick well, but not too well where it pulls the skin. While there is sometimes an itchy feeling from the strip on the skin, I am willing to trade off for a much better airflow through my nose at night.While there are some slightly cheaper alternatives that work OK, this particular one has worked very well for me and I am sticking with this for now.
