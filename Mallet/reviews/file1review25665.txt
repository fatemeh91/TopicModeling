review/text: I bought this for my husband, and his first statement was that he didn't know why anyone would say it hurts. Now, I haven't used it myself (and probably won't since it's been in his nose...), but he did say as long as you're not jamming it up your nose, he can't see how it would hurt.With that said, this product did its job and did it well. He's pleased, and with that, I'd say it's a recommended item.
