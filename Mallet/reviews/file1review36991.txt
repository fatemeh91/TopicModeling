review/text: I loved the Powder Fresh scent deodorant. It didn't leave any markings on my clothes, but I just didn't care for the wetness of the roll-on. The smell lasted all day -- that impressed me the most. I usually use dry stick deodorant and this was definitely a change. If I had no choice but to use a roll-on, I would chose Dry Idea.
