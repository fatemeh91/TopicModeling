review/text: I returned from a LONG shift in the ER as a nurse, and was SOOO needing to use this. I had waited for this and paid the 100 bucks because it was suppose to be something great. IT DOESNT EVEN TURN ON. I have tried multiple outlets, etc--and NOTHING. I am LIVID to say the least, esp. since it didn't even come with a return slip or packing slip--like I am suppose to return the defective thing on MY dime... contacted the seller---I will update when I get a response and see if this thing is worth the money or not--HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED AT THIS POINT.
