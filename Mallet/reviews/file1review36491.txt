review/text: I have been searching for years for a natural deodorant that works. I have bought just about every natural one on the market, including the crystals, and even made my own deodorant, which worked, but was messy. So I decided to give this one a shot given the positive feedback.Pros: I like that it's a pump spray and that it is in glass, not plastic.Cons: Didn't cover my body odor after wearing for only 5 hours. The scent is VERY STRONG! Smells like old lady perfume. The ingredients says it is fragrance free, but the smell is overwhelming!
