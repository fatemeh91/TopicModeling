review/text: Before purchasing the Priva Ultra Plus sheet protector, my husband I would use garbage bags and old beach towels after nights of heavy partying. It worked okay but sometimes the towel would get bunched up and the pee would leak through to the mattress. This was especially a problem since we have a tempur-pedic mattress which soaks up your pee like a sponge. We were also sick of the crunchy noises the garbage bags would make during the night. Now we just put down the priva mattress before going out and no worries in the morning! If you are in a situation with simultaneous night-peers like us, I would recommend purchasing his and hers sheet protectors.
