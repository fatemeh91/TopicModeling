review/text: I've only had this epilator for a few weeks but it sure works good. I did shave my legs the day before it's arrival so I had to wait a day or two before using it. I found it to be not that unpleasant so maybe the key is to start with stubble. I was so impressed with this unit I purchased another, smaller size for my upper lip.
