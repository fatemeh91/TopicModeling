review/text: i am new to manual shaving, having switched from electric shaving about a year ago. As a novice, i've tried different blades and shavers, but was not quick to get to Gillette Fusion due to a number of angry negative reviews. Many of them pointed out a relatively high price of these blades. Well, after a couple of months using them i can say that the blades are super sharp, leaving my face feel absolutely smooth, while never cutting me, unlike some other blades. I say - give them a try and see for yourself. As for me, i signed up for a regular once every four months delivery.
