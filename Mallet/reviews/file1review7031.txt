review/text: Before this shaver I had a Wahl 4400 for 6-7 years. Loved everthing about it. The charger ended up going bad and I thought it was the shaver. Oh well. The 4400 still works great with the charger from the new one. So I ordered the new one and it shaves great too. However, the trimmer part sucks. I think the blades are too far apart and not sharp so it grabs hair and skin. The trimmer is pretty much unuseable. I use the trimmer on the old 4400. I would not recommend this shaver is you use a trimmer at all.
