review/text: This was a replacement for a water pik I have been using since 1967. It finally wore out. The current model does just as good a job and has a few style changes that make it more convenient to use. I paid $25 for my first one in 1967 dollars. I was delighted with today's price. My dentist urged me to buy the first one and over the years I have maintained the teeth and gums to prove it's effectiveness.
