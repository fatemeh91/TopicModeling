review/text: I've been using this product for about 6 months and really LOVE it! I mix it with a low cal vanilla shake and it tastes really good, however, it's not too bad by itself (just very green tasting). This product gives me more energy and seems to help keep me "regular" as well. The price for this item is around $90 in most health food stores so buying it on Amazon is the way to go.
