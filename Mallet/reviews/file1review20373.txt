review/text: It's priced right at $.79, but I doubt it costs $2 to "ship" it via an envelope in the regular mail. All in all, it does clean well. I use it with glass cleaner for my Maui Jim sunglasses, as well as my Rx glasses, and it does a great job. What is it with micro-fiber cloths, though? Why is it so hard to find a LARGE cloth at a decent price? This is one of the largest I have found under 5 bucks, but could really stand to be bigger...
