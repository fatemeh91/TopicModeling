review/text: As spirulina goes, Earthrise tastes fine. I've compared different brands, and this is DEFINITELY one of the better ones, in terms of flavor. And it is one of the safest. Earthrise is grown in California, apparently is monitored very carefully to screen out pollutants, and is far away from Japan. I used to use spirulina grown in Hawaiian ocean water, but since the nuclear accident, anything grown in the Pacific ocean might not be safe. Earthrise is grown inland, and 6,000 miles away from Japan.
