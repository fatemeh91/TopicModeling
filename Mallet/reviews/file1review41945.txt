review/text: I LOVE this product. I have tried various expensive and prescribed medication for dark spots and this is the only one that actually does the job. It does sting a little bit (very little) but it does help lighten the dark spots and make my skin so incredibly soft and smooth. And for the price, I couldn't be happier.
