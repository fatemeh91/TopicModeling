review/text: These are ok. I like having the pop version of the Preggie drops because if the taste gets too strong or gets to be too much, I can take a break from it and pop it out of my mouth for a few minutes. Some flavors are more gingery or more sour and others are lightly sweet. The pops are flat and thin, so they are brittle. There were only a handful in the box and of those, some of them arrived broken, which makes the lollipop aspect a bit unusable. Therefore, I thought they were overpriced and would not buy again. They didn't help my nausea but they did help the constant metallic/acid taste I had in my mouth for a long time during the later first trimester. However, I did as well using a lemon-filled cola flavored lollipop (regular candy, not pregnancy specialty) I bought from a German company.
