review/text: One of my favorite Clif Bars that I've tried. I love them for a breakfast bar because you can eat them and not feel hungry for quite a while. The banana nut bread is like taking the lesser healthy version, and compacting it down to a little chewy bar. They do a good job matching a flavor with a bar; unlike some other flavors where it tastes like lemon flavored granola or some odd mismatch. Good all around pick.
