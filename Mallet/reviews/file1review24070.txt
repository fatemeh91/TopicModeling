review/text: This is the most awesome stain remover I have found. My white towels had turned dingy grey. No detergent nor bleach nor dark of night would make them bright white again. I hadnoticed this product seemed to really whiten things it was sprayed on. So on a lark I filled the entire detergent dispenser in my HE washer ( low wateruse) washer with this stain remover and washed on hot for the 'heavy soil's wash length. No detergent just this product on otherwise clean white towels. OMG I have new towels! They are as bright as new towels! I used to be embarrassed to put them in my guest bath but not anymore! I have found youdo need to rinse multiple times and have discovered the trick is to run extra rinse cycle and then two more 'wash' cycles with no detergent to get all the stain remover out. So this is not something I would do every wash but just to revitalize every year or so. I also threw in other white items with similar results. The only thing this technique has not eliminated is yellow sweat stains.I would NOT try the above technique with colored items. Also I think a washer that is not HE and uses more water would dillute the product too much.
