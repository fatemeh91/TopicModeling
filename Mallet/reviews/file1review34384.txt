review/text: I've relied on a glucasomine/MSM combo for years but tired of taking three huge pills. Jarrow is a good company that makes superior supplements. These pills are large but one pill contains 1000 mg. I used this product in connection with back pain and must say I am impressed with its effectiveness. I do take it in conjunction with glucasomine. I've never suffered from any side effects.If you have chronic joint or back pain, it is worth trying. I am impressed although the pills are a bit ungainly.
