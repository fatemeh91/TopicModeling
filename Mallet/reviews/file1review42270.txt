review/text: I was referred to this product by an acupuncturist and tried it. I really like it. The taste is very palatable for a liquid vitamin. Therefore I take it and it doesn't just sit in the fridge until it gets old and I throw it out. This is my 3rd large bottle and I plan to keep it up. I'm very pleased with the result.
