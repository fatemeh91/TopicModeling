review/text: ON's 100% whey gold standard is the best of the best, bar none. it is made with primarily whey protein isolates and very little whey concentrates. for the layman, that means a lot more of the protein is actually getting absorbed into your body and less being stored as fat or being excreted, much like comparing ground beef in a Taco Bell burrito to a big hunk of steak. It's just better (although i sure do like taco bell, but we are getting off topic :-) ). In short, the higher quality the protein, the better your gains will be.If you are someone who is just trying to maintain their body type without working out, this protein is not for you. let me re-emphasize:DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T WORK OUT!why do I say this, you ask? whey is a fast-digesting protein, and your body won't be absorbing much of it if you don't take it after a workout. try something that digests slower in the body, like egg or casein.however, if you do work out, this is the best money can buy. it offers among the highest protein per gram ratio of any protein supplement out there, and has a lot of servings. the artificial sweeteners is a turn off for some people. be warned. if you don't care (like me) the taste is great! I've tried the vanilla ice cream, and it actually tastes like vanilla ice cream! fancy that. also the strawberry tastes good too, which oddly tastes a bit like real strawberries (ie: not like a strawberry milkshake). trust me, it's good.another plus about this protein is that is has digestive enzymes inside it, putting it head and shoulders above the rest, which don't have enzymes at all.I rate this protein 5 stars. whether you are trying to lose fat without losing too much muscle, maintain your figure, or gain muscle, this is what you want.
