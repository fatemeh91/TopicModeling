review/text: I was really looking forward to having this in our home.After a month of use it seems the old fashion mouse trap is what works:(There is a season during the year where they are a problem on the island so I hoped to avoid it natually with this product but after a month of use we are still catching a few a week.Too bad and to costly to return.
