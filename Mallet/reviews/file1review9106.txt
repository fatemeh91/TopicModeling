review/text: I was scared to try this, expecially with all the choices out there, but this powder tastes good and has made a huge difference in my energy levels and health. I have been using it daily for 4 weeks and I am addicted. My mornings now feel weird without it. My skin is better, lashes longer, and nails stronger- and those are just the obvious physical differences. If you are worried, try the small version and see how it goes! My interest in this started after reading Revive by Dr. Frank Lipman. Check it out if you are interested!I usually combine it with almond milk, agave, and frozen fruits- and sometimes half of an avocado. I have tried it with juice and/or rice milk- I find almod milk to taste better and conveniently have less calories (the unsweetened version).
