review/text: Northshore, the vendor, very professional and prompt. Would definitely use again!The scale is very accurate - just like the doc's office. The yoke arrived a bit off center but customer serviced responded to my email very quicky with exact fix-it instructions. Very easy to assemble. Thank you!
