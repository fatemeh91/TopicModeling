review/text: This was my first time buying Optimum Nutrition Whey Powder- I went with the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor and it is the tastiest protein I've ever bought. It's very sweet, but it doesn't have an overpowering artificial taste. It is pretty good just by itself in water, and great in milk. It also mixes very easily. The price is also good. I see myself buying this again as soon as I run out.
