review/text: we've been using this product for a few years now. Very important to start taking tablets at first sign of cold or flu (scratchy sorethroat for me). also family members (your livein friends et al) should begin taking them at same time to avoid being infected. Also,continue to take tablets for a couple days after you feel better. We keep a supply on hand year round.
