review/text: I have used this product on a consistent basis for years. However, the primary problem is that it can be shipped in an almost spoiled condition. By that I mean it either becomes somewhat malodorous very soon or it can cause stomach cramps. Neither is good. While the product might be very good at a good price when fresh the whole idea does not work when it makes you sick. I am switching to Muscle Milk
