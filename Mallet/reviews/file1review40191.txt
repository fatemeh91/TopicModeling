review/text: Ultra brite, made by Colgate is very good at removing coffee and presumably tea stains. it is quite abrasive and contains other materials which make it , I think, ideally suited for this. However, it's abrasiveness has a downside; too much rubbing over an extended period of time MAY wear down the tooth enamel. As such, I use it only after drinking coffee and don't rub too vigorously. it does a great job of keeping stains off my teeth and does have fluoride to help protect my teeth. Other than after drinking coffee, I use Cavity Prevention Crest. But Ultra Brite is great for it's intended purpose.
