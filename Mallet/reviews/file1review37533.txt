review/text: I got this for my wife for Christmas after her previous sleep mask broke. It was hard to pay $25 for a sleep mask, and I considered it a bit of a risk, not having seen it before. I can tell you that it is well worth $25. My wife likes it much better than any sleep mask she's had before. It's not only sturdy and comfortable, but absolutely pitch black when it's snug on your face. There can be bright lights shining or sunshine coming directly through the window, but it will still be pitch black inside the mask.I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a good sleep mask.
