review/text: I purchased the Rocky Road flavor of whey protein because I had read it was absolutely delicious. That was not the case...at first. Upon opening it, it had a scent I was not used to. One of my friends compared the smell to that of Smores. I tried it in 8 oz. of milk (as I do with all the other flavors of Optimum Nutrition) and it did not blow my socks off. However, the taste did grow on me and now I can't get enough of it!As far as efficiency of the product goes, I don't really notice a difference. I use it as a protein supplement along with chicken breasts at meal times, not as a recovery drink (I use Endurox R4 for that). I do, however, drink it 40 minutes after I drink my Endurox post-workout.4/5 because I had to get accustomed to the taste.*Side-note, it tastes pretty good in 6-8 oz. of water
