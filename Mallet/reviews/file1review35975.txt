review/text: This review is about ear candles in general. My wife and I both tried these candles as instructed. When done, we excitedly cut open the candles and saw copious amounts of what looked like ear wax. Days later I reconsidered the ear candles and couldn't convince myself of the results, despite seeing what I assumed must be ear wax in the dissected candle.I bought another candle and conducted an experiment. I lit the candle on one end and placed the other end (which would normally go into your ear) into a section of vinyl tubing. Soon, smoke was pouring out of the tubing. Thinking that an open tube didn't accurately simulate the human ear canal, I bent off the tubing thereby sealing it. Once the candle had burned down I cut it open. Sure enough, the contents of the candle with tubing at the end was identical to the candle I had held to my ear; there was an ashy powder along with tough, brown chunks of wax. Since the contents of the candle without an ear attached to it matched the contents of the candle placed into an actual ear I can only conclude that the "ear wax" found in the cut-open candle does not come from your ear. It probably comes from the candle itself, but that's just a guess.Here's another similar (but more medically tested) story: http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_098.html
