review/text: I know others have complained about the Mrs. Meyer's products being too strongly-scented, but their website even admits to that so that's just the intended nature of their products. Personally I love the clean smell of their basil scent for the bathroom, lavender for the laundry, and geranium for the kitchen. The key is to use small amounts, and these products work great so you don't need that much anyway. As a rule of thumb I use about half of the recommended amount.The surface scrub does a great job on my counters and bathtub, especially compared to other cleaners or straight borax. It's just gritty enough to cut through soap scum, yet it doesn't scratch. Straight borax might be a little better for the environment (but only a little, since this stuff is pretty much all natural), but it takes forever to get surfaces clean because it's not a detergent. I bought a case of 6 that will last me for the next few years, so in the end it's really worth it.
