review/text: I have always felt that I was that one girl that sweat way more than other girls ever since I could remember. I have always had to constantly reapply through out the day and even then I would sometimes end up smelling like sweat mixed with deodorant.When clinical strength deodorants came out I was so happy because I finally found something that worked that I didn't need to constantly reapply, but the price... YIKES! Ridiculous.After buying clinical for a year I decided I was going to "go down the line" and try different deodorants to see if I found one that would hopefully work for me. The main thing I was looking for was a great smell and one that would last for the day so I wouldn't sweat through it and have to reapply.After several failed attempts I finally found relief in Degree. It holds up to it's promise of body responsive and 24 hour protection. It is very rare that I need to reapply. The price is awesome, especially for what it provides. "Fresh Oxygen" is my favorite scent, but I'm sure they all do the trick.I would highly recommend any woman to try this out.
