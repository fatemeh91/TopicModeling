review/text: Got this today after like 8 days after placing the order. I did pick the free shipping option though in case you're thinking of doing the same.it came sealed in plastic so I knew it hadn't been previously openeed. After i did some weight lifting, i opened the bottle. I had to dig a little for the scooper.I use to drink a different brand which was a vanilla flavor which I enjoyed. I got the strawberry flavor of this, and I can say it is actually better.I have read reviews of people saying it's gross, which I dont really get. It could be a relative thing I guess in the sense that I have done my fair share of drinking, and what anyone knows who's done shots of 80+ proof hard liquor is that just about everything else is tasty, or at least tolorable after that.I don't think this is just tolorable, it is enjoyable; to me at least.I would recommend this for the flavor, I have yet to see any results from it; today was my first though so I don't expect anything for at least a few weeks.
