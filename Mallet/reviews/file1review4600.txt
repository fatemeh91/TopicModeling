review/text: I have tried just about every configuration of razors: from one blade to five, including the Fusion Power. The Fusion Manual is the best I've used. It is good in the hand, well balanced and easy to handle.The shave is close and it is easy to clean under running water. Not like the other razors that clog up and you have to tap the blade on the sink to try to get the gunk out.The brilliant move to include a single blade on the back of the cartridge has made my life easier.This razor is so good, I bought one for my home and one for my travel kit.Give it a try!PS - The Fusion Power worked OK, it just didn't cut as smooth. It felt as if it was "pulling" on my beard.
