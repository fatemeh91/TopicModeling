review/text: For not having a motor, this sweeper is pretty good at picking up scattered kitty litter (which is what I bought it for). It doesn't pick up everything, but it does a good enough job. The best part is that I don't have to always get out the big noisy vacuum, which the cats hate. It's not as good as my grandma's 1930s sweeper, but I like it!
