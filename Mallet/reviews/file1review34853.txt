review/text: I was diagnosed with a fatty liver a couple of years ago, and have been looking for a natural product that could help keep my problem under control. I had taken a cholesterol medicine named welchor, and it fixed my issue initially but the issue came back and the medicine was insanely expensive since it had to be gentle on your liver. I did an immense amount of reading on the subject to see if there was a natural way to take care of a fatty liver, and the livatone capsules fit the bill. I ensured I was eating a healthy diet high in fiber, nuts, vegetables, fruits and primarily seafood and turkey when I was taking the livatone capsules. I finished the 240 capsules and took another blood test and to my doctors amazement my levels were perfect. I had tried a healthy diet and exercise before and it kept the problem under control, but this works much better if you take livatone. I will continue to use the product in the future.
