review/text: After having purchased Dasuquin for my dog Jada it started to become to expensive to keep her on it. The only problem was that the medication actually worked. So after doing some research I came across Triple Flex which has the same ingredients but is much more reasonably priced. I brought the bottle to the Vet her next visit and asked if she could take these as an alternative. The Vet recommended that I give her two a day and I have done so ever since. No more arthritis pain for Jada and I save a chunk of change, everyone wins!
