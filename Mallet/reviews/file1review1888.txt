review/text: PediFix Is a good product not the best but good. I would recommend getting it and see if you like it. It all depends on the person skin, he did leave my foot softer, what was before soo I give thumbs up for that. But it didnt totally clear my fungus I also included in my foot car an anti fungal cream and that helped a lot. Other than that I would recommend buying it.
