review/text: Method HE free and clear is not completely fragrance free, you can still detect an odor if you put it right under your nose, but you don't notice it in regular use and your clothes do not come out smelling perfumed. I used to use Tide unscented but it still had too much of a fragrance for me. Method is much better.Method is very very concentrated so a small 32 oz bottle will wash 32 regular loads. The detergent does an excellent job on all types of clothing and in all water temperatures and rinses out completely (provided you don't put too much detergent in your wash).If you are sensitive to perfumes you should be alright with this detergent.
