review/text: Neautrogena won me over with this product! As I have gotten a little older, I am 28 now; I have noticed my feet get dry during the winter and even in the summer when I wear sandals frequently.After using this product once I noticed a difference and over time the results just get better and better. I put this foot cream on before I go to bed and my feet are baby soft day after day. After letting friends and family feel feet, I have several of them thanking me for the great advice and like myself, will never need to try another foot cream again!
