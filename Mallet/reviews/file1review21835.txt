review/text: Have had this chair a short time now but love the massage it give me , I'm a senior and my back when out on me about 5 day an two doctors before I got thechair, was still in lots of pain when I got the chair an put it together, It does require two people to do so an the manual that come with it. Not real hard todo if you can put thing together from a manual. I am a big guy 6'4" 260 lbs but the massage is just right for my likes. Had another massage chair till earlier this year,though my back was ok because my back had not gone out in 6 years. That chair worked well an never gave me trouble, but the massages were to hard for me.The Massagenus 768 massage is more to my likeing, when I get up I feel refreshed, to me thats the test. I'm no expert, but the chair does it for me, so 5 stars. One morething this chair was $1000. cheaper than the one I got from Sharper Image, that also felt good for my pocket book for sure..............walter
