review/text: My dad had a small waterproof sheet protector (never had an &#34;accident&#34; but this is just &#34;in case&#34;), and instead of always washing it along with the bedding, thought I'd search for another. Found this product, read all the reviews, and purchased two (as a spare, if needed in an emergency, as well as to save on separate shipping costs). Love it, love it, love it. No problems, even after washing and drying it. Wonderful. I highly recommend this product.
