review/text: I need this because I wanted to keep track of my blood pressure since the runs in my family, but since I have been working out and exercising more I noticed that my muscles were getting bigger so the original cuff was getting harder and harder to get on my arm. The OMRON H003D Large Adult Accessory Cuff fit perfect to my Omron BP unit and was easy to connect and use. Great price and fast shipping.Thanks,
