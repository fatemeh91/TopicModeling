review/text: For anyone wanting to become healthier, boost energy and overall just feel better this is a huge step. I've been drinking Superfood products for 12+ years, this "Perfect Food" is right at the top. Over the years they have become easier to mix, I mix this in water, that's it. I enjoy the taste as I'm used to green food drinks. If you freak out over the taste, just mix it with a juice you like or blend it with frozen fruit or whatever, just get it down! As for the price, holy cow, Amazon is the best, I signed up for the subscription %15 off which comes to $35, are you kidding me? That is as good as you can get anywhere especially for a 60 day supply. I just bought the smallest jar at Whole foods for $25, maybe a 2 week supply. For the past few years I've been using and highly recommend Healthforce Vitamineral Green V5, it's on amazon for 49 bucks, this is a $100 superfood. So now I'll save some money, keep the quality with "Perfect Food" until I switch it up again. I'm just happy that products like this exist, it's truly a blessing. Buy it, drink it, feel better!
