review/text: I was happy to find these brushes as I can't find them in stores anymore and the price is very good, but I need a new handle or two. The one I have is an Oral B, probably gotten as a free starter from my dentist. Am assuming I need a GUM Proxabrush Handle, but the Amazon reviews are confusing - it looks like there's the old kind that these brushes fit into, and a new snap-on kind?. Reviewers complain of receiving the wrong ones but their descriptions are confusing and the product pictures are too small to see clearly! Does anyone know where to get the handles? Thanks.
