review/text: After a particularly bad allergy season, our vet recommended that we get an Omega 3-6-9 blend for our dog. I looked at pet stores and all the products we found there were insanely expensive. I love my pup, but I was not about to spend $40 for 100 dog omegas! We got these supplements and within a month, our dogs skin and coat looked amazing! I was a little worried about Omega-breath compounded with dog-breath, but there has only been one instance of a dog-burp that smelled like fish. And getting him to eat them has been a breeze! We just wrap it in a little cheese and he eats it right up!
