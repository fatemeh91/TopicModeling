review/text: I am tired of buying vacuums that break. This is the best thing. It pics up everything and it is easy to store. I had to assemble it when it came and I didn't realize that. It had four pieces. The bottom two polls and his handle thingy that came with it. Anyway. Great buy and I highly recommend it.
