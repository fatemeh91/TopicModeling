review/text: Our son had just outgrown his baby tub and when we tried to do a bath in the regular tub (he was sitting up well), it only took a couple of baths before he injured himself on the hard bathtub, so we needed an intermediate tub to keep him safe. This tub did it for us. My son likes to sit and play in the tub and will also lay back/recline while we wash his hair or when he feels like it. He is 12 months old and tall now, and can still stretch out in it (although his feet are easily touching the end at this point). We are buying another because after six months of regular kicking, our current tub has sprung a leak--but if you saw how hard our son kicks on this tub, you'd be shocked that it hadn't happened sooner. The lack of five stars is because it is difficult to fill--if there were a groove at the front of the tub, it would be so much easier; as it is, we have to lift it below our faucet and basically flatten the inflated material so the water runs into the tub. Everything about it works great, though!
