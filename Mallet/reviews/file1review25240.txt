review/text: I've recently purchased 12 batteries for the Sennheiser infrared hearing assistance devices in our church:3 Empire CPH-522 batteries on 12-30-2011: Functionally OK, but slightly thicker than the BA151 battery. I had to remove the manufacturer's label, and even then, the fit was rather tight in our Sennheiser charging units.3 Sennheiser BA151 batteries on 12-30-2011: One of the three has a shorted cell, so the output voltage is about 1.3 instead of 2.6.3 Sennheiser BA151 batteries on 3-13-2012: So far, OK3 HQRP BA151-replacement batteries on 3-13-2012: So far, OK, but a slightly tighter fit than the BA151.The Empire representative responded promptly and provided excellent support. He sent my evaluation, including vernier caliper measurements of the batteries to the manufacturor. However, he and I suspect other batteries in the inventory would have a similar problem. I elected to keep the batteries. I improved the fit somewhat by removing the label.Over the years, I've purchased about 25 of the Sennheiser BA151 batteries, and only one has not performed properly. I'll take off one star, but still, the record is quite good.Sennheiser BA151 Rechargeable NiMH Battery
