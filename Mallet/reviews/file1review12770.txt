review/text: Exactly what you expect with SAM foam/aluminum splint material. Price is good and the product comes folded and sterile. Good, quick seller.Perfect for use making custom finger splint for a partially-dislocated PIP joint.BTW: combine with a two-sided tape (over normal adhesive tape) for traction without having to use compression.
