review/text: Overall, I was very pleased with Secret Sheer Dry Gel Solid. It goes on smoothly and isn't sticky or wet as some others that I've tried. On my next purchase of this product, I'd go with the scented instead of the unscented, though. The unscented kept me dry, however I experienced a small amount of odor on a very hot day. I think using the scented will take care of this problem.
