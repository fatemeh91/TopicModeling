review/text: The mask consists of a heavy cheap piece of black plastic upon which ovals of foam rubber have been added to cover but not touch the eyes. How can they charge $15 !!!! Probably works reasonably well if you're leaning back on an aircraft, but if you turn your head slightly while lying in bed, the large plastic edge begins to push the mask away from your eyes. I next bought the large blue sleepmaster mask and very highly recommend it for larger face coverage than the standard masks and its softness + no elastic.
