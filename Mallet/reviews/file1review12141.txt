review/text: This prenatal vitamin is wonderful for several reasons. First, I only need to take it once a day. Secondly, it's never given me any sort of heartburn. Finally, it provides a full dosage of almost all the vitamins and minerals you need to be taking when pregnant or nursing. The one mineral it is short on is calcium (I think it provides only 30% of this), but aside from that, I really recommend this prenatal multivitamin. I researched, and tried, many different prenatal vitamins and this is the one that worked!
