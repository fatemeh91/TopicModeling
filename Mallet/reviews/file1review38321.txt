review/text: I have tried these types of products before, and have never been happy with them. Then I decided to do some research and find out what the 'reports' said were best. This product was listed as one of the best... I read what the users of the product had to say and then decided to give epilation one more shot. I have to admit... I HATE TO SHAVE!!! Not just a little, but with a passion. So, with that being said I'll commence with my review.1. Do your research. If you have a lot of hair, like me, you'll spend a lot of time epilating. Shaving is quicker, but epilation last longer.2. If you want totally smooth legs, this product is NOT for you. It leaves little spots of lifted skin and some hair breakage. It can't be avoided no matter how slowly you go over the skin.3. You DO get used to the discomfort after a while. Not the first or second time you use it. But it does go away and you get used to it. I haven't used it under my arms yet but on my legs I am used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore. In the beginning, I used Tylenol and that seemed to work.4. I'll repeat what I've read from other consumers; EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE, EXFOLIATE... ingrown hairs are a problem.5. I do remain hairless for as many as 4 to 5 days at a time. Normally, I would have to shave every day. For that very reason, I would recommend this product to anyone. Like I said, "I HATE TO SHAVE".Happy shopping.
