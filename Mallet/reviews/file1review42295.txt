review/text: I loved this product. I usually take the tablets but have had a hard time taking pills as I take so many. I have fibromyalgia and this seems to give me a little more energy. The color, spinach green, throws you off, but I tastes a lot like apricots so I don't mind taking it. I just open it up and take a huge swallow. Much better than taking the pills. You should definitely try it. I think that it would be good for children.
