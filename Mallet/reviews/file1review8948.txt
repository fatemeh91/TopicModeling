review/text: This is a great product, Ive been using it for years. There are lots of green foods, probiotics and vitamins. I mix mine with a little appke juice and drink first thing in the morning. It doesnt not have a bad flavor when mixed with appke juice. I also keep mine in the freezer for freshness.
