review/text: bought this after unsuccessfully searching for a reliable razor in my local stores. this one works really well as my wife likes the two day stuble look on me. Its sleek, well built and cleans fairly easily. All the reviews I read leading up to buying this were right of the money. Ive only had it for two months and shave only once a week so i cant vouch for longevity of it but I predict it will hold up fine.
