review/text: Dog hair, dog hair everywhere! I love my two blonde dogs and I love the color black. Alas, a poor combo! I usually use the sticky tape type of rollers but after going through page after page of them I'd had enough! The dog hair wasn't going away and I was going through tons of the sticky rollers so I decided to give this a go. Turns out this was a Fantastic decision! This little brush does in a few short sweeps what it took page after page of the sticky rollers to do. I bought one to begin with but I'll be buying two more to keep in other locations it works so well.The brush doesn't work perfectly and I still use the sticky rollers but not nearly as much.
