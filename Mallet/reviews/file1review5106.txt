review/text: I've been using this product for over 5 years and even fed it to my kids as a sweetener/protein boost for their morning oatmeal. We all loved it until they changed the formula. The sweet, cakey, non protein like taste was changed to a smelly, grainy, bland mix. My kids won't eat it, and I can't even stand the smell. It tastes horrible. If you're used to the old formula, you will not be happy with this product.
