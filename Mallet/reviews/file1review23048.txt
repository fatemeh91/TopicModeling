review/text: [[ASIN:B0001WW2G2 Bissell 2201-2 Swift Sweep Sweeper]As everyone else has said the handle is a PITA and I wound up taping it.I bought this product to get pet hair off a specific rug so I wouldn't have to drag out the big vacuum every day. For cleaning up pet hair this product works well.
