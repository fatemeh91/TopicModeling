review/text: I love the metal ball-bearing applicator that really is cool to the lips and spreads the Lip Infusion nicely. I think of this almost more as a lip gloss than I do a real repairing type of product. For repair, I useBlistex Lip Medex, .38-Ounce Pots (Pack of 12)The Blistex Lip Medex is much more appropriate for really cracked, dry lips.The Blistex Lip Infusion is a nice product to give moisture and sheen to lipe (think of the 70's and 80's and lip gloss). It does absorb quickly and does not leave any waxy coating or feel on your lips because it is more liquid than it is wax ... so it really soaks in. I am definitely not shy about using it, I will use several applications to really put a coating on my lips that will stay and not soak all the way in -- I find multiple coatings much more effective for "sticking power".If you have moderately dry lips without a lot of chapping and cracking, this is a good product. If you have Winter, chapped and cracked lips you need something stronger likeCarmex Lip Balm Small (Pack of 12)or the Blistex Lip Medex. They will certainly treat troubled lips more aggressively than the Lip Infusion product will.If this product is used as a moisturizer or sun block, I think it's the right product.
