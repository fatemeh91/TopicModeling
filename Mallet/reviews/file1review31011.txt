review/text: Osteo Bi-Flex "Advanced Triple Strength" supplement was recommended by one of my Uncles to help prevent arthritis related pains in my knees and hands. I like that the daily dosage is only two (albeit LARGE) tablets that contain Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and 5-Loxin. This also additionally provides 100% of the "Daily Recommended Value" of Vitamin C and Manganese.There is some debate about the overall effectiveness of Glucosamine and Chondroitin (technically "Chondroitin Sulfate"), but 5-Loxin seems very promising. I *think* and *believe* my joints feel better as a result of starting to take these products, but there really isn't any way for me to quantify the results or provide any real proof, so it is a matter of faith for me that I continue to spend the money on these supplements.Highly Recommended, with the above caveat.CFH
