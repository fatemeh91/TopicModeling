review/text: This product is fantastic.. The last time I bought henna, it was the kind you had to mix up yourself. I ended up making a huge mess, and wasted $25 worth of ingredients. This stuff was so easy though! And even though it's premixed, it shows up well and lasts awhile (unless your like me and get cleaning chemicals on it at work, lol). And since I could not use a whole cone in one application, I just taped the end of it and was able to use it again later.
