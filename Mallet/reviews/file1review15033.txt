review/text: These are great. These are the first patches I have tried. I tried lozenges but they hurt my stomach and I tried gum, but found it kind of gross. A constant flow of nicotine is great! Way better than cigarettes for sure! These stay on great, no itching and I have had very little withdrawal symptoms. After showering the patches kind of start to come loose, but I just keep patting it down on my skin, eventually it dries out and sticks again. I bought mine from my local drugstore though, they were a little cheaper, sometimes were on sale and I had coupons.After smoking for 8 years, and in the past couple years, a pack a day, I put my patch on March 1st. I have not had a single puff since. (36 days.) After a month, I cut the patch in half and just wore 10.5 mg. They still stay on perfectly fine! I bought medical tape thinking I'd need it to hold it on, but haven't needed it yet. I plan to cut down to a 1/4th of patch when I feel ready. The say you shouldn't cut them down, but I don't see why you can't. It's working for me!Once they are on your body though, they can not be peeled off and restuck on. I didn't realize this and ended up throwing one away. But if you had medical tape you could just tape it on I would assume.Also what really helped me is a free online pdf book called "Never Take Another Puff". I STRONGLY suggest it.
