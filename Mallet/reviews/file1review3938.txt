review/text: These seem to work ok, but the bottom strip can come off easily since saliva accumulates over the 30 minutes period you have to keep these in. I hated swallowing while keeping these in, because the taste is really bad -- so I started folding up a napkin and putting it under my tongue when I began the 30 minute period. This helped keep the saliva off of the bottom strip, so it stayed on better. 30 minutes is a really long time to keep something disgusting and slippery on your teeth though -- I wonder if there is a way they could make a product that would only take 10 or 15 minutes?
