review/text: The description says these are "all natural." I was amazed as the colors are very vibrant, so I checked their website. They are NOT natural and are packed with artificial, petroleum-based colors like most other colored sprinkles. If you're looking for naturally colored sprinkles & colorings, try ChocolateCraftKits dot com.
