review/text: I've used this brand of shaving lotion before, but not the ""moisturizing"" version. The gel and resulting lather are very good. Once you use a gel like this, you'll never go back to the regular foam. The ""moisturizing"" version lives up to its name. My legs were not chapped even though I didn't put any additional lotion on them after I used the product -- and in the dead of winter.
