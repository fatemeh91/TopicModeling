review/text: I have been using the gel callus cushions for about three months. It is the first time I have had any real relief from pain on the balls of my feet. I get big callus that dig into the nerves I have paid thousands of dollars for all different types of shoes and things to put in my shoes. Sometimes I have had a slight relief for a short time, but this product beats them all. I was in so much pain that I almost gave up walking and was staying home. I am now able to do all the things I use to do five years ago. They do stay on your feet which at first I doubted. This is the best product on the market for matartarsalgia foot pain.
