review/text: I tried this shaver after a relative suggested it. I liked that the razor itself is US made. It shaves as well, if not better, than the more expensive imports and I have a fairly tough beard. The personal trimmer that came with the system didn't work. I returned it to Wahl and they promptly and politely exchanged it.
