review/text: These diapers are so poorly made that pieces come off if they are washed, and cling to all of the other clothes. The seams are not finished in many of the diapers. I just wanted some soft cloths to use for dusting, but got the worst rags I ever saw. The manufacturer should be ashamed. I assume that they were made in some down-trodden part of the world, because no one in America would let them out of their door.
