review/text: Since I have to be careful bending and stooping I was happy to purchase the Gopher to help me. However, after back surgery I was using this tool often and the rubber tips came off. I tried using a bigger screw but it didn't work and then I glued it but that only helped a few days. I am very disappointed and won't waste my money on this company's products anymore!
