review/text: I am a huge review reader. If I dont like the reviews, I dont buy. I took a chance on this and bought the male & female pack. My husband and I have been trying for a year and I thought before we started expensive treatments, that I would try this first. I took it for a month. The only thing it gave me was acne, a jacked up cycle and 10 extra pounds on my ass! Do you know how it feels to be 8 days late when you're trying to have a baby only to get your period on that 8th day? Let me tell you...IT SUCKS!!! I have NEVER been late. I am always 28 days to the day. Now, my second month of not taking these stupid pills, I am going on 2 weeks late and I know I'm not pregnant because I already took a test. Which, obiviously, was negative.So thanks a lot Fertilaid for the awesome weight gain and acne NOT associated with pregnancy...just your crapy pills!
