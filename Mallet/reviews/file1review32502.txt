review/text: I have been using this table for over five months and I have been very happy with many aspects of it's design... and my wife is very happy with the comfort! My only hang up is that the arm rest, which is supposed to go underneath the head rest, is not easy to install. Otherwise, it's a solid table that's easy to set up as well as put away. Highly recommended
