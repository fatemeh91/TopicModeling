review/text: OK so I have bought these three times. Each time I bought a 100 count of Okamoto Crown's. The first seller Green Web sent ones that were made in thailand. These were excellent and smooth and thin.The second batch was bought from Healthtime and they said made in Japan. These were horrible and super dry and actually took the feeling away.My third batch was again from Green Web Inc and they were thailand, and again these were super awesome. So just a heads up to you folks.
