review/text: I'm a 37 year old mother of 2 and I'm not embarrassed to say this bear is WONDERFUL and one of my favorite things. My toddler fell in love with it so I bought one for her and now we sleep with them every night. The scent is amazing. Heating it in the microwave is a little over powering and actually unnecessary. I've had my bear for 4 years and he still smells amazing. Relaxing and so soft. You will fall in love.
