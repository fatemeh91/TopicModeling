review/text: This is a pleasant smelling lipgloss that lasts for about a month with regular use. To me it's like a colored, mildly flavored thick vaseline type lip gloss. With that being said, I would not spend more than $10 on this. Google online for cheaper prices. It is definitely not worth what most are asking for.
