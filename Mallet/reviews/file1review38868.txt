review/text: My 6 year old son has adhd. I refuse to put him on prescription meds. I tried mindcare jr and WOW. The change in him was immediate. I saw a side to my child I didn't no existed. He went from from getting reds in class to greens for an entire week. He was sweet, agreeable, told me loved me, was always in a great mood. What a true pleasure he was. Then he slowly started dropping back to yellows in class to reds again. He started getting frustrated easily and moody again. What happened??? Every child is different perhaps with other children the affects will last longer. I'm going to try and find more products that work for him and try alternating them. The only thing I can figure is his body built up a tolerance to it. I hope this helps.
