review/text: This little trimmer ROCKS! It's still running strong, and I would have rated it five stars EXCEPT...The plastic hinged piece of the blade is broken, which is a small annoyance. Granted, I've dropped it once or twice, and I was able to &#34;fix&#34; it with a piece of tape, but the motor and blades still work as good as when i bought this.For the price, you can't beat it! I've even given myself a haircut with it. Not the best thing you ever saw, but it worked well enough. I imagine with practice you could give yourself a decent buzzcut with this.
