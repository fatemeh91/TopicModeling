review/text: I find this loupe to be adequate for viewing negatives and other small objects with fine detail. For the price (under $6 as of this writing) I do not think it could be beaten. However, this is far from a perfect loupe. The clearest magnification is in the direct center and the viewing area inside the eyepiece is fairly small. People with vision difficulties may have problems using this tool as getting the correct balance between distance from the tool and distance from the object is a bit cumbersome.I would recommend this tool to film photographers and anyone else who needs to occasionally use a loupe, but for hobby work (model makers, etc) or professional use (watchmakers, electronics repair) I would suggest looking for a better tool.
