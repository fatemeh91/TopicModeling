review/text: My view: Let's just say I purchased a "fake" fish tank that is operated by a medium-sized motor from the Dollar Store over 3 years ago. The motor generates little bubbles inside the tank. This motor has been running 95% of the time that I've had it (5% attributed to moving, as it was not plugged in during a move). This little motor is still humming perfectly right now. Unfortunately, I purchased this Select Comfort Product almost 6 months ago. I have used the massage motor 20% of the time that I've had the chair. I have followed instructions and charged the battery as instructed. Needless to say my chair motor has gone "bye-bye" and now I will have to either go through customer service to get a replacement battery or attempt to get someone qualified person to fix the issue. If I could have seen the future I would NOT have purchased this product. If you still want this $112.00 loss, you'd be better off buying it in-store, i.e. Office Depot, Office Max, Comp USA etc. so you can attempt to raise "hell" in person instead of over the phone when your chair breaks down.
