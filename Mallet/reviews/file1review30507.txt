review/text: This is a wonderful product. I've always had pretty good skin but someone gave me a bottle and since I started using the product I haven't had more than one or 2 zits in 5 years. My husband has breakouts on his back, now that he's using it his back has totally cleared up.It doesn't take a lot. Just a dime sized amount will wash your face and neck. It really cleans out and opens up your pores while not stripping off your natural oils. Worth every penny.You can buy it in 3 sizes. I would suggest getting it in the biggest/best priced size you can find.
