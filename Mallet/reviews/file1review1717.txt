review/text: This product worked better than I could have imagined. I have really tried it all, athlete's foot has been a problem all my life. Playing sports or being active to where my feet were constantly an issue, I was finally able to find something that worked, and didn't just work a little the first time and than leveled off. It feels great to use, and I could feel the tingle of the soap working almost immediately when I used it. TRY IT- YOU'LL LOVE IT!!
