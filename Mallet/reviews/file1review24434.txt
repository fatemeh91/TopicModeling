review/text: My mom had her gall bladder removed years ago, after which she started having serious problems with her liver. I was delighted to find this storefront and the various wonderful herbal products they carry. My mom swears by this tea, and says it has improved her health 100%. Although it is extremely bitter, she says she is willing to tolerate the taste for the relief it gives her. If you suffer from digestive ailments, gall and liver problems, this is a highly recommended remedy!This seller is great to work with, honest and reliable, with prompt, courteous responses by email or telephone. A+++
