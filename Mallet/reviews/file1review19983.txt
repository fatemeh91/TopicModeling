review/text: I have a sick cat who is not at all pleased about having pills forced down his throat. For two weeks, I was forcing Clavamox antibiotics into his mouth and he would spit them out instantly and they would already be melting and he would foam at the mouth. Not fun! Not fun for either of us. I'm new to the misery of major pet illness, but I did some online research and read that a pill gun would help. I also read some reviews about the pill gun and found that small pills would fall out. That is when I found these gelcaps and realized that I could load the Clavamox into the gelcap and shoot it into his mouth with the pill gun. The gelcaps are definitely big enough that they don't fall out of the end of the pill gun, but as a major bonus, they also stop the Clavamox from melting since it is inside the capsule and doesn't make direct contact with his mouth. In addition, I've noticed that the larger gelcap seems to make it impossible for him to "cheek" his medication and then walk away and spit it out. Yes, after weeks of this dance twice a day, he had become quite adept at that.These are a GREAT help if you have to give a pet medications for any extended period of time. My only other note is that they stick in the mouth so a syringe of water to moisten the mouth before keeps the capsule from sticking as much and then another squirt of water after helps encourage the stubborn pet to swallow. I highly recommend these empty gelcaps for owners of sick pets!
