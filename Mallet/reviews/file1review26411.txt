review/text: Pocket rockets are quiet and provide very powerful stimulation and intense orgasms. I have tried others and have never found anything that works better for me. I used to buy them at a local retail outlet where I paid $29.95 for the exact same vibrator. I like the convenience and price of buying from Amazon.com. They are reliable and provide good life. When they start getting noisy and using up batteries too fast, I replace them and always keep a replacement on hand.
