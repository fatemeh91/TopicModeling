review/text: I have been looking for an ice pack to relax my eyes after long periods of computer use, this one does the job.I also like the padded back so my eyes won't freeze.They don't stay in place very well because there is no strap, and they are not as tight as those eye masks, but that's to be expected.Overall good quality product.
