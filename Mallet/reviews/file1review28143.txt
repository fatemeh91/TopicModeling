review/text: Hi,I bought this item after reading the reviews on amazon. Basically I was searching for a great tasting whey protein for my muscles after workout and this product (flavour) really is good. I am sure other flavours will also taste good. My Vanilla Ice Cream flavour mixes well in fat free or lactosefree/fat free milk and tastes delicious. Thanks!UPDATE : 12/04/2010Ordered Delicious strawberry this time and love the taste. Mixes well and tastes good with water also.
