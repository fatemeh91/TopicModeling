review/text: My dental hygienist finally convinced me to use an electric toothbrush, and recommended the Oral-B Triumph Professional. It is the best decision I have made in quite a while. It is extremely well engineered and well made. I like the built in timer that helps you to remember to brush each quadrant of your mouth for at least 30 seconds. It is very easy to use, and has three speed settings. The base unit is pretty cool--you just stand the toothbrush in the unit, and it charges the battery, no plug-in, no fuss. Finally, it is really easy to keep everything clean. I have no doubt whatsoever that I am getting a better brushing than I ever have. The small brush head makes it easier to get to those hard to reach places in the back. I highly recommend this toothbrush. A great example of a well made consumer appliance.
