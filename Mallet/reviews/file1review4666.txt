review/text: I have already tried this product and I adore it! Tastes great mixed with fruit, etc when blended and really enhanced my gluten-free diet. However, having a ship window of about a month and still not arriving by the last day of the window..what's that all about? I did appreciate the prompt response when I finally asked what had happened and my product arrived the next day. So three stars it is!
