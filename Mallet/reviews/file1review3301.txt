review/text: I have been using the mini slant tweezers exclusively for a few years now. They work best of any I have tried. I use them for eyebrow and chin plucking. Yes, I said chin. I am one of those unlucky girls who gets chin hairs and these tweezers help me keep that info to myself. The only reason I've bought a new pair is because I inevitably drop the tweezers on the floor and they land on the tip, bending and rendering them useless. If you're less clumsy than me, they'll probably last you many years. If you're just as clumsy, I recommend storing them in the little plastic tube they arrive in, as I am now doing, or keeping them above carpeted areas only.
