review/text: i took this stuff and didnt workout superhardcore. i did see a bit of improvement with it. and any noticable change is better than none. i mix it with milk cause it just seems a little thin. also put it on my generic grape nuts from kroger. good stuff i could eat it all day. or mix it with that and yogurt and a scoop here and there. i'm sure i would see more dramatic improvement if i worked out harder but it did what i wanted it to.
