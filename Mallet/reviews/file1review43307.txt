review/text: This is a very easy review for me to write. Method's glass cleaner cleans just as well as Windex, or anything else, but it smells so much better. It smells of mint, not of chemicals, which makes it much more pleasant to use. You won't get caught in a cloud of fumes with this spray. You won't have to worry about breathing too deeply when you clean, and your windows will still look fabulous. I use this spray both on my indoor windows and on my car's windshield/dashboard, and it cleans both beautifully. If you use it in the car, the bonus is that you don't need an air freshener- you get a slight, but very natural mint scent that lingers.
