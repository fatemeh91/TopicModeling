review/text: Ok guys, I started out never having owned a sleeping mask in my life and I wanted one for sleeping on the hammock ... No mask came close to this thing... It blocks 100% of light, and this is outside mind you.. the foam is so soft, I can't see how people can call this discomfort! The front is a hard plastic.. very tough.There you have it: the best sleeping mask on the market.Also... I sleep on my side with no problems with this on ... So again... I just don't get the dislikes with people saying they can't sleep on their sides with this mask.. You tighten it up a bit and it works fine, the foam is so soft it doesn't bother me at all..
