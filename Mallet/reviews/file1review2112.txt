review/text: I've used this product for many years and found that the coffee pot comes out spanking clean like new. Unfortunately, I can't find it in the stores anymore butit is extremely reliable for doing the job. I use it on my Farberware and enjoythe feeling of a sparkling clean coffee pot for a good cup of joe.
