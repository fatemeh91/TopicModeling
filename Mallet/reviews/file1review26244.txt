review/text: I have used other spf lip balms, and the ones without "chemical" sunscreens are usually very dry and chalky. This is not the case with Lipcotz! I really enjoy using this! I have not tried it under or over lipstick, because I usually wear this when I'm outside at home, but I think it will be fine. I will buy another one next year!
