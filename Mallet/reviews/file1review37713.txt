review/text: I bought these Tena Flex fitted briefs (actually, they're like diapers) for my elderly mother-in-law. She had gotten them in England, and she prefers them over any other brand. She says she likes three features they have that other brands don't: 1. They are secured by hook-and-loop fasteners, which means she can attach and re-attach them when she needs to use the commode. Unlike the onetime use only tape on other brands. 2. She likes that only paper -- not plastic nor elastic -- touches her sensitive skin. If she perspires, the other brands make her itch or give her a heat rash. 3. Lastly, she likes the design, which allows her to take it off and put it on by herself. No need to get completely undressed, which helps in public restrooms.
