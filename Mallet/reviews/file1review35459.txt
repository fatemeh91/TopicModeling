review/text: The inside of our dishwasher gradually became coated with black gunk. I didn't know if it was rubber dislodging from the door seal, mold, or just yucky stuff. Anyway, I bought Dishwasher Magic on the recommendation of the hardware store owner, and gave it a try today. I am very impressed with how it cleaned up the black stuff. I will need to use it again before long, and will use it regularly after that to keep the dishwasher clean. The directions say to turn on the nearest faucet until the water runs its hottest, before putting the bottle upside down in the silverware basket. I did this, and had no problem with the wax plug not melting, unlike the previous reviewer.
