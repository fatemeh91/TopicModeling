review/text: This product was recommended by a worker at a health food store. She said it was the one people kept coming back to purchase. Getting a good night's sleep is difficult for me as I can't shut my thinking off. But this product works for me and I like that it is gentle and natural, a big plus. Additionally, I found the Amazon price to be a bit better than the store offered. Ordering through Amazon, was also more convenient for me.
