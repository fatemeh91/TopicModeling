review/text: I FEEL like a grasshopper as I drink this. It tastes like I dumped my grass clippings in cup of liquid and drank them. I also FEEL like a grasshopper afterwards because this drinks gives me AMAZING ENERGY. I feel like I could hop to San Francisco. (I live in Jersey). I mix it with rice milk and add 2 tsp of Agave. i am really beginning to like the taste. I am also beginning to look like a grasshopper.
