review/text: I bought this for an increase in energy the natural way. I thought at first I was starting to notice a difference in my energy levels at various times of the day...it might have been the Bee Pollen or just a mental thing. I can't say it doesn't work or not because I did not take it long enough or as often(with every meal) as directed. I do know that when my wife and kids ALL tried passing the flu on to me I was taking it at the time and fought it off with no problem.
