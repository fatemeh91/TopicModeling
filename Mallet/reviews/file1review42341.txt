review/text: While my husband was in the hospital having surgery, this was the product which was in his room for use. He has very sensitive skin and allergic to Vitamin E which is a problem, since almost all products today have it. This product doesn't, thankfully.This has a completely clean and fresh scent, cleanses gently and rinses well. I tried to get it at a local pharmacy, but it was all sold out.This beats any cleanser on the market at typical stores. I will consider placing a bulk order for this product, since it's worked so well. Hope they never change the formula.
