review/text: I tested on days 24, 28 and 31 of my cycle, and the results were negative. By this time I was already experiencing uncontrollable bouts of hunger and fatigue. On day 32 I bought a High Street brand and within a couple seconds a faint positive line appeared and within a couple minutes the line was distinct! For the purpose of this review I tried these tests again... After a good five minutes with only a negative line showing, a barely discernable positive line appeared. Probably the test I had tried on day 31 beared the same results, but I didn't wait long enough - or look hard enough. Conclusion: If you're looking for a clear, simple and speedy result - go with a High Street brand.
