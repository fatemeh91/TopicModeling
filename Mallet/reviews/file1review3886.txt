review/text: I recently got my braces removed and decided to whiten my teeth. During my previous experiences with the strips i experienced no burning, but after i got my braces off, i experienced an unbearable burning. Im sticking through it, but when i take them off...my gums turn white where the strips were. i don't know if this is bad or what, if anyone could tell me i'd like to know. But when i did use them before i had braces, the effects were incredible. they really work
