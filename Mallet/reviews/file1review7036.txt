review/text: For the price this is a great shaver, and with the three heads you can select the one that works best for your face.In shaving where there is a few days growth, you have to make sure you don't miss any hair, as it tends to miss a few if you're not careful. Shaves quite fast with it's larger head, and the separate heads can be purchased from Wahl direct, quite economically.
