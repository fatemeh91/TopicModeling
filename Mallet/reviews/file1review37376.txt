review/text: I just got my SoftPerfection in the mail today. At first I tried it with the massaging head, which worked well. It was painful, yes, but it was very bearable. I expected it to be a lot worse than it actually was.I managed to epilate both legs today, and found that it worked best without any of the attachments. I have really fair, sensitive skin, and fine hair, so it didn't get all the hairs at the root. It broke some of them off, leaving my legs a bit spiky, but I don't think anyone will have that problem if their legs have decently thick hair. My legs still looked hair-free.I read some reviews before buying the product, which was helpful. It is true what they say: go slow so you can get all the hairs. It works very fast and efficiently, even better than an electric razor. My legs, however, are left red and bumpy, but this was my very first time using it.I'm really happy with my purchase, and my boyfriend says I'm obsessed with the little dealie. I recommend the Silk-epil to everyone and I can't wait to tell all my female friends about it!
