review/text: If you want a new shaver to pass to your grandchildren, this is a great choice. Wet shaving with a single blade is not a lost art. These new crazy razers with 12 blades are just a bad joke.Want a smooth shave that won't take off your face? Try a single blade, with a decent brush & soap. You won't go back to the goop in a can, and a face remover.HPS: If you want something passed along check out the e-bay auctions.
