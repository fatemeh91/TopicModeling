review/text: I like vanilla vs. chocolate - more versatile. Can always add chocolate flavor or mocha mix, etc.. The French Vanilla Creme mixes well and tastes great - no after taste. Besides my afternoon fruit smoothies, I add some to my morning (Kashi) cereal to up my protein intake in morning. I add some frozen triple berries (Costco) to my bowl, thaw in microwave, add about 1/2 scoop over berries, add low carb, hi protein Kahsi cereal, top with fresh bananas and or strawberries, add Silk Almond Milk or Coconut milk and voila, have a complete meal with balanced Protein, Carbs, Fats. I also tried and liked ON vanilla Ice Cream. Very similar to the French Creme. I switched my subscription from the vanilla ice creme to French vanilla creme - so I guess subconsciously I give the French vanilla creme a slightly higher rating. As for nutritional value - I've found Optimum Nutrition to have quality products. I'll let others that know more about nutrition write about that... but as far as taste - this is a great product. Mixes well without lumps (I use a blender) and tastes great.I also add a little to pancake mix when making pancakes... and add some berries (triple mix or blueberries). If not eating meat, it is hard to get protein level to where it should be (for me about 25gm per meal). I read that using protein powder should not exceed 50% of your daily protein intake. In other words, is not a substitute for high quality meat protein.I also use Muscle Milk (purchased at Costco) and alternate using ON and MM... MM also taste great (Vanilla & Chocolate) and mixes well... between the 2 I prefer ON Gold Standard.
