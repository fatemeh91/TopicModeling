review/text: Caffeine can be cruel. I regularly drink coffee at work, but if you are as lazy as I am on the weekends, you don't make a pot of coffee on Saturday morning, and in the early afternoon, you get a horrible headache from caffeine withdrawal. Enter the amazing Penguin Reds caffeinated mints. A few of these in the morning, (three equals the caffeine kick of a can of cola), and the monkey on my back is placated for the day. I keep a tin with me when I'm traveling for the occasional caffeine boost without having to stop for coffee of questionable quality at a convenience store, and I get the bonus of minty-fresh breath instead of coffee breath. Penguin mints rock. Penguin Reds rock harder.
