review/text: This product is a god send. I cannot afford to go to the vet every time my 17 year old cat would get a UTI. I read the reviews for this and bought it thinking what the heck. I noticed a difference immediately. And we haven't had to go to the vet since. I would recommend this and have done so to other cat owners. She is not as lethargic and doesn't act like she's in pain anymore. Highly highly recommended. I make sure I sprinkle it on her food every morning and she doesn't even know she is eating it.... Thank you, thank you.
