review/text: Have had PACs and occasional (lone) atrial fibrillation for four years. Hospitalized 2 or 3 times for afib. Until I started taking this product, I had hundreds (perhaps 1000s) of PACs per day. Cardiologist stated that these were "benign" and recommended anti-anxiety meds. I tried these because I had read about the effectiveness of magnesium for these symptoms. I tried other (cheaper) forms of magnesium with inconclusive results. I started taking 3 pills per day. PAC episodes greatly lessened after a few days. I am now almost symptom free. I take one in the morning and two before sleeping (to stop the "poundies"). I feel like my life has been given back to me. I can exercise more vigorously, and even enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning with no ill effects. I had forgotten what life was like before the palpitations started. No side effects so far after three weeks. I hope they never stop making this stuff.
