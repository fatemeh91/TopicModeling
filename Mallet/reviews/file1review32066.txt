review/text: that's the rule of thumb! As they advertise, if you apply this on fresh stains, it removes most of them. I love whites, especially in summer, but have been scared of wearing them since I'm a bit on the clumsy side. But with Tide to Go, I risk wearing whites, and guess what, I don't regret it. The types of stains (read fresh stains) it has helped me with so far include:coffee stains (have to use it a bit more so that it doesn't spread)pizza sauce stains (don't ask me how)soda stains (specifically cola)oily food stainsThe reason why I've given it 4 stars is because sometimes, especially if it's an oily food stain, rubbing over and over doesn't necessarily remove it, only makes it lighter. Thus, not 100% on those kinds of stains. But overall, it's the best one available in the market so far.
