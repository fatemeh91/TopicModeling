review/text: Took me a while after trying Ride Rub, Boy Butter, Stroke 29, ID HIM, and Swiss Navy, this product is superior by far. Elbow Grease is long-lasting and pleasant to use on yourself. Doesn't dry out or rub out, smell-free, washes away with just a bit of water. Elbow Grease has texture more like a moisturizer rather than anything greasy or buttery. The other products I've tried are either too greasy and don't last anyway, or too thin to stay put, such that reapplication is necessary. I fully recommend this product for, shall we say, auto-erotic activities of all kinds. The only downside is -- it will stain slightly your bedding; however, the stain will easily come off in a wash.
