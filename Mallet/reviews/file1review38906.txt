review/text: I don't think I'd recommend this type of condom. While the condom wasn't irritating to my partner or me, we didn't find this condom to be ""extra sensitive"" at all. It was just as sensitive as the condoms that we normally use. Also, when trying to remove one of the condoms, the latex broke. I'd assume this is due to the fact that the latex was thinner. Still, I wouldn't want to risk the latex breaking during intercourse.
