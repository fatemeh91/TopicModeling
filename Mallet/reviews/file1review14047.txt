review/text: I have now had this diaper organizer for 5 years and 3 kids. The same one has lasted through it all and I think it is great. Mine hangs from the wall above the changing table (I used screws) and is packed with baby supplies. I've never been worried that anything will fall out and onto a baby. The diapers stay in place just fine (newborn diapers are obviously smaller, but I never had issues with those either) and the organizer doesn't sag. I'm not sure how it would sag. Maybe people just mean falls forward slightly. The only part I don't like is that the shelf pockets don't stay perfectly horizontal (they fall forward slightly), but they are fairly deep pockets so, with a little common sense, it's very easy to keep everything in place. I've had it in 4 different spots on the wall in 3 rooms as I rearrange more than any human needs to and I have never had issues with it falling. It hs been very sturdy and useful.
