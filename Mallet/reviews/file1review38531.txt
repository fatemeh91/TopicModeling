review/text: When my sister-in-law asked me to buy a second pair of these scissors, she told me that (1) these were the best scissors for clipping babies' nails that she could find and (2) that the handle in the first pair broke in less than a year. So, I guess, they are the best for that purpose, just not very durable.
