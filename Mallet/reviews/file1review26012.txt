review/text: I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of this mask. It's basically a cutout of flexible black plastic backed by a foam cutout that sits between the plastic and your face. The shipping cost was outrageous...almost as much as the cost of the mask itself. I wanted to return it, but the cost of the total shipping would have exceeded the cost of the mask itself, so I kept it. Do not make the same mistake. You can easily recreate this in a craft store for about $1.95.
