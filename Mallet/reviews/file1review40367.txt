review/text: This is an herbal immune booster that is supposed to improve your immune-system without introducing harsh chemicals to your system.Good Points..+Vegetable source glycerin+Vegetable source cellulose(some other supplemens use animal source)+Certified Organic Olive Oil+Alcohol Free Extracts of Echinacea rootQuestionable Points..-Only 20 capsules per bottle-You need up to 5 capsules per day-Price is high for the quantityI also have a Trader Joe's version of Echinacea/Goldenseal and that item seems to work better. I usually only need to take 1 or 2 tablets per day to maintain my health and there are 100 tablets per bottle(at a lower price than this item). Although the sourced ingrediants apppear to be high quality, I recommend a different Immune defense item(such as Trader Joe's) because of the quantity per bottle and the amount you are required to take in order to have an effect.
