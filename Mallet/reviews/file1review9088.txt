review/text: This is the best super food out there. I don't get all these people complaining about the taste. All you need to do is mix with OJ and it's fine. After a week, you'll get used to the taste. I like using a banana, oj, and a scoop of Trader Joe's frozen plain yogurt. THis literally makes my hair grow faster and my nails and it just makes me feel better ALL day. I no longer crave a nap (I'm 40)around 3pm. The 15 travel packets are good to use if you travel a lot. Buy this stuff now!
