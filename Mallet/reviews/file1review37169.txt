review/text: I recently started having symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and the worst of it is in my hands. I'm a teacher, and even my students noticed how much my hands were bothering me. So, I looked for a pair of gloves that would provide compression and warmth.The package arrived exactly when it said it would, in very quick order. It was very securely packaged - almost TOO securely for someone whose hands hurt and who is losing grip strength!The gloves have a very nice sort of fish scale pattern. The wrists have Velcro closures which allow you to choose how tightly you want your wrists compressed. I ordered medium, and they seemed a little large at first, but after wearing for a day, they now feel like the perfect size. The fingers go right down to my last knuckles, which does interfere with some fine motor tasks, but the warmth the gloves provide more than makes up for it. The fabric also feels like it could be trimmed with a good pair of scissors and not unravel. I am adapting to it, though, and for instance, am typing this review while wearing them.The gloves hold in body heat very well, so even when I was in a cold room, my hands felt quite comfortable. In a warm environment, especially in direct sunlight, they were extremely warm - very soothing to my aching wrists and knuckles. What I thought was a loose fit became very comfortable, and when I took them off, I found that the gloves had molded themselves to my hands. It took a couple of minutes to work the gloves free!The only time they are awkward is when I need to do dirty work - scooping the catbox and such - and they really need to come off for that. From here, I am interested to see how well they will hold up to daily wear and tear. These gloves are very well made and a bargain at the price.
