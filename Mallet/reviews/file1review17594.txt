review/text: I got this to replace another Remington that I had, which died after about 2 years' worth of use, and I'm writing this review after using it twice.Pros:- The length guard is softer material and doesn't dig into your skin like the hard plastic ones- The cutting head is larger than I expected, so it takes fewer swipes to do the job- The design of the length guard should help keep things more even than the snap-on style length guards- The length guard can be adjusted very easily, which is handyCons:- The trimmer as a whole is bigger than my old one, so detail work is a little challenging- Removing the length guard to edge my goatee isn't as easy as it was with the other modelAlso, a #3 setting on this one is shorter than the #3 on my old one. I found this out the hard way. This is not a criticism of the trimmer or the design, but I wanted to throw it out there to save other people from making the same mistake I made.All in all, I prefer the other model, which was smaller and lighter. But this is still a very good trimmer.
