review/text: I was hesitant when I bought this cleanser at the beauty supply store because I have tried so many acne products to no avail. I have tried proactive, clinique, shiseido, etc. and no product has kept me from breaking out the way this gel cleanser has. My skin is combination oily/sensitive basically the most problematic skin you could have. I don't have severe acne but I definitely see my fair share of bad breakouts. I also have olive skin so breakouts are especially problematic for me because each blemish I get leaves a little dark spot. I haven't broken out once since I bought this cleanser over a month ago. If you follow the instructions and wash twice every time you cleanse, your face will be incredibly clean, not tight, and your clarity should improve dramatically. At least mine did. It lasts a long time too because you only need to use a tiny bit each time you wash.
