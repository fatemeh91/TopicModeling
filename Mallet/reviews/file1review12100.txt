review/text: I picked these vitamins up while in a hurry at Wal-mart. Since there's a possibility of being preggo, I wanted to go ahead and get started taking a vitamin. Since they were only around $8, I was concerned about their validity. Since amazon users give such great reviews, I decided I would check out what people are saying... I am so thankful to have found such a popular item. With my past 2 children, I had difficulty with prenatal vitamins being constipating and also not allowing my body to absorb enough iron.I am very thankful to hear about other women who have had success with this vitamin. I do not understand the comments about them being difficult to swallow. I had no problem at all and was extremely delighted by the fact i couldnt taste them or have hertburn afterwards, like i have had in the past. I think most of that discontent is "in the head" and people get psyched about swallowing a pill. I've swallowed way more food at one time, it's just in their head. Get a glass of water, swallow and go on with life.. Love the potential for all the various positive aspects of this vitamin!!!!!
