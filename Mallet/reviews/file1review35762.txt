review/text: I've used Lynco inserts for years in my Brooks running shoes. This time--the first time I ordered them online--they were too large, although they were the same size I'd ordered previously. I had to trim them down with scissors. They still work, but I'm not sure that they hit my foot in exactly the same place they did before.Regardless, they still seem to do a great job of preventing foot/ankle/knee problems when combined with my Brooks running shoes.
