review/text: The consistency was better than anything else I've tried (and I've tried a lot) - smooth, slippery, but without being greasy, slimy, or sticky. The thickness was also just right - goes on smoothly, not gloopy, but not too watery as to be dripping everywhere either. The problem is that you need to use a lot and reapply every MINUTE or so. It dries way too quickly for a product of this nature.In summary, I'd buy it again because I like the feel, but next time I'm going for the bigger bottle because this won't last long!
