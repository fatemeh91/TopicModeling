review/text: Excellent product which flushes teeth and gums with plenty of water flow for better cleaning. On mid range intensity it does great job without piercing pinpoint jet of my previous one. One drawback is the large size of product versus small vanity top, I should have been more aware of dimensions as it takes up large amount of space. Tank is overly large, which they say, means fewer fill ups, but I don't like the idea of leaving water in between uses, so I fill halfway, use and empty balance of water, also not very easy because of size. Also does not have tank cover top, which would help to keep it clean.
