review/text: Our daughter arrived earlier this year and the middle of the night feedings really kept us on our toes. Sometimes after nursing, she would unexpectedly empty her stomach or have an explosive #2 diaper that would have been so easily contained with this sheet protector pad. The morning after we had to change our sheets at 2 a.m. following one of these episodes, my husband suggested finding something like this.For the low price and the sanity of not having to change your sheets in the middle of the night when taking care of your little one, this product is a no-brainer and a must-have. I only wish I had known to buy one or two before the baby arrived. Now I am telling all my pregnant friends. It holds up fine in the washer and dryer, and scrubs easily enough withDreft Stain Remover - 22 oz.Now our baby is sleeping through the night, but I could see having 2 as even more of a convenience because we did run into a time crunch with this one in the wash here and there. At any rate, I can't recommend this enough!
