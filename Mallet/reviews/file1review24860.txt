review/text: I read tons of reviews on this product both on Amazon and other websites before deciding to try it. Like many of the other women taking this product, I have an irregularly long cycle. The cycle before I started taking this was 38 days long with ovulation around CD 23. I started FertilAid on CD 1 of my new cycle. I took it 3x day faithfully. About ten days to two weeks into it I started noticing a rash around my chest area. I didn't pay it much attention at first but it started to get worse. The red splotches became darker and more prevalent. I hadn't tried anything else new so I didn't think it could be an allergic reaction to anything. So I did some research. Apparently a rash is a common side effect for both red clover and chasteberry (two major ingredients in FertilAid). (You can see for yourself if you search side effects of FertilAid supplement.) Ok, so rash aside, I would have overlooked the rash (despite its unattractiveness) if I felt like it worked but it didn't. I know it's taken a few months for it to work for some people and if it had not changed anything for me the first month then I might have been patient and kept on trying for a couple more months to see if it changed anything. But it ended up DELAYING ovulation. I didn't ovulate until CD 30 this cycle, making this cycle 44 days long. If it wasn't going to kick in for 3+ months then fine, wouldn't my cycle have stayed its usual 35ish days? Why did it take me LONGER to ovulate?! Needless to say, I've stopped. It's been almost two weeks since I've stopped taking Fertilaid and the rash is still there!
