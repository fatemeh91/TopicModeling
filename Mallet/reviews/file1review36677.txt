review/text: I enjoyed using Sports Scent Irish Spring Deodorant soap. The scent is fresh and clean and it really lends a ""clean"" fragrance to the whole bathroom. And it has really great lathering property. There's plenty of suds, yet it's easily rinsed off. There isn't a soapy residue like there is with some soap. The deodorant protection lasts all day. I have used Dial soap for most of my life, but I will definitely buy this product again.
