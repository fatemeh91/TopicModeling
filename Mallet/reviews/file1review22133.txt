review/text: NOTE: I'm posting here in case someone wants to read my review about this baby oil, not because you should pay ~$10 from 3rd party seller. Amazon sells a 6-pack &lt;$4 bottle, which what I generally pay for it pre-coupon. Thanks.My son has had itchy skin ever since he was born. We've tried so many things for him, from lotions to oils to creams. It's especially important during the winter time when the air is so dry, but we try to do it all year. Compared to the regular baby oil that JnJ makes, this baby oil is SOOO much more pleasant smelling, and hence is our preferred baby oil to purchase. Unfortunately, our local Target has stopped selling this for some reason so I am glad to see it on Amazon.We apply it in one of two ways, before we towel him off:1. After his bath/shower we just smear on his body - makes him the most greasy.2. We let him sit in his rinse water and put it directly in the water. Using a cup, we just pour this oily water over his body from the neck down - much more even application and he is well coated without being too greasy. Remember, oil likes to float on top of water, so we scoop up the top water layer.Empirically, my wife and I think that he gets a lot less itchy with JnJ Baby Oil. The Lavender version is the MUCH better smelling version.NOTE: When you drain the bath water in the tub the next person who gets in the tub needs to be really careful since the floor of the tub can be fairly slippery. This is especially true for bathtubs that do not have frictionized surfaces. I wouldn't use this stuff in the same tub that the grandparents might use unless you want an unscheduled visit to the ER.
