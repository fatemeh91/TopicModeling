review/text: This cane came yesterday and overall it's just o.k. Quite light weight to the point of being a bit flimsy. But the problem I had was that I ordered the bronze, paying an extra $10, and found that 6 inches of the front of the cane is covered with a big white sticker. By the time this was removed and the sticky stuff gone, the cane underneath was dark and splotchy looking. Not a good thing when they advertise colors. In calling the company I learned that the sticker was not to be removed, it "identified" the cane. And that they "aren't responsible for what pictures Amazon posts in their sales". Just a little warning if you thought you wanted a color - get one that blends with the huge sticker.
