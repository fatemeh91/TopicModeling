review/text: Being a Mitchum user, I was excited to try this product. I found that the solid didn't stick as well as the clear gel -- I felt as though I didn't have deodorant on. Another thing I didn't like was that when you put your clothes on, the white came off on your clothes. I purposely wore black twice to test this. In my opinion, the solid would probably be good for men, but not for women. It did glide on easily. To compare the two, the clear gel is definitely a better product for the reasons cited above. I don't believe I'd buy the solid.
