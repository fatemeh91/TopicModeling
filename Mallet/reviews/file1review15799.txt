review/text: This pen works well. It does exactly what I wanted it to do easily. It's more expensive than I would like it to be for an everyday work pen. I keep it in my shirt pocket and shortly after I bought it, I leaned against my desk while reaching for something and bent it a little. It still works well. Both colors of ink and the pencil work great and it's very easy to switch between them.
