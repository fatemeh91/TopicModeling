review/text: The self-cleaning feature is a bit of overkill but it works well. This unit is replacing an earlier Braun shaver that I have had for over eight years. Works even better. Charging/Cleaning station is a bit large and the blue "charged" light is very bright in the dark and has an annoying flicker once fully charged. Comes with a good travel case although it does not fit the cord which is needed to charge when on the road. Holds a pretty good charge, needed to charge it twice on a recent three week trip. Best electric shaver that I have used.
