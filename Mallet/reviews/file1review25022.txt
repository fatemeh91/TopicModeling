review/text: These give you a full day's worth of calcium and are easy to swallow. These are perfect for those of us who don't take in too much dairy due to a distaste for milk or lactose intolerance. Bluebonnet is also a good, all natural brand of vitamin. No added chemicals or junk that's bad for your system. Always go for all natural ingredients and/or raw food ingredients in vitamins--and always go for capsules over tablets. They absorb best and companies that use tablets heavily tend to either skimp or over do it on the amounts of nutrients in their supplements. And there's currently no regulation for this by the FDA, so you have to do the research and look out for yourself and your family. I highly recommend this Calcium supplement and pretty much anything by Bluebonnet.
