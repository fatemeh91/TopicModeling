review/text: I don't even know where to start with this. My changing table has no top space so I purchased this thinking it was the ultimate solution. My first issue was attaching it, the velcro didn't seem to attach well around itself. I finally attached the little extra velcro pieces to the back of the organizer and was able to get it to stay - so I thought. I began to fill the organizer with diapers, and other light changing supplies and the changer kept sagging lower and lower. The "shelves" are a great idea but all of them slump forward. I walked into the other room and heard a light crashing noise. I came in to find the organizer on the floor and the velcro I put on the back had come off. I ended up using the little loop holes on the top and some cloth ribbon to tie it to my changing table. I will use this until I find a replacement but I would not buy this product again.
