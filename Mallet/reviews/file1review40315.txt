review/text: Gaia Herbs Quick Defense is to be taken when you start to feel the first pangs of illness. Runny nose, aches and pains, and that *not quite there* feeling that a cold or flu often presents with....It provides a good amount of Echinacea root and other herbs to fight the onset of symptoms and to boost the immune system so you can go on with your life without falling victim to sickness.The instructions are to take 2 phyto-liquid capsules 5 times a day for two days. This will give theAlkylamides a chance to absorb at the cellular level and to do it's work. This is a product you want to keep on hand in case you feel a cold coming on; the sooner these herbs are taken the source of the possible infection will be destroyed.
