review/text: really like this product, does a large are or skin at one time and is powerful. this is my third optima and maybe my sixth epilator (all from emjoi). they only last 2-3 years but that is all i use on my legs (no shaving). i love that even when the hair starts to grow in it is not as prickly as with shaving. works great on the top of my feet too for sandals!
