review/text: Schick I have a message for you... Stop spending all your money in new product design and give it to me for telling you You already have the best design in a razor. Ask any 30 or 20 year old what razor she learned to shave on, the answer will be a Personal Touch. Slap on some new colors (a wall mount would be great) and sell away. If you don't take my advise I beseach you not to discounting the cartridges. I still have mine and after fifteen to twenty years it looks brand new! And I haven't lost my Touch in shaving with it. No NICKS EVER.
