review/text: When I first read the instructions, I read something about a scoop. I had no clue as to what the gram size was in a scoop so I hoped for the best when I opened it, hoping for a scoop. I opened it. There was no scoop. But then my brain started to churn and I figured that the scoop was in the center of the jar. Damn. I washed my arm like a doctor does and dried it. Then I shoved my hand down in that jar like an artificial cow inseminator. Lo and Behold, after some wriggling, I was triumphant with my scoop! Now I scoop that in my water, milk, or smoothie everyday and I see some good results! The taste, ah, well, do you really ever think vanilla protein will taste good?
