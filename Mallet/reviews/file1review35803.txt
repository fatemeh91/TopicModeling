review/text: I had a severe sprain from playing hoops and was unable to walk for 2 weeks and I am still suffering 3 months later. Doctor said 1 more month of therapy. I was hoping this brace would reduce the pain as compared to my aircast and allow me to do more. I don't think that is the purpose of the brace (reducing pain when moving). To me it seems a mild way to brace up ankle and prevent rollovers--- Next time i would want something with a much tighter wrap around the ankle.
