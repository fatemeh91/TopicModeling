review/text: When I emailed Shaver Outlet about this, they replied:I am sorry for the confusion. We are a repair centrer and order many parts in bulk. The parts you received are the exact same parts as the packaged items but without the wasteful retail packaging.I would have preferred the "wasteful retail packaging" since it was shown in the picture. For all I know, they could have sent out refurbed crap. DON'T SHOW ONE THING AND SHIP ANOTHER!
