review/text: It was a good week to Test Drive a deodorant -- lots of stress at work and it was warm and muggy too! I'm pleased to report that Dry Idea Unscented Roll-On was up to the task! Although it lists ""fragrance"" as one of the ingredients, I couldn't detect any fragrance (I like that in an UNSCENTED deodorant). It didn't feel wet or sticky going on like some roll-ons; it also didn't sting after shaving. It kept me as dry as my regular stick deodorant. It may be a good value, but not being a regular user of this product, I can't tell how long it will last.
