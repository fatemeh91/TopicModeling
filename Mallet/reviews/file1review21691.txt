review/text: We had the Fisher Price whale tub for my baby, and as she started to get bigger and we removed the middle ledge in the tub she'd often slide down towards the water. Also, splashing got to be a bit messy on the counter top. I purchased this, and have used it for a few months - it's perfect! I've had to add some air to it once, but other than that I just rinse it out after each use. My 9 month old does not slip around in it at all. She likes to either lean back or sit in the middle and play. I wish we had started using it earlier. It's so nice not to have to fill up a whole bathtub with water, just for a tiny baby, too.
