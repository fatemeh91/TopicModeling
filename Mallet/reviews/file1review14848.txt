review/text: It did not taste like cake batter at all, maybe pancake mix at best. I really like their meal shakes though I had the berry, chocolate, and vanilla too. So sometimes I would do half and half to mix up the flavors. I didn't really like the berry either so I would mix the cake batter and the berry, made it better. The best is to mix the vanilla and chocolate. Those are good seperate too. Three stars because the ingredients in metrx shakes are great and filling.
