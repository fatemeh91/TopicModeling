review/text: Our son used the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty. But by 3 1/2 I realized we should have gotten him a potty seat & stool earlier! This seat does not require attachment to the toilet seat, it simply sits right on the seat. The have only one quibble; the adjustable fit dial does not seem to work well on out toilet's seat. That doesn't seem to be a major factor or problem as the seat fits snugly anyway. My son is able to place the seat himself which gives him greater confidence in being able to go potty by himself.While he was learning how to use the stool & potty, I went with him to the bathroom to be there in case there was a problem. Now, he has it down.
