review/text: Optimum Nutrition's products may often be overlooked by many due to its plain labeling, and a lack of crazy adjectives describing all the benefits you will get. But those who research supplements know that Optimum Nutrition makes only the highest quality products, and their whey protein really is the standard by which to judge all others. It is about as pure as you can get, and will easily and quickly be digested by your body post-workout. It tastes great to boot. This is NOT the protein I would recommend for overnight muscle building, as it is a quick digesting protein. For when resting it is recommended that you take a slow-digesting protein which will probably be a mix of soy, egg, and whey proteins. But for post-workout pure protein, without a lot cholesterol or extra unneeded calories, this is the BEST.
