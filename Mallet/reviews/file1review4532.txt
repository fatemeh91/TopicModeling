review/text: Oh Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor,Gleaming long and bright.Bring to the growth upon my faceYour buzzing, five-blade might!Your contours sleek and overformed,Your gripping action steady.Your shaving power manifold,T'would make a weak mind heady.What thoughtfulness lies 'neath your shine?You gleam like spaceship rubble!And with your "Future Now" design,You lay waste to my stubble!Too bad you lay waste also toThe skin beneath the hair.Now I bemoan the scabby strokesThat mar my visage fair.Purring like a happy tigerThat stalks its helpless prey,With your five and shining claws,My face you swiftly flay.Our first few dates were sweet as silk,Your touch was oh-so-gentle.But by date three you bit and chewed,You've proven tempermental.Oh, Fusion Razor, Fusion Razor,Why have you done me wrong?Although you're mighty, it's too badMy skin is not as strong.Why do I keep on giving youA chance to find redemption?What razor god hath granted theeSuch epiderm exemption?Oh, no more, no, my razor friend,Your doom is clearly writtenBy tributaries crimson redThat on my cheeks you've smitten.I wondered when I purchased you,Just what the "fusion" meant.Now I think it marks the meld'Twixt shaves and punishment."The leading edge of science!""The future is today!""The greatest shave technology!"Your advertisements say.Technology's not always good.Although it's what life's built on,It also causes wars and monsters(much like Paris Hilton).I need no buzzing, layered meshOf steel that swiftly flails.I think I'd rather shave myselfWith dull Lee Press-on-Nails.So, adieu, my Fusion Razor,Don't leave in dour depression.Take comfort in that tho' your banned,You still left an impression.
