review/text: This Oral-B Advantage toothbrush was very nice and worked very well. I'll purchase more for my family, since I liked it so much. I've used many different kinds of toothbrushes before, but this one really works quite well and also cleaned in between my teeth. It left my mouth feeling fresh!
