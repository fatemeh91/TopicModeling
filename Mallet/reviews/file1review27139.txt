review/text: If you Google "Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein" it won't take you long to find out that this stuff is one of the best bang-for-your-buck protein powders on the market. So the real question is, "How does it taste?" The cake batter flavor is OUTSTANDING... seriously tastes like yellow cake and makes my morning smoothies even better. I've been told all the other flavors are great as well, but I can definitely co-sign for CAKE BATTER.
