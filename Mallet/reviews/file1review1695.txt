review/text: I just received this product and I already see a difference in the texture of the skin on the bottom of my feet. I have only used it twice...but the dry skin is starting to crumble off. I am not saying that this is a miracle soap yet...I will have to see if my toenails improve. I would expect this to take a month or so. And I also bought it because I too am going through menopause and as one user stated, you sweat in places that you never did before. Especially good for underarm perspiration. The soap has a strong smell at first but it does subside. You will feel clean, clean,clean and totally refreshed. I am skeptical of reviews that state the toenail fungus disappeared in a week or so...but this soap so far is excellent as a body wash and foot soak. So for this I will rate it a 5 at this stage.
