review/text: This works great for cleaning my glasses, which always had difficult smudges, probably due to the AR coating. It comes with a sleeve that is very handy and keeps it from getting dirty/lost/unfolded in my briefcase. I will definitely order another (or two!) when this one wears out or gets lost.
