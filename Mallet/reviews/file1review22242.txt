review/text: These are the best and cheapest containers we have ever used, and they freeze very well and the food doesn't get that freezer smell even after months. Only problem is that these are so hard to find, Walmart used to be the only place where I could find them but I don't think they stock them any more, we are so glad we found them in Amazon.
