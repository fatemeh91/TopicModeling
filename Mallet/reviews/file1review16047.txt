review/text: I went to a Naturopathic Doctor when my Gynocologist couldn't help me with a female issue I was having. The Naturopathic Doctor recommended these vitamins and it helped clear up the issue I was having. Best of all, like the other review, I noticed my general health was better too. I can tell a big difference in my appetite, surprisingly, when I am taking the vitamins too. I took my bottle to Whole Foods to compare to all of their vitamins expecting to find a comparable one and NOTHING on their shelves even compared with the list of ingrediants that Meta Fem has. I have run out and am scolding myself because I feel more run down when I don't take them.
