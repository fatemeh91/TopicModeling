review/text: It's a beard and mustache trimmer. I use it to trim my beard and mustache, and it does so with great ease and effectiveness. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but that's just fine. I love the adjustable height of the cutting head. Very convenient and the charge lasts numerous trims. I've had it for a month or so now and still haven't had to charge it. I trim once a week so that's 4 trims and counting. The trim is simple and edgy and flat, just as I want it. You'll still need a razor blade to fine tune the edges though, as well as getting rid of unnecessary stubble.
