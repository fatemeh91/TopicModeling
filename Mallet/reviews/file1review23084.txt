review/text: At the time I purchased this sweeper, I just wanted it for little pickups every once in awhile. Right now, I am in the middle of re-doing my bathroom because the floor was giving way!! There has been a lot of traffic back and forth (using the saws, etc. outside) and walking back in. This little bissell picks up wood shavings and all the little "dust" from the bottom of shoes. I am very pleased with my purchase.
