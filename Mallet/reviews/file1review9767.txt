review/text: they were pretty cheaply priced so i figured id try them out because i like the tweezerman brand, they work great for the little strays when you do your eyebrows, also for me at least if you end up with an ingrown hair when you shave your legs, these make it very easy to remove, the tips are sharp enough to penetrate a couple layers of skin if they need to. only downside is, you gotta be careful they kinda bend easily
