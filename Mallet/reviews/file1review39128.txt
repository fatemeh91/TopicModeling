review/text: The first one lasted about 20 years. we figured its time for a new one.We are very pleased, just like the old one it trimmed my hair perfectly & removed some excess body hair perfectly.Since neither of us has a full head of hair, the extra pieces will just stay in the nice case.At this low price, it is a superb value, especially with the pruce of haircuts today.Thanks againSir Jay Harris---AKA ---sirbossmaN
