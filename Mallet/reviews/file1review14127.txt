review/text: I for one love the gel 171. I've tried both the lotion and gel but cannot get as close a shave with the lotion. Plue the shaver seems to drag on the face much more with the lotion 170. The gel is the way to go.I would like to buy the gel at the local stores but it is not sold there. The lotion is on all the shelves but no gel. The only way I could get the gel was through on-line delivery. Why is this? Confused on that marketing.
