review/text: I use quite a few Eneloop low-self-discharge batteries: AAs in my Canon S5 IS and some toys, AAAs in Harmony 659 and Dish remotes. I really like how these rechargeables keep the charge for very long time.These Sony low-self-discharge batteries were on sale, and I decided to give them a try because of the price. In my opinion, they are just as good as Eneloops.
