review/text: This was purchased as a gift for my father, who has Parkinson's Disease and was having trouble brushing his teeth. This item was a perfect gift, because the brush does all of the work, and his teeth are getting cleaner than before. I later ordered replacement heads, and now my mother shares the base and they are both able to use this to brush their teeth. It apparently wasn't too difficult to learn how to use, as my parents are both in their seventies and do not care for a lot of techno gadgets. As I was shopping for an electric toothbrush, the reviews on this model steered me toward it specifically because of its ease of use. It does need a spot to sit that is near an outlet for recharging. If you don't have adequate counter space, you will have to be a bit creative or flexible (or both) to make this work, but my folks are very pleased with how their teeth feel after using this brush. Initially, my mother said her gums bled a bit, but after a few days, that has stopped, indicating better gingival health! So, yes, when I am an empty nester and can utilize my counter space for this tool, I will purchase one, too! (Well, okay...maybe sooner.)As I shopped around for this item, I found the best price here at Amazon. It was definitely worth the amount of $$.
