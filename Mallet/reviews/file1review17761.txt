review/text: The trimmer seems to be good enough. However, I bought it about 6 months ago and the charger stopped working recently. I have tried to find a replacement for the charger only but neither amazon nor remington itself does seem to sell one. Without a charger, of course, the whole trimmer is pretty useless. If you read through the reviews you will also find others complaining about this very same problem. So if you buy it, you risk no longer to be able to use a perfectly well functioning trimmer due to this problem.
