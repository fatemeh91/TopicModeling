review/text: I at these for years and really liked the way they taste. Then I did some research and found out that much of their protein is from gelatin or collagen which is 100% worthless to humans for building/maintaining muscle because the amino acid is not good. Also lots of palm kernel oil in these which isn't too good for you. There are much better options out there. If you want something with better protein (but still has some palm kernel oil) and tastes great, try Metabolic Drive protein bars. If you are ok with eating something that is just ok tasting, then Zero Impact are by far the best bars out there. Great protein, healthy fats, low sugar, no sugar alcohols. I haven't found one bad thing about them. I just feel ripped off for the years I spent eating Balance Bars.
