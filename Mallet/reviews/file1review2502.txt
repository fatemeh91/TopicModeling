review/text: I used to use the "silk epil" braun epilator (similar item) for years, and I was looking for somthing new alike, when I found this satinelle epilator I was thrilled in a good way, not only about the very good price but also the quality, soft skin in the most delicate areas for weeks, is worth the pain (which decreases everytime, and you will get less hair everytime as well). GREAT DEAL, FORGET SHAVING!!!
