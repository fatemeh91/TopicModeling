review/text: I've broken off pieces of these and shared with fellow employees, and they usually want to know where I got them. When I'm really busy they can make do as a meal because (unlike a Snickers bar with 350 calories) they really stay with me. I didn't like the apple Zoe's bars and the chocolate peanut butter were really good, but these are just plain great. The soy crisps in it are almost like little peanuts and the chocolate flavor is very intense. They are just fantastic with a good cup of coffee or an espresso.
