review/text: I regret buying this vacuum. The pet hair attachment was clunky to use, very difficult to move across the surface of our couches in the first place, and then it got clogged with pet hair almost immediately and stopped working (the attachment stopped spinning, vacuum still works). I went in and unclogged it once only to have it stop working again a few minutes into cleaning. I don't know what I am going to use this for now as it's not a very convenient handheld vacuum with no rechargeable battery power option so it must be plugged in, which makes it difficult to use to spot clean around the house.
