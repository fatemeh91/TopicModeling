review/text: I bought a 'Hummingbird' many years ago. Outside of the ocassional battery change, this product was swellThey, about two months ago, it stopped working. I cleaned it, thoroughly and replaced the battery. Still no dice! Not bad after ten years of service! The search began for a replacement, but not even Oral-b had them!I took a shot at Amazon (after al, Amazon has everything) and found it!I know I've only had it a month, but so farm,so good!
