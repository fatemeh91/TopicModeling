review/text: There can be a slight burn or warming sensation putting this on, mostly after shaving. But 3 sprays under each arm will last me all day - mowing the lawn, running errands, playing with the kids or sitting on the couch. I'm as fresh at night as I am when I first put it on, without a heavy perfume smell.
