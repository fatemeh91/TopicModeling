review/text: Received my table within 3 days on regular shipping. The quality of the table is better than any I have looked at and I shopped around for awhile. The table is very lightweight (I have the 30-inch) because of the special table bed which is not plywood...it is a nylon mesh, Combined with the aluminum table frame, it is very light and easy to handle. The mesh gives excellent support as well as a different feel since you are not pushing down on foam over plywood. I could sleep comfortably on this table. The legs are a very nicely finished soft-tone wood. The table is very sturdy.The upholstery is very soft and has piping around the top edge which makes it look like a piece of furniture since the upholstery isn't just a single piece of vinyl which is stretched over the padding. It actually looks and feels like leather. Also top-layer padded with memory foam giving it a nice feel. The head rest is easily attached and had an easy to adjust tilt mechanism. Attachments store easily and neatly under the table both in the open and the folded positions. The carrying case was an excellent quality with heavy duty zippers, hard bottom, and plenty of side compartments and handles making it easy to maneuver and store extras such as sheets and oils. Shipping was free and the table had a $50 rebate making it an even better deal. Wish I could give it more stars. I haven't used the heat feature yet but so far I LOVE THIS TABLE!!
