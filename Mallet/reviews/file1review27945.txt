review/text: I began to weight lift with a friend not too long ago simply to bulk up. I searched online, all of them will surely mention Optimum Nutrition Whey on their top choices. Considering the price is only about $5 more than other brands, I decided to give it a shot.I picked the coffee taste since it is an easier flavor to be blended into milk, soy milk or even water. With a mixer cup and some vigorous shaking, the powder dissolves quite well. To me, the taste is better than the usual chocolate or strawberry flabors.I managed to gain 5 pounds in the first 2 weeks of lifting (3 days per week, about one hour each session). However, that's just me, YMMV.
