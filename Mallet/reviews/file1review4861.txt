review/text: Anyone, like me, who has used Lavilin for decades....do not be fooled by the photo (as I was) into thinking this is the old formulation (That seems to be gone for good)or the 1/2 ounce quantity Foot Smart is advertising here. It is the same .44 ounce quantity and the new formulation that several other vendors are selling for less. The new formulation, for me, does not work as well. But still fairly well. I would give the deoderant itself 3.5 or 4 stars ( the old formulation was a 5 for sure), but downgraded the rating here because of what seems to me to be false advertising by this seller.
