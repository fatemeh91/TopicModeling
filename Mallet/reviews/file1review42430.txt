review/text: I have a young horse that is very "emotional". He is the bottom of the pecking order in the pasture and worries a lot. He would take forever to eat! I tried so many kinds of weight gaining grain but nothing worked. We were worried we would have a visit from "animal patrol" because he looked so bad. You could see all his ribs. After trying everything to put weight on we tried this product. He is now ROUND!!!! He loves this product SO much! I dissolve it in hot water and pour over his grain. He eats in a few minutes like the others.I've been able to cut back on the expensive weight gaining grain to mix with pellets that I feed the other horses. His weight has been stable. This product has truly changed him!! It's SO worth it!!!
