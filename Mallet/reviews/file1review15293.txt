review/text: I loved the flavor of the bars!!! I really didn't expect them to be as good as they are!!! I have had other nutritional bars that tasted really nasty. I'd buy the Balance Bars again, and plan on doing so. Even my children liked them! The bars gave me energy when I ate them in the late afternoon. They were a real pick-me-up! I'd recommend this product to a friend in a heartbeat. It's nice to know you can buy a nutritional bar that tastes good and seems more like a snack!
