review/text: As my princess loves raspberries, I figured this would be an ideal gift.Alas, her over-enthusiastic use of this product did not produce the expected result - the cheesecake didn't taste of raspberries.Worse, we both felt a little hot and bothered afterwards and needed a long, cold shower to recover.
