review/text: I am not sure why Remington and other companies find it so hard to make a good shaver. This model feels cheap and plasticky and it acts like one. If you want a really fine grain, it'll be tough to obtain. Areas on my neck look like someone clutched hair and randomly pulled it out. I have patches of skin and hair. The shaver works better on the cheeks, but fails around the chin. I bought a newer model, with touchscreen and USB charging no less, and it fares worse than this. Everything is flimsy. I would invest in more $$ and get a Philips or something. I am done with Remington.
