review/text: I first bought this for rashes I was getting on top of my feet. Don't know what it was but it was not athletes foot. It itched and was terribly red from all the scratching. I bought this product having no idea if it would work,but thought i'd give it a try since I tried everything else. From the very first time I used it, It felt so cooling and refreshing on my skin. After about 2 weeks of using this product, once in the morning, and once at night, my rash completely disappeared. My husband used it for heat rash he was getting between the legs. It took care of that in no time. A little goes a long way. I find the scent to be invigorating. We live in Florida, and sometimes after a long hard day outdoors we will use the funga soap as a complete body wash. How refreshing. This is honestly the best soap I've ever used. It's not oily or greasy on your skin, and washes right off in a matter of seconds, leaving your skin feeling completely revitalized.
