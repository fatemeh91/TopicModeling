review/text: I have a gym membership but since getting pregnant I quit the germy-gym and decided to pursue my yoga at home. This kit for under 25$ including the blocks and strap was a value for money. The mat is not super thick,but that works for me since I workout on a carpeted floor. The mat does not smell too rubbery as mentioned earlier. The blocks have a slight smell but i guess with use it will go away. Not offensive smell, something you can live with.I would recommend this anytime!
