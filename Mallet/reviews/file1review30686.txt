review/text: This razor is amazing. I have been using Mach 3's the majority of my shaving lifetime and recently switched to this razor and there is a big difference. After just three shaves the skin on my neck is in much better condition then when using the Mach 3. I no longer have any razor bumps which makes shaving easier every time. This razor also has a much closer shave and leaves a smoother finish. If you can handle the very small learning curve then this razor is for you!
