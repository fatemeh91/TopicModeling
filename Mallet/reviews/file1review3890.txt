review/text: After 3 days I did notice a difference. However, thinking my teeth were going to continue to get whiter over the next couple days, but they did not. I was expecting way more. I feel like my teeth are already almost back to their normal color and it's only been a few weeks and I am not a smoker/ wine drinker. Next time I want to whiten my teeth I think I'll just save me time and go to the dentist to have them done.
