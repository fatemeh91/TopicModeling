review/text: Had a really bad case of jock itch (like couldn't sleep at night) and wanted to attack the itch from multiple solutions. This paired with Lotrimin Ultra and after two weeks, no more itches. The smell is tea tree. I don't think it smells awful, more medicinal. Kinda pricey but when it itches down there, this is well worth it.
