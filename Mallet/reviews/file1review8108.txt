review/text: Whenever I buy something from Amazon that costs 2, 3 or even 10 bucks, I wonder why would anyone rate it. But what the heck, the OXO squeegee works great in the shower. It's just the right width for the different width panels, and does what a squeegee should do: it squiges. It leaves the glass dry.So why not 5 stars? Because the bulbous handle is not as ergonomic as most OXO products. It's too bulbous, and if the grip/handle is a little too big for a man, how difficult would it be for a woman's smaller hand? I suppose I should ask my wife...
