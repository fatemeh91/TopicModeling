review/text: Typical of the evolution of Braun products,the Triumph professsional is the best toothbrush yet developed by Braun. The timing features are not new but the types of brushing and cleaning features are a welcome development. The brush head is not the standard type of brush. It incorporates small cleaning pads that leave your teeth clean and gums refreshed. It also comes with an extra brush for future use or for a family member. I'm sure that Braun will always improve its products but this is the best yet.
