review/text: Body Back BuddyI purchased the Body Back Buddy from Amazon especially for my wife because she has fibromialgia and a lot of trigger points in her back that she can't reach to ease her pain. she says it works great and loves it and since i don't have to wear out my fingers pressing on her sore spots i love it too.
