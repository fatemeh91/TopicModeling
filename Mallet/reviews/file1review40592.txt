review/text: I am on my second bottle of Wave Dishwasher Gel and it has worked very well for us. The dishes are clean and the glasses sparkle. When I used the name brand products, I would have to replace my glasses because they were etched (cloudy). I couldn't find this gel at Costco today so I will order from Amazon.
