review/text: The idea is a good one, however if your child is used to a different type of pacifier then chances are he/she will not take it. When speaking to other moms we all agree, it depends on your child. The product is inexpensive. I reccomend buying the product and trying it because if it works on your baby it is a lifesaver. My son was born 4 weeks early and his immune system was not great. He was sick very often in his first few months and this pacifier made things a little easier. For the money, it's worth a try!
