review/text: Got this sweeper to use for quick, small pickups when getting the vacuum cleaner out and plugging it up would be too much hassle. It is better quality than a previous sweeper I used to own since the handles now screw into each other. I no longer have to worry about the handle falling apart. Does it work as well as a vacuum? No, but it isn't intended to. It was created for a certain purpose and does a good job.
