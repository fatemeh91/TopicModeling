review/text: These are some of the best compilation of herbs I've ever seen. I found them at my organic food store and then bought it for much cheaper on amazon. The only problem (that doesn't bother me) is that you either need to take 3 tablets (kind of large) or 4 capsules (smaller). I didn't like that the capsules have 2 grams of protein, of which the manufacturer was unable to tell me which kind, so I'm sticking with the capsules
