review/text: We ran out of these recently and I used a few standard tall kitchen trash bags. They work, but don't fit nearly as neatly in the simplehuman trash cans as these bags. Ordered a whole bunch so I won't run out again anytime soon. You can probably see it in the picture, but these are the "J" size bag, wish that was in the title because these were hard to find.
