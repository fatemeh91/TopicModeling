review/text: This is the best whey protein you can buy. It is top quality, it has BCAAs for post-workout recovery, glutamine-it's all there. Just take a scoop after lifting weights and in the morning for some added protein. The taste is also super great. I like banana cream the best, but strawberry banana is good as well. It goes great in shakes. My special recipe: about 4-5 oz milk, one scoop of this, some nonfat yogurt (I like to use Greek), some oatmeal (try it!), some flax seed (very healthy), some frozen fruit, two egg whites, and a splash of pomegranite juice. It tastes amazing and is very healthy and packed with protein.
