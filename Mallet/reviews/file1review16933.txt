review/text: After a couple of years of Braun, I was ready to switch back to Norelco. I picked this shaver because of the deep discount, figuring that the Personal Comfort Setting gismo was just a marketing ploy. But I find I really do like it. At the "sensitive" setting, I am able to shave with a very light touch, an experience I prefer to the "normal" setting. And I like the Norelco MUCH better than the Braun.
