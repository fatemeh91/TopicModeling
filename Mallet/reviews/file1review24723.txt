review/text: Since I also ordered a traveling "tractor" type sprinkler that I absolutely love, this sprinkler doesn't get as much use as I had expected it to. It does a good job of what it is meant to accomplish. It works as it is supposed to. It was a little perplexing to figure out the settings, but once I did, it is easy to set it to water the area desired.
