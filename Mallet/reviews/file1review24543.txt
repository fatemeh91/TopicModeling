review/text: I was recently introduced to Numi Tea, and I had such a great experience I kept trying new flavors. Their tea actually tasted like the advertisement, which has never happened before. The lemon green tea tasted like someone actually squeezed real lemon in my cup. There was a toasted rice green tea that made me feel like I was in my mom's kitchen eating the crispy rice on the bottom of the pan. My husband and I are now addicted to the honeybush, which is perfect for nighttime. Great experience so far.
