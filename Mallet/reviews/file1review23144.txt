review/text: I have dark carpet and a white cat so I need to vacuum the fur from the carpet daily. It's a chore to get out the large vacuum cleaner so I thought I would get this for quick jobs. It does a very good job of picking up the fur and lint and does not require electricity. It must be emptied frequently or it will stop working properly. I have not had one incident with the handle coming apart because I read the instructions before putting it together. This sweeper does not replace the traditional vaccuum, but for a quick clean-up it does an excellent job.
