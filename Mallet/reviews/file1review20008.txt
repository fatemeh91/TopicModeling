review/text: This tub is fabulous! We love that it is just as simple as can be...no bells and whistles...just a great sturdy tub. It folds up so as not to take up much room when stored, has an opening in the bottom to drain water out, fits great in the kitchen sink and holds baby in a great position for bathing. We use it with one of those yellow bear spongy thingies, and baby is supported, semi-reclined and very, very comfy!Worth every penny!
