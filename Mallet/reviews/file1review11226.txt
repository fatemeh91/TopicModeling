review/text: I thought this was really cool at first. Used it about 10-15 times and it stopped working. Got it for $10 at Target. Wish I could take it back. I do like the light-up features, the soft stick that goes in your mouth, and the large read-out. If only it lasted longer. Could be the battery, but most of my batteries for any thermometer I've ever bought have lasted several years before needing to be changed...even after being really sick for months and having to take my temp several times daily ...so either way, that's a major inconvenience. I also felt like my other thermometer was more accurate...I would get several different readings with this one. It boasts 8 seconds and while it is WAY faster than my old thermometer, it's not 8 seconds.
