review/text: I owned an Epilady before, which worked well for 10 years. I thought I should replace it with a more recent product. After a lot of research, I bought this one. It works very well, especially on very small hair. It hurts much less than my old Epilady and cleaning is much easier. I recommend it over the Epilady, especially since it is much cheaper. I haven't used the shaver option, since you don't need to shave anymore after using the epilator(Your hair gets more and more finer and you will use it less often).I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, since it took Amazon 1 month to send it to me:(
