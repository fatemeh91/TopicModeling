review/text: I bought my Canon camera without thinking about batteries. Well that thing EATS alkaline AA batteries for breakfast. In one night I can go through 2 pairs of alkaline batteries. Not to mention the flash takes 10+ seconds to recharge.Well after getting the duracell NiMh batteries I am happy with the camera once again. Flash charging is quick and a charge lasts a couple days of average use. Not to mention the money I'm saving from not buying alkalines all the time.
