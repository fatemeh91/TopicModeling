review/text: I have been using pretty consistently for a few weeks now, but there seemed to be quite a bit of hype with this product that I am not sure of. How long does it take to make a huge difference? I mix one scoop with a banana, other fruit, almond milk, and ice. Really doesn't taste too bad that way. I would just like to see a difference before I try to reorder it.
