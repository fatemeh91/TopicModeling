review/text: I usually use an electric razor because I can't see well without my glasses in the shower. I first tried this dry, as usual, and found it scratchy and very ineffective. It barely took anything off. I tried it in the shower with soap, and it worked wonderfully. If you're looking for a dry razor, you'd be much happier with Remington Smooth and Silky, but my last one didn't last very long, so I tried this instead.
