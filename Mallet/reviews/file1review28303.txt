review/text: I have to say, Optimum makes a pretty good protein. The taste is fairly good, and from what I can tell it is fairly competitive with protein per serving. The only thing that put me off about it is that it always gave me a mild stomachache when I took it. I kept taking it anyway because I didn't want it to go to waste. Recently, I had a friend who is pretty much a supplement guru tell inform me that they use coffee creamer as one of their ingredients! I immediately know what was giving me the upset stomach. I don't know if they are trying to cut corners or what, but a least for me this was a deal breaker.
