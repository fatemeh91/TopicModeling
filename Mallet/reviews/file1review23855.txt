review/text: I purchased these Microflex Supreno SE nitrile gloves since they were slightly cheaper than the Kimberly Clark version and seemed to be comparable in material and thickness. I just wear these gloves around the house for cleaning, home improvement projects and weeding outside, tasks that I consider somewhat standard and not extreme, by any means. These gloves get holes in the fingers easily and tear easily (the top of the finger will come off, for example). I am almost through the whole box and the holes/tears are frequent. I often need to stop my task and replace a glove. If I were working on hazardous tasks, this could be a very serious issue, but it is still really unacceptable performance to me. I wear the Kimberly Clark purple nitrile exam gloves routinely at work (chemical/laboratory) and have also tried them for the same tasks mentioned above at home. The KC gloves have never failed me - no issues with holes, etc. I have been dissatisfied with the Supreno SE nitrile performance and definitely will not repurchase - I will instead purchase the KC version, even if they cost slightly more.On a side note, I have also purchased the Microflex SafeGrip gloves (much thicker) and have not had any issues with those. They are much thicker and are designed to resist needle punctures.
