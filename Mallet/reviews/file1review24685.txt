review/text: This new "Lemon Fresh" Comet doesn't hold a candle to the original Comet. It doesn't clean scratches from the kitchen sink, for instance, without a LOT elbow grease. I don't believe the formula is the same as the Comet that comes in the green can. The new closeable lid doesn't work. When you close it the accumulated powder poofs out into the air. I prefer the old tape that you placed over the holes in the can when you were finished. My Safeway Store is no longer carrying the original Comet in the green container. What's up?
