review/text: I ordered this after the frustration of nursing school, they use Littmans. Which are SUPPOSED to be the Ferrari of stethoscopes, but I couldn't hear a thing with them! I know I am not deaf, but I needed something that was more sensitive. Of course I am attracted to girly things, so I ended up ordering the Red-heart stethoscope. I have to say I am NOT disappointed with this. Vitals sounds are sharp and clear. Also, I have gotten a lot of compliments with this! It's fashion-forward and functional. So all around I would highly recommend this product!
