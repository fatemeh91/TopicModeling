review/text: These help my feet feel good.I have a bone spur and feet over 60 years old. I follow a large dog for at least a mile each day - in the desert - rough terrain - rocks and brittle brush and holes and washes. I have a pair of these in my hiking boots, two pair for each set of daily sneakers, and a pair that I move among my low high heels. For each pair, for the first wearing I placed the inserts one at a time in a pot of boiling water for 7 minutes each. (The water turns green from the dye but the bottoms of the orthotics do not melt.) When I take the insert out of the boiling water, I press it very briefly with an old towel (green dye - remember) to blot up the hot water and then immediately put it in the shoe, put the shoe on, and stand for about a minute, then walk around for about five minutes while the pad conforms to both my foot and my shoe. (This is roughly the same procedure, I followed in the doctor's office as I was fitted for a $75.00 pair of orthotics there.) I have on the type of socks I will normally be wearing with each pair of shoes as I do this.Each insert softens just enough to adjust to my foot. It does not melt the insert. The insert is warm but not hot as I stand on it for the first time in my shoe. (I think the pad keeps the heat from transferring.) Funny enough, the green dye does not transfer to my socks then or later as I use these inserts.The pad on this insert keeps my feet comfortable when wearing my shoes throughout the day and evening. The inserts from my doctor's office do not have any pad on top and bother my feet after 4 or 5 hours.I have been using these inserts for nearly a year. They help my feet feel good.
