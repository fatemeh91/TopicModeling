review/text: When I read the spec, it sounded like it can do a lot. After I got this product, it took me a while to try to figure out how to work it. Then I realized that it is not that accurate. I was hoping that this can also measure the body fat. When I went for the check up, the reading I got from the scale vs. the manual thing that was used to measure (sqeeue your flesh to go through that gadget) is too big a difference. Now, I do not trust that feature. So, the 3 star is for the scale itself, not to the boby fat measure side. Again, I can buy a scale for less than what I paid for. The design is okay.
