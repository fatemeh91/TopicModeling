review/text: I tried the Earth Friendly Powder first, and that did not clean well, in addition to clumping up and being left in the dishwasher after it ran. But the Gel works fine for me. Not as good as, say, "Cascade Complete", but Cascade has phosphates. It does require rinsing the dishes and a good dishwasher.
