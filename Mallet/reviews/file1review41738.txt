review/text: The toothbrush is great. The only thing I'd change is to move the mode selection button. I sometimes bump it while brushing. That and I'd leave off the gentle mode completely. It seems worthless to me. Once you've gotten used to this, a regular brush just doesn't feel like it's doing anything anymore.
