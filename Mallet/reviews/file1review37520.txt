review/text: I got this item shipped to my home fast, then I found out the tools used to assemble it were missing. The customer service was quick on handling to ship me the required tools. However, after a couple of weeks of waiting, the tools arrived to me and I found out that was not the exact tools for this model (I did give her the model of the massage chair)... I can barely assemble this massage chair together with missing bolts etc... I actually tried to sit on it and discovered that the massage roller couldn't reach my lower back even when select to use "Lower Back" setting... And my lower back pain is the part bothers me more...
