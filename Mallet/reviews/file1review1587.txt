review/text: You certainly can't beat the price. I've tried several over the counter freezing products, several patches, and several liquids. Nothing worked on a wart I've had for 20 years, but this did. I assume that is due to two factors: (1) the salicylic acid is 40% which is much higher than patches or liquids, (2) The waxy nature of the delivery system keeps good contact with the wart. Because the product is delivered as a fairly wide wax stick like a lipstick tube, it was too wide and unwieldy to use the applicator, so I scooped a very small amount with a tiny screw-driver that I have and put it on the center of the wart and then covered it with a bandaid. In a few days the wart was dead and gone.
