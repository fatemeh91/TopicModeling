review/text: I skeptically purchased my Intuition razor about 2 months ago on a buying binge to find a halfway decent way to shave my legs. Amazingly, after trying Veet, the Venus, and even the Mach 3 mens razor, this was my favorite. The blades offer a close comfratable shave, and you really only need water.My only complaint lies with the need to be careful when using it. Do not get carried away and press too hard. It only takes a smooth glide but if you press too much, the soap/conditioner part breaks off.Otherwise, this is a wonderful system.
