review/text: I have been using the Sonicare Elite for a couple of years, but have also noticed the raving reviews on this Oral B product, so I decide to try it out. It is just like the polisher at the dentist's office, and I want to love it, except for two things: I have a very small mouth, and I also have a couple of sentitive teeth that no dentist or specialist can do anything about.To solve the first problem, I trim back the brush head by 1/3; but my second problem is not easy to solve. The vibrations must have aggrevated my sensitive teeth, so as much as I believe this is a very good toothbrush, I have to give up and go back to my Sonicare, and now my teeth are back to normal.I have given the Oral B as X'mas presents to some relatives. One absolutely loves it, and says after 1 week of brushing, someone has noticed that her teeth are actually whiter. But a couple of others are not as impressed, because they normally spend at least 5 minutes to brush their teeth, so the recommended 2 minutes are totally inadequate for them to do their job, and they don't feel clean without adding more time. But other than that, they still find the Oral B a good equipment.
