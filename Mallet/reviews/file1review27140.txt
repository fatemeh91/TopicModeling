review/text: This is my second 5 lb tub of Chocolate Malt. It's delicious (and nutritious!). I am a woman who lifts fairly regularly and recommend this to anyone. I also enjoyed White Chocolate flavor, but not as much. Double chocolate was ehhhhh. They're all good with milk, but this one works with water just fine (saving the calories).
