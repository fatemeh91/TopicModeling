review/text: Echinacea works for me. It's not some kind of silver bullet, but it definitely helps me when I'm catching a cold or recovering from one. I used this product at the optimal time as instructed, and I believe it helped. In one instance I did come down with a cold, the typical kind that doesn't stop you from going to work but makes you miserable all day. However, I don't expect echinacea to prevent colds in the same way that vaccinations prevent certain illnesses.Some people swear that echinacea doesn't help them. I believe it helps me and I think it's a kind of wonder herb. This product seems to have a good dosage of quality echinacea so I recommend it for those that benefit from this herb.
