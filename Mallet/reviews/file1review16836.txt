review/text: I was almost certain this would taste like a piece of medium-density fibreboard, but the Black Cherry Almond flavor is not terribly bad. Made with oats and soybeans, you can count on a little strain on your jaw to digest it, but the organic brown syrup softens the bar quite a bit. I tried the one-ounce bar that came in a sample packet from Amazon, which was the perfect quantity for me, but I notice the standard size is 2.5 ounces. This may be a case where less is more since the flavor satisfaction quickly dissipates after the first bite. The larger bar would mean it is 250 calories of which 45 are from fat, so it's not a diet bar. Rather, it's most specifically for those who are already burning fat efficiently and increasing their metabolism. Given the graphic of the effortless rock climber on the package, I am guessing couch potatoes will find less to be excited about here since the tagline is "nutrition for sustained energy". I guess it's back to the Kit-Kats for the rest of us.
