review/text: I was looking for an alternative to toxic deodorants, and decided to try Aubrey Organics -E Plus High C Roll On, per the suggestion of a sales clerk at a local natural supplement store. Made with (potentially) great ingredients like aloe leaf juice, grapefruit extract, lavender, and calamine and rose water, it sounded safe enough. What I didn't realize was how messy this would be, that it would smell awful and completely burn my skin (after shaving). It does work against bad BO (Body Odor), but, that is about all. I really wish I could give this a higher rating. It is just challenging to to find an effective deodorant made without aluminum, triclosan or other harsh ingredients.The search continues....
