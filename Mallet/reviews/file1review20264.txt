review/text: I bought these for use as burp cloths with my first three children, the last in 2007. They were fantastic. After the boys outgrew the need for burp cloths, they still liked to sleep with them, they were so soft.I recently bought another package in anticipation of our 4th baby, and I could not be more disappointed. They are 2/3 the size of the originals. The edges are serged - and not very carefully - instead of finished. The fabric is rough, even after washing. I have searched for a better alternative with no luck.I don't know what caused Gerber to alter the quality of their product, but I am one very disappointed customer. I will not be recommending them to anyone.
