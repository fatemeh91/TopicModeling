review/text: This tub would not be my choice to use at home. I bought it to use when travelling and so far it has worked well. I place it in bathtub or shower. My child is 4 months and did not hate this tub ( judging by the lack of screams). There is enough water to keep the baby partially covered and warm. The baby did roll a bit from side to side, so I had a keep a hand on the baby at all times. But for a quick bath, the tub worked fine. It folded quite easily. I did not have a problem with fingers getting caught in the folding mechanism. The tub also dries pretty quickly. The price was great too ( I bought it at Walmart for half the price it sells for on Amazon.
