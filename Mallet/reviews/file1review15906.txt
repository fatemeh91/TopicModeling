review/text: I'm only in my second trimester and have had a ton on sciatic pain. It amazes me how much this helps. It really did lift the pain off the nerve. I originally got it for other back pain which it helped with as well. I wore it to my Obgyn appointment and my doctor was very impressed with it and asked me where I got it. He said it was one of the better ones he's seen.
