review/text: I have an Australian Sheperd that molts every spring and fall. I needed something small to get the excess hair and debris without having to drag out the giant vacuum every day. This works great! I use it carpet, tile, wood, and throw rugs. It picks up tons of hair and dirt. It does not do corners and you have to push it forward enough to allow the rollers to go through full cycle. Not a problem with the handle of you follow the included directions. Great buy!
