review/text: i love herbal concepts products. i have the neck wrap and jsut received this one for the back. as someone else mentioned, the back one can be used on the stomach for cramping, but on other body parts as well: i like to use it on my knees and quads after a jog to relieve soreness.as for the seams not being sewn the whole length, i think that is on purpose. it lets you slide the beads around in the inside to distribute the heat evenly.the scent is delightful, too.
