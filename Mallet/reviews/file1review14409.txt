review/text: Do not buy this product. It made me, and the 3 other people I was with, sick. We used it exactly as directed, and within half an hour we were all nauseous. We had to wash it off as quickly as possible to stop from being sick before we even set foot on the boat!I am not 100% sure what made us sick. It may have been the extremely over power odor or the oil soaking into our systems and actually messing with our equilibrium. I believe it was probably a combination of both, because while I did feel better after washing it off, I did not feel very good the rest of the day. Needless to say, I threw it out that evening.
