review/text: I was disappointed with the mat quality. I used it on a wooden floor in my living room and the mat seemed to slip a little and the thickness of the mat just wasnt there. I used the mat for diff purposes apart from Yoga (like Push ups) and one cant rest ones palms on the mat for long (especially once they are a little sweaty in the middle of the workout) as the mat doest provide a very good grip.Okayish for its price, I would recommend you put in $10-15 more and research for a better product.
