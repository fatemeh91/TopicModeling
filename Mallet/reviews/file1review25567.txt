review/text: Well-designed tool that works so much better than "safety" manicure scissors. Really keeps things tidy. I wish that everything in the world was this well-designed. This would also make a nice little stocking stuffing for the holidays, something small but thoughtful.Face the fact that you just don't *need* hair growing out of your ears or nostrils. Comes with age, but it's gross. This is EASILY the best way to keep yourself nice and neat!
