review/text: I have become tired of shaving my legs every other day! I began looking around for a solution to my problem and ran across this Braun Epilator. I started reading the reviews and was suprised to read so many that spoke so highly of this product. I decided to go for it. The evening that it arrived I sat down and read through the instructions, turned it on, and began running it over my leg. OUCH! It is kind of a firey feeling. Slowly and painfully I covered most of my legs....they didn't feel quite smooth, but after reading the other reviews I knew it may take more than just one try. I let a couple of days pass and tried again-not so painful this time-definitely tolerable-and I was begining to feel smoother. I have owned the epilator for about a month now and I am very pleased. I really isn't painful anymore....hair growth is so sparce. I try to make a pass over my legs every 3 or 4 days just to catch the few that are growing in. If you are ever in need to have super super smooth legs then you can simply shave them and they will stay feeling super soft for 2 or 3 days and then you can return back to epilating. I am glad that I purchased this item...while it won't stop me from shaving completely it will definately reduce the amount I do. Like I said, the first time is very uncomfortable-I would recommend taking some tylenol or ibuprofen about an hour before you plan to start...bite your lip and do it, it will be worth it in the long run.
