review/text: Until I tried Fusion catridges, I got decent shaves but not great. I was always cutting myself atleast once a week, especially on my chin. Now, I get the smooth shaves and I never cut myself. I also think the shaves are closest to the skin that is possible for me. Razors today are vastly superior to razors twenty years ago. I grew a beard for two years to avoid shaving. It seems every 2-3 years, a new shaving product comes out that is much better. I think Fusion is that product. I like the power option as it seems my shaves are faster but maybe it is psychological. I like shaving now because of Fusion.
