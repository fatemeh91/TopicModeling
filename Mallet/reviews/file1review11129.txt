review/text: This was indeed my first vibrator. At first, it gave great service: the size and power were both just right. It has a rotating switch for setting the speed, and its highest speed is intense, but not too powerful. The silicone ring is interesting; a definite nice "twist."However, after a few uses, we started to have problems with it. The screw that held the swivel switch kept loosening, which made the vibrator unreliable. In an attempt to stop the screw from loosening, we tried to tighten it good. But, this resulted in the plastic breaking around the screw, apparently silencing the thing for good. Recently, though, having purchased a similar vibrator, I found that I could swap its cap onto this one, bringing it right back to life for me!I am quite glad to have this vibrator back, and am glad that I kept it. So overall, I do recommend this vibrator, but I do suggest that if the screw in the switch comes loose, that you take it out, and then reinsert it with a dab of glue to lock it in.(Review of My First Stick Battery Back, Scalp and Body Massager Blue)
