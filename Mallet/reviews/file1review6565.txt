review/text: I left a previous review for this item saying how I received the item with no directions and just wrapped in a piece of paper..the company contacted me a few days later about rectifying the problem and that the instructions would be sent out promptly. They further said they would credit me a percentage for my troubles and also asked if I would remove the negative review. So, I did. Guess what??? Still no instructions sent to me and, no credit on my account....sorry but that is bad business. I would think twice about ever dealing with this company again!..as for the product, can't really tell you how it works...don't want to use it improperly and cause more damage then what already exists...
