review/text: I've been using the pills for a few weeks now. Along with diet and exercise I've gone from 165 to 154 on zantrex 3. I haven't had any side effects, but that's because these are caffeine pills... And I use to drink 4 cups of coffee each morning. My body is used to a caffeine overload. These pills made me feel great, and I can go to the gym for hours at a time! I understand some people are getting harsh side effects, but the key is to take what you can handle. The first time you try caffeinated coffe, you don't drink a pot, that would mess your body up and make you feel sick. The people who experienced harsh effects right away needed to look into the product a little more and start out slow. Also, taking ANY pills on an empty stomach is never a good thing. Taking Tylenol or Advil alone can give you stomach aches.I am very satisfied with this product, and have never experienced any issues, and I take the maximum dosage per day. Zantrex isn't for everyone, but I'd your body has no problem handling caffeine, I highly recommend it.
