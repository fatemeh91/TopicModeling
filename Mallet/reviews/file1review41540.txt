review/text: I'm not the most thorough or articulated tooth brusher. I admit. But after this thing, i have no choice, before work, before sleep, i love it. It works well and makes easy usage for those new to electric brushes like i was. Very pleasently surprised.Cleanliness is no longer an issue. I can see myself going to the dentist next time and having him say, "What are you doing here". I can literally see the difference.Not too many people have mentioned this, but you do have to buy the polish heads seperate. That was sorta unexpected. Especially at this price range. But three heads which will last a whole year are $16. so i can't complaing. Very good system thus far.
