review/text: The SF-3, which has a single-head cutter, is OK for light beards, but not for heavy or 2-day beards, and I found the trimmer to be almost useless for cutting longer hairs. The older models ,eg, SM3 2700, have a 3-head cutter and a 2-position trimmer that could be used by itself for sideburns and longer stray hairs, or in conjunction with the cutter, which is very effective in shaving, say, a heavy beard or a beard of 2 days growth. Of course, the older models are more expensive to manufacture. It is unfortunate that corporations are willing to make inferior products to maximize profits. Such is life in a faltering economy...
