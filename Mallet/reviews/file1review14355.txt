review/text: My allergist suggested that I cover my new mattress with plastic to cut down on allergens and I wasn't happy - didn't want to hear "crinkle crinkle" every time I moved (or feel like a 5-year-old with a nighttime problem). This cover is vinyl and I can roll across the bed never hear it. Also as long as you have a mattress pad on top of it it doesn't make you hot while you sleep. I highly recommend it, especially if you have allergies.
