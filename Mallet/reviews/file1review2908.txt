review/text: These vitamins made me feel like a new person. After struggling with the ill-effects of taking "normal" multivitamins on an empty stomach (almost instant nausea and vomiting) and questioning how much good they were really doing, it was recommended that I try a whole food vitamin. I balked at the price, but decided that if they helped with my fatigue, poor skin and hair, it would be worth it. I noticed a difference after a week. My energy level picked up, I could take them on an empty stomach with no nausea, and I stopped getting cravings that previously resulted in poor eating choices. Within a month, I noticed a difference in my skin, nails and hair. I recommended these to my mother-in-law, who had a similar experience, and now also uses the Un-Stress formula when she feels the need. We both swear by Megafood vitamins!
