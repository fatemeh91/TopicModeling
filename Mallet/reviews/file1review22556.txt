review/text: I don't know about the other women who have reviewed this product but I knew what they had to say was slightly overdone. Sure the product does smell like rubber/latex. That's why you wash it off first. (plus. what is a condom made of? ;p). The picture does make the penis bigger than it is in person. That I agree on but - It isn't a bad thing. I'm not trying to turn my vagina into a garbage bag. This product is PERFECT for hitting/rubbing your g-spot. if you are looking to feel it go deep inside of you ramming your insides - this isn't the product for you. Also the blue latex keeps the vibrator cool and not hot if you keep it on longer than 30 minutes (we are all guilty ;p). - June 2, 2012_______________________________________________________7/9/2012I promised I would review again after future use. It is been almost 2 months since I purchased this item and I have highly changed my mind on this product. The rubber is extremely malleable. After extreme use the product does not wrap fully around the head of my hitachi vibrator. The rubber is cheap and not worth the asking price. I'm going to have to throw this out 57 days after purchasing this item because now I can feel the heat from the hitachi head because this product is NOT meant to last. Highly disappointed!
