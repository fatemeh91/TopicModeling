review/text: Using the wheel to adjust this for a snug fit on our toilet seats was VERY easy, very pleased with this seat, it seems very comfortable for our 21 month old. Also recommend buying potty hooks for a few buck each (may be cheapest at BRU unless things change). I have a potty chair for my son but want him to have the option of using the big potty on a regular basis as soon as possible, so I am fitting each toilet in our house with one of these.
