review/text: I have tried a few types of nursing pads, and these are the ones I personally prefer. they are thick, absorbent, and heavy duty. They last a lot longer than others that I have tried, and hold their shape in the wash unlike others that bunch and wrinkle up. Also, the washing bag that comes with the breast pads are great to use for baby's socks, hand mitts, etc. I don't use the bag for the breast pads, I just throw them in the wash by themselves and haven't lost any yet. I highly recommend these!
