review/text: If you can handle retinal products this is a good one. I love how velvety it goes on. I use it at night 3 or 4 times a week and it makes your skin very smooth. You might want to take it easy at first until you figure out what your skin can take or you can make it flake and dry out. All in all this product is great.
