review/text: This is my favorite flavor of whey protein. It mixes great with water, ice, and a banana. Or you could use one of those blender ball cups and bring it to the gym and just add water. Either way, it tastes great. The 5 lbs tub is a good size to buy because the container is sturdy and stands upright, as opposed to the 10 lbs sack. Makes it easier to scoop and reclose the lid. The smaller sizes are also more expensive per serving.
