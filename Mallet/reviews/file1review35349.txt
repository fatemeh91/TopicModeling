review/text: I bought it because I am on crutches and thought it would make it easier to get out of the car. I can only put weight on one foot and had to push up from the seat. Pulling up didn't really help me. It also didn't work for my husband who has cerebral palsy. He needs the door to be still in order to get out of the car. The handle obviously pulls the car door in. I wouldn't recommend it for those with disabilities. It probably works better for older people who lack strength to stand easily.
