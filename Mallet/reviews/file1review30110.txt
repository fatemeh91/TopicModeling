review/text: This is my 5th bed buddy. This product has nursed me through migraines, sore shoulders, cold feet, stiff necks, and a variety of aches, pains, and muscle strains. Every member of my family has one. They last for years and provide a level of comfort, using moist heat, that you cannot get from a heating pad (dry irritating heat). I highly recommend this product.
