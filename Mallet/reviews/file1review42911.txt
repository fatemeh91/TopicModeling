review/text: I am 55 years old and work 12 hour shifts on my feet with lots of moving bending and lifting (RN). They stay up as long as I don't pull the very top part tight, then the stocking will roll and I end up with knee highs. I have not had any leg pain since starting to wear these. My only problem has been that the top part tears easily. I would like to find this very stoking without the lace top.
