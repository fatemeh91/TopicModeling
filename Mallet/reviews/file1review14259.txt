review/text: I believe this is the best invention since sliced bread! The unit does cover to love, so luckily for us we have a drop ceiling, so I got creative and hung it at a higher level so it covers more of the shower. It keeps the shower freser longer and I hate nothing more than to scrub a shower, so when I do have to clean it, it is not as hard, keeps the scum off. This is a little expensive and I wish the units would last longer in between having to buy a whole new unit.........but like I said I HATE cleaning showers and this is the best thing on the market so far to make this job easier. Now I wish their other products were in rust proof containers, I would use them more often. Finding some coupons to buy would be nice too.
