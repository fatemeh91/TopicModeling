review/text: I always have lower back pain when I sit too long at work but usually, the pain disappears after work. However, after using this during the first day, my lower back pain was way worse than usual, and the pain lingered even after work. Tried it for another day and had the same very bad feeling. I bought this product because of the good reviews but maybe it is not really what it is. Have to return it...I am really disappointed because I thought that I have found a solution to my back problem.
