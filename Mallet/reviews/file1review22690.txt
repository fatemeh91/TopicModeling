review/text: I stumbled on Rescue remedy by accident on the internet a few years ago when I was looking for natural remedies for stress relief which were safe and drug free. I was skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. I found that it worked and also gave it to other family members to try. They too, were apprehensive and worried that it would be addictive or habit-forming but that was never the case with any of us. It helps me calm down without any drug side-effects. It is handy to have around and safe enough for my liking. I believe it helped me get through some stressful situations and moments.
