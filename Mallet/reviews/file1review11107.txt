review/text: The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for adults is around 100mg. Multiplying the amount by ten gives no advantage to the body, considering the body's tissues cannot even uptake more than the RDA. There is no clinical evidence of vitamin C, of any amount, as a cure or prevention of any major disease, or the common cold. Its clinical uses are limited to aiding the body's absorption of iron in the GI tract, and acidifying the urine. Excess doses can also lead to the formation of kidney stones.(Sources: Walton and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ch 28; Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry, 29th ed, Ch 44)
