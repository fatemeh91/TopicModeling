review/text: I feel like I have to share my opinion of this shaver. I found other people's reviews to be so helpful when I was trying to find the best electric shaver recently.I previously had a Braun 6520 for years and was very happy with it until the day it died. I went a while without an electric shaver and finally decided to get a new one. I am not a rich man, but the Braun 8585 is worth every penny. I am extremely happy with it. I believe it to be the finest electric shaver available today. The other two shavers I tried during my recent search failed in so many ways by comparison. You really do get what you pay for with electric shavers.One of the shavers I tried was the Remington MS3-1700 Titanium 3 MicroScreen Ultra. By comparison the Remington was much louder especially the sideburn trimmer which made me feel like I should insert earplugs before putting that thing so close to my ear. Also, even though it has the 3 screens, it took a much longer time to shave and it did not do that good of a job.This Braun works really great and is impressively better than my old one which I was very happy with. I highly recommend the 8585!
