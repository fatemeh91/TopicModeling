review/text: It's attractive, it has a great name and it's backed by an extraordinary brand. Once you get beyond that, it's just hype. My mother loves hummingbirds and I hate flossing, so I thought this would be a fun gadget to use. Unfortunately, the vibrations don't do as much as proper manual flossing action to clean the spaces between teeth. And if you need/prefer tape-style floss, you're out of luck with this product, which just uses string. It sat on my shelf for months and was used only 3 or 4 times before I gave up. Now I use OralB silk tape or Tom's of Maine tape. Easy, fast, inexpensive and far more effective. Sorry guys; you usually do a good job, but not this time.
