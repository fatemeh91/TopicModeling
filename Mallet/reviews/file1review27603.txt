review/text: Pros:Tastes ok, not the best, but not the worst either.For the most part, gets the job done.Value - you're getting a good price for the amount you're gettingCons:Not the highest of quality of Protein (not from organic source)Contains Acesulfame Potassium, a sweetner that's suggested to be avoidedContains Artificial Flavoring.Yes, this stuff may work for you considering you don't have any side effects from consuming it. Any side effects will hinder your progress. However, there are many commercial proteins out there that do the same job, many of which taste better, although may not be as cost efficient. The down fall with this product like many others is that the main source of protein is of 'low grade' and not premium or ultra high or whatever the labels states. Unless it's from an grass fed cow and all that other good stuff - more than like the whey extract is of poor value. in addition, Acesulfame Potassium is an artificial sweetner,linked to many side effects like other artificial sweetners. Rule of thumb on Artficial sweetners is that, if it aint natural, it probably shouldn't be consumed. which leads to the artficial flavoring aspect of this product. AF may be made up of up to 4 dozen ingredients, chemicals made to make your taste buds dance.Like I said, this stuff will get the job done and it's cheap for the amount you get. But more than likely will cause underlying problems. not really worth it if you ask me.
