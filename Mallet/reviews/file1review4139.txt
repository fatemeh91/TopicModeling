review/text: I regret ordering these as a box in the Gillette container was only a few bucks more. From normal packaging I get 30-45 shaves before the razor begins to scratch my face. These...2-3 shaves. Yeah. The lubricating strip at the top disappears after 2-3 shaves too. Really, sorry I bought these. I'll switch back to buying the razors in the Gillette packaging for next time. 8 razors from Gillette has in the past lasted me close to a year, not 12 weeks.
