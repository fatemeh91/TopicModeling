review/text: My wife always had issues while cleaning my stainless steel thermos that I take to office filled with coffee. The opening is so small that washing it becomes a pain. The other day she was telling me about the OXO good grips bottle brush; she is able to clean my thermos without any worry. The bristles are soft yet firm on the base and side walls that it does not leave any scratch. Even after repeated use the brittles remain firm and have not lost its shape. The handle has a decent grip and despite using with soap does not slip. The length is also pretty convenient for cleaning elongated bottles. It is a must have in any household.
