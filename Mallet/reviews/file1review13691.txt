review/text: This Shiatsu Reflexology Foot Massager was a gift for my daughter & son-in-law. It arrived safely, well packaged & in good time.My daughter, who has used a similar machine here at home, loves it, & it seems to have a lasting benefit on her.My son-in-law has never experienced such a massage before, so, at the moment, finds he is unable to stay on it for long. However, with short but regular times on the machine, he is already beginning to feel a benefit in his feet, legs & his general well-being.Everybody has a different tolerance rate, so the use of this machine will vary. I know that once my son-in-law has become used to the machine, he will allow himself to use it to help relieve his recurrent back pain.If nothing else, increased blood circulation in the feet & lower legs has to be good, combined with sitting down & relaxing.At best, this is a magnificent home health aid for the whole family!
