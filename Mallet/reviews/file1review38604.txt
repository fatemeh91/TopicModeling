review/text: It's presentable for men or women wearing many different styles of clothing, unlike those large ugly copper bracelets, and functionally works well. Yes, I was a skeptic at first but the pain in my wrist told me to try it (since I had seen so many old timers as I was growing up using copper bracelets who appeared to be benefiting from them). At one point I said, hey, this is nonsense, and I put the bracelet in my drawer. Guess what? Within a week the cold pain and weakness returned. There's definitely something to this (not psychosomatic). Anyway, arrived on time, works well, looks nice. What more can I say?
