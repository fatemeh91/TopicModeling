review/text: This is a delicious shake mix. I add a teaspoon of coffee, reg. or decaf, and it makes a delicious mocha shake.It keeps you from feeling hungry and satisfies chocolate cravings.This is the best price you can get it at, too.Milk Chocolate tastes better than the Chocolate Royale, and is better as far as calories and sugar.
