review/text: Helps with energy, circulation, and overall performance.I learned about stacking pre-workout supp's from my body building program, when I couldn't lift due to shoulder issues, I started running. Works great for that too. Tastes kinda yukky if you take it alone with water, otherwise, undetectable with other supp's I recommend taking withOptimum Nutrition Instantized BCAA and Creatine, Orange Blast, 738g
