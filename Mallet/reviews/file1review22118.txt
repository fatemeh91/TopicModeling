review/text: Tom's Of Maine has a wide variety of toothpaste all made from Natural ingredients with various healthful benefits that all keep your mouth fresh, clean and healthy. This one, Peppermint flavored, with baking soda and calcium is great for clean teeth and uses fluoride to help in preventing cavities. Other ingredients included are water, glycerin,carageenan,xylitol,sodium laurel sulfate(from coconut oil). The box lists the purpose and source of each one. For example Carrageenan is a thickener and it's source is seaweed.The peppermint taste is very refreshing and leaves my mouth clean and fresh feeling even between meals.it uses only a mild abrasive(calcium carbonate) and this one is accepted by the ADA for helping to prevent tooth decay. I rotate this one with Tom's 'antiplaque' made with fennel, propolis and myrrh(kind of tastes like a purple spice drop), which, for those that prefer a non-fluoride toothpaste is great at preventing plaque build-up, but does not last quite as long as this peppermint one as far as freshness goes.Tom's of Maine has been around since 1970 and uses no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. A great way and natural way to keep your mouth healthy and fresh.Have a Healthy and Happy New Year.....Laurie
