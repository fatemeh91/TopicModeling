review/text: My husband currently has elevated blood pressure but this machine consistently read it as normal. We finally realized it wasn't pumping the cuff up far enough and we had to hold the button down while it was inflating to get it to the right level. We still are not confident it is giving accurate readings though.Also - do your research, which I thought I had done. I found this same model at 'big-box' store for the same money so I could have had it a week earlier.
