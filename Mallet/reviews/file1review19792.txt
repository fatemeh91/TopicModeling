review/text: Love this seat (and matching step stool)! It was super easy to adjust to our toilet and my 3-year old took to it immediately; he takes it on and off all by himself. I've tried several other seats and this one doesn't have the nook and crannies that the others have where urine seeps in and makes the whole bathroom smell. Just a quick rinse and it's good to go again.
