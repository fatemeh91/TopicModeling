review/text: Pleasantly surprised with this product. First off, I will say that it was much bigger than expected in diameter. The texture is a very nice change from the normal rigidity of most vibrators. Overall, very effective. It does have a funny smell that I have not been able to get off of the product. Not a horrible smell, but it is noticeable.
