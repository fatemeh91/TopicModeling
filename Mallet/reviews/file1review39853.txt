review/text: I've had two of these and will not buy another. I bought them at a store near me.The first one lasted a couple of years so I bought another.The suction cups did't stay on either one and I had to constantly screw or glue them back on.Then one day while decorating for Xmas one cup came off of the last one and I still can't find it to this day which renders the tool unusable.I only had the last one two or three months.A cheap price for cheap tool. In this instance I did get what I paid for.Won't buy this again.
