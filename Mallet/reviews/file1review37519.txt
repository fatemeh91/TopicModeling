review/text: This is a great chair if you can find it for $200-260 (same price as the lesser AG2101). Assuming you get one in that price range as I did, The chair is comfortable for the price. The locking mechanism could be stronger, but seem to work on my 185 lbs weight. I think they made the leg rest shorter to cut cost and if you are over six feet you will have to have it reclined or off the ground somehow if you want your knees to not bend.Massage is good but it's basically their $120 mat built-in. so figure your paying $100-$150 for the chair (about the price of the lawn chair antigravity chairs and it has more padding then those that so not to bad.Some have complained about feeling the mechanism to hard or a lower support bar when reclined to a "feet above your chest" position. This is due to your weight increasing as you recline...that in mind, a massage will be rough when inverted so to speak..if you have to do this, a good sweatshirt may help...not so much an issue with the AG 2101 or when the motors are off and the extra pad included is used.Note, There is no lumbar support on this chair so an extra pad of your choosing in this area may help.All this aside, the chair is the closest thing you will get to feeling like sitting in an I-joy but for $300-350 less. If you have the extra cash, obviously an I-joy is the best choice.Your next step up is $600-$1500 for the other brands of antigravity ...so in retrospect it's not bad if your budget is $200-$300 and your looking for this styleI have marked it down for:- needing just a little more padding- better locking handles- longer foot rest
