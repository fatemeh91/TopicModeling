review/text: yes, there has been deafening hype and marketing surrounding the fusion, but guess what? the damn thing is pretty amazing. it really does provide a crazy close shave with little to no irritation. yes, the blades are pricey, but hey, it's your face! you could keep hacking away with cheap Bic razors, but do you really hate your face that much?P.S. I am also a head shaver, and this thing is very well adapted to the scalp.
