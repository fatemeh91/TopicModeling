review/text: I bought this because I wanted something natural that could keep my tub clean because I hate scrubbing! I like that Method products are safe for my body and the environment and I would give this item 5 stars if it weren't for the smell. If I spray it when my husband is at home, since he's more sensitive to smells than me he'll ask if I just sprayed some chemical in the bathroom. Sometimes when I spray it I feel a little stinging too, not bad but from a natural product I would want something safe for my lungs too. Maybe it is but it doesn't feel like it sometimes.As for how it works, it does a great job. I spray the shower every other day and I alternate between this an another brand with a better smell but that doesn't have the natural ingredients this one has. For this reason I'll keep this regimen but if I find a natural alternative with better smell I'll switch right away. At least my tub remains clean for a long time and I only have to scrub in a couple of strategic places every now and then.
