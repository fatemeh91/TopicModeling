review/text: The E-seris are simply a fantastic toothbrush. Ergonomic, effective and actually very good value. If you are sill using manual brushes you really have to stump up the extra few dollars investment and get one of these. They are 10x better than a manual. The replacement heads just keep a good purchase lasting longer. My teeth are in excellent condition and it is mostly due to this tootbrush, get one.
