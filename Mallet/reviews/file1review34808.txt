review/text: the product itself, is fine. the container is unexceptable.. it is so fragile it will crack if not placed on a completely flat surface and handled like glass. we had two of our four bottles crack on the bottom in less than a month from purchase. all the contents leaked out made a terrible mess in our storage room. what a waste! we need eco friendly products for our grey water system and we live in a very remote place and buy in quantity. we can not afford to order this product again if it is not storable and is so poorly packaged.
