review/text: Would have given this item a 5-star rating, however the handle does tend to come apart easily. But, a little silicone caulk took care of that problem! This item is a MUST HAVE for anyone with pets and especially small children. My son is the original "Hansel"....leaving crumbs wherever he has been. I used to get irritated and grumble about having to lug out our heavy vacuum several times a day. Now that I have my little light-weight picker-upper, I can just do a quick run over the carpet and the crumbs are all picked up. Seems to work equally well on carpet, as well as hardwood, linoleum, etc.Always saw these kinds of sweepers before, but they were just too expensive to own. For $20, I decided to take a gamble. Plus, I knew Bissell is a good name. It is worth every penny!
