review/text: Purchased this tub for my 8 month old. This tub is great for little ones! Minimal water needed, padded on bottom (which was surprising, as I was expecting a flat sheet of plastic on the bottom), drains well. My son loves bathing in it. He has on occasion thrown himself backwards in it, but no worries here. The sides are well padded and the bottom is also padded, so no injuries. Just keep in mind you do not have to fill it all the way up to give a good bath. If you fill it too deep and your child throws themselves backwards or slips, then they would go under the water. Just use common sense when using the product. Overall, VERY pleased with this purchase!
