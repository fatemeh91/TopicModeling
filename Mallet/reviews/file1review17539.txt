review/text: I have been using this model for years to trim my hair. Best I've ever used, mainly because the selector dial for length lets you clearly see and set your desired length .... AND IT NEVER ACCIDENTALLY SLIPS TO A DIFFERENT LENGTH/POSITION.Last very long time (not forever, but several years of regular use without any problems)
