review/text: We've had these condoms for over a year now... That should tell you enough about how much my wife and I like them. They really don't help with keeping the "sensations". My wife hates them and I really have to work to finish at times (and really - I'm not typically a marthon runner when it comes to sex).Some reviews claim these are knock offs....I'm lead to believe them since I've heard great things about this brand elsewhere.
