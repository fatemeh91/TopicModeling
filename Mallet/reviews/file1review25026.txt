review/text: BY FAR the best tasting BCAA I've tried. Really, all of them contain the same amount of Branched Chain, so that's not the issue. It always comes down to taste. I've even taken this without water - or mix it with VERY little water (think shot glass). OR I've mixed in a tall glass with ice and sip (as a treat when I'm cutting for a competition). I do mark it down a little because it contains aspertame... I've tried another BCAA that uses Stevia - but it doesn't taste as good (perhaps why Coke is taking so long with their Stevia soda - aspertame just tasted better). This mixes "ok" but does require some fork action - in a shaker or with a palm over the cup (or a in a bottle) its just fine.
