review/text: The Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Double Rich Chocolate, is the most delicious protein I have ever tasted. It is perfect for oatmeal breakfast mix with sliced bananas as well as a protein shake with soy milk. The aroma contributes to the taste as it is an aroma that overtakes your taste buds and makes you want to take a spoon and just eat the protein.
