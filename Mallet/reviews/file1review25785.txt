review/text: This is my second 411 trimmer purchased. The first was at Target about 3 years ago - I dropped it in the sink and it could not be repaired. I tried another brand and it was worthless! It was hard to find this trimmer anywhere and Amazon had the only reputable source. It was sent in 'shrinkwrap' only with the printed instructions. It seemed odd it was not in original packageing but has every appearance of being new and, in fact, runs even better than the last one that seemed to go through batteries much faster... It arrived about a week later than promised, but I still could use the other unit (somewhat) - Otherwise I would have had to pay for the express shipping
