review/text: I am new to Mate. I have wanted to start drinking it for a long time. Just bought the tea (would recommend getting brand other than Guayaki, maybe their San Mateo is better!)But...for the Bombilla, it is great! I would recommend. It doesn't come apart so there may be times when it is hard to clean. But it is very sturdy and genuine looking. I like it a lot! thumbs up :-)!
