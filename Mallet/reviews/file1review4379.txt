review/text: these are the best razors. i've been shaving my entire head and face for past 5 years and these are clearly the best razors on the market. this is a great price too (less than $3 per cartridge). the single trimming blade is worthless i think. but the 4 blades leave me no nicks/cuts. very very close comfortable shave.
