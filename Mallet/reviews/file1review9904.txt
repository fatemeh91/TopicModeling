review/text: These tweezers are the greatest idea! If anyone has ever had a whisker or an eyebrow that has become stuck under your skin and becomes painful, or a splinter in your hand or finger, these will do the trick. The have a long needle like tip that allow you to get into the skin without digging like a needle has you do. You just need to make sure you sterilize them before and after you use them. My husband loves these for whiskers he couldn't get out before, and my son was amazed the other day how easily the got out a splinter in his finger. I would highly recommend these to anyone that needs to get an annoying foreign object causing pain or infection out from under your skin. These are reasonably price, and worth every penny of it.
