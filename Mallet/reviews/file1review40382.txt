review/text: I had the 20 capsule Quick Defense for awhile waiting for an opportunity to try it. Recently I had a runny nose and a sore throat which is how most of my colds start. I took two capsules of Quick Defense five times a day (which is instructed). That means you'll finish off your bottle trying to stop one cold. I have to admit I did feel better the next day and didn't end up with anything worse than the sore throat and runny nose for another day. Not sure I'd pay out of pocket to try it for a future cold.
