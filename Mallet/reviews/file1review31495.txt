review/text: This is exactly what I was looking for in planning a 7+Day kayak trip for about 6. It says only up to 4people but if you don't go out adventuring with noobs this should be good enough. I added a foil emergency blanket and a pair of HeatFactory pads in case of hypothermia. It's surprisingly small and light. Putting together a medkit such as this would cost a lot more and wouldn't be nearly as light nor waterproof. Hope I don't need it but now I feel confident in case of emergency.
