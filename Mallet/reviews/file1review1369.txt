review/text: I placed an order on May 16th, and the scale arrived on May 20th, 4 days before the estimated delivery date. Very fast. It took me 25 minutes to figure out how to put it together. If you have someone who helps you to hold the rod with the beam (it is pretty heavy) while you adjust the rod to fit the hole underneath, then it makes things so much easier. While your helper still holds the rod, you can screw the thing tight (4 screws in total). The final step is to remove the carton board box underneath and put the hook in the right place. Stand on it, then you are in business! The scale is consistently accurate, and because the design uses the level principle, it is extremely precise and its accuracy is not affected by the local gravity. $135(plus $21 for shipping) is a bit extravagant for a home-use scale, but this scale will last you a life time and it will always tell the truth.*UPDATE*: I've been using the scale for a couple of months already, and recently I decided to lose some weight. I weigh myself every morning after going to the bathroom and without any clothes on, and this scale accurately and truthfully reflects my weight loss progress (the smallest unit for this scale is 0.25lb). I also use this scale to weigh my cat (he is on a diet too) by holding him in my arms then subtract the scale reading from my own weight. It consistently gives extremely accurate reading, for both cat and I. If you really want to test the accurate of this scale, simply weigh yourself first, then weigh yourself again by having something in your hand, the scale will reflect that difference. For example, I did that test with my new iPad and the difference is exactly what Apple's says about the weight of an iPad.
