review/text: I used the Bissell 9400 Steam cleaner.My review may not be fair because I cleaned a foyer carpeting that was really dirty...not cleaned in a year.I did it 3X & did a clean HOT water only rinse also. It is alot cleaner buttttttt there is still dirt to be seen after it dried. Is this the way it should be on a stained carpet?? I don't know but I don't think so.When I did the LR carpeting with the Bissell pet & orange shampoo, it came out super clean. I mixed them equally. Great results.I will do the foyer again & mix all 3 shampoos...or maybe just two, than I will edit this review & tell you whats what.
