review/text: The number of different supplements I've been taking has slowly added up the past few months - Vitamin D, Fish oil capsules, probiotics, a few others.And then I started with the P.A.G.G. stack which is a 4X daily combo of supplements for fat loss, but this particular combo have all of these semi-complicated exceptions to them.. like take one only at bedtime, but the others all 4 times, but skip Thursdays etc..So now I have a routine on Sunday morning, where I stand at the kitchen counter, with the music on (don't put on talk radio, it'll distract you), and fill the entire 7 days of compartments.. takes about 20 minutes.But when you're pressed for time the rest of the week, you'll never be forced to do a rush job on your supplementation or think about all of the different rules behind which ones you skip for that time., or the ones you don't take that day.It's such a wonderful no-brainer to open the labeled Monday/Morning compartment, open up the mouth, and toss them in.Must add that the compartments are just barely big enough for some of the times .. for the morning time , the particular compartments are definitely full and can take no more (the single Flaxseed oil capsules I take are big). But I think for most people they will be big enough for their needs.
