review/text: Most OTC wart removal products from your drug store are 17% salicylic acid (the active agent). This is 40% and the difference is noticable.You do need patience. I put a generous dab on my wart(s), daily if I can remember, and then cover with a band aid to prevent my clothes from rubbing it off. Some warts take a week or so before falling off and some much longer. I am just rid of one which took over a month. Did I mention you need patience?I suspect the OTC stuff would work too; it would just take a *lot* longer.
