review/text: I originally bought this to take with us on a cruise . I ended up using it before I even printed out the tickets. I mowed the lawn and forgot my sunscreen and ended up with mild symptoms of Sun Poisoning. I put a dot of oil behind each ear , and a few mins later I wasn't dizzy anymore. I only had to apply it once , and was able to get back to life and deal with my bad sunburn.
