review/text: I found the shaver to be overated. After years of using a Norelco triple header, I thought of trying a Braun and found it to be difficult to achieve a good shave. The Norelco was far superior. I returned it to Braun, Amazon would not take it back because of the head cleaning fluid. Which is another expense, the cleaning fluid only lasts for about a month and needs to be replaced, even if not used, it evaporates. I would not recomend.
