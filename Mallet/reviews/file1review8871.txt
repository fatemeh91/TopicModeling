review/text: My nutritionist suggested Green Vibrance, and to be honest, I was skeptical. I've had "green drinks" before, and they smelled and tasted the same: like low tide. I had to chug them like a shot of tequila. This is the first green drink I actually like! It tastes very much like fresh lettuce leaves, which is quite pleasant. I might actually make it past a week with keeping up with my prescribed green drink!Please note that once opened, it needs to be in the fridge/freezer. Not a big deal, but just an FYI.I feel myself getting healthier already! :)
