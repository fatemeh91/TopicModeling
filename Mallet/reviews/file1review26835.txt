review/text: Don't know about the other flavors, but the Double Rich Chocolate tastes pretty good. With milk that is. I have tried it with water, and it's drinkable, but not at all pleasant. As for using a spoon to mix it, you'll find it requires quite a bit of stirring and you'd still be left with small chunks of powder that couldn't dissolve. A shaker is therefore essential, and I think it's more practical than an electric mixer, unless you're mixing in chunks of fruit.Lastly, there's a plastic scoop in there! Mine came with the scoop buried inside the powder and I had to dig in to get it. I didn't know about it until a friend told me, so just wanted to share this info if you ever receive yours with no visible scoop inside.
