review/text: I bought these Thermoplastic whitening trays after getting a mouth guard with a whitening product that was just so uncomfortable for me! I figured, for the price I really couldn't go wrong! Now I should mention that not everyone will like these, and given the price nobody should be expecting dentist-quality trays. That said, for the few dollars I spent, I'm rather pleased!PROS- Cheap- No plastic taste- Moldable to your mouth- Only need hot water to mold- Three trays in case you mess one up- Great for teeth whitening gels- Allow you to talk (with difficult), drink water and spitCONS- Tricky to get just right- Even after trimming, amount of plastic between molars is uncomfortableOverall I'm not displeased. After having left one tray in the boiling water for too long (shrank to an unusable size) I managed to get the other two pretty much to a usable mold for my teeth. Since I am using these for whitening, they are only in about 20 minutes every day or two, so I don't mind that they are a little uncomfortable! For the price I paid (compared to the $125 I was quoted by a dentist) I would definitely buy these again. Due to the lack of viable alternatives on the market, I would recommend them with some reservation - keep your expectations low and I think you might be pleasantly surprised.
