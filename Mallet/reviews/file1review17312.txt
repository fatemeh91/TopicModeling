review/text: I have been using this trimmer on my face for about 8 months now, and I really like it.The blades seem to stay sharp, the battery lasts quite a while, and it comes with a little brush to clean it.My only gripe with it is that the guard doesn't stay put if you push too hard. I cut my hair with it once and had to re-do half of my head because it had slipped from a "7" to a "6" mid-cut. Obviously, this trimmer is not made for haircuts so that's my own fault!But for normal, everyday use on your face you will not be disappointed.
