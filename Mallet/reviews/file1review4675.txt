review/text: From a girl that's always scorned things like diet shakes and meal-in-a-glass sustenance, this Herbalife wasn't so bad. I'm using it because it's quick and easy to pack in the mornings before dashing off to school, but it tastes pretty good. I won't lie and say it completely fills me up, but pack a handful of almonds for your crunch craving, a serving of fruit (I recommend the Fruit Leather products), and of course, a bite or two of dark chocolate - and you've got yourself a meal. I haven't been using it long enough to say its effects on my weight, but I'm sure it's doing the job. I'm too hungry by dinner for it not to be.
