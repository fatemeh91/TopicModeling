review/text: I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor (red velvet cake) for a gift. And I was sold. I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake, chai, pecan pie and zombie. I love these. They go on so smooth and they're shiny enough that people think I'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box, in just a couple days, and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it. I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose, (I was sick!) not only did it smell great but the next day my nose wasn't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils, which I love. Gonna order more soon. There are 400 flavors, hard to pick just one!
