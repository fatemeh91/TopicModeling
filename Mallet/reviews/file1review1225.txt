review/text: I use this along with the echinacea goldenseal as my go to for immune support. I love this product the very best due to it's ability for an all around immunity support. (I've just reveiwed the echinacea goldenseal - so this is part is a copy paste since it applies here as well) I really like the liquid caps. I get the benefits of fast absorption of the liquid and the ease of a capsule. I also have found that Gaia is the best for Astragaus. I get consistent results.
