review/text: This heating pad has a little weight to it, so it feels extra good. The switch is set up so that when you fall asleep, it turns itself off. I have had two of them, ordered one for my sister and now have to order myself another one since my new puppy chewed the cord. I can't wait to get my new one. I fall asleep much better when using it.
