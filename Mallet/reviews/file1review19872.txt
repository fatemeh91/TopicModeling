review/text: I bought this potty after the insert one that I bought at Burlington did not fit our elongated toilet seat. The Bjorn potty fit perfectly with the adjustment of the dial. My daughter (5mo), who we are using Elimination Communication with, fits perfectly on the seat and uses it without any problems. I also love the fact that I can hang it up so that it is out of the way but easily accessible.
