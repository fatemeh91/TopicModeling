review/text: While the pacifier thermometer is great in concept, it is quite bulky and larger than a regular pacifier. My daughter could not keep it in her mouth and with the slight fever and her crying, the pacifier did not read accurately. I have to use my regular thermometer. I probably wouldn't recommend it.
