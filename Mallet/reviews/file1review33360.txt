review/text: Merkurs are the benchmark blade. That does not mean that there are not slightly better blades, but it does mean that it established the standard by which others are judged. As in knives, Solingen steel is nothing to sniff at. Merkurs offer the smoothest, least abrasive shave, and they are unmatched for edge-holding.I have used Merkurs for four years, and I interchange them with Astras and Feathers in a Merkur Progress double-edge.I believe the Astras to be inferior (but still very respectable), and the Feathers to be slightly superior (when in a Progress; too agressive for my sensitive skin when in a 1960's Gillette DE).
