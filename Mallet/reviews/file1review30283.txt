review/text: This vacuum comes with no attachments except the brush for pet hair, which is useless for getting into corners and crevices, and I can't seem to find any additional attachments I can get for it. If you just want to clean up dust and pet hair in open discreet areas, it works OK, but for anything more, look elsewhere. Mine's going back to Amazon.
