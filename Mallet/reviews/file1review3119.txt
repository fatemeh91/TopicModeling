review/text: there's not much more to say about them. they're thin enough but they're not amazing or anything. they're pink, a little bit ribbed, and a little bit lubricated. I'd say they're slightly better than the trojans I had been using, but they're not some miracle condom -- at the end of the day, it's still a horrible piece of latex that takes 30% of the enjoyment out of sex.
