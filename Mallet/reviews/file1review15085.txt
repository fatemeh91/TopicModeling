review/text: I've been using this eye drop for at least two years, and have had no recurrence of cataract in the one eye that had had a cataract removed, and no new cataract formation in my un-operated eye. I was always impressed by the original research, and have seen no &#34;blowback&#34; from the scientific community or general public. In fact, my ophthalmologist approved of my use of the drops well after I'd started taking them. She seemed to be familiar with the data and claims.At first, the dispenser design seemed a bit flawed, but now I think they've got the tolerances down to a more precise measurement. You have to be very careful with this, keeping it in the dark, and preferably refrigerated, and when you screw down the cap to create the tiny hole that dispenses the drop, it now seems to work better.RE the dating on the box, they seem to manufacture a very large run, so that when you reorder, for a few orders (a few months) the batch date remains the same, even though it is usually about a year ahead. But, sooner or later, your re-order comes in with a newer date. The variable I'm not happy about is that there are many suppliers, and you can't be sure that your product will always be handled or stored ideally. And, the prices do vary as well.
