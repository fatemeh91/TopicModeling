review/text: I really like this sweeper! It does just what I want -- picking up bits of this and that on all my rugs in between regular weekly cleanings with my Kirby vacuum. I have four cats and this does a really amazing job of picking up cat hair. And I've had no trouble with the handle as I followed the instructions to whack it on something hard when I first put it together. I recommend this sweeper highly.
