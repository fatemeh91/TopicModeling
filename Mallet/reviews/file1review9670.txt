review/text: My wife and I bought this for our first child. She used it according to the directions, playing the music every night for about 10-15 minutes. When the baby was born he was very calm and so far does not cry much unless he wants something. Also when he gets crabby we play the music for him on the 2nd Cd. It seems to calm him down right away. To me this really helped would recommend it just for the Cd's. The heartbeat listening device is pretty much usless until the later part of the pregnancy and can be tricky to hear the heartbeat. For the price did not expect the heartbeat monitor to work well anyways.
