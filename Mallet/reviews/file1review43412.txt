review/text: I highly recommend this product! This is my third pregnancy- I have back pain, leg pain, ligament pain, and pelvic pain. Wearing this makes the pain better and allows me to remain more active. I can sit/stand for longer periods of time without the pain and swelling. It also makes me sit in the correct position so the pain does not get worse. The straps on top show a little, so I just pin them to my bra straps. It took some adjusting to figure out how to wear it comfortably. If it is not comfortable at first, keep trying different adjustments until it is. I was on the border of being a medium or large, so I went with the large and it is a perfect fit. Other belts I tried were ok for standing, but I was not able to move around or sit as comfortably as I am able to do with this one. I only wish I had this supporter with my first two pregnancies!
