review/text: This is a great grout brush, with a nicely designed handle that's perfect for giving the grout an good ole marine scrub. Unlike the other reviewer, I think this makes a lousy dish brush. The brush is designed stiff and narrow. For a dish brush, I would prefer something with more surface area, like the ones OXO makes.
