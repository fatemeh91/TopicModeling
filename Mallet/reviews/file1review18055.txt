review/text: overall this is a great mask. the fabric is very good quality; it's quite comforable. it does a good job of keeping the light out. i have a big nose and i feel that the nose indentation could be a bit more accommodating to make it a completely perfect fit. that said, no one mask fits all types of faces perfectly and this one comes close.
