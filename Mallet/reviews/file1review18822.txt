review/text: Mineral Rich is a must have for me. I listened to Maureen Salaman speak about it many years ago, telling of all the benefits of taking it, not only internally, but outwardly, skin, hair and nails, so I ordered not one bottle, but a case of six bottles, and I couldn't believe the difference in my hair. It was very strengthening to my thinning hair, stimulating new hair growth, and giving my hair new shine and bounce. My hairdresser even asked me what I was doing to make my hair so healthy. I told her it was Mineral Rich. When I run out of it, I can certainly see a differance in my hair. I look at it this way, if something I am taking is having a positive effect on my hair, skin and nails, then I know it is doing something good on the inside. I love this stuff and don't want to ever be without it. My daughter is now using it, and I definitely can see a change in her thinning hair. It has thickened on top, and her natural dark hair color has come back. I couldn't believe it when I saw her last. I just kept staring at her hair, in disbelief. This product is amazing, and I highly recommend it.
