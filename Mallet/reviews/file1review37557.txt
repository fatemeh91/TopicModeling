review/text: My son asked me to get him deodorant sticks one day (he was 12 at the time), and I ventured out to a nearby drug store. I have never used deodorant myself so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I stood in front of shelves full of deodorants and anti-perspirants, not knowing which one is the best one.I decided to test-smell each one of the deodorants (since my husband advised me against getting our son anti-perspirants) there and I came across this one. It does not make my son smell like a grown man, yet scented enough to make him smell, say, "groomed and presentable".Some stores don't carry this scent so I decided to check on Amazon and I found them here. It is on my shopping list now.
