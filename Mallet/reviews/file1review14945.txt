review/text: This thing is a great addition for any athlete or anyone with muscles. The head itself is nice and firm but has a rubber coating that makes it just the right hardness, and the thickness is really perfect. But there's lots of massage tools on Amazon. The difference with this one is the rolling head. The other simple plastic nubs can only either hold direct pressure on one point. Dragging it will just yank your skin and if you oil up you might be able to move them around for deep strokes but they will probably slip too much. This one is perfect because you can grab it any time and roll it on your skin deep into muscles. But you can also get that 'static' pressure massage if you pinch the base of the roller holding the wheel steady, or dragging perpendicular to the wheel if you want to glide some skin and upper fascia around. So it's almost like two tools in one that you can switch simply by pinching your thumb.I go deep into muscle knots like this, but another really useful thing to do is to 'carve' along muscle lines to break up adhesions. A good example is if you can feel the edges of your IT band, run this guy along those grooves like a pizza cutter to really free up that band. It's great for small corners like around the knee cap, between your metatarsals, forearm muscles, and jaw. I love this thing, I might get a second one. You'll still want something for broader massage and to hit your back. I like lying on a lacrosse ball the best. I have the stick, too, which is good for behind the legs, but it's not at 'surgical' as this or the lacrosse ball.
