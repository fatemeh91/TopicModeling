review/text: I've never had trouble finding a deodorant that worked, but one that doesn't irritate my skin has been elusive. I really hoped Lavilin would do the job, but it completely failed me. While it was gentle on my skin, it was completely ineffective. I abstained from other deodorants for 48+ hours and then applied Lavilin after showering, yet by the next day my armpits were getting pretty "pungent". I showered again and reapplied the Lavilin, this time quite liberally - only to be greeted by the return of odor by the next morning. Summing it up, Lavilin is: A)Expensive, B)Difficult to apply to hairy armpits, C)Completely ineffective at preventing odor, but D)Does come in a pretty box.
