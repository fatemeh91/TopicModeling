review/text: I can get 1-2 uses per charge with this trimmer. Low charge means slow-moving blades, which starts pulling hair instead of cutting it (ow!). It doesn't run off line power if plugged in, so let it recharge overnight before you need it.My favorite attachment is the precision trimmer with the adjustable comb (same concept as head hair trimmers). Without the comb, it's great for moving the bikini line under the bikini, but it doesn't cut below the skin like a razor, so there's no problem with ingrowns as when shaving. With the comb, you can trim to your choice of three different lengths. I think the only improvement would be if I could get inside the head to clean it out better. I'm sure there are hair bits in there trying to get in the blade vibration mechanism.The mini shaver seems fairly useless to me. For the coarseness of the hair I'm generally trying to shave, I have to make a point of placing the hairs through the shave screen to get them to cut off. The precision trimmer is far more efficient and effective.I've never found a use for the other two trimmers, as I'm more likely to pluck the things they're intended for. But the bits I do use are certainly worth the very reasonable price. The washability of all the parts is also very welcome, considering some of the places I use it. The coordinating stiff mesh zipper bag is handy for keeping all the bits together in a neat little package.
