review/text: Pros:* Veins are a nice touch and feel great.* Texture -- every toy should feel like this! Super silky and pliable, yet maintains shape.* Color -- I bought pink, but had blue and purple to choose from too. Color's cute.* Good length, for grabbing onto.Cons:* The smell is STRONG, like a sweet-smelling plastic. I can tolerate it but yeah, it's definitely noticeable.* It. Is. Huge. Circumference-wise...a bit too big, really (I'm female). I think a half inch less would have been perfect.
