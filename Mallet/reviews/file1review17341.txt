review/text: I love this trimmer. It works great and the price is great. The only problem I have with it (and it still did not stop me from ordering a second one)is the shaver head when dropped from about six inches into the sink came off breaking one of the 2 "plastic holder pieces". They are very small and apparently easy to break thereby making the head useless. Also, they do not have a replacement for the head, you have to buy a whole new shaver.But, it's still worth buying another. I will just be much more carefull with this one.
