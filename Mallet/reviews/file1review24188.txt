review/text: We bought 2 walkers, one from the hospital, and the second from Amazon. The hospital included Guardian Casters 5 inch swivel casters with the first walker. The casters came in an orange Guardian box and had Ref: GO7811 and UPC 0 16958 00616 2 on the bottom of the box. These wheels are great---no problems--solid--no spokes----they turn/swivel properly.We then ordered the same thing from Walgreens for the second walker (we wanted inside and outside walkers. Instead of the original Guardian casters, we received a white Medline box with Reorder#MDS86615SW5 and Lot G120698086 on the bottom of the box. These casters absolutely do not compare with the first Guardian set!! Rather, they seem cheaply made and almost caused our family member to fall forward with the walker. The wheels are not solid, but with spokes, they go sideways, fail to swivel properly, and are extremely dangerous in our opinion! I was told that Medline bought out Guardian and these casters are all that is now available. I called another website that shows the same picture and asked if an order would result in receipt of the actual ones portrayed in the photo (Guardian)instead of the Medline. The customer service rep for that site said all their orders come from Medline and they could not guarantee which casters would be sent. We decided to go back to the hospital (apparently they still have old inventory) and pay the higher price to get the original Guardian casters. I am giving the original Guardian 5 stars. As far as the Medline casters, in my opinion whoever manufactures these, as well as whoever sells them, should be prosecuted. Elderly, injured, ill, military wounded, etc. should be given something that would result in further injuries! I would give the Medline casters ZERO!
