review/text: I've played tennis once and futbol once, and so far so good. it keeps my knee tight depite the fact my lateral ligament is unstable. The bad thing is that i asked for the large one and it fits loose in my leg. it should've been medium, but i didn't know how choose the right one. now i have to pull it up my leg many times every time i use it. i think i'll have it fixed it.i hope it keeps doing a good job for long time
