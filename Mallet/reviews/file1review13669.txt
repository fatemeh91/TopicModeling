review/text: Invented by a dad and his young daughter, FireFly flashing toothbrush encourages kids to brush more thoroughly than regular toothbrushes.FireFly light up timer toothbrush lights up and flashes for 60 seconds, the dentist recommended time for kids to thoroughly brush each row of teeth. The light can be activated easily by a press of a button or tap on the bottom of the brush, allowing children to learn and take charge of their brushing at a young age.With many different colors and designs you can find a fun tooth brush that your child will enjoy looking at as well as using.We got the Barbie FireFly tooth brush and my daughter was thrilled. It came at the right time as her old tooth brush was in for a trip to the trash can.I love this tooth brush because of the flashing light that is a 1 minute timer. Infinity knows that she has to keep brushing as long as the light is flashing. This ensures that she will brush her teeth for at least that long. She has been known to brush longer than that just because it is a fun tooth brush.I received a free FireFly tooth brush from PrRevolution via the Product Review Place. Thanks!You can check out more here and get your own FireFly tooth brush at your local supermarket.
