review/text: My first vibrator I had died after a year. So I needed something new and read the reviews on the pocket rocket. Although they seem good, I disagree. This vibrator takes me almost an hour to get off, where as the first one I had only took 15 minutes. I'd reccomend this as a starter, but not for someone who is looking for a little more power.
