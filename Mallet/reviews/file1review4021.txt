review/text: Like Homer Simpson, I too am a slave to the Gilette Corporation. Every new razor they come out with I try. It's an addiction but I have never been disappointed. This razor gets a 4 of 5 from me because of the price of the blades. Seriously, I've had car payments lower than the cost of an 8-pack.Still...Shaving with this razor is like shaving with a warm stick of butter, but with a closer shave. It's close, comfortable, and luxurious. Treat yourself.
