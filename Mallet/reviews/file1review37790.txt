review/text: I ordered this product after carefully reviewing many products because I am allergic to soy. This one clearly states, "Contains no yeast, wheat, corn, milk, egg, soy, glutens, or sugar", but when I received it the first of the 'other' ingredients is Soybean Oil. I didn't give it one star because I couldn't try it and rightfully say I hated it, I just don't like the fact of the soy. For others it probably is a great deal.
