review/text: Tums has been making antacids for many years but it was only recently that the company decided to stray from its usual chalky tablet formula. The result is Tums Smooth Dissolve, an antacid tablet that works as effectively as regular Tums without so much of the chalky residue.When I first heard about this product, I assumed that it was going to be harder and similar to a cough drop. This isn't the case. The tablets are smoother than regular Tums, and that means less of the chalky bits of the tablet will be stuck in your teeth after you chew. But they are not completely smooth. This means there is still some residue, it just isn't as bad as with regular Tums. The body of these tablets is a little bit softer and less crunchy, making them break apart more easily than other tablets. But they are not like a cough drop or other medicine that require a good amount of time to dissolve completely.Tums makes this antacid in assorted flavors to satisfy most anyone's taste preferences. The tablets are pretty effective, too, bringing fast relief to an upset stomach. They also include calcium and some people take them as a calcium supplement. They are not strong enough to handle the more extreme cases of acid buildup, like that brought about by acid reflux disease. But they are good enough to eliminate most of the symptoms of common heartburn and acid indigestion.
