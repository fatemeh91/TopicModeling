review/text: A cervical posture band is not meant to be totally comfortable. There has to be enough pressure to pull your shoulders back. But - even though I have narrow shoulders and even when it's a little loose - this one really cuts into my armpits if I wear it against my skin. Doesn't do any good if it's loose, of course. So I wear it over a tee shirt and it does help quite a bit. It even helps relieve my tension headaches! As small as it is, I doubt it would work for a large, or a muscular person. Even the more expensive one I used to have rode up on my back. Didn't seem to make any difference on how it worked.
