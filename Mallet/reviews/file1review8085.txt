review/text: I bought this hoping it would save my nails when washing certain items that needed harder scrubbing than a dishcloth can do. It fits in my hand easily and does the exact job I need it to do. I saw some staining on the bristles from tomato sauce left in pan but luckily it washed/rinsed out by the time I was finished with those dishes. It is easy to fill with soap but unless I am really mindful how hard I squeeze the top - I feel like too much soap can be dispensed. All in all, I am happy with this item.
