review/text: Okay I figure if I pay more for a pen, I might actually get a pen that writes smoothly. I loved it when I got it and then just like cheap pens it breaks within 2 months of use. The pen will no longer protract (is that the correct word?) Well it stays retracted and when I try to write with it, the ink tip retracts and won't stay out. I'll keep trying to find the perfectly made pen that lasts! This one goes in the reject pile.
