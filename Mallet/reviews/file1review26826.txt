review/text: I've been ordering this product mainly through Bodybuilding.com. I went ahead and purchased this 5 lb., choc. chip flavor from Amazon, due to the fact that I saved on free shipping and no tax.I first opended the product and noticed the smell of it was different. I mixed up a protein shake and immediately notice bland taste to it.I can compare it to the choc. chip I purchased from Bodybuilding .com, which has a fresh taste to it.So, it seems to me that Amazon receives Gold Standard Whey products that have past their expiration date. It still works as I do drink it daily, sometimes twice on the days I work out at the gym. I'm still getting good results and can tolerate the taste.I believe I'll not order this product from Amazon any longer and continue to order from Bodybuilding.comThis is only my opinion, take it or leave it...good luck!
