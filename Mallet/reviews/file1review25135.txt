review/text: I ordered this hoping to increase my energy and desire to work out. I read reviews of the product at other sites which were mostly positive. I saw some complaints about taste and loss of sleep. But, mostly the reviewers said that they made gains in size and strength. They claimed an increase in sexual potency as well. So here are my opinions.Pros:The taste kind of reminded me of real maple but not sweet.Cons:I did notice some sleep difficulty but it went away if I took it earlier in the evening usually after eating.I did not feel more energetic. I did not have any gains in size or strength. I had no difference in sexual potency.So, it did not work.I gave it two stars only because "hate" seems a pretty strong term. The definition of 1 star is "I hate this product."I say spend your money on a good whey protein.
