review/text: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply to my purchase, l was most disgusted that you could take from me $99.00 US dollars for an item that was discontinued the same month l purchased it, as l live in South Africa and my daughter lives in the USA l buy me goods thru her, l tried to get the test strips the same time l bought the monitor and then heard that they were discontinued, to my disgust l was unable to notify them as they were on an answering machine, so as at this time l am a very unhappy customer who feels that it was dishonest of you not to tell me that the lifestream was discontinued but you still took my money.
