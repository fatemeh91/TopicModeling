review/text: My 15 yo pug leaks pee when he sleeps deeply. Because of this, I now own several different size and types of incontinence pads. At 52", this is a great size for a wandering dog.sometimes, he leaks quite a lot, maybe two to three cups, and this one has never leaked off the edge or through the bottom. He can now sleep on the bed again.Why does ths one get five stars? It's comfortable to sleep on, both for me and my pug. He hates the pads, feels like they are a punishment, so he'll lay anywhere but on the pad. He'll even scratch it and fold them over to not lay on them. Not this one, maybe the ultra plus means the nice soft cover or the little padded squares. Either way, it feels nice. I sleep with very little on and don't mind the pad at all. It's not scratchy or pilly like other pads, even after several washings. This one is so good we bought a couple more.The oldest bought about 8 months ago has stood up. Can't tell it apart from the newer ones purchased a month ago. Stands up to washer on hot with bleach and dries easily in machine. I have noticed the price fluctuates quite a bit, so keep your eye on it for the best deal.
