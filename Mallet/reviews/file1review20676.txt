review/text: I had the same experience as the fellow who wrote the July '06 review. I ordered the part in the first week of May '06 to only have it delayed 3 times for shipment. I just got another delay notice from Amazon today, July 10. At this rate they'll never ship the item.If they can't ship, why in the world do they list this item???UPDATE: Amazon finally shipped the product after the 3rd delay. Replacing the screen/cutter restores the shaver to like-new performance. Overall I find the Activator to give a decent shave with minor irritation. Using a William's Lectric Shave helps even more by reducing irritation to nearly zero, lightly lubes the screen/cutter and keeps the screen reasonably cool to the touch. My previous screen did last about 19 months so the longevity (in my case) is excellent.
