review/text: I tried these to compare to the "Nozovent Large". The large nozovent is hard to find, hurt quite a bit the first few weeks, but works great in increasing the airflow alot. Now, this Snooze feels to me for the first few minutes, it might povide a little more airflow, but than I notice very clearly, that it actually limits the airflow due it's relatively small tubes. When breathing in, I clearly feel the resistance it creates in the airflow. And I am using the large version. So, I think the design idea is great, but the shape is not optimized yet. This needs a re-design. It might help others, depending on their nose, but for me, the Nozovent Large is much, much, much better. The difference between Snooze and Nozovent is, Snooze uses tubes, which take away more airflow space inside the nose than Nozovent, which uses just 2 "paddles" that press outwards. Of cause, everyone's nose is different, and I would not be surprised if Snooze works great for some noses, just not for mine. I could not find the Nozovent Large on Amazon, and therefore could not provide a product link.
