review/text: There are many different types of prenatal vitamins, and so if this is your first pregnancy you will probably be just as lost as I was on which is the best for me. I came to amazon and just picked the most bought prenatal vitamin and figured it must be good.The pills are VERY big, and they cause *for me* a lot of heartburn. They make me pretty sick everytime I take them. So I pretty much have stopped taking them. You have the taste in your mouth for a while after taking them.Overall there are many other pills out there that you can buy that are much smaller..if anything else. Stuart prenatal vitamins are pretty popular, and pretty easy to take.As far as rainbow lite, its as if its a punishment everytime i have to take it.So in concluding, id say rainbow lite works, but they are just uncomfortable..And if you could find another brand that works for you, I would try that first.
