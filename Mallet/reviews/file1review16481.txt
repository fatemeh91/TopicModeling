review/text: For the last 6 years, I've had chronic acid reflux and stomach problems. I did some research and read a book by Doctor who mentioned that a majority of acid reflux victims have a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, and how most doctors (and pharmaceuticals) instantly will provide a simple "coverup" of the symptoms by prescribing a variety of antacids on the market that simply neutralize the stomach. These products provide temporary relief (for the most part), but effect the bodies natural process of digestion and nutrient absorption as well. I know...I've been on Nexium, Pepcid, Gaviscon, and many other doctor prescribed medicines for years. I finally decided to give it a chance, and see if getting off all the med's and letting my body work for itself naturally. I stopped taking my antacid (yes...I was scared to death) and started the new regiment of the betaine hydrochloride at breakfast, lunch and dinner. I realized you have to experiment with what your body can handle. I started off with two tablets at each meal, and over a two week period went to one tablet per meal. I then discovered that I didn't need the HCL at breakfast, and only continued using one tablet at lunch and dinner (foods and meat that are harder to digest). I must say...after three months, my reflux is GONE! In addition to the betaine hydrochloride, I take a 1000mg d-Limonene (orange peel oil) softgel, which helps soothe the stomach. I have to admit, my body feels better, and my reflux is gone. I didn't have just a little reflux, I had one of the worst and most chronic form acid reflux. This caused me to have breath odor problems, sinus problems, and major throat irritation. It's all gone. :)
