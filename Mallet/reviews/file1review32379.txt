review/text: For some reason the material stings like mild chili pepper. Not sure if it is a mild allergic reaction or if it affect everybody.Anyway this makes it unsuitable for use as a gag, or for long duration insertion without covering it in a rubber. Still the effect could be used to advantage in some situations.
