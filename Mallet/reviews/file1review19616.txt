review/text: I previously bought a stand alone potty seat that was cute and made sounds but, frankly, it frightened my son a bit. Besides that, he told me he wanted to use the "big" potty. So I needed a seat that would fit on my elongated bowl toilets and my search (and a friends recommendation) led me to this seat. I kept it in my Amazon cart for a while and, like most Amazon items, the price fluctuated a bit. I finally bought it when it was around $23.00. Once I received the seat, I immediately wanted to see how well it would work on my elongated seats. I turned the dial and within seconds it was a perfect fit for my toilet. My son seem very interested in it and wanted to use it. That made me happy. It seems like it is comfortable for him to sit on and we have never had a problem with the splash guard not working properly or pee getting anywhere it shouldn't. It is easy to clean and we move it on and off the toilet all day long, which is nice. It is a nice, clean looking seat too, which I like.We would definitely buy this seat again and we have recommended it to a few friends.
