review/text: My wife and I were introduced to this product whilst on a visit to the USA. Very unfortunately we live in the UK and the company which manufactures this item is unable to provide this item to us in the UK. Perforce we are buying this item from AMAZON and have to pay a very large amount towards frieght and custom duty. But inspite of the heavy price the product is worth the money. The product is value for money. Please make sure that you are Type II diabetic. Use proper diet and the blood sugar will stay in control. Our Hb1C is now lower than before we took this product. My wife's medication has been since reduced.
