review/text: When it comes to this type of product I always go for the OXO brand first because I haven't bought one yet where I do not like the grip. They, by far, have the most comfortable grips than any other brand I've tried and this one is no different. I like how small the brush itself is and how easy it is to use it for long periods of time without my hand hurting. I've been using it regularly for four months now and it is starting to show wear and tear but you know what? It's inexpensive and I like it so much, I don't mind having to buy a new one. This time, I think I'll get two :)
