review/text: Flat feet, arch and heel has been hurting when walking for Months. Tried several 'jel' inserts that were comfortable but did not help me. THESE DO!If I go a day without wearing these I can feel the aches coming back. These are about half the length of your shoe but they still stay put without slopping.3 levels of arch support and at first it feels like a ball under your arch that leads to 'happy feet'. 2 pair even.Excellent product.
