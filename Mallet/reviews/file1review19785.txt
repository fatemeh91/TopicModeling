review/text: I purchased one of these several months ago in order to transition my son from a potty chair to using the real thing. I love this potty seat! It fits well all shapes of toilet seats and is secure. The slim design also travels well. My son never feels like he's going to "fall in". I love this seat so much I'm going to order a second one for another restroom. Well worth the 25$!
