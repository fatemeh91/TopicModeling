review/text: Today was my first day using these. I put them in a pair of boots that I love but would always cause my feet discomfort by mid day(especially my left foot). The first thing I would do after getting home from work would be to take off my boots. Well today my feet felt great all day and when I got home there was NO hurry to get the boots off!! And this was just the first day, I cant wait to see how things are in another month or two! I was leary about this product when I saw it advertised but thought what the heck, if it doesnt work I'll return them. If it doesnt do anything else but give my feet comfort in my boots/shoes, then it was worth buying! I do recommend them!
