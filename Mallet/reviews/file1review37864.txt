review/text: First off, these pills have been a remedy for teething in my family for over 50 yrs. My mother used it on all 7 of her children and of course when i had my child she recommend i use it on him as well. I never heard about the FDA warning until the other day when i read someones review here on Amazon. Having my second child recently who's teething naturally I was concerned. After reading about Belladonna I was disturbed to find out the side effect which are symptoms such as seizures, difficulty breathing, lethargy, excessive sleepiness, muscle weakness, skin flushing, constipation, difficulty urinating, or agitation. Although this is reason for concern I had to wonder if this FDA hype. Everyone in my family has used Humphreys and has given it to there children with no negative side effects. It works much better and is less of a hassle then orajel. I decided to go ahead and purchase this product although I will be very cautious ensuring I only use it as directed as well as monitor my child's health.
