review/text: These condoms have some renown for being made in Japan and therefore high-quality. The package of 100 I ordered from GreenWeb are in fine condition, and smell normal - only a little like latex compared to my old standby, Trojan. The shipped package consists entirely of a large plastic bag full of the condoms and one deflated packing pillow, so don't expect another cardboard box to open. I don't care, since like most mass manufactured products you'll generally get a run of either good or bad products, regardless of the frilly exterior packaging you're about to throw away.All condoms are packaged in dark blue as pictured on the main product page, with "Made in Thailand" clearly printed on the reverse side (not currently pictured). I'm adding this picture to the product page.Based on the highly varying reports I've read in reviews here and on the vendor pages, I postulate the Okamoto company has recently changed to Thailand production and the inventory is in flux. The silver packaging that still appears on some of this product's pages seems to be of higher quality than the dark blue packaging, and the manufacturer claims in the product details specifically that the product is in new packaging but is still the same high quality product.I got these for around 12 cents each buying 100, and I've seen other vendors charge twice as much for these and show the older, simpler product details: "no latex smell, very sensitive, thin condom, lubricated". Maybe some of these legendary condoms are still available? I'm not sure, but for the difference in smell and price between what I received and anything in the drug store, these are well worth it.
