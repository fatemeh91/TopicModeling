review/text: I bought this product because I needed something for work lunch that was simple and quick to make. I don't have time to make lunch at home so I was eating out for a few days at work and got this instead because it was simple to make and it satisfied my appetite from lunch to the end of my shift. It tastes great, keeps me full and its easy to digest. This with a snack bar or a fruit are a great combo.
