review/text: This product combines perfect with my Norelco advantega razor. I have very sensitive skin and this gel makes mine very smooth so when I shave it doesn't irritates my face and to be honest, this has been my all time problem. With the Norelco advantage and this gel, my problems are gone. I trully recommend it.The only down I found on this product is that it doesn't last to much shaves.
