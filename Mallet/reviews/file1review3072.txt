review/text: I haven't tried every condom made in the world but I've tried most of the big name brands. Crown-Okamoto Super Thin Condoms are by far the thinnest I've ever tried and that's a great thing (except for the times when she doesn't want you to go just yet lol, but who doesn't have those times regardless). I highly recommend you try these out and so far I can't find a better price for condoms for the amount given. Gotta try these out!
