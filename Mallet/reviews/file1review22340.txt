review/text: This is comfortable material , but very difficult to achieve snug fit . A gap is created in the cradle of the thumb and forefinger when wrapped . I added some Velcro to the under strap to keep that in place while the main wrap is done. Without that, it is impossible to wrap and close without two people.
