review/text: I am so thrilled that I found this brush! I was looking for a long time for a good brush to use with our nalgene bottles. They are hard to clean with the small mouth but this brush allows to get all the way to the bottom of our large nalgene bottles and cleans them well. If you have Nalgene bottles, you need this brush.
