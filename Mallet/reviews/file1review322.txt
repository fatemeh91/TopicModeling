review/text: The vibrator worked well for six months or so we had it, but over that time the silicone became discolored (turned a yellowish color) inside where the circular beads rotate and it just spread from there towards the base. The entire vibrator turned a yellow tint from where the beads are down to the base. It was one of our favorite toys for a while, until we discovered how cheaply built it was. The battery holder was the problem. It is cheaply made, so the thin contacts in the battery compartment which slides into the device are the most likely thing to break, which we soon discovered. What I learned from this was, you have to put your money where your mouth is when it comes to getting a quality sex toy. If you go cheap, you can go home. Forget this one. It is not a good investment and it will just break on you. In the short term, a couple of months, it will last, but don't expect it to work much longer than that. We didn't even use it that often and it still broke down. Also, it was only $25 when we bought it, now they have gone up on the price. Forget it - NOT worth your money people! If you want a quality product, try the Lelo vibrators out. Lelo's products have a lifetime warranty and you never have to buy batteries because they are rechargeable.
