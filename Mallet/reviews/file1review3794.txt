review/text: I have severe nausea so I wasnt completely surprised when it did not help my nausea, but that is the only reason I am giving it lower stars. The flavor of this tea makes it one of my new favorites. Eventhough I will still be in search of a stomach cure, at least I found a good tea to drink in the meantime.
