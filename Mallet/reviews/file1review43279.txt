review/text: I was very excited to try this product. This is my second pregnancy, and my first daughter weighed 10 lbs 6 ozs, and I am not a very big woman. This pregnancy has been rough, my body seems to be worn out, and to beat it all, I work at a hospital and am on my feet for 12-13 hours a day. I thought the cradle would help, but it is just a jumble of elastic. It does not support like it claims and I did not even notice ANY difference in having it on. AND, you can see it under your top, I wore mine with my scrub tops and I peeped out of the shoulder area and all day people asked what it was. Not cool:-( Buyer beware...save your money!!!
