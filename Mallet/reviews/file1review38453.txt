review/text: The Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator actually works. I'm a female who does not have baby thin hair. I've purchased everything from a wax system to a hair removal "lotion" and nothing works like this method. The little tweezers pull even the thickest of hair and leaves my legs feeling and looking smooth! No sticky mess, no burning skin or unbearable smell. It's so easy, I feel silly not to have found this sooner. It's almost completely painless, but I will note that I've got a pretty high tolerance for pain. I would recommend this to the person who does not have time, space, or energy for the self-waxing production and has tried everything else to get smooth legs.
