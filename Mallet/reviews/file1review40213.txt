review/text: I really like this toothpaste because it leaves an extremely fresh feeling and aftertaste in my mouth. I had a ""clean"" feeling for a much longer period of time than with my usual toothpaste. The baking soda and peroxide can be actually be felt working while you brush. I would definitely buy this product again!
