review/text: So far I have about 30 of her balms, and 1 Body Butter Stick. They are all fabulous! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips. The scents are very true to their names. My favorites are probably Margarita, Coconut Lemongrass, and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon. I've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends, and I highly reccommend it to you!
