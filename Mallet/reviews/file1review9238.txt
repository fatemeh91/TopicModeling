review/text: The pill boxes are well designed and the only complaint is that the boxes don't snap into the stand but just rest there in slots. Not too big of a deal but snapping into place would have been better for me. At the same time it may have been a pain if it snapped into place too securely so maybe its just me. All in all a great purchase.UPDATE 7/18/12: Its actually better that they don't snap into place. Works just great as is and a great product.
