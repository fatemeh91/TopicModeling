review/text: This is the perfect pan for preparing or reheating small meals in your oven, providing excellent cooking/heating quality! The ribbed bottom prevents sticking and even gives that 'grilled' look to meats and poultry at higher heats. Plus the ribbed bottom provides an area for grease to drain in to if you are cooking oily foods like fish, cheese, etc.For extra non-stick quality one can always add a light spray of PAM or similar non-stick food preparation, but I find it seldom necessary as foods rarely stick to this great pan.These pans are durable, heat well and cool quickly, and are perfect for disposable cooking of that quick, low-cleanup meal!
