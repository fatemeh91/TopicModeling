review/text: I bought this item with active tone and active moist, this three products are very generic and applicable to normal face types. I never had any acne problem, I never had any skin problem before, I was using Babe until now and my skin was perfect even when I was at 17s I never had any acne problem. But since I started using this product my skin became awful, it is unbelievable, I paid a lot of money and I can not use it, if I attempt to use it, in 1-2 days I start having at least 4-5 strange acnes all over my face. I strongly not recommend anyone to buy it.
