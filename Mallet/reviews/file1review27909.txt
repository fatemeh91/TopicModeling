review/text: I'm finishing up my first 5lb tub. Getting ready to order my next tub. I only take it after I work out, so I'm definitely not hard core with it.The issue I was hoping it would solve was that as I'm approaching 40, it seemed that my recovery time was getting worse and worse. I especially found that as I lifted legs hard, they would just get more and more sore. Sometimes being sore for 4 days after I'd lift. And I try to lift legs 2x a week which was getting more and more difficult.Since taking this I've found I am not nearly as sore as I was before. I've also noticed myself going up weight much quicker. I'm also putting on a bit of muscle (which I don't really want although I look better), but I'm willing to deal with it for the improved recovery.I've always drank 2 16oz glasses of skim milk every day. Now I just take one of those glasses of milk with the Double Rich Chocolate after I work out. I honestly think it tastes better than most chocolate milks. I don't understand how anyone could complain if they mix it with skim milk. However, I've never tried it with just water.I could not recommend it more if you are like me and maybe not recovering like you did in your 20's and early 30's.
