review/text: This is the first toothpaste I've used that has actually whitened my teeth noticeably. The difference is quite astonishing and I would recommend this to anyone who is an avid coffee drinker like me. The downside however is that is makes your teeth sensitive, so it would be best to alternate between this and another normal toothpaste. Otherwise, given the amazing results and cheap price, this toothpaste is a miracle.
