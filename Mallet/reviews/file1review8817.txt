review/text: I have been taking Green Vibrance for years. I mix it w/ a little water and about 4 oz of Gatoraid and have a tsp of fruit flavored fish oil (yum- :~) before exersizing in the AM. I used to have some muscle/joint pain, which I don't really have anymore, and I'm pretty darn healthy. I definately recommend this product. Drink up!
