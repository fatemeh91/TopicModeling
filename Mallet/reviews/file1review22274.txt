review/text: This flat, waxed floss slips easily between tightely spaced teeth and into the peridontal region between gum and tooth to scrap the tooth surface below the gum line where peridontal disease develops. Proper use of this floss disrupts pockets forming below the gum line, which helps recovery and prevents complications due to deepening pockets and peridontal disease. Flossing can be followed by an effective mouth wash lavage using Waterpik or similar device.
