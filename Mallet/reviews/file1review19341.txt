review/text: Works great, easily fits the mattress, easy to wash (just dry on cold), feels like a normal cover and is not hot or uncomfortable in summer.So far, it has prevented all accidents from leaking through no problem, I have not tested a gallon, but seems reasonably padded anyways.Just purchased a second one, so one can always stay one if the second is in the washer/dryer. Cost is OK, ours is protecting a 250 USD mattress, for 60 USD for both, that's a reasonable ratio.Very happy with it, can recommend.
