review/text: Because of the majority of the reviews published, I have been thru 2 bottles of this product now, which I bought at my local CoOp, and I have to say I like. It works well for me. My dishes are clean, no film (though I do use Ecover rinse aid). I do pre-rinse my dishes, but I don't, by any means, scrub them prior to putting them in the dishwasher. I have never over-flowed the washer with suds. I like the lavender smell that fills my kitchen and lingers, mildly, on my dishes for a brief period of time. I live in the SW part of the Country so maybe the hard water has something to do with the quality of cleanliness different people get from this product. If you can find it locally pick up a bottle and give it a try before buying a whole case. But for me, I really like it!
