review/text: I just purchased the HEM-711AC from Amazon after reading the positive reviews here. The monitor was a breeze to set up and easy to use. (Make sure you follow the instructions for band placement and how to sit when using so you get an accurate read). The item comes with a nice little carrying case and an AC adapter allowing you to save on the batteries (though it can also use batteries which makes it nice for traveling too). I do recall reading a review or two that mentioned the arm band can squeeze a little tight. I would agree with that a bit. It certainly feels tighter than at the doctor office but it's not so tight that it feels like your arm is going to be hurt from it. Buy with confidence.
