review/text: This is a very nice little sweeper. You can't beat it for the money. Works great picking up off my nice wool rugs. The rubber strip that protects from hitting baseboards did come off and I couldn't get it to go back on but I don't need it anyway so it's no big deal to me. Sure beats having to use a vacuum which kills my back. I love this little jewel!
