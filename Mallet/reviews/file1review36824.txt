review/text: I have end stage arthritis in my right hip. I had my wife help me get socks on my right foot, otherwise it was a slow painful stretch for me to bend my leg and pull up on my toes to get the socks on. With this product, I slip the sock over the cloth part. I then let the sock aid almost lie on the floor and I slip my foot into it. I have to pull the sock over my heel and then I can pull the sock aid up my calf and lo and behold, the sock is on. I us a compression knee sleeve and I use the sock aid to get that on too.
