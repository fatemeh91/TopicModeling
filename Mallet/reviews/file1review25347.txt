review/text: I just received these and will post my opinion about how well they work once I've got spent some time wearing them. They were promptly sent and carefully packaged. However, as a value I see very little to recommend. Shipped, these cost me $38 and I'd guess that the expense of manufacturing the product itself was no more than the cost of the box it came it (a thin cardboard thing with a cellophane "window") - certainly no more than a dollar in total for the two. The plastic is a low-density expanded foam whose durability I have concerns about. I would strongly recommend prospective buyers take another look at cheaper alternatives.09/25/11 Update: My concern about the longevity (due to the foam that these are made from) has turned out to be unfounded. Three years after purchase, these are performing well and are quite durable.
