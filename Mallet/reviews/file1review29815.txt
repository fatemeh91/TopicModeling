review/text: I purchased the Vapor-Eze Vaporizer/Aromatherapy Unit based upon the product reviews. I decided to write this review for the benefit of other people who are trying to make a good purchase decision. I generally love the smell of menthol or eucalyptus...but this smell really bothers me. Also, the smell without the moisture really HURTS my sinuses - very painful. We live in the Pacific Northwest and have plenty of humidity in the air - so I'm not sure what the problem is. For the past 40 yrs we have used various models of the Vicks Vaporizer - we add the water; some Vicks ointment/liquid - it puts warm moisture into the air - it feels and smells great.A previous commenter noted they were disappointed the Vapor-Eze fragrance smell did not last longer. I think the smell lasts plenty long - too long. If you are planning to put this unit in an infants or childs room you might reconsider. If this hurts their sinuses - as it did mine - you won't know why they are crying.I'm going to order the Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier instead.
