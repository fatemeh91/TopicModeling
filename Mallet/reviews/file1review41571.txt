review/text: I recently received the 9400 for a Christmas present, and I couldn't be happier. This is my second Oral B electric brush. This unit makes brushing easy, effortless, and almost fun.This toothbrush comes with so many innovative and useful features such as* 30 second quadrant timer (can be set to a two minute timer) which is very useful.* LCD, although you can't see the display when you are brushing it is nice to see exactly how long you've brushed. Plus it just looks cool.* Four brushing modes. Clean, Soft, Massage, Polish.* Pressure sensor which will adjust so you don't hurt yourself.* A "smartchip" in the brushheads that communicate with the unit to let you know when to change them. The chip will also tell the unit which brush mode to use depending on which head is inserted (For instance you insert a PowerPolisher head and the unit will switch to the Polish setting).* A base station charger that can be removed from the larger stand. Which is perfect for when you are traveling.* You can choose to leave the unit charging all the time with no worry about battery life dropping (as long as you discharge the battery completely every six months).*The base station has a flip-up storage compartment for (4) brush heads.For those of you wondering, the unit comes with one FlossAction head and one PowerPolisher head. It also comes with a travel case and charger base station.You will not be disappointed with this unit. This toothbrush is a bargain at twice the price, and comes with a 2 year warranty.
