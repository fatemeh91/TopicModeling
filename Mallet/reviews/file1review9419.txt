review/text: I purchased 2 of this item thinking that it was a great idea to get medications organized. The items arrived and was very disappointed with the quality. It was so poorly designed that the tiny latch which keeps the container closed doesn't work at all. What a total waste of money. Its a cheap piece of plastic not worth the $7+ asking price. Don't be fooled.
