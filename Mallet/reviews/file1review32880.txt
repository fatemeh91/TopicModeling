review/text: This tea tastes ok, but the results are amazing! I have always had BI issues...or lack of BI movement in general. This stuff sure gets things going. Once in a while its a rush feeling, but for the most part it is like clockwork. I take the tea after dinner, before an evening walk. The evening walk seems to help get the tea around my system and when I wake up BOOM. Like magic. This stuff has worked for me consistently over the past 1.5 years and I hope it continues to work...because NOTHING else did! ENJOY!
