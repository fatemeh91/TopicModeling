review/text: This is a good bottle brush, especially for cleaning the inside of nalgene or other plastic-type water bottles. It's got a long handle with a sturdy rubber grip and is definitely good quality.The only issue that I have had with it is that the bristles are on the soft side, which is fine for soaping down water bottles, but not so good for giving my stained travel coffee mugs a good cleaning after they have been sitting all day. If you really want to give a bottle a good scour, this is probably not your brush. It is however a good brush otherwise and will go where a sponge can't.
