review/text: As the title says, this is great for the car or a boat, even in a barn or stable. This was given to me as a present, and, if you know me, you know why!! Amazingly, I have yet to use it. The metal box is great, I have already stepped on it, dropped it in a parking lot and it tumbled out of the car and plopped into a good puddle, yet the contents were safe. Almost everything you will need is in the metal container. The only addition I wll be making is an ace bandage, probably the single sticky version, but I think there should be an ace bandage in every first aid kit. If you have a van or truck, it is able to be mounted inside of the vehicle, but the case fits just fine in the hatch of my PT (along with ALL sorts of other stuff). So, 4 stars because it is what they say, minus one only because, from my past experiences I feel you should have an ace bandage in every first aid kit.
