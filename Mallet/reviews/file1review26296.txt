review/text: I think these are pretty good. I like the not-too-sweet flavor and the consistency is like soft-baked biscotti, which I ejoyed.I have had the raisin-almond, mango-coconut and the apple. I really like the mango-coconut, the apple is pretty good too -- but I DO NOT recommend the raisin-almond, it has a harsh aftertaste that the other 2 do not.It is nice to find a tasty snack bar that I can keep in my purse during the warm/hot months and not worry about a gooey mess.
