review/text: Taking protein is something you have to get used to. I haven't tried one yet that I would just drink for the heck of it. They all taste funky. But, this Cookies and Cream flavor from Champion has been the best for me. Also, Champion has much lower sugar than, for instance, Muscle Milk. Therefore, if you're looking to lose weight, something like this would probably be better. It's working for me. 2 scoops, 2 times a day!
