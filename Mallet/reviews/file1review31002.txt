review/text: I love Osteo Bi Flex, but not in this triple strength tablet that is so large I gag on it and can't get it down. The package says easy to swallow, but I choked so badly, my spouse came running. I'm glad I saved the old bottle, because there are so many variations in this product that it is easy to buy the wrong type. I will avoid the Triple Strength from now on, and go with my usualOsteo Bi-Flex MSM Advanced Joint Shield Formula with 5-Loxin, Twin Pack, 120 Ct. eachwhich I have used for the past year, and which helped my bad knee so much. If you compute the cost per pill, this is the least expensive in spite of the high up-front cost for the two bottle package.
