review/text: I bought this as a gag gift for myself. Package came on time and discreetly. When I finally opened the package the smell of the latex/silicone made me gag. Very strong smell. I washed this product immediately thinking it might help alleviate some of the smell but nothing worked. The product itself was a very very nice size. But just a little too much in the head for your average girl. The head is wider but the rest of the product is just right. Really wish that all of their products do not smell the same.
