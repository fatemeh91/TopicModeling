review/text: Strap does not have any give to it, becoming more of a tourniquet than a support brace. As a racquetball player, for the brace to become effective (immobilize the aggravated tendon on the innerside of the elbow) I had to tighten the strap significantly. Since there is no elasticity in the strap, after a half hour my arm was sore from the tightness of the strap. Recommed staying away from this type of brace. If you are playing sports, such as tennis or racquetball, where you are constantly gripping a racquet and need an effective elbow brace, recommend you get Futuro Elbow Support With Pressure Pads.
