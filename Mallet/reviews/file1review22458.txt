review/text: I have taken "SOURCE OF LIFE" vitamins for I can't remember how long..They make me feel great all day long. The only thing I don't like is the price increases. Thank God for Amazon.com. I was all set to re-order from another company and they wanted $[...] which is $[...] more than my previous order...I decided to shop and wow! what a difference. Thank You AMAZON! $[...] Each w/ free shipping. I decided to order two. Keep up the good work AMAZON.SEARAY-TROY HILL, PITTSBURGH, PA.
