review/text: For anyone sick of shaving and who want's to save some money on waxing I recommend this product. I bought my first Satinelle back in the '90's and haven't shaved my legs since. The cord wore out so I just got this replacement. To minimize pain from hair removal, get a wax, then use the dry loufa that comes with the epilator afterwards, and a week to 10 days later when you start to get sparse growth use the epilator. Stay on it after that. I used to wait 30 days to epilate now I do it about every 10 days - that way it just "tingles" vs. hurting and there is a lot less hair to deal with.
