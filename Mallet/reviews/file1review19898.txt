review/text: We bought a cheapo Elmo seat before this, not paying much attention to the shape of it. Realized too late we have an oval toilet seat and it was a round potty attachment. Needless to say, it didn't fit and he slid all over. Ordered the Bjorn and got it the next day, amazing!! Owen can set it on the toilet, climb up, sit and finish up with no mess. The guard really works to keep the pee in as long as he sits far enough back. It is so easy to use and we take it to others' houses and it fits well on every seat so far. We installed a 3M removable hook on the wall behind the toilet where it can hang out of the way when not in use, too. This has allowed me to say that finally, my son is FULLY potty trained! Hooray!!
