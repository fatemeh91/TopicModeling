review/text: I had a lot of soreness with disposable nursing pads, and a lactation specialist recommended these to me. They work great! Are much more comfortable than disposables, and stop leaking. I don't put them in the dryer, just let them airdry after washing and they have maintained their shape fine (no bulkiness). This is the first brand of washable nursing brands I've tried, but they've worked so well I'll keep using this product.
