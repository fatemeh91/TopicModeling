review/text: I bought that item after having read the reviews, most of them where positive, but I'm dissapointed by it.It's hard to get the soap out of there. I have to push hard and a few times before the soap is coming a little bit out. It's easy to clean plates, pots and pans. As I use only non stick pans, it's perfect cause it doesn't scratch them. Forget cleaning glasses,cups or even flatware with it.
