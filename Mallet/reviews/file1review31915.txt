review/text: I definately appreciate this product for the good feeling I have after using it; it is a solid player in my detox routine. I first tried mixing it with apple juice but did not like it. I think it goes well with blueberry, bilberry, raspberry or cherry juices. It's not something I want to sip, I just shake a scoop with 6 oz or less of juice in a small Mason jar and knock it back. No big deal. My wife likes to mix it half and half with Kyo Green and she likes the flavor better that way.Several different merchants sell this on Amazon, be sure to check the price because it varies greatly.
