review/text: This machine is fantastic. It replaces an old one that didn't stop working, the wand cracked and parts were not available since it was at least 30 years old. The only problem with the new one is the reservoir doesn't fit when it is turned over with the wand in place. You have to find a place for it on the counter and it will take up a lot of room if you travel. My teeth already look great and gums also and I am 71 years old.Controling the pressure-output- is great. On and off control could have beeen placed in a different place. Buy it! Buy it!
