review/text: I encountered these cubes in a bar in the Netherlands last week. They are so cool, you put them in your cocktails and they light them up. You can also dance with them (if you want to). The best part about them is that you can stop them working and they're not like the glow snap stuff you get at Disney, that lasts a few hours and then dies on you. They last for ages!!
