review/text: I bought this product over a year ago but only now needed to write a review. It has stopped holding a charge. When it worked it was great. Sharp, easy to use, easy to clean. It help a charge for a while in the beginning but now it wont even hold a charge for a day.I will be contacting Remington to see what they can do. I assume it is out of warranty.The rechargeable trimmer is very convenient, but I guess I will have to find a different company that uses better batteries.
