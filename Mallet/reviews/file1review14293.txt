review/text: When I saw this product I was delighted to think that this may lessen the endlessly repetitive and futile chore, so I scoured the tub until it was gleaming and tried it for a month. As previous posters have noted, the unit does not spray the tub- the exact area you need to prevent scum from building up. It is also very loud, but on the good side, the solution is not harsh smelling. So here we are 1 month later and I am again slaving away at the stubborn buildup. This product did absolutely nothing and was a complete waste of money.
