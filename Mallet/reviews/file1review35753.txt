review/text: This product was a big disappointment. If you are trying to pull up a typical dress zipper that runs from the butt all the way to the neck, then don't buy this. Its not long enough. Its also cheaply made. I have a disabling injury to my right arm and hand and bought it because it looked so easy to use. You still have to use two hands, one to hold the dress together and the other to pull the zipper. Otherwise, the you can't pull the zipper up.
