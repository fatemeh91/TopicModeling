review/text: I received this trimmer over 2 years ago for Christmas and it works better than any other beard trimmer I have used. It's easily adjustable and I find the battery to hold a charge for weeks before needing a recharge. I think that the negative battery reviews come from people that don't understand how to charge a NiCad battery. You only charge it once the battery is completely dead, then let it charge fully before use. Do this and this battery will last you 4-5 years. I use this trimmer once a week and charge it once every 6 weeks. It doesn't get any better than that!
