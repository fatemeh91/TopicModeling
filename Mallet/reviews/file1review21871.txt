review/text: I have been suffering from lower leg tendinitis for six months now. I'm a runner and cyclist...so you can imagine how such a thing can really slow me down. I ordered this ice wrap to help with the icing of my lower leg to reduce inflammation. I'm not sure if I got the correct size, as I do have some difficulty getting this wrap on and off. I've used it a hand full of times and the ice gel packs seem to last anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes, which is just right for proper icing. My leg always feels better when I take it off. I'm a little worried the construction won't hold up, so we'll see how long it lasts. The ice gel packs are sewn into the inside lining of the wrap, to focus the icing effect on your shin. I twist it a little bit to focus the icing on my inner leg next to the shin. Other than seeing how long it will last, its done the job I bought it for. Give it a try!
