review/text: This thing works reasonably well as a hot (dry) mask. However, the product description at Amazon says that it can be heated in the microwave oven "or even hot water," so my intention was to use it dampened. The directions that came with the device say "do not get the product's wet." The two directions seem to be mutually exclusive. It is not worth my time to send it back, but if you want to use it for moist heat--forget about it.
