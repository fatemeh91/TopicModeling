review/text: I am 30 years old and my husband is 29. We have been trying for about 4 months to get pregnant without success. I began to take FertilAid and noticed changes (for the better) right away! My period was on time and the flow seemed so much richer, the color more like you hear described as ideal. For years now my period has been irregular and the blood a very dark color instead of pinkish red which is ideal. Right away, using this product, my body was transformed! Within the first month I became pregnant! I am now 4 weeks, going on 5 weeks along! I totally believe this product helped me to concieve, I truly hope it can help you too!
