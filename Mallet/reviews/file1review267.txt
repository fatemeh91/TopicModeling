review/text: First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The "rabbit ears" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the "floating beads" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though.
