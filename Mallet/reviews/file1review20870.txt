review/text: I purchased this model of shaver after doing probably a dozen hours of research on the pros and cons of different brands models, and after reading tons of reviews. This shaver was a gift for my husband who is very picky and therefore rather difficult to shop for. He has to have the best and finest things in any category, and he hates everything unless it was his decision to purchase. I swear I am not making this up. So, I was thoroughly expecting him to say he hated the shaver and to send it back. Much to my surprise, he actually likes it. The Braun 8585 Activator Self-Cleaning Shaving System is flat and about the size of the old two-head shavers (you never see those sold anymore, only 3-head ones). In my opinion the smaller shaver gives better maneuverability. Shavers almost all claim to be as close as a blade, but this one nearly delivers on that promise. They could claim to be "99.5% as close as a blade" and be completely accurate. You'll want to shave prior to showering, since the skin tends to swell a bit in hot water. The shaver's self cleaning feature is fabulous and works well; it's like having a brand new shaver every time. I don't know this for sure, because I would never dream of using my husband's shaver, but it seems like it would work just as well for women, since they don't make women's shavers as nice as this one. Oh, ok, so maybe I tried it out. I have a knack for somehow managing to half amputate my leg while shaving, so it was a nice easy and effective switch. I even groomed the dog with the mustache trimmer part. The shaver is fairly quiet and didn't cause her any undue alarm or stress. She now looks fabulous and also heartily endorses the Braun 8585 Activator.
