review/text: I've been using this for only a week now (on patch #2) and I've already lost an inch off my waist, hips, and thighs. I haven't lost any weight specifically, but any doctor will tell you that weight is not a measure of getting slimmer, losing inches is. I did get the red patch of skin like everyone else; I put some hydogen peroxide on it (don't have any rubbing alcohol) and it seems to have mostly gone away in the past couple of days. That parts annoying but the weight loss is worth it! I don't feel hungry very often and my cravings are down to almost nothing (unfortunately, though, when I DO eat because I feel obligated to I end up eating more than I did before because my body is hungry even if I don't feel it!)Still, though, I excercised twice this week and it really exaggerated the effects. Of course you won't lose weight sitting on your bum, the patches are meant as an AID, not a cure-all.The only downside (besides the red splotch on your back) is that I sweat a lot more and it's harder to get to sleep at night. Still, though, I think it's worth it and I would recommend it.
