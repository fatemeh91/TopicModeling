review/text: Although this is a little less sturdy than I expected, and a bit small, it works pretty well for picking up stuff on the carpet. I personally hate to vacuum because of the noise, and the stress on my shoulder, so this little sweeper is a good alternative. It picks up a surprising amount of dirt, lint, and little wood chips that get tracked in from my husband bringing in wood for our woodstove.My main complaints if I could give Bissell suggestions would be that this sweeper makes an annoying rattling sound as it is used, and the rubber bumper tends to be easily dislodged.Other than that, I'm pleased with the product.
