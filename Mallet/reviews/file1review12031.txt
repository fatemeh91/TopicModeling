review/text: I began taking these about two months before I got pregnant, and continue to take them even after giving birth (my child is now eight months, and still nursing). This vitamin has all of the recommended amounts for prenatal vitamins, and has never once upset my stomach. I will probably still take this even after I am done nursing and having children. Great price too, I used to buy them at a different site, in a 30 count supply for $5, but this is much cheaper. My husband also takes the Men's Rainbow Light Multi and he likes them, too.
