review/text: This did provide comfortable support but the straps that go around your neck were way to visible at the collars of my shirts. They were snug against my neck so that they couldn't help but show. I had to return it because I just couldn't wear it with summer shirts. It would be fine in the winter with a turtleneck.I bought another one instead that is called Mother-to-Be and it does a great job giving my belly the needed support.
