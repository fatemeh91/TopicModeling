review/text: This tub does the job well. I do agree with how the baby slides around the bottom, but I have solved that by folding a towel and putting it at the bottom. Although you end up with a sopping wet towel, this way, it's much easier to bathe your baby without him/her sliding all over the place. Plus you dont have to worry about bumped heads or anything. Other baths on the market look great, but I worry about my baby and the hard plastic. The cuddle tub looks great, I havent tried that one out. I figure soaking a wash cloth in warm water and putting it over the baby would be a good idea for the cuddle tub so he/she doesnt get cold being suspended over the bath like that. Also, I sister in law has the safer bather. It works very well too, but it does start to stink after a while and if the water is high, it floats away from you a lot... lol!! All I can say is shop around. Check other stores, too. Target has some great baths not advertised here. Good Luck! This is a special area that needs a lot of attention for safety and comfort. Good luck and congratulations to everyone with your babies.
