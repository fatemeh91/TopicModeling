review/text: I have the Rich Double Chocolate flavored powder. I'm probably not doing this right, but I mix one scoop with 8 oz. of 2% milk (I know, not skim, shame on me!), and it tastes like chocolate milk. If I enjoy the taste of something, I'm more likely to continue doing it. I've been drinking two "shakes" a day in addition to 4 smaller meals, and I look forward to it each time.As far as results, I don't know if it has made a difference, because when I just began serious weight training about 3 weeks ago, and have had the powder since the beginning of the third week. I have been gaining weight, and my workouts are constantly improving, so something must be going right.If you like chocolate milk, and you would like an extra boost of 24g protein (plus what is in the milk), this product/flavor may be for you. I haven't tried it in water, and I really don't plan to. Chocolate flavored water does not appeal to me. I'll put up with the extra fat if it means that I'll actually stay with the program.
