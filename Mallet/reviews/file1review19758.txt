review/text: I first bought a First Year training seat for my 2-year old boy. Whenever my boy moves on the seat, it moves. A few times my boy would have fallen off the seat if I was not there holding him. Also the front was not high enough for a boy. BabyBjorn seat is secure on the toilet. My boy seems very comfortable on it. The front has the right height so my boy has stopped using his hand to help himself pee.
