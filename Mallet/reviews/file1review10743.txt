review/text: Like others, I take a lot of pills. Some are prescription and some are different vitamins. This is the only pill organizer I have found that holds ALL of my pills. I take about 4 very large pills in the morning plus other various size pills. I use to have to have two pill organizers to hold all of my morning meds but not now. I have Parkinson's and must take pills 3 times a day so the different compartments really are a blessing. I love the bedtime compartment too! It is easy to open the different compartments, is easy to fill and best of all it doesn't take a lot of space on my bathroom counter. You'll be really pleassed with this one!7 Day Pill Box Organizer 4 Deep Compartments Yellow Tray- Made in the Usa
