review/text: I had high hopes for this mask. It does a great job blocking out light, and doesn't squash my eyeballs like other masks do. The front piece that goes over the face is soft and silky. I like that it comes in different colors and patterns.The problem is that it's horribly uncomfortable. In fact, it's painful. Lying on my back for only 5 minutes, I could feel the thick doubled over velcro strap digging into my skull. Not good. So I turned over and slept on my side. I had the worst night of sleep. The edge of the strap dug into the top of my ear, causing me pain all night. Why I didn't just take it off I'm not sure, but I was in a half-asleep state and not making logical decisions. I was exhausted the next day because my sleep was so bad due to the discomfort. They did such a good job with the front part, but the strap is awful! I would make the strap an adjustable soft stretchy fabric material, not a hard thick velcro strap. I also wish they made this in a smaller-face size.I'm going back to my eyeeco mask - it does a great job blocking out light, doesn't squash my eyeballs, fits my face well, and has a very comfortable back piece. I was just hoping to find something a little more attractive than the goggle look... but I'll take functional and comfortable over looks.
