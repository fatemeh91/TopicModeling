review/text: Nice sunglasses! These fit my head very well. It's my second pair. I was able to purchase these from Amazon for cheaper than at Sunglass hut. Plus they arrived with a soft shell case, a soft lens cleaning sleeve, and a piece of the lens cleaning fabric! Usually in the store you have to pay extra for the case, but it was included! I am very pleased. These give everything a slight green tint but the polarizing is good. I also don't notice any optical distortion.
