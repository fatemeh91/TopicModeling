review/text: i am a 20 year old that that has wrinkles in between my chest i dont use anything on my body except body soap but after looking at Dr.Oz and heard him talk about that this can reduce wrinkles i was intrested on trying this out because i was furious on the wrinkles i have between my chest area so i had tried it i mean my stomache didnt react well to it because it was a brand new vitamin i had added to my vitamins it was a little harsh in the beginning but as my stomache got used to it didnt have no problems what so ever but as i looked at my chest the wrinkles has been disappearing little by little. It made a big difference as i start noticing the dissapearence!! i was satisfied because that was the hardest to get rid of i had gave it a few weeks and notice the differnce! couldnt be any happier!! very satisfied! except the begging but i give it 5 stars! thank u Dr.Oz :)
