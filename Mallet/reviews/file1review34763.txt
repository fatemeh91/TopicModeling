review/text: I purchased this deodorant spray along withAubrey Organics - E Plus High C Deodorant, 3 fl oz roll-onat the same time in an effort to find a more natural replacement for the major name-brand anti-perspirant deodorants I had been using up to this point. I have been using both products for about a month now, and am quite pleased. It took me about a week to get used to the strong--though not unpleasant--smell of both of these products. This deodorant does not stop you from sweating because it is not an anti-perspirant, but it does keep the bad odors under control. I apply it only in the mornings on most days, and maybe once during the day on particularly warm or active days.I have also tried Miessence Tahitian Breeze Roll-on Deodorant since I purchased this product, and I actually prefer the smell of the Aubrey Organics deodorants. I cannot say the same about Aubrey Organics facial lotions/moisturizers. I had to give them away because of the overpowering scent and replace them with Miessence moisturizers. Go figure! It could be just personal preference for different scents.
