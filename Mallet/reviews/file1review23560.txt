review/text: I used to have a Revlon mirror, which worked great. I bought this Conair mirror because it was more stylish (polished chrome compared to my plastic Revlon mirror). Unfortunately even the brightest setting on this mirror is not as bright as I desire. Secondly, every time I bump the base, it turns the light off! I wish that I would have stuck with my Revlon.
