review/text: I've been blessed to have never had an ear infection until a few months ago, when I had my first (and--I hope--only) one. I'm all about natural supplements and healing, so I ordered this promptly from Amazon (while trying another natural remedy). I used this one evening and, within 3 hours, my ear felt perfect. Yes, it feels slightly strange going in, but I expected that. It didn't hurt, just more like pouring water in your ear. The fact that there are no side effects and it's effective are enough for me to use it again, if necessary, and on my poor boys when they get the occasional ear infection. I highly recommend this and many other Similsan products (Pink Eye Relief, Cough and Cold, Cough, Sleeping Pills).
