review/text: I was looking for a mild stool softener to help me through my high protein diet. Hhmm, however decided to write on the label that it's gentle and "predictable" should take a few pills himself. I was on the toilet for an hour just 2 hours after taking this, and a full day later, and I am not venturing far from home. I have been cramping and miserable for about 24 hours now.
