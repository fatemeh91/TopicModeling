review/text: We are adopting and will be travelling to pick up our baby. We bought this product to bathe our newborn in since we will be away from home for several weeks. As far as people saying it's slippery, we bought one of those really small nonskid pads and put it in the bottom. The one that we got is a soft foam and that will take care of the sliding. You can find them in the bathroom/kitchen area of your local store. It's great for travel and easy to store. Hope this helps.
