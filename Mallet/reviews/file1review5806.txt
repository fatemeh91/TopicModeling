review/text: The item is well made and the blade is sharp and cuts well. The orange surface the pill rests on is a type of sticky material. The pills do not slide on this sticky surface and consequently the pills often do not align properly for cutting. The sticky surface also makes it difficult to get the cut pieces into the reservoir. A smoother surface that permits the pills to slide would be preferable.
