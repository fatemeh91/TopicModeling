review/text: I've owned this toothbrush for over 3 years. I have replaced the brush head when it is worn out. I hadn't seen my dentist for over 4 years. Went in for a teeth cleaning and the tech was amazed that my teeth were in such good condition - barely any plague. My gums are healthy and pink. Compared with the electric brushes I used to use, my teeth are doing great.
