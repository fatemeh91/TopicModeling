review/text: This blood pressure cuff is easy to use. I've used other automatic cuffs that squeeze too hard. My blood pressure runs low most of the time and this cuff doesn't squeeze me to death before it starts letting go. The directions are clear. Just point the arrow on the cuff to the center of the bend in your elbow and have the cuff above your elbow and you'll do fine.
