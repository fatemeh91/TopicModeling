review/text: I received this item and was disappointed big time. It has very little scent, and part of the cologne content was missing. It was not filled up to the top. It made me feel cheated. This company has had this same type of complaint leveled against it before. I can see why now. Don't buy unless you want to waste your money. Tuccni isn't a good company.
