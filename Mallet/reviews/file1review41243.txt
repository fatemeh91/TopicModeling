review/text: I have osteoarthritis in my left ankle, a result of corticosteroid use for asthma. I have tried practically everything to alleviate the pain, which is now so intense, it causes a limp. The pain-killer pills tend to cause kidney damage. Chondroitin and glucoseamine are not meant for those with shellfish allergies.Australian Dream ointment seemed to be the only alternative. I really wanted some pain relief; I wanted this product to work. SADLY, IT DID NOT RELIEVE the pain. I applied hot compresses - no relief. Logically, Dream should not work. After all, rubbing pain ointment doesn't really reach the intended bones, where the pain resides.I can't argue with other glowing reviews. I envy those users. I must look elsewhere for pain relief. Ankle fusion surgery is the prescribed remedy, but the doctors make no promises of success at my age (63).
