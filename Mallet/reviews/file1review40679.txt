review/text: Started Body for Life a few weeks ago and decided to use these bars for some of my smaller meals. I've never had many protein bars, so I don't have a lot to compare to. These taste good and keep me full for a while. I've had bars that taste better, but had more carbs. I would recommend these bars.
