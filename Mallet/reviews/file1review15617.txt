review/text: This deodorant is great because it's not full of Alzheimer-associated metals, and one package will last me almost a year so it's very cost-effective. Of course, being vegan myself helps me use less deodorant than your average meat-eater since I'm not releasing toxins through my sweat all the time. A little dabble of this under each arm lasts me all day, even days in which I include a workout!
