review/text: My toddler is on a continuous feeding pump. We use the bandages to help stabilize the cord so it doesn't pull out his button when he tosses and turns at night. They stretch nicely and don't leave marks/rashes on his tummy. Because he's on the continuous pump all night and most of the day, he constantly urinates through his diaper. These wraps have all been washed mulitple times (line dried). They hold up great. It's hard to estimate exactly how many times, but I'd say roughly 5x each if not more. Some are showing wear and tear. There are mini holes where his button poked holes through.The hospital sent us home with ACE brand wraps so we have both. These lay flat where our ace ones are all twisted it's impossible to untwist them without ironing them flat. These are longer then the ACE brand. Though the ACE brand are thicker so they don't get the holes. The color of these is much more appealing. The ACE looks dingy and dirty after the first wash. Which isn't a big deal, but for a 2 year old that wears this all day long, the brighter color just looks better.I also found that these breath better.We've had our wraps for several months and we haven't had to toss one out yet - though we're getting close.How well these would work for a sprain, I don't know, but they're absolutely perfect for our needs.
