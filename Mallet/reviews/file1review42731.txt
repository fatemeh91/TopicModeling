review/text: I've been using the razor for 4 months, and overall, this is a nice razor. However, its battery/electrical features are poorly designed.PROS: This razor gives a great shave - close and smooth. Never a nick and never a pulled hair. The razor has nice grips and is easy to handle and is well-balanced. It is very easy to clean. I get 8-9 days of shaves out of it. I think the battery lasts a bit longer than the 60 minutes advertised. However, I also followed the instructions in "conditioning" the battery before using the razor. A complete charge - which took a full day, followed by using it until it completely discharged, and then another complete recharge.CONS: No battery life indicator or low battery warning. And even worse, it won't run on the electrical cord. So if the battery dies and you haven't finished your shave, you are out of luck. Plugging it in doesn't make the shaver run. Also, it has a ridiculously long recharge cycle. It takes between 18 and 22 hours to completely recharge. Who designed this? The pop-up trimmer works great, but it could 1/16th of an inch higher.
