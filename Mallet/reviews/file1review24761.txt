review/text: I received my first speick shave stick from amazon today. I am a huge fan of Speick cream in the tube. I used the stick tonight and I am very impressed with the results. I have a thick beard and have been experimenting with lots of shave products over the last year. My first shave with a stick instead of cream in a tube or soaps like Cella or Proraso. I can get used to this.
