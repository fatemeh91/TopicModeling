review/text: I received this order in the time frame stated. I love these products and use them all the time. when I received this shipment the product was intact but the box was full of ants. I called the company to just let them know and they not only responded right away they sent me a replacement at no extra cost. this type of customer service and dedication to their customers will make me a repeat customer.
