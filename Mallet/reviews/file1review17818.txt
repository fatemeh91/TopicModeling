review/text: I've been wearing RGP lenses for almost 20 years and used Boston Solutions exclusively. My eye doctor gave me samples of different cleaners and solutions to try. Allergies tended to fog up my lenses after only a day of wearing them. This cleaner really worked. It does wonders for removing protein deposits. It makes the lenses feel "slimy" just like after having them professionally cleaned. I can't use the other Lobob solutions because for some reason my eyes are sensitive and tend to burn when I do but this cleaner is great. I use it with Alcon's Unique pH conditioning solution and my eyes have never felt better and my vision is so much clearer due to clean lenses.
