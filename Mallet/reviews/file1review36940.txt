review/text: I was really impressed with the Glade Dental Tape. Unlike many other brands of dental floss, I didn't notice it shredding at all. Years ago, my orthodontist recommended this brand of dental floss for this same reason. With braces, I remember dental floss often breaking in pieces from rubbing against the metal. I should've tried it then and not waited. I'd buy this again.
