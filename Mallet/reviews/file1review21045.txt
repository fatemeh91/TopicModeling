review/text: These plugs do a great job of insulating the excessive noise of power tools, lawnmower, etc. They are not comfortable for long duration. They could not be worn to bed as they stick out too much.I did not like how loosely the strap fits into the plugs. They actually arrive with the strap disconnected from the plugs. The strap has hardened endings (like shoe laces) that one is expected to insert into the ear plugs.
