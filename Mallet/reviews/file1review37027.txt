review/text: I liked the Unscented Dry Idea. It kept me dry all day and I never had to re-apply it. I also liked that it was unscented, because I didn't have to worry that it would compete with my perfume. The only thing that I would have changed is that it goes on wet, and I prefer deodorants that feel dry when applied.
