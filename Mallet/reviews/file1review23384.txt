review/text: Purell makes an excellent hand sanitizer for any occasion when you need to wash your hands but you just can't get to a sink. Purell, therefore, is perfect for people who are on the go and can't stop to wash their hands.The pump on the top of the plastic bottle is easy enough to use--just push down and the Purell comes out. Want more? Easy--just push down again and more comes out. All you have to do then is rub your hands together rapidly for a few seconds until they become dry again. This will leave your hands feeling super clean and there is almost no scent whatsoever!What's the secret? Purell does indeed kill 99.99% of common germs in as little as 15 seconds. It does this through its active ingredient ethyl alcohol. I suppose the isopropyl alcohol helps, too. Excellent!Purell also includes aloe and Vitamin E in its formula. This should help your hands feel a bit softer after you use Purell. An excellent plus!A few caveats: wash this off your hands before eating; and supervise small children as they use Purell. Purell says that it's hypoallergenic; but it does have a slight fragrance. Purell's fragrance will not overwhelm you by any stretch of the imagination; but if you are allergic to scents then you may need to use another product. Ask your doctor about this issue if it concerns you. In addition, Purell liquid is flammable--I assume because of the alcohol content--so keep this away from fire.Have further questions? Purell offers consumers both a website and a toll free number so that you can contact the company. Good PR!!Overall, Purell is just about the best cleaner for your hands whenever you are on the go and you just can't get to a sink to wash your hands. I highly recommend this product for people who want to keep their hands germ free while using public facilities.Score a goal for Purell!
