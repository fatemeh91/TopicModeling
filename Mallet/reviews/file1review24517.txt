review/text: The gel cushion feels great to the touch, however it does not always stay in place. It can easily be misplaced or lost, especially if you like to remove your shoes at work or anywhere just to rest your tired feet. The gel cushion is an excellent idea however a little more tweaking could have gone into it and, as for the price of the small gel cushion, it could have given you more for your money (larger or extra gel cushions).I am constantly misplacing one of the gel cushions, has anyone found it?.Truly disappointed.Cat47
