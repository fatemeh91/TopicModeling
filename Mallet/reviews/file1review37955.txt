review/text: These are great for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet. They make my legs less tired & achey by the end of the day. Also my ankles are less swollen. I especially like wearing them when flying on a long flight, with long pants of course.Once I left them on for an OB/GYN visit and joked with him that I was too tired to take them off. He laughed and said he wears them too!They're a little hard to get on when new but after a while you get the hang of it. I wash them separately with a "hand wash" cycle of my washer and hang to dry. They've lasted a couple years. They're not cheap but it's worth it to me!
