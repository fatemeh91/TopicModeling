review/text: First, I've just purchased the Dreamtime foot AND separate hand cozys as a gift for someone who struggles with cold hands and feet (of course!) But I've used both products myself for several years, and they're still as good as new. Next, as others have stated, they are not slippers (or gloves), but 'cozys', thus the name. Don't expect to walk around in them. They're perfect for sitting on the sofa to read a book or watch TV. Even if the heated grains aren't touching you, the cozys create a chamber of warmth that takes care of cold fingers and toes quickly. Just pop them into the microwave (according to instructions) and you're all set. By the way, I put the whole thing in the microwave oven rather than separating the cloth from the grains - no issues - and it has worked just fine so far. There's always someone in the house who is just a bit chilled when everyone else is comfortable, and these are a perfect solution on the sofa.
