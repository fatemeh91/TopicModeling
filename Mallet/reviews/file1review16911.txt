review/text: The instructions advise you to wait until the batteries are almost depleted before charging (to preserve battery life). That's fine, except for the fact that there is no battery gauge. Are you supposed to wait until the shaver stops and then wait 6 minutes for a quick charge? Poor design and poor shave to boot.
