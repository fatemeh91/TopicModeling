review/text: I bought the prenatal cradle because I had been having problems with SPD during pregnancy. This product does provide some support for the belly, but I'm not convinced that it makes that much difference. Plus, it's kind of awkward to climb into and hard to find clothes that cover the shoulder straps. In my opinion, it's just not worth the money.
