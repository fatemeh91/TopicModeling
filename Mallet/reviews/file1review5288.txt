review/text: I bought these while I was pregnant because I was having terrible morning sickness. Me thinking I was getting something I could actually take was very wrong. These are not what I would call "candy" They are very spicy when you put them in your mouth. I did not have more then 2 before they went in the trash. I would rather have morning sickness then eat these.
