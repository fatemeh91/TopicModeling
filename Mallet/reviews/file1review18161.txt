review/text: Well, I have to say I was skeptical in ordering this. I read many reviews and decided to try it. I recently started working evening and night shifts and knew trying to sleep into the late morning would be a problem. I have to say since I got it, I've slept better. I didn't realize how much I was waking up due to light in the room. The other reason I was skeptical is that I thought I would not be able to sleep with it on my face. Not the case! It fits well! ( the slightest crack of light, if you go cross-eyed, can be seen at the side of my nose) I don't even mind the velcro in the back of the head ( it is a little thicker back there) but I can sleep on my side and back. I especially love the contoured eyes. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and look forward to wearing it. It means I sleep more during the day!!! I would definately recommend this product.
