review/text: i chose 5 stars because thats the max allowed but this product deserve many more stars. i am 40 years old and gave birth to my only child 16 years ago and for 16 years i have not been able to bounce back from that pregnancy in regards to energy and vitality. i heard about this product from a beautiful youtuber named honestylove and really ordered for hair growth but was encouraged also by other reviewers and their writings of the health benefits. i can truly say from the first time...FIRST TIME!!! i took it i felt like my old self again..i used to drink powerade excessively attempting to combat that deep inner dryness i felt. it was like i couldnt get hydrated & i had very little energy and my sense of being was almost like a depressed state... i had been fighting this for YEARS but not anymore im so glad i found ms honestylove who led me to this WONDERFUL product i have already ordered another bottle and after finishing this review i will order at least 2 more as i have put my 16 year old and my husband on it as well. even if you dont experience hair growth quickly enough the health benefits more than make up for the wait because the hair growth will come just keep in mind the product has to work with each individuals body and some will see progress sooner than others as we dont all eat the same and each of our systems will react to and work with the product on an INDIVIDUAL level so be patient in this microwave society and give your body all the time it needs dont reject this great product due to impatience this is one of those good things in life we shouldnt deny ourselves!! i believe honesty love when she said God told her to share this product on youtube because seriously this product is an answer to prayer for me... i feel so great i sleep soo much better my digestion has improved theres so much i could say ...just give it a real try i think you'll love it as i do!!
