review/text: I had been using the All Freeclear laundry detergent for some time before I discovered that Amazon carried it and had a good deal on it. I'll probably be buying it from Amazon from now on.The fragrances in most laundry detergents are chemicals that are really bad for you. If you walk down an aisle in just about any supermarket where the soaps are, the fumes are very heavy there. This is because of outgassing from the boxes of detergents. All Freeclear seems to do a pretty good job of cleaning and doesn't seem to have any noticeable odor to it at all, so I think I'm going to keep using it.
