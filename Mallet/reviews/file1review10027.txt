review/text: It's been several years since I purchased this product, but the caliper seems to be pretty accurate and the tape measure works great. However, I have used many different fat or BMI measuring devices and I have discovered that many of these serve very little purpose. I'd say, unless you're in a competition where knowing your fat percentage or BMI is crucial (were BMI and fat % would most likely be measured by a professional anyway), forget these types of devices. You can tell what kind of shape you're in by how you feel and how you look. If you feel and look great why should it matter what your body fat percentage or body mass index is. These days people have become so absorbed by little things like this that they loose sight of the things that really matter. Use a tape measure and scale if you need some type of encouragement, but that's all you should really need. Also, women or men shouldn't be discouraged if they gain weight when first beginning to workout, this is because muscle weights more than fat. So as many people start to exercise/workout they will gain muscle (partly due to water retention) thereby gaining weight first and as the muscle building starts to plateau they loose weight.
