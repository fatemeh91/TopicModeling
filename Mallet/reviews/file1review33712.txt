review/text: Oil containing products make me break out so I've always had to use one of the much less common oil-free mositurizers. After a few weeks of using the Zia, I was astonished at how much happier and youthful my skin looked. It absorbs well and I don't feel anything on my skin once it's in. In winter I sometimes have to reapply a little at night. It doesn't have sunscreen. It's not inexpensive, but it's worth it for the result. Zia has come out with new product lines since this one and I've tried a few and they're good overall as a brand. This particular product is magical as far as my face is concerned and I hope they never discontinue it.
