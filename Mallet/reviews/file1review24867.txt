review/text: I took the FertilAid pills for about 1 month after 8 months of casually trying to conceive. I also used the Clearble Easy Fertility Monitor, and I got pregnant within the first month! I would recommend this product for anyone that is trying to conceive, along with using the fertility monitor. It works!
