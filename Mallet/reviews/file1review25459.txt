review/text: Bought the Panasonic 20 dollar model and this one works way better. I have a beard and mustache trimmer for all other grooming so I just wanted a unit for nose hair. I would buy a few of these in case one breaks or for replacement before spending 18-20-or 30 dollars for the high price ones. It works great and I have had no problems with it.
