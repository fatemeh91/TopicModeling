review/text: This is a great detergent for those who do not like the idea of using strong chemicals produced by companies that probably also use animal-derived and tested ingredients. It gets my clothes clean and smells wonderful but not overpowering. Pretty much everyone in our house (including my dog!) have some sort of allergy and this detergent is also gentle enough not to irritate any of us. As mentioned in a past review, my box also came with one side of the double-boxed shipment saturated with leaked detergent so if you do order, keep in mind that it could happen.
