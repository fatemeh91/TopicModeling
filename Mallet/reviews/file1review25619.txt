review/text: I had bought a low quality grommer from a different manufacturer a couple of months back and suffered from it - it would take me atleast 10 mins of grinding around my nostrils to remove all the hair follicles and even after that, I could still feel some hair inside - which I hate.Disappointed with my earlier experience, I took my chance with this one - there are some negative reviews and some strong positive reviews.With this one, I am pretty happy with the way it performs - just 2-3 mins and I have a clean feeling in my nostrils and ears.Some of the negative reviews and my comments on it* Too painful and yanks off sensitive hair - yes it does pain - but very very little. If you want zero pain, somebody needs to design a microprecision tool for this and would cost you nothing less than a grand.* Too irritating - Yes, it is not a comfortable feeling to get something moving at high speed inside your nose and ears, it is just a matter of getting used to* Breaks after a few months/malfunctioning - Well, I have some doubts here, if you guys have been immersing the whole thing into soap water and cleaning it. It is an electrical equipment and does needs some due care.On the other side, these are low margin, low volume business for these companies and I would'nt be surprised if they put low quality parts into manufacturing this.Overall, I am pretty satisfied this product.
