review/text: I bought this at an electronics store an year ago and can vouch for its usefulness. It would be sufficient to say that other companies are copying the design (store brands like Remington, etc) I used a have a combo total hair care from Remington and its trimmer would give me &quot;RED EARS&quot; and &quot;a sore inside the nose&quot; everytime I used it.Cleaning this unit is a breeze. I dismantled the head and there was nothing much that need to be cleaned. Just keeping it under running water everytime it is used.The AA baterry life is are not so bad either.
