review/text: I keep trying other blades and razors because of the price I have to pay for the Gillette Fusion blades, but I keep going back to the Gillette Fusion - they're just the best blades for me. So, I signed up for Amazon's monthly shipments to get the price down some and that helps. Now I can use the blade I prefer without feeling so guilty for spending so much on razor blades.
