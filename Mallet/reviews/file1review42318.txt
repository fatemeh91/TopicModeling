review/text: This is a great source of liquid vitamins. I was sluggish and tired and my mom suggested I try liquid vitamins. I was apprehensive since I talk a multi-vitamin by mouth daily. To satisfy my mom, I tried Nature's Plus. I love it! I like Nature's Plus so much that I purchased a bottle for my brother and encourage friends. There are others liquid vitamins out there, but they do not compare to the benefits of Nature's Plus.
