review/text: Unfortunately, 0 stars was not an option. I purchased two 8 Packs of Energizer D Batteries to use in an O2 Cool Camping Fan (which BTW I recommend wholeheartedly). The 1st 8 Pack worked Fine. The 2nd 8 Pack, with six years left for freshness, were dead . . . I repeat . . . *D*E*A*D*. I placed them in the appliance for which I bought them . . . not once . . . not twice . . . but three times . . . each time checking to see that I had installed them properly. Next I installed them in a flourescent lantern . . . nothing . . . I will not buy Energizer batteries again. I would furthermore fire the Rabbit that keeps on going and will make sure he remains gone from my life.
