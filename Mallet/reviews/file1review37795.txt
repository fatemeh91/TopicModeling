review/text: I used this for two long, one-day bike rides, 200 and 300km. I didn't want the hassle of solid food for these events. For both rides, I finished strong, and never felt weak from lack of energy. I'll note that I'm a bit old, overweight and out of shape, but felt as strong as ever. On the first ride, I did experience some leg cramping, but for the second, I added an electrolyte, and that problem went away.
