review/text: This machine does the job, no doubt about it. The powerful water jets clean all food debris away and massage my gums - I have braces so I use it instead of flossing, and my dentist said my gums were fine. The only problem I have with it is the design of the water reservoir. First of all, you can't fill the tank without picking up the fairly bulky apparatus and putting it underneath the faucet. I have a small sink so it's somewhat of a nuisance to do this. Secondly, the water reservoir isn't really 'attached' to the base at all, so it's pretty easy to knock the reservoir straight off of the base when moving it around or even turning it on, spilling water everywhere.
