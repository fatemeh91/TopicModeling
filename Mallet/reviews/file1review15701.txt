review/text: I use my miracle cloths all the time. My mom gave me two of the ones from her package and I LOVE them! You must be sure and not put them in the dryer WITH a dryer sheet. You can dry them but don't use a fabric softener sheet. I use mine with water to clean anything glass; merely wet one end of the cloth and squeeze out excess water. Use the wet end to wipe windows, oven doors, counter tops, refrigerator doors, ANYTHING and use the dry end to do the final shine. No need for windex or any other cleaning agent. If you are concerned about germs, use the new Clorox Anywhere cleaner with it. Works like a charm!
