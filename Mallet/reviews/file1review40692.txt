review/text: I bought this for my husband because he always complains about lower back pains whenever he drives for more than an hour. Well, he loved it! Not only does he use it when driving, but he uses it at work (long hours sitting infront of the computer) and at home (resting before dinner). It's like a specially-shaped squish pillow (if you don't know what that is, ask any teen-ager!) with massaging action...in 2 settings! We haven't had problems with it so far; although, the vibrating sound is a bit noisy. I wish it had come with the 2 "C" batteries though. But even if you run out of batteries, the material it was filled with makes it comforting anyway!
