review/text: this product is only meant for one hair at a time and yes if you hit the root it will not grow back, make sure to disinfect the area.This product is best sued for individual ingrown hair, it can be used to pop white heads without or very little scarring as Ive notice.. but should not be used for acne.good for any chest or facial hair but remember this product should only be sued on certain hairs that causes any trauma to the skin like ingrown hair or follicles that grow in awkward places .. anything bigger then a 4 cm area should to be obtained, another product is best for youi give it a 4 because its hard to find the main cell which grows hair to kill it but it will kill it once you've found it, 100 recommend adding salt water first before any conducting is involved
