review/text: Nice trimmer. Works really well. Easy to adjust. Easy to clean. Had my previous one for 5 years and only had to buy a new one because I dropped it and it landed on the guard and cracked it. My previous one was an older model, but looked exactly the same (except it was gray). So I'm hoping that this one will last just as long.
