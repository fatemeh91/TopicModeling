review/text: I had plantar wart on my foot and instead of going to the doctor's office, I tried numerous OTC remedies. I can say that this Pedifix product appeared to have worked, but is by no means a miracle cure. Frequent applications are probably the only way to get it work the way you want.Bottom Line: Alright product for smaller issues, but just see a doctor and get it out of the way.
