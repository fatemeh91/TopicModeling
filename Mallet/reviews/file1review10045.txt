review/text: If another company would duplicate this type of brush, but just execute it better, they would do well. I have bought 3 of these Interplak brushes and many, many, brush heads. The brush heads wear out fast, are hard to find, and are not cheap. The batteries they use in the unit must be old recycled ni cads that don't last long either. I too have tried all the other brushes and found they do not work near as well as the Interplak. The individual bristles make all the difference. I keep saying that I will go out and get an Oral B or some other brand, but my Dentist says my teeth have never been better. I guess I will continue buying Interplak until they go out of business. Most people aren't as forgiving as me.
