review/text: This is one of the richest, most hydrating moisturizers I have ever used. I have been using it for about a year now and in the summer I use it at night 2-3 nights a week. During the winter I can use it during the day since the elements are so much more harsh. The combination of oils and vitamins in this cream make it a winner. I actually like the smell, it smells like candy and fades away fast. I notice how plump my face is the morning after I use this. A must try. Plus it is not tested on animals or made with any animal ingredients.
