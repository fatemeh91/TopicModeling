review/text: I have the same problem as many others who have posted reviews on this sweeper. It seems to pick up junk on the carpet pretty good but the handle comes apart after a while. I find that annoying. I haven't yet done anything to fix it but I think just drilling a hole through where the two parts connect and then running something through it will solve the problem. I bought two of these, one for upstairs and one for the downstairs. They don't replace the upright vacuum cleaners but they're nice to have ready to sweep up small areas of crumbs, cat hair, toenail clippings, etc....all that good stuff that seems to land on the carpet! And they don't require electricity, cords, have a loud motor or extra weight. These are very light and easy to carry from one room to another.
