review/text: Again great stuff!! I've have tried a few different magnesium products... the two that I like are "natural calm" and this....this seems to be more effective and cause less side effects from the rest of the capsules/tablets out there. great for panic! great for GAD (anxitey) great for up-beat mood, great for keeping appetite in check, good for focus....if you want to know the details about how good magnesium is read Dr. Carolyn Dean's book!
