review/text: I got these for my 5 year old who is no longer wearing pull ups. We had the standard under the sheet mattress protector, but that is a flawed experience because as soon as she wets the bed we have to change the entire bed. With these we can just lay it over the sheet and if she has an accident it is a quick change in the middle of the night. We bought two of these and have the other one sitting by the bed. If she wets the bed, she just removes the wet one and her underwear and puts a new pad on by herself AND goes bak to sleep. No extra steps and mess involved! And ..... Mom gets needed sleep without having to struggle with wet sheets in the middle of the night.Hasn't leaked so far and is the prefect size.
