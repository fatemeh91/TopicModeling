review/text: My doctor's nurse gave this to me as a gift for waiting so long for my appointment. It's proabably the best gift I've received in years! I LOVE THIS HEATING PAD! It heats so quickly and I can feel the moisture easing the muscle aches from deep within my back. Sure, it's a little annoying to have to keep switching it on when you want it to reheat, but trust me--it's worth it. I accidentally kept it on one time, fell asleep, and to my horror, the switch casing had become misshapen from melting! Yes, it does get VERY hot. (I now need to purchase another one.) It's good for regular use, and the 14 x 27" size is a huge plus as it's able to heat the entire length of my spine as well as my hips--and I'm 5' 10". I will ONLY be buying this product--when you've found the best, you'll NEVER get anything else!
