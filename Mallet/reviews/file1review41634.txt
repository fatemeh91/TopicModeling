review/text: I purchased this toothbrush on the advice of my dentist. It seems I was brushing too hard with the manual toothbrush. The interesting thing is that with this new toothbrush, I had to start with the "feather" mode, as regular made my gums bleed. However, once I got used to it, I really like it; it makes my teeth feel super clean. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a good power toothbrush.
