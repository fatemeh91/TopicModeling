review/text: I've been using the WaterPik WP-65 for a couple of weeks now. I'm a first-time user of such a device --- and am very impressed so far. This device is admittedly somewhat cumbersome to use but seems to do a fine job of cleaning my teeth.I should note that a strange situation occurred during shipping. The item was initially sent to an intermediate shipping point of Dallas. It was then trucked to Houston --- bypassing my location in Austin. Then the package was placed into US mail for Austin. There was NOT any significant delay, but it makes me wonder --- wouldn't it have been more efficient to have INITIALLY used the US mail?
