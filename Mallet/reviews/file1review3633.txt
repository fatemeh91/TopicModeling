review/text: When I first got my cooktop, I forgot and laid a potholder on the hot surface. The vinyl tag melted onto the top. I called the maker and did some internet search for help but didn't really find a fix. I ordered this kit and was able to get most of the stuff off pretty quickly. There was a fine film left so I put a saucepan of water on the affected burner and boiled the water. Once the pan was hot, I took it off the stove and dumped the water out. Most of the residual film stuck to the bottom of my 25 year old Farberware pan and came off easily with a Brillo pad. The tiny amount STILL on the cooktop came off over time and my stove looks fine now. The manufacturer tried to sell me a new top! The produce set works great for everyday cleaning, too. :-)
