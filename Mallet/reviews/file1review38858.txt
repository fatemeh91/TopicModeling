review/text: I think Mennen Pre-Electric Skin Bracer is the best commodity pre-electric shave I have found. I've tried other grocery/convenience store pre-electric shaves and have not gotten the same smooth, easy shave that I do with Mennen. It appears to be getting more difficult to find, so when you locate it - better pick some up!
