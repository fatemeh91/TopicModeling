review/text: LOVe that these have the one side that doesn't leak through. I produce a LOT of milk and during the day these are perfect! At night I have to change them once or else I would be soaked but if I do that it never gets all over my clothes and leaks straight out front. My mom have ones almost exactly like this and she loved them, then we found these and I love them and my sister loves them.
