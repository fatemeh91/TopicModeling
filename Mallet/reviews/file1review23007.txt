review/text: This is an excellent knee support. Made better than McDavid's earlier models. Does exactly what I wanted it to do. I expect it will last longer than I will. It has adjustable straps to help keep it in place. Light weight, hardly notice it is there when wearing it and it is WORKING for me. When wearing it, my knee feels strong and able to do anything. Walking is easy with this support.
