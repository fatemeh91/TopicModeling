review/text: Ive been using these for 4 weeks and I look nothing more like a patch work, with itchy reddish brown jag-ged squares all over my body,there are 10 packets of &quot;stickers&quot; in the box, and you're to stick them on different parts of your body with a new one every 3 days,Sticking them on was fun, taking them off was hair raising, they werent like band aids that come with friendly adhesives, I had to rub liquid soap and warm water to take them off and they would leave a mark. They were there no matter how much I exfoliated my skin and when I peeled it off at one go, it left a scar like the first one already did,I just hope the scar will fade off someday.I lost about 3.5 pounds in total,but its a lousy tradeoff for looking like a patchwork.Only my sis was impressed by the effortless weightloss but Im sticking to low carb diets.
