review/text: This is a truly great product. Quiet, compact, works great and trims like a lawn mower. Works well at getting into hard to reach places around the nose and ear and strong enough to trim sideburns - though I don't recommend it, it would take a long time. A must have for those looking to remove unwanted hair.
