review/text: Although many reviewers have criticized these blades I still adamantly maintain that these are the best blades for shaving; granted these blades are not for everyone but they are the perfect blade for some people; namely me! I understand that when it comes to wet shaving, one needs to find the right blade to suit one's face, as blades range in the angle of sharpness; with these blades I believe I have found my brand of blades for life! However, these may not be right for others, who will need to do more extensive trials and errors with various blades; ouch!
