review/text: I got them for my 90 year old incontinent grandmother. I had been using a bunch of smaller ones 24 x 36 - this makes it much much easier. I have them layered so that I dont have to change the bed sheets and mattress pads, it's a lot easier to just wash these. I am very please with their quality thus far and they seem to hold a lot of water, as Grandma does not get out of bed during the nite so these babies have a big job everynite. I would definitely recommend this product.
