review/text: These are quality tweezers suitable for both cosmetic endeavors and miniature hobby projects. As with many fine tools, there is a trade-off. The extremely narrow tips are prone to damage if used aggressively. Perhaps Tweezerman should cryogenically treat the metal to increase their yield strength.Regardless of the quality of the material, the suggestion that these tweezers be used to extract ingrown hairs is bad medicine. Don't try to address the problem with any tweezers. Academic research and common sense indicate that ingrown hairs should be left alone or treated medically. To prevent the problem in the first place, use an electric razor and accept a not-so-close shave.
