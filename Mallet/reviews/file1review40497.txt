review/text: This company sent me the wrong product. Instead of the ZIPPERED enclosed mattress cover for a hospital bed, they sent me some cheap over the mattress cover. When complained, they overnighted me a replacement, supposedly the correct one. I got the same one again,,, so now had 2 wrong ones, and not going in for three. Called the credit card company,, am reversing the charges, and they are gettin both there cheapies back, in one box at their expense. DONE!!! DO NOT DO BUSSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!!
