review/text: A wonderful shaving cream. The aroma is intoxicating, and the lather is thick and silky. Despite being priced considerably higher than some other popular luxury shave creams, a tub of CF goes a long way. There's more per tub, and you only need half as much. I'm still undecided on whether I'll buy the pre-shave or after shave again, but I'll definitely be using the shaving cream for the foreseeable future.
