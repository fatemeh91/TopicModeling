review/text: Since im not a person that goes to the gym as much as he would like, nor someone that will spend 3 hours there every time he goes i needed a supplement to help me recover after those days that i manage to workout, this has been working greatly for me, i normally use it on the afternoons immediately after the workout, the flavor is actually good if you mix it with milk, not so much if you do it with water, but the benefits are apparent, maybe not physically but I do not feel so tired and out of energy as i did before taking this, hopefully it will help me increase muscular mass but as far as helping me recover energy it does great!
