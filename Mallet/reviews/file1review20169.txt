review/text: My order got off to a slow start, didn't receive initial order apparently it got lost during transitioning. Sent an email to the company stating that I had not gotten my order and according to my purchase order's approximate date given I should have received it by now. The company responded immediately in fact received a personal phone call to my home on a Saturday inquiring about my status, after informing the company that I still hadn't gotten the order was told they would send me out another order immediately, which they did. The owner of the company called me at work to personally see if my shipment had arrived, he checked himself and saw that it was in my city at the post office awaiting to be delivered to my home that week. I was impressed that not a representative for the company called me personally but the owner himself called and discussed his genuine concern for his customers receiving their orders correctly and promptly. That experience there alone has assured my that company is who I will continue to do business with in the future.
