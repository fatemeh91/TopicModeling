review/text: These are very thin but you can tell they are durable and won't fall apart the minute you put it in. It is hardly lubed and has no smell. But, since it isn't lubed very well, make sure to put some lube on the inside. I was rubbed raw a little bit from it. Other than that, very good condom.
