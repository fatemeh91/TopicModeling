review/text: I don't have good things to say about this item I purchased as what I ordered and what I was given by the seller are two different things. When I challenged the seller on this matter, they told me that the item is no longer manufactured. Yet, they adverised it on Amazon! If they don't have the item to sell, then you shouldn't be listing it on Amazon...
