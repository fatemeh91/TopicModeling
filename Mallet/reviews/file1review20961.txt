review/text: If you have a Braun shaver - you know it's an excellent product. Unfortunately the cutter blades and screens just do not last forever. If you've got a tough beard like I do, you'll eventually need to replace both (or purchase another shaver).Don't buy another shaver, get the OEM replacement blade and screen product - it WILL restore the performance of your shaver! Just make sure you match your shaver's model number with the foil/cutter combo. This product shipped quickly and was well priced. Recommended.
