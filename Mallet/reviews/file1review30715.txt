review/text: I've used a number of shaving systems: electric shavers (higher-end Braun and Norelco/Philips) and, of course, the ubiquitous multi-blade cartridge razors from Gillette. I was never completely happy because I would nearly always get ingrown hairs and irritated skin on my neck. Also, for some reason it was all but impossible to shave the neck clean (there always were some hairs left on the neck after shaving, no matter how hard I tried). Using irritation-fighting skin creams didn't help a bit. Enter a double-edge Merkur razor... It took me about 2 weeks to get used to the new way of shaving. I did cut myself a few times during that time, especially when I tried to shave in a hurry (never do that with a razor like this!) Now, about 3 weeks later, I'm very happy. I can get a really smooth shave, closer than I've ever had, including in the "problem" areas like the neck. So, no more Mach 3 cartridges for me! I do spend more time shaving now, but hey, I enjoy it, and I know it'll be the time well spent! Now, a few words about the Merkur Classic. It's an extremely well-built razor, pretty heavy, with a great non-slip handle. It feels good just to hold it, unlike those modern plasticky shiny Gillette handles. And as any good tool, it "disappears" in your hand when you shave. I highly recommend this product. Happy shaving!
