review/text: The picture appears to have a pulse oximetry with it; which it did not. I ordered the oral therometer but received the ear one. I had to send it back because of this and that was over 2 weeks ago and still have not received the credit on my card. Very disappointed with the advertising ,not with the monitor as I ended up buying one from my usual vendor and it works great.
