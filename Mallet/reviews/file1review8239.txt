review/text: I had been searching for this item for over a year. I decided to search on the web for it. And Whalla there it was. I did not let any grass grow under my feet. I ordered not just one but 4 of them. I rarely wash my dishes by hand at the sink. I use the dishwasher only. This brush is the perfect item to rinse the dishes off before sticking them in the dishwasher. It gets in the corners and crannies. I like doing this because I only run my dishwasher in the evenings only. Food never gets caked on. This little brush never scratches any dish or glass but is tough enough to clean out a pot or pan. The bristles are very soft so if you add a tiny amount of dishsoap to it, the lather builds up due to the softness of the bristles. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!....Mg
