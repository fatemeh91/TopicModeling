review/text: Ok, so you shake the bottle, open it up, and the liquid is dark green! I was put off at first, but decided to try it. My thoughts are it's tart, and tastes like fresh mango. I felt better that day! I was amazed. I've tried other vitamins, and I like this one the best so far. I did try another liquid vitamin, that was so bad I had to mix with juice, but this one, you can sip from the cap, and you're done.
