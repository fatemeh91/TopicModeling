review/text: I am in my 30's and have had arthritis for almost 14 years. Over the last couple of years, the pain in my hands has become more disruptive, and I've tried several things in my search for relief. Prescription medications (oral), OTC topical creams, heated wraps and gloves (both compression and non-compression). I purchased two of these Futuro Energizing Support gloves and have been mostly satisfied...but not completely.As you can see from the product image, these gloves do not cover the fingers at all, and therefore the "warmth" benefit is limited to the palm of the hand. This is better than nothing, of course. There is certainly a benefit from the compression provided by the glove, but once again, this is limited to the wrist and the palm of the hand.On the plus side, the gloves are reversible -- able to be worn on either hand. I find I am not able to wear them for long periods of time, however...the piece that goes between the index and middle finger becomes uncomfortable and I find myself tugging at it. Also, the velcro strap that wraps around the wrist is quick to snag and pull at the fabric of the glove if you aren't careful. (Although I am quite careful to keep the strap fastened to itself even when I'm not wearing the gloves, I've got a couple of unsightly pulls on each glove.)I can recommend these gloves when you are looking for some compression (as long as you don't care about coverage for the fingers), and they are definitely great for wrist support thanks to the velcro strap, but I prefer the IMAK Arthritis gloves in general. Keep the Futuro gloves as a back up pair.
