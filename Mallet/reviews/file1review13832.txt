review/text: When I first heard about the product, I was more than anxious to try it. Every review that I read was good, so I had to give it a try. I must be the only one in America that was not satisfied with this product. It actually did me more harm than good. The only good thing was the warming sensation which was very soothing. However, after that, it itched like crazy. It's possible that I am allergic to it. I returned it.
