review/text: So I just started using this stuff today, and it seems to work. Be warned though; the "cooling" sensation it creates it no necessarily pleasant to start. I have a minor internal hemorrhoid which I have never had before. It was more swollen then anything, not terribly itchy and not burning at all. This ointment made it feel like it was on fire at first, then turned into a sort of cooling sensation which was not pleasant but not uncomfortable.It is definitely working in terms of reducing the swelling though, the pain/discomfort from the size of it has improved dramatically in just a few hours. I was using Preparation H before trying this, and it did nothing to reduce the size, it only made it slightly soothed/lubricated (vaseline would have worked just as well in my case). So if you want relief from swelling, don't have any bleeding (I think the cooling sensation would be way too much for an active bleed) and aren't afraid of a menthol-like cool sensation, then try this!
