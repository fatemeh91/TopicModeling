review/text: My mom told me about orange oil and I love it! I have an older table and every six months or so, when it starts looking dull, I apply orange oil to it. Normally, I spray it on, spread it around and let it sit for a couple of days before I wipe it off. The oil seems to last longer that way. When glasses are left on my table, there are no rings left behind!
