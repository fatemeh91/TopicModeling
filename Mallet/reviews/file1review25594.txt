review/text: Heard from my barber that this was a good unit. I bought it, and it was... for about a month. Then? New batteries notwithstanding, one day it simply wouldn't work any longer. Wouldn't turn on and defied me to figure out why. So, for twenty bucks who wants to hassle with warranty or repair issues?? Not me! The most effective, most practical solution seemed to be to hand launch the unit on a ballistic course over the fence of my back yard. It's now slowly becoming one with nature, sort of in the manner of "dust to dust" (plastic to plastic?), seeking its own destiny with nature and the future.... Hopefully the relic will be found one day by some future being, perhaps a member of a new civilization. Maybe he or she will ponder it, come to terms with it, and thereby gain more of an insight as to just how weak the underpinnings of the old America were, how the inoperative little hair trimmer is at some level symbolic of the failed American experiment as a Constitutional Republic, or the American failure as "Emperor of the World."
