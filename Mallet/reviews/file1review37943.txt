review/text: Bought this as a present for our 89 year old uncle, he's been experiencing fainting spells. His doctor prescribed these therapeutic stockings, saying his blood is "pooling" around his legs. The local medical store wanted $65.00 for one pair, found these on Amazon for half the price so we bought two pairs, arrived here in four days w/the correct size & color. They are a little difficult to put on but, he hasn't had fainting spells.
