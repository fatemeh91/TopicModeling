review/text: My relatively new dishwasher wasn't cleaning as well as it could. I ended up calling a repairman and it turns out I have hard water and things were getting clogged up in the dishwasher quite bad. He recommended using this once a month. I think this product may have saved me a repair call, but once a month may be excessive, I'd suggest once every two months.Before you make the repair call, try and test your water to see if it's hard. Then try this and see if that doesn't solve the problem. It's easy to use, you just set it on the bottom of your basket upside down and run it on hot. If you're sink is by the dishwasher, run your sink until the water is hot, that will save you from running a &#34;hot start&#34; if your dishwasher has that option. In fact the repairman recommend that I run the sink until the water is hot, then start the dishwasher. It helps with the cleaning.Good luck, I hope this product saves you some money!
