review/text: I was sooo fearful about drinking this as I read in the reviews that it tasted so bad people vomited! But when a coworker swore by the effectiveness of this I decided to purchase it.I went to my local Health store and bought a bottle that was smaller then what is sold here. Which didn't beat the deal here but I rather try things out before committing to such a large quantity. While buying it I decided to by a juice to put it into because I was afraid of taking the taste. I opted on a Odwalla (Flavor: Blueberry B) because I know their juices are thick and flavorful.I drank a little of the juice and then added one leveled scoop. I shook the heck out it (took awhile) and it mixed well.The flavor wasn't bad at all!... It did give the juice a bit of a chalky flavor but I didn't at all gag of feel grossed out. (Believe me I am horrible if something tastes bad - to this day I can't take cough syrup because of the flavor- yuck) I made sure to drink it quickly to avoid having to have it at room temp.So far I am happy - this was my first try of it and I have enough to last me two weeks. I will post again in a week to let you know if I notice a difference. Because I know if I do I will be ordering more. In the meantime, I will be getting a big container of Odwalla on my way home from work tonight.
