review/text: I specifically searched for this item online just so I could rave about it! I used these prenatals with my second pregnancy and wish I'd had them for my first. I continued to take them for the year I spent nursing my baby. They made me feel so good that I have started taking them again in place of a multi (I'm not currently pregnant). After trying many expensive brands of multivitamins (including the $$$ packets that are supposed to be better than a "one-a-day" pill), I still maintain I was better off with this one remarkable vitamin. After 4 days of consistently taking this, I am NOTICABLY more awake, energized, and focused. Instead of taking a vitamin because I am "supposed to," I take it because it actually makes me FEEL BETTER. I don't have to blindly hope that it's doing something!I am appalled by the people who whine about the bad taste and smell. They are supposed to be SWALLOWED, after all. Nobody says you have to suck on them. Vitamins and minerals that are natural, potent, and effective SHOULD have a sort of funky smell. Think of what they are made from! A "pretty" vitamin with no smell or taste is going to made of mostly synthetic ingredients that aren't going to be absorbed by your body anyway. I mean jeez, most people take vitamins in the first place because they are too lazy to eat right, so they try to get the required nutrients in a convenient little pill. They are vitamins and minerals you and your baby NEED, in a PILL, that you SWALLOW, ONCE A DAY. Now you want it to taste good on the way down and not have an odor? Do you want a vitamin that works, or one that is super attractive -- because this one works. Hold your nose and take it with something sweet if you have to.
