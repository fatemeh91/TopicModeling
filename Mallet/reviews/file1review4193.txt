review/text: I switched last year to the Gillette Fusion razor (ProGlide) - and love it. I never thought a simple razor (powered by a simple AAA battery) could be so efficient and effective. But with every razor comes the need for blades (which is what ends up being the true expense of shaving). Buying quantity reduces that price - and buying monthly through Amazon's reminder program facilitates the process. The Fusion Manual Cartridges are excellent in my opinion. They are reliably consistent, providing a time-efficient smooth shave. I use each blade 2-3 times - and for me, am happy to have finally found &#34;my solution&#34; for shaving that eluded me for many years with numerous previous razor systems and blades that I have tried. Thank you for this product!
