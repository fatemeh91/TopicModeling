review/text: This is a corded vacuum that works great on furniture which has a tight weave, the beater brush is made from some type of silicon material that really lifts the dog hair up. Our dog sheds alot and you will need to empty after each use but have used this on stairs and sections of carpet and found it is the best vac for pet hair
