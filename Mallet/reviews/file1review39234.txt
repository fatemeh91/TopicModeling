review/text: Bought to cut my own hair while in school. I have wavey hair, but the clippers work really easily. No pulling. I was careful the first haircut (took me close to 40 minutes), but it turned out really well. Don't hesitate to buy. Take your time trimming. It helps to have a small, handheld mirror and/or someone to make sure you trim the back evenly.
