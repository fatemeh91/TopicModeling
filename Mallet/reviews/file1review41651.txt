review/text: I like this tooth brush, and think it's worth it's higher price. After a year, I still brush much longer than if I used something else. It does a great job on plaque. It's better than my Sonicare, but it does require more cleaning. The tooth paste collects on the head and base of the brush. I only use one of the speeds, and do not use any of the different brush options.
