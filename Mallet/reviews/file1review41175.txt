review/text: I purchased Australian Dream cream from ads I saw, store display, and also other people talked about it helping them. I have been suffering arthritis pain in my right shoulder, and every night I wake up to shoulder pain by the morning, I also suffer back pain from a ruptured disc, and taking pain pills daily for that. Due to one failed kidney pain meds must not be NSIDS and that is what works on this type pain. I noticed aspercream helped, so I tried Australian Dream, on my shoulder and just for kicks, tried it on the area of my lower back where my pain comes from. It has helped me with agood nights sleep for 3 days in a row, and I haven't had this relief in about 5 yrs. I have noticed a awesome improvement in my shoulder, and it doesn't snap crackle and pop like it did before and my back is more comfortable. The pain meds I was taking during the day is cut to less then half what I was doing before. Best sleep I have had in years! I just say try it, it worked for me. Very happy with the results, in only 3 days.
