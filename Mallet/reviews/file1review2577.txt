review/text: read all the reviews, decided to test it out myself. definitely not disappointed. this is my first vibrator and i really enjoy it. i don't use it very often, but when i do it gets the job done! the rotating option could be a little stronger (if you squeeze to hard it stops rotating, the only time my kegel exercises have worked against me, lol). otherwise i love it!
