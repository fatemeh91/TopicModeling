review/text: I just got my shaver and have only used it dry so far. I have dark course hair on my legs, so it can be a challenge to get a smooth shave with an electric shaver. The Panasonic ES-2208AC Progression Ladies Wet/Dry Shaver didn't make my legs smooth like after shaving with a razor, but it was the next best thing. When I don't have time to shave with a razor I just shave with this and it makes the hair less noticeable. I don't think any electric shaver shaves real close, so just don't expect a shave like you get with a razor. Like I said, I have course black hair on my legs, so this shaver might work better for those lucky ladies with soft blonde hair on your legs.
