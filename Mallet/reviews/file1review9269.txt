review/text: ADEQUATE CAPACITY FOR PILLS BECAUSE IT IS PUFFY SHAPE(TOP AND BOTTOM). EACH BOX IS STURDY PLASTIC, DIFFERENT COLORS AND HAS LARGE BLACK LETTERS SPELLING OUT THE DAYS OF THE WEEK, PLUS IT HAS A.M. AND P.M. THIS INDICATES THE SEPARATION DIVIDER INSIDE THE PILL CASE. I GAVE IT 3 STARS BECAUSE THE TRAY, WHILE NICE PLASTIC, DOESN'T HOLD THE CASES IN PLACE. ANY MOVEMENT WILL CAUSE THEM TO FALL OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE SLIPPERY. SO YOU NEED TO LEAVE THIS IN ONE LOCATION.
