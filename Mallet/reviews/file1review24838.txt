review/text: I began taking FertilAid after I had intermittent spotting in between periods every month for about six months. After my first month of taking it, the spotting has stopped, I ovulated mid-cycle (confirmed by BBT charting), and my luteal phase has gone from 8 days to 11 days (and counting). I suspected that my spotting was due to hormonal irregularity, and in just one month, FertilAid has appeared to regulate my cycle. I will continue to take FertilAid until I get pregnant. I would recommend this product for anyone dealing with irregular spotting between periods or a short luteal phase -- two factors that can inhibit conception.I simply cannot say enough positive things about this product. I was dealing with stress and depression due to my irregular cycles, and FertilAid has given me hope as my husband and I start trying to conceive. Thank you, FertilAid!
