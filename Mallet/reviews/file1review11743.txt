review/text: I bought these originally for myself. I didn't notice any improvement with my issues (the generic hormonal stuff, cramps and the like) so I gave up on them for a while. Then, my sister complained about some hormonal issues (mostly PMS) and I handed them over. Thought it couldn't hurt for her to give them a try. She noticed definite improvement in the symptoms that she was having issues with and I noticed she seemed much happier, better able to focus. She said they also seemed to help some with her anxiety. A few weeks later the pills ran out and I noticed definite changes in her mood. It was so bad even she noticed it! She ordered a few bottles and has been taking them ever since. I couldn't be happier with the outcome for her, but I knocked one star off because they did zip for me and because they have such weird ingredients. We ended up calling them her "Cow Titty Pills" because of the bovine mammary extract contained within. I don't even want to know how one acquires bovine uterus extract. Craziness.
