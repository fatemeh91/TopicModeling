review/text: Quick points (it's just a shaver)- cuts decently close, but nowhere near a shave- large spacing between the teeth, so multiple passes necessary- batteries don't like to stay seated, a couple of taps of the unit against the hand usually get it running again- it does look good, with a blue power light and rubberized grip- the length attachment is AWFUL! fills up with hair, has to always be emptied, which wouldn't a big deal if it wasn't so hard to remove! the intended pressure point to squeeze the head to remove the spacer isn't very effective.I wouldn't recommend this for a clean shave or a 5pm shadow. this is good for longer-bearded guys who want to shape the beard or pick off the straggler hairs.
