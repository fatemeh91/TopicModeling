review/text: After reading various reviews of this tub, I can agree with most. It is the best way to naturally bathe your child. No special seats or other devices. Only noticed one defect. After owning two, these are things to consider:1) CHILD MUST BE ABLE TO SIT UP. Make sure your child can sit up effectively. Even if your child is big for its age, this tub is really suited for 7 months and up.2) WALL SEAMS ARE STURDY, FLOOR SEAMS ARE NOT. Within a short period of time, the floor seams on the ones that I have erupted. On the two that I own, they both began to leak in the second floor column toward the rear. Since this is on the seam it is almost impossible to fix.3) INCLUDED PATCHING MATERIAL IS INEFFECTIVE. If by chance you have a rip, your best bet is to use duct tape and a little epoxy. The included patching does not do the job. It comes off very easy.4) DRAIN TAKES GETTING USED TO. Drain can be awkward at times and will not fully drain all of the water out of the tub. Once you have used it a few times, you are able to work around the issues and dump the water out by flipping the tub over. After getting used to it, you'll become a pro.5) USE A HAND OR LOW PRESSURE PUMP TO INFLATE. Please do not think you can blow this tub up with your mouth. Even someone with terrific lungs would get dizzy after trying this. I personnally used the tubing from my child's nebulizer and it inflated within 7 minutes.6) CAN BE SLIPPERY AT FIRST, BUT CHILD EVENUALLY GETS USED TO IT. My daughter gets so excited about taking a bath that she sometimes stands up. The first couple of times she did this, I held her but she would manage to slip a bit. Over a period of time, and after slipping a few times, my daughter has developed the necessary balance to stand.
