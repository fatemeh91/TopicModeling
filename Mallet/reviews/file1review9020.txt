review/text: I decided to wait until after 60 days before reviewing this product, as I wanted to give the product time to 'work'. The main question I'm sure you're wondering is: does it? Well, honestly, at first I couldn't really feel that much of a difference. It wasn't until recently--after having the flu for several days--that this product really shined...After having vomited (and etc nastiness) for two days with the flu, my body was out of whack. I didn't have much of an appetite while recovering, so one morning after I held down some oatmeal, I decided to take this out of the freezer and drink a serving. At first, I almost regretted ingesting it because the taste isn't pleasant and that alone almost made it come back up. But WOW! Once this stuff kicked in, I actually started feeling better and had energy for the first time in days! My stomach got back to normal fast and I have no doubt that this product helped my recovery time.I mix this with organic apple juice in the mornings after breakfast. Does it taste like grass-flavored dirt mixed with tomato juice? Yep. But does it help? I do believe it does. And the amount of awesome stuff (like the probiotics and organic foods) are enough to get me coming back to it despite the price.
