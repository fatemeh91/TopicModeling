review/text: i bout this knife about a month ago now. i had to get a new one because i bout a cheap one from the local flea market and it broke so i decide to put a little money into a strong and long lasting knife. i use it for hunting and fishing and it is great!! really sharp to cut almost anything you need to. also a great knife to carry in your pocket for general reason. all together i gave this knife 5 stars. you will be impressed with this knife if you choose it!!
