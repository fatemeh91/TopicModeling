review/text: This is a really well thought out design. There are two features that make it stand out from the pack.The bristles are firm enough to clean, but they easily bend to get through small openings. So far, the bristles have snapped right back to their original shape.The best feature is that the handle is somewhat flexible. It has enough bend to it to really allow the bristles to get to the hard to clean areas. I feel confident that I have not missed a spot and the entire bottle is thoroughly clean when I am finished washing.Well worth the price.
