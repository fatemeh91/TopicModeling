review/text: This was, without a doubt, the grossest shake I've ever tried. I used their shaker, and after nearly five minutes of vigorous shaking it STILL had chunks in it. Don't even think of trying to drink it out of the shaker's drinking spout... it's so thick it won't move... and not in a good way, in a like-the-stuff-you-clean-out-of-the-tub-drain way. To add insult to injury? It's GREEN! I'm not even kidding... it's a chunky, bubbly, thick mess of green that is totally gross. Waste of money.
