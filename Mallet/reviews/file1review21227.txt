review/text: After 2 months of use, my dentist noticed there was less tartar build-up. I told him I was using the Sonic Complete.- 2 minute timer - 30 seconds for each part of the quadrant (upper right, upper left, bottom right, bottom left of the mouth).- you can set it to two different modes (normal, soft brushing)- the 3rd feature, a massage (for the gums)- lasts about a week and half without charging (like any rechargeable battery, the battery will eventually die).- comes with a travel case (holds toothbrush and 2 extra brush heads)A fancy version of a toothbrush but worth the money.
