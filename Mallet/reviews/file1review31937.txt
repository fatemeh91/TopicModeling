review/text: I decided to buy this after visiting my local health food store several times. The store associate was trying to sell me on Macro Greens, but my gut was going more for Perfect Food. I am happy I did! There is much more in Perfect Food than in the Macro Greens. Now...the taste is not the greatest, but it I as expected from eating green foods. It tastes like eating spinach and kale without dressing when you blend it with water alone. I like blending it with apple juice and/or putting a banana or mango in it. Overall in the last week plus that I have used this, my energy level has been so much higher. My energy lasts throughout the day, and I've been sleeping much better at night. My husband even said my skin is glowing (not from pregnancy, LOL). I feel so much more alert while at work. I've already ordered another container from Amazon, and also ordered the Raw Meal. This has become a morning ritual for me (and now my husband). These supplements will definitely help me as I transform my body to become more alkaline. Also, I will add, that while my husband and oldest were sick with the flu this week, I haven't had so much as a sniffle. I have also been giving some to my 3-yr od twins and they haven't been sick either. They don't mind the drink because the eat a lot of greens anyway. Definitely try this if you are thinking about it.
