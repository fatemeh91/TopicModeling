review/text: It's interesting how the previous comments written regarding the fire this pillow started in my home just disappear from this site. There was NO ARCHING FROM ANY ELECTRICAL WIRING in my home, that is always the preliminary statement placed on fire reports on scene because it is the most common, 5 electricians have deemed the electrical arching not the cause of the fire, HOMEDICS never tried reaching me, THE USPSC LAUNCHED THEIR OWN (on going) INVESTIGATION OF THE PILLOW, I saw the pillow sitting on my sofa ON FIRE with my own eyes, furthermore, HOMEDICS NEVER REPORTED THE FIRE TO THE USPSC (Product Safety Commission) WITHIN THE REQUIRED BY LAW 72 HOURS AFTER IT WAS REPORTED TO THEM. How does Homedics explain that one away when it's a product safety law that carries heavy sanctions when it is not reported to them within the 72 hours? Was there some reason it wasn't reported as required? As a matter of fact when I did call HOMEDICS, their response to me was "So what do you want from us". It's not about "wanting", it's about safety when these pillows make great gifts for elderly people. Unfortunately HOMEDICS didn't think it was important enough to investigate and immediately placed this spin campaign on the situation, but the US PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION found importance in the matter. I'm not saying Homedics is a horrible company and you shouldn't buy their products, I'm only stating that on August 17th 2005 my smoke detectors went off and when I went into my living room "flames were shooting up from the Squush neck massager pillow" that was sitting on my sofa and my house was destroyed, not to mention myself being injured and it almost killing my dogs. How does Homedics explain the "electrical outlet behind the sofa" (they claim arched)still being intact and unburned and not even melted? This is a review site, and that is my review! Anyone can draw their own conclusions and use the pillow at their own risk! My purpose is not to slam Homedics in this review, I just think people have the honest right to know what happened with the pillow at my home!
