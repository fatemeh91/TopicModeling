review/text: This is my first electric razor. I got it several years ago, and It's just kind of so-so. The issue I have at this point is that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find parts for this thing. Especially the shaving gel packets.I suppose that's more of an indictment of the razor itself, instead of the blade. But anyway, the blade works. I'm disappointed that it seems to be dropping out of the support sphere for Phillips Norelco. A year from now, the machine will work fine, but I may not be able to get a blade for it.
