review/text: Note this will only work if you get up at the same time every morning.When you get the sleepkey computer you sleep normal for seven nights. When you are in bed the device emits a tone or vibration or both, your choice. If you hear or feel the signal then you push a button.After seven nights it calculates how much you actually slept. Then it adjusts your bedtime so you sleep for the number of hours determined in the first week. I normally went to bed around 9:30 when I started but then I had to stay up until 11:45. The device still monitors your sleep and makes the signal and you push the button when you hear the noise.The first week I felt great and I had a lot more time to do things at night. The device moves you bed time earlier when you don't push the button by about 15 minutes. By the third week I felt tired all the time and I frequently cheated by taking naps during the day because I felt so exhausted. Gradually my bed time moved earlier to about 10:00 and I felt that I had better quality sleep. When daylight savings time came around I felt pretty messed up for about a week but then I got back on schedule. I sleep better now and I feel that it helped me but the device is more for those with chronic insomnia rather than occasional insomnia.I have also tried exercise, sleeping pills both prescription and herbs and combinations of herbs. This device worked the best for me.
