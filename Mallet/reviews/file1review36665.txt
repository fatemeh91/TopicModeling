review/text: The bar had an almost overpowering scent out of the box, but fortunately it faded over a reasonable length of time. It looks like regular Irish Spring except it's blue instead of green. It produced an above average amount of lather. It cleaned well, without leaving any noticeable residue. Seems like a good daily use bath soap.
