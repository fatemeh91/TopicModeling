review/text: After I ordered this item, I received a call from them inquiring the size. I indicated that I needed aan extra large, which they said they would send. After nine [9] days I received the Knee Strap, but it was a size medium.Calling again, I spoke with the same individual who remembered me, apologized for the error and would resend the correct size. This would also include instructions for return on the origional. After two weels plus, having not received the replacement, I called again, ane was told that the Knee Strap had not as yet been sent. Within the following week I did receive the item. Their website instructs the measurement taken at the center of the knee. My measurement was 18" which there web indicates an extra large [16" to 18", The instructions with the strap, when received, indicate that the extra large is for 18" to 20" measurement.Their web site stresses the their customer service is what they take pride in, unfornatunatly I didn't experience the end result of good service. My calls were responded with apologies but, there was no follow through.The strap is a tad large, but will suffice, as I do feel relief when wearing it.
