review/text: I bought one of these several years ago and loved it. It, of course, has worn out. I tried to find one locally to purchase again, but was unsuccessful. I was delighted to find it on Amazon. The rubber edge is soft enough to really squeegee the water off the tile well. The handle is easy to hold and long enough to reach the upper tiles.
