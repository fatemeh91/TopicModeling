review/text: Gaia Quick Defense3+StarsThis product is comparable to Airborne as they both claim to reduce the severity of the symptoms of colds, flu's coughs and fever. The main differences in both products are the ingredients.Airborne has an herb blend, which includes 7 herbs but it doesn't tell you how much of each. It also has vitamins including Vitamin E and Vitamin A. The problem i have with Airborne is the recommended dose is 3x a day at the onset of symptoms. Taking this product three times a day could be dangerous as it would be 300% of your daily allotment of Both Vitamin A and E, which could be toxic levels in some people. With that said, many people do like their product.I liked Quick Defense better as it only contains two forms of echinacea and a very small amount of elderberries and ginger root. The jury is still out if this is indeed effective to starve off upcoming symptoms, but in Germany which is the only country that regulates herbs, it has been approved to treat colds, upper respiratory infections and UTI's.The only thing that really concerned me about this product is the amount taken daily. Directions say to take two pills 5x a day, that seemed excessive to me, however I took them for 2 days and actually did feel better with my head cold.Keep in mind this product should not be used by people with certain diseases and autoimmune diseases. Check with your doctor before taking this or any type of herbal product.If you are already taking this type of product to ward off illness I would definitely recommend this, however I prefer to sweat out the symptoms.
