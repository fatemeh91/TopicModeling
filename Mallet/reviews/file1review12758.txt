review/text: Although it is a bit thinner than the famous SAM splints, it is still adequately sturdy. I suspect this splint will perform very well for its low price. My only complaint is that the splint arrived folded over itself in fourths (and nicely shrink wrapped with a paper insert inside) rather than being rolled as pictured. I would have preferred that it was rolled so it wouldn't be creased, but it's no big deal. It's more compact this way anyway, and I can roll it myself if I need/want to.Summary: Good product. Will likely perform close to as well as a SAM splint for considerably less money.
