review/text: HAVING TWO KNEE REPLACEMENTS AND SPINE SURGERY, MY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS LIMITED. I DO HAVE ACCESS TO A GYM AND DO LOW IMPACT STEPPING AND AT HOME WHILE WATCHING TV AND SITTING TALKING ON PHONE, I CAN PEDAL. THE PEDAL EXERCISER IS SIMPLE IN CONSTRUCTION, LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO PUT OUT OF SIGHT WHEN NEED BE.
