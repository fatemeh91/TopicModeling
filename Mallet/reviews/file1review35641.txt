review/text: I have sun spots/ acne scares on various areas of my face. I have overall good skin and was able to cover the spots with makeup. Even though, I've been trying for the past 3 years to remove them. I've tried Clinique, este Lauder, Murad, bare essentials products to name a few.... I've tried so many I can't even remember their names! Then I saw a review for Ambi and figured its so cheap why not? And I've gotten the best results!!! It does take time... I saw results after a week and it only gets better after a month etc... But I apply twice a day. I've even applid it to a dark spot on my leg and it's even faded that. If your skeptical take a before picture with no makeup and take another after a month and compare. Always wear sunscreen. Sunscreen is vital because the sun will only darken your spots and make the ambi cream less effective!
