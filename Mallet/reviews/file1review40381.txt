review/text: My last bad cold came at the onset of allergy season. I remembered I had these in the cabinet and decided to try out about 24 hours after realizing I was getting sick. It may have been more effective had I taken the first dose earlier on, however, I felt much better the following day after taking the full recommended dosage. I like that the ingredients come from trusted sources and that you can find out online where each herb is from by typing in your code listed on the bottle. Only major downside is I went through this whole bottle very quickly while sick, and given the cost I am not totally sure I would buy these next time I feel a cold coming on.
