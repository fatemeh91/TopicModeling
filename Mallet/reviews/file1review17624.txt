review/text: I have been using a Peanut trimmer for years but dropped it so I was forced to buy a new one. The MB-200 is a clearly superiour trimmer. What makes it so nice is that I can set it to go as close as I want ("stubble"), it cuts evenly, and the battery hold a charge for a long time. I also like that I don't have to oil the blades. I am very happy with this purchase.
