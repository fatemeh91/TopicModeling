review/text: Total Health Discount had these the cheapest. I ordered them and 13 days later they sent me an email saying that they were out of stock. I got on Amazon to write a bad review and the company still says it has one order still in stock. Do yourself a favor and order from another company. Higher Mind pills are great and worth the trouble finding below the store price.
