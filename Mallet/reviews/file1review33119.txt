review/text: My chiropractor recommended this to me as a way to boost my immune system. I have definitely taken it consistently and as directed at the very hint of a cold, and I've ended up getting sinus infections and bronchitis just as usual over the previous months. Instead of this, I would recommend drinking a lot of water, taking a multivitamin, eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of sleep, and eliminating as much stress from your life as possible. That'll probably be the real trick to health -- not just a weird smelling little pill.UPDATE (5/12):My husband and child were both extremely ill over the past week. My husband was the sickest he's ever been in his life. I took six pills (plus some echinacea tea) the day I felt the sore throat coming on. I DID get sick, but I only got a cough -- no fever, no blistering in the throat, no vomiting, no rash. I am a convert.SECOND UPDATE (11/12):I have a crap immune system. I had shingles in Sept, followed by a kidney infection in October. Horrible! I started taking these again (two in the morning, two in the evening) while I had the kidney infection. My husband and two year old son got a horrible cold and cough, and my husband got bronchitis from it. The little one got ANOTHER cold. Since I've been consistent with taking it, I have not gotten either cold. I also had a small shingles rupture on my finger this morning and took six pills today. It is now gone. (I have had shingles twice this year; I'm a freak of nature.)I'm now a real believer in this stuff. Seriously I am. And I don't believe in many herbal remedy type things. I take a vitamin and fish oil. And this stuff.The ingredients SEEM to work. And they're not so weird -- lots of garlic, echinacea, astralagus ... stuff that's pretty commonly seen as immune boosters.I may not be a double-blind study, but I can swear that this stuff works -- at the very least to prevent upper respiratory infections.
