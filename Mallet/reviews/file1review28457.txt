review/text: I used to plug "5 lb. whey" into google and just buy whatever came up as cheapest. But after stumbling upon this one recently, it's definitely my go-to from now on.1. Ease of mixing. You truly don't need a shaker; this mixes extremely well with a spoon and a glass of water/milk. No leftover globs like most proteins that won't mix up no matter how hard you stir.2. Easy on your digestive system. I usually drink about 4 shakes a day, and I don't have ANY digestive problems. The last protein I tried literally gave me constant gas. No gastrointestinal problems here whatsoever. big plus.3. Taste. I like to drink mine with water and the taste is fine. Often I'll get sick of one brand and have to switch to another, but so far so good with Optimum.4. Value. There are 77 servings in the 5-lb tub. No tricks like making it take 2-3 huge scoops of the power to make 1 serving. One scoop = 1 serving = 24 grams of protein.Hope this is helpful - I don't usually bother with reviews but really liked this product. The only negative I've seen is the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners, but that doesn't bother me. Only 1g of fat and 1g of sugar per serving... that's basically negligible, and an acceptable trade-off for the taste.
