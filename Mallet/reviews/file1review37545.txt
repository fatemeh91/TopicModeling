review/text: I chose this sleep mask after reading Amazon reviews. The main portion of the mask does not touch the eyes and the strap is adjustable enough for large heads. I dislike anything binding around my head and I have don't want anything touching my lashes in my sleep. I am very satisfied with this product even though it is pricey.
