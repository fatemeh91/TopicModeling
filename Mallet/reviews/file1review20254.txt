review/text: Used diapers for a different purpose. For a family member with a very dificult rash and excoriated area in their groin area that would not heal. After applying medicine to the area, I used the diapers [after cutting them in one half and sewing the edges together] to place in the groin area to keep edges of groin from touching each other. The diapers were all cotton and very light and that allowed the area to heal.
