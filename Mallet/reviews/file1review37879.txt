review/text: These tablets do take a little longer to dissolve than others I have used, but they seem to work better. I put the tablets in a med dropper, fill it with the amount of water needed, holding my finger over the dropper to keep the water in. Then I shake it back and forth to help dissolve...takes about 3-5 minutes. I squirt the meds on a Q-tip and rub it over my little ones gums. Sometimes she will even bit down while I am doing it, so I know it is really working! Takes some time, but worth it!!
