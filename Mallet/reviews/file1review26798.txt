review/text: This is my 4th 5lb tub of ON Whey. I have tried Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry and Double Chocolate. Double Chocolate is by far the best tasting of the four. Not that the others were bad by any means, they are all great tasting. The Double Chocolate is just far more superior. It satisfies the sweet tooth while suppling you with great protein and BCAA's.
