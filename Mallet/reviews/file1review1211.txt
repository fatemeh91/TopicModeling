review/text: I love these little gems. I'll never use a toothpick again. I even keep some in my vehicle.One end is a brush which fits between even the tightest spaced teeth and the other end is a flat curved surface which is good for larger spaced teeth. The plastic material is thick enough that it won't snap yet flexible enough to manipulate well in the mouth. I would recommend these, in fact I give them to my friends and they want to know where to buy them.
