review/text: I previously used a Sonicare Elite for several years, on the advice of my dentist. It was wearing out so I wanted to try something new. The reviews for the Oral-B were very good so I bought it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I guess I should have realized the Oral-B was a rotating motor type toothbrush, and I was used to the tiny sonic pulses from the Sonicare. BIG DIFFERENCE. With the Oral-B, I felt like my mouth was being drilled upon, and my whole head vibrated. The brush head was very large and cumbersome for me.I ended up going to a local store and buying the Sonicare Flexcare, which is not the cheapest one out there, but returned to the sonic pulses and extremely clean feeling after brushing teeth. No head vibrations! Smaller brush head with softer bristles, good for sensitive teeth or gums.In defense of the Oral-B, the toothbrush did clean my teeth well. I just didn't like the jarring motion compared to the Sonicare.
