review/text: I had a similar neck pillow made by another company- which got lost on a plane, train, or...somewhere else along the way on a recent trip. I was very glad to find this!These pillows are filled with rice and buckwheat, which comform to your body and provide much better support than foam, air, just about any other material.We bought 3, (2 "travel" and one "spa") and are very happy with them. The fleece provide warmth, and this one (the twilight crush) stays nice and cool (better when you're in the tropics ;) (the fleece will be held for use in travel).I'm adding this review for those who can't tell the difference between the various pillows offered (as the descriptions are pretty sparse). I believe the fill is the same on all of them. (so they should all be microwabeable). They all have removable covers, and so, are washable. The fleece retains warmth better, and the smooth fabrics stay cool. beyond that, i can't tell the difference between the "travel" and "spa" pillows.These are very well made, and a real bargain at this price!One other thing to consider if you are buying this as a travel pillow. It's pretty substantial (weighty), and might be more than some want to carry....but they are so much more comfortable than air pillows, and really good if you have neck or back problems.
