review/text: After reading the reviews posted, I felt it necessary to post a review as well. This product is helpful when cross contamination or accidental glutening occurs. It is by no means a substitute for a gluten free lifestyle for those diagnosed with celiac disease. It helps alleviate symptoms caused by gluten for those who suffer. For my husband, it helps alleviate symptoms when he has ingested gluten accidentally, however there is NO guarantee that it is preventing damage to your small intesting and the host of side effects you can have from uncontrolled celiac disease. Use this product, but carefully!
