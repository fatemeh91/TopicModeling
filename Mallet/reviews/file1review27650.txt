review/text: I can't really say if it's effective in terms of providing protein, but I leave that up to the science guys to test. I can say, however, it tastes good enough that you won't gag drinking it. I got the chocolate milk flavor. It does not taste exactly like the real thing ... if you know how the sugar substitutes (e.g., equal, splenda, sweet and low, etc.) taste like then I would say that it's tastes like chocolate milk with the "fake" sugar ---- makes sense b/c otherwise the product would have loads of carbs.
