review/text: The ingredients are wonderful and I think helpful for improving any health plan. My problem is the taste. Even in juice the greens are so strong I can hardly get a dose down. I am good with greens usually but this taste is just too strong for me to continue with. For that reason I do not think I will reorder this product. Maybe for someone who makes a large drink in the blender with a combination of strong items this would be an excellent addition but I do not do much blending.
