review/text: I can't find these razor refills anywhere but online and I'm afraid I'm buying them all! These are the best razors for me. I get a very close shave with them. However I'm finding that they do not stay as sharp as they used to. One refill used to last me a long time. Now I find that I have to change it out for a new one weekly. I'll still keep buying them though!
