review/text: I just bought and used the gillette Fusion razor. Halfway through I said the heck with this, and got my trusty mach 3 turbo out.The razor is just too big. It feels like your shaving with a butcher knife or something. I'm returning it to Target today after work. Seriously, don't waste your time or money. It's not worth it.
