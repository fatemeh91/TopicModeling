review/text: I ordered this product thinking I was getting plain, unflavored Benefiber (yes, my fault for not reading more carefully), but figured I'd use it up before reordering. The orange flavoring is just awful! Sickly sweet, cloying - can't figure out why anyone would choose to use this when unflavored is available and cannot be detected in any food or beverage. Benefiber does what it's supposed to and does it well, but I would definitely recommend buying the UNflavored product!
