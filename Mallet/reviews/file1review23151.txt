review/text: Ads for this sweeper are very misleading. I've used it 3 times and each time it has only picked up some dog hair and nothing else. It will never pick up: Tiny pieces of thread, paper, leaves, dirt, etc and these were all very tiny pieces. You can roll the thing back and forth over these items 20 times and all it does is move them an inch or two, never pick up. The amount of time it takes to use the tiny comb they provide to clean the roller brush takes longer than getting out the vacuum to do the job over. The handle comes in several pieces and even when assembled as instructed the handle will not stay together. It constantly falls apart and has to be put back together. You can get around this at least by using duct tape. Unless you have a very low pile carpet or berber, and the ONLY thing you ever have to pick up is pet hair, this Bissell product is a total waste of money
