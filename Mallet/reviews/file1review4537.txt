review/text: I finally made the switch from the Mach 3 Turbo to the Fusion with 5 blades and the difference was very noticeable. With the Fusion it feels like you're simply dragging a butter knife across a perfectly smooth, freshly saved face.There is virtually no sensation of the whiskers being cut. This could only be my own personal experience because I do not have a heavy beard.However, I do notice a significant difference in sensation of the hairs being cut between the Fusion and the Mach 3. So, there is obviously an improvement in this area.Overall, I wish I had made the change when the Fusion was first introduced. Expensive, yes, worth it, definitely.
