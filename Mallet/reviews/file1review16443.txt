review/text: I used this product years ago on all my children for daiper rash. If they developed a rash in one diaper I would apply this powder and by the next diaper change there was no redness. I bought this for my grandchild who had a severe diarrhea case with a red and bleeding bottom - her mother tried EVERY product the store sold and this powder was the only product that made the diaper rash disappear! I am a Nurse and I highly recommend this product. Thank you Amazon for having this product for sale!
