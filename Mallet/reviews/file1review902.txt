review/text: For many years this amazing invention has been a lifesaver for me. When my neck, or any other area, starts tocause me problems, I grab my neckease. put it into the microwave, and within minutes I'm on the way to feelingmuch better. I don't remember how many years I've had it, so that in itself tells that it's been quite a few.Even if my neck is not misbehaving, sometimes it's just comforting to have the warmth of it on dreary winterdays. A wonderful product, I highly recommend it.Grammy
