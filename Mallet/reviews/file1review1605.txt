review/text: I purchased this item for my 11 year old son who developed 2 warts on his finger. He was embarrassed and I looked on Amazon (my online site!!) and read the reviews for the wart stick. He is already seeing improvement in 2 weeks. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is hard to keep right on the area at night. Otherwise, great product!!
