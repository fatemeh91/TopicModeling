review/text: For me, this pill does nothing to suppress my appetite. Actually, it seems that I was more hungry on it, and I don't know how that could be! For the first couple of days, my stomach was gurgling and it scared me but it went away. I have taken the pills for about a month, and no weight loss!! I will not get another bottle when I'm done. BTW, i am exercising too.
