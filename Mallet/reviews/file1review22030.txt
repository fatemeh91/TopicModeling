review/text: Thin and protective. Glides on easily and smells / tastes amazing. I will say that this particular application is definitely geared towards the more feminine as it's glossy. Not just a sheen, but it is decidedly a gloss. Tingles a bit and lasts a long time. Buy a bunch so you always have one handy. Good stuff.
