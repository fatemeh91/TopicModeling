review/text: We use a number of vitamins and supplements as addition to as healthy a diet as we can accomplish regarding available choices and budgets. We also indulge occasionally in dinning out, which tends to diminish healthy vs a night away from the kitchen. The brand we prefer is. NOW FOODS. Vitamin E is essential as an antioxidant of choice. In my case I do not tolerate oil based capsules. For me this is a great alternative. I incorporate it into my dietary needs additioaly to help with fibroid tissue issues recommended by my GYN. Now is a trusted brand and affordable.
