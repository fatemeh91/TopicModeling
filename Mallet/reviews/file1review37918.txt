review/text: After wearing this product for 30 minutes I was in pain. It can't be returned so it is going in the trash. It may be a size issue--too small. However, I have had a similar product, which worked well, made by Ace that was size small/medium. This Thermoskin brace is a Medium. Very disappointing. A total loss.
