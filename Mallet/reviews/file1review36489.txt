review/text: I really love the scent of this. It has a spicier, earthy rose scent from the geranium oil in it. I carry it with me because like most natural deodorants on me, it doesn't last for more than 8 hours. I apply it twice throughout the day for total freshness. The spray is nice because there's no stickiness and it allows you to sweat naturally while masking odor. I even sometimes use it as a perfume. Great product, but I would suggest to someone who's never smelled it to go to a Whole Foods or your local health food store and try out the samples they have there. I love the smell and it works great with my chemistry.
