review/text: I highly recommend this for anyone that is active and takes the occasional scrape and bruise. I wouldn't have thought it was worth the price, but my cousin got me a trial pack of the Indigo Wild products so I put this one in my bag, just in case. Well, just recently I took a spill and lost some skin. I thought, I would give it a try and was really happy with the results. It helps keep the cut from stinging and prevents infection as well as providing moisture to help it heal. This is really great stuff!
