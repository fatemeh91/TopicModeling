review/text: The price is great for these. The only problem is they don't seem to work as well as the the exact same product I have bought from the store, and I think it's because these have probably been sitting on a shelf a while and are older. They still do ok but won't last as long before the solid wears off and you start getting razor burn. I will still use them up but probably not buy again.
