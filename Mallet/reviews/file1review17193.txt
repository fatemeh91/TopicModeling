review/text: I have used this trimmer from more then 10 years. My first trimmer bougth in Italy still works sharp.The wheel to regulate the length of the cut is not only useful but "necessary" to me as i like varying often between lengths according to the face position.I bought the second one only because I have moved from europe to US and I needed the new power supply for 120V (220V in europe).....so I thought would be better to buy the entire thing to have a backup trimmer. Now I am set for other 10 years.
