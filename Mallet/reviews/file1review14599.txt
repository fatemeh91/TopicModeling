review/text: What I read is that less is more with Melatonin . I have tried literally dozens of sleep aids including many with Melatonin and NONE of them have worked for me like this exact product. The combination products do not work as well as this and make me feel weird. I have or used to have problems waking up in the middle of the night and bought Midnight Sleep which worked for a few nights then stopped. I decided to try and chew one of these peppermint ones at 3am and they work great. And have continued to work so well I'm contemplating throwing out or giving away my remaining bottles of combo products. This even works much better (for me) than 3 or 5 milligrams.
