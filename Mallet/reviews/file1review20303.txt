review/text: Bought these on sale at Babies RUS. Well, now I know why they are so frequently on sale. The cloth is too thin and flimsy to use as diapers or burp cloths, and even worse, the material sheds little fibers constantly into the air. I had to wash an entire load of laundry again because all the fibers from these diapers got onto them,. They shed even after they are washed and dried.Terrible quality!
