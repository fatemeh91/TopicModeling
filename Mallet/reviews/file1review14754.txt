review/text: Lost 3 fingers in construction accident and were re-attached but lost the knuckles on all three. The therapist recommended the tan color.I liked it so much went and ordered all of them so I would know how much I had progressed in finger strength by the level of firmness I was able to use. Excellent product but must be supervised with kids as you do not want it around cloth or anything porous. The 4oz is the best for hand.
