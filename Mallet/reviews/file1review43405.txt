review/text: This review is for the prenatal cradle with the V2 support. I am 5 mo pregnant with twins and feel huge. I bought this hoping it would relieve pelvic pressure and support my growing tummy. I bought a size that was completely by a few lbs larger than my current weight.Pros: It does work to support.Cons:The velcro that tightens the strap to support your tummy is at an odd angle and pokes uncomfortably through most panties. unless you wear great granny bloomers, you have to fiddle with it to even get it to fall within panty linesThere is absolutely no way to adjust the hip -- It is already uncomfortably tight! I don't see how this is going to last me thro even next 25 lbs though it claims all the way thro 50 lbs more when I am expanding sideways as well with twins. What a waste of ninety dollars.The other reviewers are right on about the straps always showing everywhere. If it worked comfortably, that would not be an issue for me since I need the support when I have to walk around.
