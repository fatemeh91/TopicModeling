review/text: If you are a woman, the calipers require you to take a tricep measurement of your right tricep. There is no way you can do this by yourself, as you need to pinch the area and measure it at the same time with one hand. Also, it requires you to take all 3 measurements (tricep, illiac crest and thigh) because it will calculates a fat %, so it is limiting in that respect. If you want to be more scientific, I would get a manual caliper.It also is set up to measure and store 3 users, which may be an issue if you are training multiple people.
