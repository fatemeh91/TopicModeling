review/text: I purchased the Large NeckEase by BodySense for my husband and the Sinus Pillow for myself and let me tell you, I can only say I wish I'd gotten them sooner! We both go to the Chiropractor and have the Mediflow Waterbased pillows (see my review for those and the pillow case) but the addition of these 2 items was a great investment. We both suffer from neck and back pain and arthritis so we have tried many different things to help ease our pain and discomfort.I've used the Sinus Pillow twice now. We live in West TN and this time of year we can have some crazy weather - in the 70s one day and down to the 40s the next. This weather wreaks havoc on my sinuses, causing me lots of sinus pain and pressure and some pretty strong and painful, pounding headaches. I just heat my Sinus Pillow in the micro for the recommended time, lay down and place it over my eyes and nose and once again, it's not long until I'm fast asleep. Now, I'm not going to say it took my headache away completely each time, but it sure does relieve the sinus pressure and greatly reduces the pounding pain in my head so that I can relax and fall asleep quite easily. The various scents given off from each pillow is wonderful and very soothing.My husband has used the NeckEase several times already and I used it the other night...heated it in the micro, wrapped it around my neck and climbed into bed for the night. Was very comfortable laying there with my head on my Mediflow Waterbased pillow and before I knew it I was fast asleep!I would recommend both of these products and look forward to using them for years. And after reading the reviews of the BodySense Large Pack and Extra Large Pack I am putting those on my wishlist for purchase of one or both in the very near future!
