review/text: I bought this tub for my 7 month old daughter, who out grew her infant tub. It is very nice. It has just enough room for her to play with her toys, but still small enough to be safe. It blows up just like a pool ( very easily ). I also use this at my mother's home, where she has a tubless showers, and it works extremely well!! I suggust buying tub grips when you get it.Overall, excellent. :)
