review/text: Ignore other negative reviews. If you over heat this product, it will smell like burned popcorn; don't over heat it. The stitching allows one to distribute the contents as one desires; this is an attribute, not a negative. The quality has NOT changed within the last several years; it is still an excellent product. Yeah, the aromatic properties diminish with time; accept it.
