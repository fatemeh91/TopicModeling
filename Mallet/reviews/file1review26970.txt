review/text: I have been using ON 100% Gold Standard whey for about 15 years. I think it is the best tasting whey with minimal sugar and other additives hands down. ON 100% mixes well and digests well. The chocolate malt is especially tasty. I think I am going to make this my standard flavor. ON is also when of the best priced proteins on the market. The price here on Amazon is comparable to everywhere else. It may be a little cheaper (a dollar or two) than anywhere else. With the free two day shipping with Prime, this is the best deal on the protein you can get. I am, for some reason, always surprised when I run out, so prime shipping is great.
