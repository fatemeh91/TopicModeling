review/text: This is an excellent carpet sweeper, but as many reviewers have noted the handle does not screw together so it is constantly falling apart. I had to glue the handle pieces together with Super Glue, after which it worked fine. I had previously purchased the Bissell "Sweep Up" (the light blue model) and its handle is threaded and screws together, so I would recommend that model instead.
