review/text: 1/I'm looking for the deepest foot tub. Are there depth measurements for the top two: Brookstone's 'Aqua-Jet' and Helen Of Troy's 'Pro Ultimate'. 2/Brookstone mentions it can maintain 115deg water, but Helen claims to be the only unit that can heat cold water. SO: Can Brookstone heat cold water? & what temp can Helen of Troy maintain? 3/MOST IMPORTANT: Will these units run dependably if they are regularly filled with 2 cups Epson's Salts per gallon of water? (It seems likely that some water agitators/jets/bubblers may be ruined by heavily mineralized water.)thanks
