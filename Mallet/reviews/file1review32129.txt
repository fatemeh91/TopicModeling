review/text: I had read that real ice was more effective than a gel pack for icing injuries and this ice pack is very easy to use and very effective on my injured knee. It straps on with velcro and I like that if I need to pop up to get something it easily goes with me. Wide mouth makes it easy to fill with ice and it does not leak. Sometimes simple is best.
