review/text: This product by J&J; is esentially a tapered toothpick designed to fit better in-between the teeth than a regular toothpick. It does a fair job of cleaning out food debris and plaque from between the teeth but does not replace flossing as it cannot clean the bacterial film between the contact points of the teeth. It is the contact points where many people get cavities.The greatest advantage of this method of tooth cleaning is that it is easy to do and it is portable. You can use this product virtually anywhere and it fits in a shirt pocket.I recommend this product to those folks who like to have a toothpick handy. It does work, but don't thow away your floss!Jim "Konedog" Koenig, DDS
