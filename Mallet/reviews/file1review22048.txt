review/text: We purchased a 2-pack of these cleaners to clean the bathrooms at work. They were a reasonable price so we decided to give them a try. When they arrived, one or both of the bottles had leaked quite a bit and soaked everything in the box. I mopped things up, screwed the lids on tight, and used them anyway. This product does a fine job cleaning and the smell is fine, but the bottles continue to leak slightly when used. This can get annoying when you start to have cleaner running down your arm.
