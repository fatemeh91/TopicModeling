review/text: I've experimented with a few different supplements that are meant to increase focus, concentration levels, etc. The most effective combination I have found are vinpocetine and huperzine,Huperzine A (1 Gram) Bulk Powder. When I take both of these in the morning, I can study, write, and focus all morning with no problem. I also take them occasionally in the late afternoon when I need a boost for the evening and there is a noticeable effect. The only downside to taking them later in the day is that I have difficulty getting to sleep but this is a minor annoyance considering the overall benefit.
