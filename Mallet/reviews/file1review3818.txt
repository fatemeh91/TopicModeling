review/text: After reading many reviews, I thought this would be a product worth trying, boy was I wrong. Not only did it taste disgusting and required a pinching of the nose for every sip, it didn't bring me any feelings of relaxation or stress relief. I even tried two tea bags and nothing. I followed all steeping and heating instructions and still nothing. It was gross and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.
