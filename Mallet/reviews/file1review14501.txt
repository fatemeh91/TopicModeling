review/text: Some of the pops were weired flavors like lavender. The pop drops are only come in lemon orange and rasberry but those are really the best flavors. The Preggy pops work but then you have a stick hanging out of your mouth and you are attracting attention to yourself. And if you are around kids they want one. With the drops no one at work knew I had them and I could tell the kids they were medicine like cough drops and they were fine with it.
