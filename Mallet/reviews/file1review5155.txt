review/text: Good, durable, scale. Personally, I found all the pre-programmed caloric values annoying, but maybe someone else would use them. To just use it as a scale, it's great. I gave it to my brother and he's been using it for years. It's rugged, too. I saw him drop it on the floor. He shook it, and it worked again. I guess he's done that before.
