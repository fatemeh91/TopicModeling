review/text: As per Braun's recommendation, I waited 18 months before replacing the cutterblock and foil. Over time I must have forgotten how well and easily my 8585 worked when it was new. With the replacement parts in place my Braun has a brand new feel to it. I'll probably try changing the parts again in 12-14 months. It's well worth the price!
