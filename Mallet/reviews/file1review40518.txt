review/text: I rated this 3 stars because my husband absolutely loves it. I hate it, or it hates me. I can't taste anything after using it.I used it at night and I liked how it made my mouth feel very clean. Unfortunately, it numbed my taste buds.My husband made me a cup of coffee in the morning after I used it, and I thought he had made a mistake and put hot water and milk instead of coffee. Then I got up and made myself a cup. Same thing, it's like strong tastes have been edited out of my taste buds.I only used this because my husband likes it so much. He keeps one bottle at his office and one bottle at home. He doesn't have any problems with tasting things afterwards. In fact he told me that whatever I was experiencing could not be caused by mouthwash. I looked it up online though and I'm not the only one who has had this issue.So give this a try if you had really terrible bad breath problems, but don't try it the day before you have any good meals planned in case you get the strange side effect. I'm so glad I didn't try this the night before we went on our wine tasting trip.
