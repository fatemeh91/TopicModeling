review/text: I use this bag in my kitchen trash container. That is after I recycle it. I have to take my laundry out and I furnish the bags for return laundry. Then they are my kitchen trash bags. So far, not one of them has given out on me. The rolls are great in size and weight. I like the fact that I don't have to unroll to find where to tear off. I don't have to tear off. The bags are thin and don't look sturdy. For my purposes, they are just right.
