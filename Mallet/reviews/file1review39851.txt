review/text: Great idea, poorly executed. Works just for a bit and I do mean just a bit. Suction cups loosen, break off and THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE HAD!!! REPEAT THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE HAD! CAVEAT EMPTOR! My one star rating was a gift. If zero stars were available I would have rate it that.
