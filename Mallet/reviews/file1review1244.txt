review/text: Ever since going to get my eyebrows done and ending up bleeding, I have been reluctant to go get them waxed again. These work pretty well though the contour is a bit off and you may have to use more than one to get the precision that you need. They take off the hair pretty cleanly and the cold wax job lasts long enough. Plus, they're pretty cheap.
