review/text: I actually started taking this vitamin after I had my second child and I have been very happy with the results. I wanted to take a vitamin that had everything I needed for my health and for my baby since I am nursing. I like that it has no artificial colors or fillers, is food-based, and has probiotics added. I can tell that these vitamins are working for me because my fingernails are very strong and they grow amazingly long - they've never been like this before, even when taking other prenatal vitamins. I also have less digestion issues since taking this vitamin. I used to have frequent issues with IBS and now I don't have many issues, if any. This is probably due in part to the probiotics in this vitamin. I am very pleased with this product and plan to continue to purchase products from Rainbow Light even after I no longer need to take prenatal vitamins. I've also bought their children's chewable star vitamins for my 3 year old son and he loves them.
