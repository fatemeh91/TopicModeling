review/text: These massage bars are awesome! You need some of these. The therapy bar is wonderful. All of the bars I have melt with just short contact with skin, so massages are greasy, slidey wonderful fun. A thick slathering of oils from this bar take a while to work into the skin, but no matter how much you end up with, it will soak in after enough massaging. (Tired of getting the short end of the stick on massages? These will get your lover to make your massage last longer! They are so much fun to give massages with- and recieve!) The nub on this bar didn't last as long as I hoped, but it's not that big a deal anyway. It's still a great bar. No overpowering smells.
