review/text: I bought just one of these because it seemed like an odd tool, but now I wish I'd gotten the three pack. I've only tried it with Glide Deep Clean floss but it works incredibly well. Much better than disposables if your teeth are tight together since you can choose a floss like Glide instead of what comes with the throw-away flossers.
