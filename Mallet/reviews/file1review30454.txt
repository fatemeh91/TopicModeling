review/text: i purchased this Dermalogica soap because of concerns with blackheads and frequent break-outs. It produces a nice lather that smells good, but after a couple of days I noticed that the areas around the nose and my chicks were drying out, despite the use of hydrating creme. So I went back to my Clinique soap and use this product only 2-3 times a week. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it unless your skin is really oily.
