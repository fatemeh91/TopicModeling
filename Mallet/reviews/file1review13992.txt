review/text: While my product arrived without directions, I am very thankful to other reviewers who posted how they did it. I recommend reading the review where the buyer discussed boiling water, cooling water, refitting, etc. I've since realized that my top tray is not the best fitting- but it was also the first tray I molded (and the good thing is that I have a 3rd to get it right). And be sure to cut away extra plastic that will lay over your gums. This does take some finesse and time, but definitely worth it. These trays are somewhat bulky, but tolerable. For the money, you can't beat this- as teeth whitening has now cost me around $20 (trays and whitening stuff) as opposed to several hundred at the dentist. Color me happy!
