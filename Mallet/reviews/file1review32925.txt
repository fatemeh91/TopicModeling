review/text: I was looking for this tea to use with "The Master Cleanse" It was rather pricey in the local stores, if they had it at all. By ordering 6, I was able to save considerably. Found it to be a gentle and effective way to keep things moving. I enjoy the taste of this flavor, over the chocolate version.
