review/text: As I am travelling frequently worldwide , I always favor liquids of 1oz and less which are more convenient.This item has a drawback that may seem of no importance at first but is an issue in every day use. This lens cleaner has NO plastic top that prevents the spray from functioning when , for instance , being squeezed in your toiletry case or in a pocketIt is easy for something to lean on the top , emptying the bottleOne can only wonder about how many pennies are saved by dispensing with the necessary capI would not buy this product again
