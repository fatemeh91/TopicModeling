review/text: I am usually not picky when it comes to scents, but this deodorant smells awful. The smell is very strong, too, so it is not easily ignored. I gave mine to my husband, but even on him, the smell is bad enough to almost make me sick! It works fairly well and I love the fact that there are no harmful chemicals in it. But make sure you smell this before you purchase! I have never not used a product because of its smell, this is a first!
