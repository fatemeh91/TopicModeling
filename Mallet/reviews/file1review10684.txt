review/text: I have been through several pill boxes, stumbling around with them, picking my pills up from being spread around my bags, thinking about what would I like a pill box to be, until I found this product. This pill box is excellent when you have to take pills through out the day and do not want to carry around a BIG pill box and do not want to spend time every day filling up a pill box for the next day. This pill box is also very durable and does not open easily on your pocket, bag or purse. It also helps with your self esteem because you do not see at once all the pills you have to consume in a week, as when you carry a big week-long pill box. I highly recomend this product.
