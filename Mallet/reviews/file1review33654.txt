review/text: I have been using waterpik for a long time and I love it. Nothing can give you that clean feeling in your mouth better that water flosser. But I always bought mine from store and this time I decided to buy it on Amazon. It stopped working after 2 months and I can't request replacement per Amazon rules. I can send it back on my own expense and get partial refund. I don't think that is right. But the first two months that it was working, I love it.
