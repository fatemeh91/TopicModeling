review/text: I use one heaping scoop of this in a peanut-butter/banana smoothie made with Braum's skim milk after every workout.It's an affordable and convenient way to add additional protein to your diet. It tastes fine and mixes in a blender in no time flat.Please beware of people/vendors who try and sell you on the idea that their protein powder is going to change your life or have you ready for a fitness magazine photo-shoot in no time flat.The only thing that can do that is steroids.This is just protein powder------not the holy grail.
