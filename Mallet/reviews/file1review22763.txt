review/text: I wasn't too impressed by this product. I thought it could be better. The pill taking was not that bad i was able to take them all at once. During my workouts i would sweat like crazy! i liked that because it would help me get a better workout. It didnt provide too much energy except on the first day. It did make my arms and other muscles more cut, but didnt lose too much weight. The bads about this product is it makes you really hungry. Thats not really good if your trying to lose weight. overall all i gave the product a 3. they could boost the energy levels and if it would suppress your hunger it would be even better.
