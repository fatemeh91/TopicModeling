review/text: Not only does this tea aid in digestion, but it worked wonders on my 10 year old daughter's sore throat. She was experiencing moderate pain, and after trying Ibuprofen and Lozenges, I made her this tea. I added honey, and the tea had an instant effect. She claims that it did something to numb her throat. She continuted drinking it every night through the course of her cold. I am so pleased to have found this product! Excellent tea!
