review/text: didn't exactly buy this product from amaazon. I picked it up from wal-mart at the lovely price of .98! The consistency of the paste is great, nice minty flavor, and after just a few uses my teeth were starting to look brighter. Although I did notice that my teeth got a little more sensitive to cold afterwards. But that's just might be on me.All-in-all a great product and I highly recommend it!
