review/text: For the price of a good manual toothbrush, you can have this terrific electric. I have a couple of plugin rechargeables, but this is the one I use. The battery lasts forever, so recharging just doesn't make sense. I keep a spare on hand for guests, and keep one at my mom's and my daughter's place for visits. If you eat out a lot, you can even keep one in your bag. The brush combines back and forth with circular action. It cleans your teeth and stimulates your gums. I don't know why anybody would use anything else.
