review/text: Of all of the protein powders I've used, this one is by far the best. I don't get tired of drinking it every day like others with an odd taste. Even if you like chocolate or other flavors, I'd recommend this flavor. I prefer chocolate, but just add a tablespoon of Ovaltine to the mix and voilah ....chocolate! ...and it tastes much better than the actual chocolate.
