review/text: (From the wife) My doctor recommended this prenatal cradle last year, but I opted for a cheaper store belt (which didn't help me). Pregnant again this year with an infant to care for, I chose to follow his suggestion. I love my cradle! I've worn it daily, 8-12 hours a day, throughout my third trimester. Without it, my belly feels heavy and strained. With it, it's like someone holding my belly up for me. It's summer, so the straps that cross over the chest have been visible. At first I used safety pins to hide them, then I realized I could use my nursing bra (which I was already wearing for comfort purposes) to slip the straps off to the side under the cup snaps - works like a charm!! As a fibromyalgia sufferer who is dealing with pelvic and back/hip pain, this product has kept me mobile, moderately pain-free, and able to care for my very active pre-toddler.I definitely agree with ignoring the weight suggestions and buying a size up. At my smallest, I'm a size 8 with a G-cup bust, and pregnant left me a size 12-14 with a J-cup bust. "Small" just didn't seem possible. "Medium" was the right choice.
