review/text: After reading all the wonderful reviews, I decided to buy it for my bathroom tub. Other than the fact that the smell was unbearable, which I was ready to accept, the product did nothing to the few stains I had in my tub under the mat. Hope it works for others (and it looks like it does); but unfortunately, it did not work for me
