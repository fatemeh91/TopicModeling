review/text: I use this everyday. I doubt the power aspect does anything other than add a gimic. The blades work great and leave my face very smooth (I would have a very heavy beard). I especially like the extra blade on the back to do sideburns and keep the back of my neck looking clean. The blades also seem to last for awhile - mine go two weeks or so before needing a change.
