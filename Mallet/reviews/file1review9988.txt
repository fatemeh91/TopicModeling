review/text: I've tried several types of body fat calipers, and these seem to be the easiest to use, yielding the most accurate results. I always recommend AccuMeasure Body Fat Caliper to folks that are starting a weight loss program since the scale can be so unfriendly at times, especially when a person incorporates strength training into their fitness program (It's true! Muscle *does* weigh more than fat!). The bonus measuring tape is an asset as well since it makes it easier to track the inches that you are losing!
