review/text: I had high hopes that the back buddy would allow me to reduce the visits I made to receive deep tissue massage for my chronically tense neck and upper back muscles. Although the back buddy is well made and does provide pressure at trigger points, I haven't found it as effective as either rolling around the floor with a tennis ball under my back, or using a foam roller (very fun and effective). Probably would not have purchased it had I known this in advance. I gave it three stars though b/c it does what it claims (provides pressure on trigger points) and is well made.
