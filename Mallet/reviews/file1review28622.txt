review/text: I've been taking Optimum 100% Whey since high school (and I'm now a few years out of college). Like my review title says, it's reliable, it's consistent, and it's a quality product. I've tried all kinds of brands, and even gone so far as to order custom protein blends (which is still valuable if you have very esoteric needs). When it comes to straightforward, uncomplicated results, however, Optimum is virtually impossible to beat.-Cost effective, especially if you're an Amazon Prime member.-Highly mixable; whether it be a manual shaker or a blender.-Several flavor options.-Contains protease and lactase enzymes to aid digestion, and avoid stomach problems.I'm a professional athlete, and have to travel all over the world to compete. Quality protein sources can be hard to come by when you're in an unfamiliar environment, and Optimum 100% Whey is one of the most important things I travel with.
