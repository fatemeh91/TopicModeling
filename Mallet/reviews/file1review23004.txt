review/text: I ordered two Knee supports for my left and right knee and the package came exactly when they said it will. I used my fathers Knee sleeves that were exactly like these and I was expected the exact same product. But I was given the updated models that just had a different McDavid emblem and colors on the inside. I am very pleased and will order through them when I need another product. Thank you McDavid.
