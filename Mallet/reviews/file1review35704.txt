review/text: After trying every eye drop that has ever been to market :o) this one is the BEST. Also, in our local Health Food Store this product sells for $11.50 per bottle. I order 12 at the time at this price and have them sent to my son who has severe dry eyes and has been on Restasis. The Restasis is a good prescription medication but so expensive. We have found that using this product has helped and he has been able to get off the expensive prescription eye drops. Great product and ordered from Amazon at an awesome price.
