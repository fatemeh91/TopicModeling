review/text: I've suffered from some bad breakouts and acne for a long time now, on and off. I don't know why but I just got so lazy i don't want to type anymore. Okay I'm going to try and keep going. Anyway, like many others in this terrible world we live in, I tried absolutely everything for my face, washing it all the time, creams, soaps, acids. Up until now nothing really worked all that well, some might have helped a bit, and others made it worse. But then I had an epiphany! after reading an article online about how apricots were good for your skin because of all the vitamin A, i thought, why don't i just go directly to the vitamin and start taking it and see what happens! Well thats exactly what i did, and let me tell you, this is apparently the only thing I needed all along! After 2 days my skin was cleared up, and I've had no breakouts in about 2 weeks! Greatest feeling in the world and I owe it all to this product. Listened people, if you have terrible skin like me, it may just be vitamin A deficiency so try this out... After all the wasted years..
