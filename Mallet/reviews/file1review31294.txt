review/text: My 4 yr old daughter has had this spray used on her since birth. She is still wearing pull ups at night so she gets a spray before the pull up goes on and first thing when it comes off. We love this stuff from the light scent to the fact that it works. Buy one - try it - if it isn't for you, so be it...but we have sworn by this stuff for 4 yrs...and I am at the site to buy more. :)
