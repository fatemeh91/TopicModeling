review/text: I just bought this and I have to say this is the only potty seat that fits my toilet seat. My toilet seat is elongated and curved. I've read many reviews which says that it doesn't fit unless your toilet seat is completely flat. The rubber edge keeps the seat firmly in place without slipping. However the paddles on either side doesn't really do anything since my toilet seat is curved I just make sure they are out of the way.
