review/text: The first time I used the product I had 3 weeks worth of growth on my legs that was soft/fine from previous waxings. It really didn't hurt, just a very minor pinch and removed about 90% of the hair in about a 20 minute period. Although this was efficient, I didn't get the smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave. Also, the hairs slowly began to grow back within a week so I had to go through the process again. It's a great product to get rid of most of the hair, but if you want that smooth feeling you get when you wax or shave then it probably isn't for you.
