review/text: GREAT PRODUCT. VERY CONVENIENT TO CARRY MEDS TO RESTAURANTS RATHER THAN THE WHOLE WEEKS WORTH OF MEDS IN ONE BOX. EASY TO OPEN. LOVE THE PRODUCT. LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO FILL WITH SEVERAL PILLS BECAUSE THE BOX OPENS AND BALANCES ON THE HINGE. A BIT AWKWARD FOR SOMEONE WITH ARTHRITIS BUT OTHERWISE GREAT IDEA AND PRODUCT.
