review/text: My 87 year old mother-in-law just moved in with us. She is active, but has trouble sleeping at night with aches and pains. She has been using this for over 5 years and loves it. We found it on-line thru Amazon so she could purchase it on-going (since there is no health store close by). Just today her new physician looked at the ingredients and expressed surprise. He too was sold on it. She would definitely rate it a 5 plus, and I, too, am impressed. I would recommend it. Thanks Amazon for caring this cream; it has saved us a 100 mile round trip to the big city...and it is delivered right to our door step!
