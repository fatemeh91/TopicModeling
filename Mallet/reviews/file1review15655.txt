review/text: I've used Cruisers for my son since he was a newborn. I like them -- no problems with leaks, and they also don't have the baby-powder smell of the Baby-Drys (also by Pampers). Size 6 is sometimes hard to find in the supermarket, so I like to buy them online. If you buy them in the large box, you don't have to dispose of extra packaging.
