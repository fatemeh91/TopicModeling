review/text: I have been using this product for three years. It really does help improve the appearance of your skin. The scent is very light and definitely not overpowering. It has the kind of scent that you can wear during those hot, summer days. You can also get an unscented version of this product. This shave balm will work whether you use a regular blade razor or an electric razor.
