review/text: I recently conducted a wine study where we had 40 participants drink 10 wine samples of .75oz. We calibrated the AL100 units for each participant and found that the results varied by almost .2 after drinking. Yes, that value is not a typo and yes we allowed up to 30 minutes post-drinking before testing. We even had non-drinking control participants use the device and found that most values indicated the controls were extremely intoxicated (BAC > .2) at the conclusion of a study where they consumed no alcohol. I believe there are many factors that affect the BAC values for the AL100 but none are explicitly stated in the instructions nor would any user be able to attend to them all.So if you are seeking a device to help your child avoid a DWI, I suggest you look elsewhere. If, however, you are looking for a cocktail conversation piece then this unit provides ample coverage. The wild values will get a great laugh and the cost will easily be justifiable after just one party.
