review/text: I like that the product is safe and natural. I also like that it does gently scrub your teeth as you chew. At first, the taste is okay at best. The texture is a bit odd. The gum has a hard shell and is softer inside. After chewing it for about 10-15 minutes, the gum becomes so soft and sticky you have to spit it out. It also gets an odd flavor around the same time. The cinnamon flavor is about the same as the mint. I do admire their efforts in creating safe and natural products, but they need to be a little more palatable.
