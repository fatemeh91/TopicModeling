review/text: I purchased one for my husband and one for my father for Father's Day. They absolutely loved it. So seeing what they could do I watched the instructional dvd and I got the nerve to try to cut my son's hair, which I was told to leave alone. I was impressed with myself and never complained. He's 3 so he usually can't keep still. I let him hold the brush and put on the cape that was all included and he had a ball. Money well spent.
