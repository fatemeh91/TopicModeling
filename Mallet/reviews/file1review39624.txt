review/text: I love this thing! As gross as it sounds, I have never regularly flossed in my twenty years of life. I had made it my new year resolution for 2011, but hated putting my fingers in my mouth or running through the disposable ones. This is perfect! Maybe it's too early in the year to say, but so far I've flossed every night. Sometimes the floss falls off the edge and needed to be put back on, but this doesn't usually happen. One of those gadgets that is legitimately useful.
