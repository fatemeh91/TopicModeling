review/text: I'm sorry to say this but this deodorant makes me smell like an old lady. It's almost worse than if I didn't wear any deodorant at all. I was so disappointed. I am trying to stop wearing products that can be toxic. I love roses. But this product just doesn't smell right on me. Anyway, perhaps it is just my own chemistry and would be good on others? It smells fine in the bottle so perhaps that is the case.
