review/text: Ordered this badboy August 24, 2008. Today it is June 22, 2011. The blades sharp as ever. Cleans easily if you know how to take off the head properly. I have cut my hair on average once per week the past 2+ years. Let's calculate that: 52 weeks + 52 weeks + 44 weeks (this year). That is 148 weeks. That is 148 haircuts. If each haircut is $10 (which is a very low estimate and most likely a very bad haircut), that is $10 x 148 = $1480 in savings. In an economy like this one, people wonder how to save money. Well I will tell you how! Go get yourself the Wahl 79524 Clippers baby!!!!
