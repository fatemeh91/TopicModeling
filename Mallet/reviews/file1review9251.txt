review/text: I love that individual cases for each day are removable so that you can throw just one day's worth of pills in your purse if you're going to be out all day. You don't have to take the entire week's worth along. The cases are a little bigger than I imagined but still plenty small to keep in a purse or pocket. There's probably room for 6-8 pills in each of the AM/PM slots.
