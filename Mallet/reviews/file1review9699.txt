review/text: Smoke away works great for withdrawal, which happens to be the worst part of quitting! I do recommend being mentally prepared to quit, meaning you have to break the mental habit as well!!!!! Smoke away worked really well, I had only a mild headache the first day and that was it. A few days later my bad mental habits got in the way. I thought since I hadn't smoked in a few days, I could have just one. NO!!!! Don't fall into that trap! Be mentally prepared before you buy! I have been training myself to hate smoking for a few months and I plan on trying to quit again using smoke away. Every time I light up I think "I hate smoking, I can't wait to quit!" I have gotten to the point where smoking makes me gag and sometimes puke, but I do it so I don't suffer from withdrawal. So I think it is time to quit, my brain is ready and smoke away will handle the withdrawal! I am sure I will be able to quit this time.
