review/text: The Brookstone foot bath was promising but it was rather disapointing for the money. While the heater does a excellent job of heating cool tap water to a nice comfortable temp , the rest of the functions are no better than the $39 economy baths . The front portion of your foot gets the best benefit from the forward placement of the two circulating jets yet the rear ankle and heel area is totally forgotten The bottom foot roller is also of little use as it is mounted too low to give any real massage action to your feet.
