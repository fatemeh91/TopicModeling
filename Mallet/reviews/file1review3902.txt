review/text: This product is so different than the tv says. The strips are really hard to put on, and they only cover a 8 teeth, when 10 teeth show when you smile. So unless you put the excess stips on the rest, you have some white, and some yellow teeth when you smile. The strips are hard to keep on for 20 minutes, and the product tastes gross.I paid 40 bucks for these, and half are still in the box. I went out and bought the 20 dollar Rembrant set with the gel and trays and it works so much better. The gel stays on the teeth and tastes like a pleasant toothpaste. It whitens and the trays are easy to keep in. I will throw-out the Crest strips, if I can't give them away...do not use them!
