review/text: I own 3 of these between two houses. Our daughter loves this seat and it fits on our toilets quite well. Heck, we've even forgotten to remove it on occasion and I've ended up sitting on it myself in the middle of the night. Quite comfy in a surprising kinda way at 2am. LOL! This is a potty training necessity, buy it! Buy it now!
