review/text: I think this is one of the better values for r-ALA. But the powder in my caps are slightly hard due to moisture/humidity getting into the caps. Not to big of a deal, can't roll out the hardness with my fingers. So had to use a few wacks with the back edge of a knife to break it up a bit so I could roll it out with my fingers.First time that happened, but various supplements are prone to humidity. Can't comment on its effectiveness? Just going with the available online research. Seems like a good antioxidant.
