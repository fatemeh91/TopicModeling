review/text: The only trouble that I've had with the three of these that I've bought, is that over time,they tends to clog up. Perhaps it's the minerals in my water system.Otherwise, it's responsible for saving what teeth I have left, and within a week of use it improves gum health tremendously. My gums don't bleed anymore.
