review/text: I originally bought this to take with in my truck to get at my neck and in the middle of my spine after a long day of driving. I guess I didn't pay close enough attention to the over all size because the unit is much bigger that I thought it was. None the less it does work pretty good. On its strongest setting it is fairly hard, but not really strong enough for that deep muscle relaxation I like when the muscles get quite tense. The heat only works on the opposit end from the attachments and not with the attachments. This makes sense, but I was really hoping I could use the double pronged along my spine with heat.It's actually a pretty good unit for the price
