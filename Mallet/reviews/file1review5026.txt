review/text: I am just getting over strep and tried everything to take the blowtorch burn out of the back of my throat. Lozenges didn't cut it. My favorite herbal tea came close, but didn't last long and it was tough to swallow.Chloroseptic was what my pharmacist suggested. The spray doesn't taste as good as the lozenges or the tea, but it offers the longest relief out of any of those options. And when you hurt, numbing the pain is what it's really about.Rebecca Kyle, January 2009
