review/text: I have done several intestinal cleansing routines including the psyllium/clay/herbal types, most of them work to some degree but I have never found one that is the final "cure" for a sluggish system. I was anxious to try this one because of all the great reviews. It works as promised, is very gentle and is by far the easiest cleanse I have ever taken. If you get the dosage right it does not have to disrupt your day. And that is the key, getting the dosage right. You should be going between 3 - 5 times per day and the reaction should be gentle, not harsh. What the label doesn't say is that for some people the optimum dose is less than 4 capsules. For most of the people who have trouble and give this product a bad review, it's because they are more sensitive to it and they need to take the dose down to 2 - 3 capsules at first. For some people it's just one capsule that does it! So if your system overreacts, don't give up on the product, just try taking less and be patient.The fact that it oxygenates your system means that there are many other benefits at work and this product can potentially alleviate many chronic health problems besides digestive ones. Do your research on oxygen-based therapy; our environment is oxygen deprived due to deforestation, pollution, etc.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that after taking the seven day cleanse, I had hoped I would be "cured" like some people have reported. But alas, I still have my chronic problem unless I take a maintenance dose every few days. It's not serious, and I always prefer to achieve health by eating the proper foods rather than taking supplements. But you can't always eat exactly right so I plan to keep Oxy-Powder around and use it when I need it.
