review/text: I can not say enough good things about this product - it really does what it says. It is a supplement which keeps you fresh all day long. Following a shower and brushing your teeth, if you take one-two softgels a day, you do not need to worry about bad breath, stale BO, etc. I have also noticed that it acts as a antiperspirant for underarm and feet. This is a product I will reorder over and over.
