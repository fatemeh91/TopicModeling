review/text: Needed something to pull the shoulder blades back - have developed "wings" over the years of poor posture! The design is very poor in practical wearing. The fabric under the arms resembles velcro and very irritating & tight, without any adjustment for the armpit area. The center fastener does not stay in place - level with the shoulder blades - which further irritates the armpits by continuing to creep up toward the neck. Agree with another poster, this would be much more effective with a front adjustable band/strap to keep in proper position. Wearing does make me more aware of my posture which reminds me to correct the "wing thing" by standing with shoulders back. BTW I am 5'5" & 120 pounds, so I cannot imagine how uncomfortable this would be on someone taller or with developed shoulders, arm muscles, etc.
