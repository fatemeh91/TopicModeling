review/text: A little on the expensive side, but well worth it. I love the scent, which is kind of a a combination of musk and fragrant wood. Masculine, but not over-powering. Lathers well, and provides good lubrication for a close shave. I don't use it every day, but it is a nice treat to use a couple of times a week.
