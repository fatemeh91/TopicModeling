review/text: I purchased this product because I was going camping and spending time at the beach. Knowing that things live in the woods and sand that are very fungal and like human skin I figured I would be on the proactive side of the attack this time. It has been wonderful. I knew it had tee tree oil in it but was pleasantly surprised with the Coconut, Olive and Peppermint oils. This product attacked a fungus I did not even know I had but can guess I got it from the local pool too. I now use it after every time I am in public spaces, especially the watery kind.
