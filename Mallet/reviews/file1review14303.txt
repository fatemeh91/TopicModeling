review/text: These replacement heads are fine, as would be expected for a orig. manufacturer-branded item.I definitely recommend using the gel-dispensing inserts over canned shave gel/cream to reduce build-up in the heads. That said, it's not a cheap option. I've been using mostly Edge shave gel for at least the past year and since you can run the whole thing in water (I haven't used it in the shower in a couple years), it's easy to clean. Unfortunately, it will still get pretty nasty over time. And I think the inserts generally helped get a closer shave in less time. So there's trade-offs...In case you're wondering, the main body unit has performed admirably for years, the battery still holding a charge good for a few days of decent shaves. I don't let it run down too much as that drastically affects the closeness of the shave, which has never been the best, but pretty good for an affordable wet/dry. For longer trips, I typically shave every other day since the charging base is not travel-friendly.
