review/text: I discovered this product in a supplements shop and I have been using it ever since, for going on 2 years now. It's not easy to find off the shelf, but that is not an issue when you can get it through Amazon. I now recommend it to all my friends and family. With lupus-type joint pain, I find that I can get instant relief that lasts for hours and with regular use (and combined with health-conscious food choices), this product actually improves the condition. I had a bad left elbow for months. Docs and chiros couldn't help. Stopain made all the difference. The pain dimished with regular use and within weeks, it was gone. My adult son has started using it for chronic back pain and he is amazed, as well.It does have a strong smell of menthol when first applied, but I don't care since it eliminates my aches and pains.
