review/text: I haven't gotten this thermometer to hit 98.6 yet. I don't think I've seen it get to 98.0. I have established baseline temperatures for my child and myself so I will know if we are running a fever. That doesn't help me much to determine our exact temperature. I'm not sure if the thermometer is defective or if this is just the way they work. I am dissapointed with this purchase, but I'm not going to return it. Too much of a hassle.
