review/text: This product is great, exactly what we were looking for. The size is plenty big enough for my husbands size 13 feet. I love that this product heats the water. My one wish is that there was an automatic shutoff once the water gets to a certain temperature. My husband has little sensation in his feet and does not realize when it gets too hot. Otherwise this is perfect for our needs.
