review/text: When I purchased my first Gillette Fusion Power razor a few years ago, I thought it was kind of silly and the vibrating action was a mere gimmick. From my first shave I have been delighted. It really gives the smoothest shave. On the back side of the cartridge is a single blade for the bottom of sideburns and under the nose and other hard to reach places. The cartridges are expensive but they last me for months. This 8-count package should last me for a couple years of happy shaving. I wouldn't go anywhere without it and I keep an extra one in my gym bag.
