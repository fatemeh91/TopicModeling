review/text: Hi all. In the morning I take a number of supplements, and for months I had been fumbling with my hands attempting to open pill bottles. This was a frustrating and time consuming start to the day.Then I purchased the "Apex Pocket med Pack" which has made my mornings much more pleasant. Every weekend I prepare an entire weeks worth of supplements. In the morning I wake up, take the pills in the "morning" side - then I take one container on the road with me for any afternoon supplements. This also takes away the need to carry around bottles of pills during the day.Great product! Would definitely purchase again.
