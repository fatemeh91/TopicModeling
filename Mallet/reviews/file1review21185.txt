review/text: I have gone thru my share of heating pads but this beats them all hands down. My husband & I both use it daily. It is on our chair in our bedroom and it has become a nightly ritual. What a great way to end the day. He runs on the treadmill, showers and then takes 5 minutes on the heating pad. It really loosens tight, sore muscles.
