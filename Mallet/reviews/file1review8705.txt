review/text: I'm make protein shakes in a personal blender at work, so I needed something convenient for washing a small, fixed-blade blender pitcher and decided to get this brush. I've had it for 3 months now. I use it at least 3 times a day, and it works great. I've never had the head fall off, as another person said they have happen in their entry. I decided to also get one for home. The brush aspect (in contrast to a sponge) lets me clean beneath the blades of the blender pitcher. I've never had soap leak out of it or anything else negative.
