review/text: me and my husband have tried so many differet product, form astroglide to ky to everything else out there. all those other types leave a sticky stuck feeling after using. a feeling that only goes away after a shower. i just use a baby wipe afterwards. the wet just absorbs in the skin after a little cleaning. no sticky feeling. its just great.
