review/text: The 15 quart Rubbermaid bucket is a quality bucket, if you need 15 quart capacity. For my purposes, the Rubbermaid 12 quart size is sufficient.The 15 quart is rectangle, whereas the 12 quart is square an fits more easilyinto a kitchen sink. The 15 quart has less of a place to grip the bottom, in order to pour water. The 12 quart size offers a better shape to grip the bottom to pour.
