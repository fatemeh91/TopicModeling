review/text: My 1.5 year old son's favourite toy is eye-wear prespcription glasses and sunglasses (both mine and my wife's)and as a result, we had a lot of lost nose pads and loose legs on our glasses. Also recently bought some Banana Plugs for my home theatre system speakers from Lowe's and to my surprise they were the ones with the tiny screws in them, not the screw on type that I had bought from Amazon earlier,24k Gold Connector Banana Plugs, Open Screw Type 24 Pack (12 Red, 12 Black). I did not have a screwdriver that would fit the small screws on those, so I needed a small screw driver (was using a pen knife earlier to tighten and loose those screwes and it is pretty much a very frustrating job).So I started my search on amazon for a small screw driver and then thought about why not buy a glass repair kit and kill two birds with one stone, and stumbled upon this kit. Also read reviews and checked many other kits, while reviewing this and decided on this one maninly because of the price and it looked like it had a lot of pieces in it. Got it last week and overall I'm extremely happy with the kit, except for the fact that it is the worst packaging I have ever seen for small products like these. Everything was everywhere when i got the case and couldn't figure out which one went where and the fact that these pieces all require a magnifying glass to see them better wasn't helpful.But anyways apart from that it was a great buy and did the job wonderfully, both with our glasses and the banana jacks, the nose pads fit very well and i could find screws the right size for our glasses and the banana jacks (I had lost one of them on the carpet earlier when i was meddling with my pen knife).Overall we are happy, but if you expect a neatly packaged product, they have a warnign on the picture or product description about the pieces shifting, so you shouldn't expect it, I did not but was shocked even with low expectations. My question to the manufacturer or seller is why, how difficult is it to have a box with a lid which has place holding indendations or some kind of pegs whic when closed would cover the small holes on the basde box and thereby prevent the tiny screws and nuts from scattering all over. I would imagine if you can get all these small stuff made wellm, then it should'nt be too hard for you to figure out a way to package them better. Please do that and you would have had a 5 star review!
