review/text: Bought this for my Dad who is unable to shave himself. I tried one of the less expensive models and it only worked well on portions of his face. Took the plunge and bought this one, and it was the best thing I could do. The razor gets all the parts of his face, quickly and it's not too loud. The self-cleaning feature is pretty loud, but worth it because of the ease and quickness of shaving. I recommend for anyone who has to help others shave.
