review/text: I bought these thinking they would save me money instead of buying the disposable breast pads- they do not hold any leakage! I was constantly leaking all over myself, and my baby boy!! I highly recommend the Lansinoh brand disposable pads instead. A friend recommended them to me, and they hold 6 ozs of liquid (my husband poured water on them as an experiment). They are unstoppable! As for these cloth ones- I'm thinking of using them as shoulder pads :)
