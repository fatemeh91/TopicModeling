review/text: I have tried most nutritious bars on the planet and these rate pretty well. They don't have sugar or icky fructose but Splenda which makes them perfect for me. I don't want extra calories to sweeten a bar. Since I have bought these my appetite has gone away and I am not even an Atkins dieter. I highly recommend them for someone wanting a snack, (candy bar type treat), that will fill you up. A lot of protein and fiber, yes some fat, and no sugar. Thanks!
