review/text: I've tried lots of floss handles, disposable floss-ups, and other flossing devices, and this is the best of them all. Strong and well-built, and uses regular (any kind of) floss for decreased cost and less waste than the dispoable ones. Wind the floss once around the post while anchoring it by the base of the handle with your thumb, around the ends (pinching them together slightly to get a good tension on the floss), and twice more around the post. I use it with a wider glide tape, and it's the easiest flossing I've done in years (and the gaps between my teeth are quite a range, in some places so tight that regular disposable floss-ups just rip or come apart). Best of all: it's quick, and I don't have to put my hands in my mouth (because who knows where *they've* been?).
