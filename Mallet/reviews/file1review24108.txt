review/text: i suffer from mild adult acne and decided to give this a shot after reading reviews here and on other sites. big mistake. my pimples are typically small and rarely are they painful and deep. within a week and a half i developed a cluster of deep, painful zits. weird, i thought, but didn't chalk it up to the soap. after another week of use i broke out in another set of deep, painful pimples on another area of my face. after that, i quit using immediately. the smell didn't bother me, but the massive zits did.
