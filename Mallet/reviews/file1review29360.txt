review/text: This magnifier is powerful but poorly made.The is significant distortion in the corners and along the edges leaving only the center of the lens useful and if the available light isn't enough you're out of luck. When what you're looking at is in focus the built-in light isn't shinning on it.I'd have returned it as useless except that there are times when the ambiant light is enough to use this magnifier without needing it's built-in light.As a reminder of how useless the built-in light was I took the magnifier apart and removed all the light's parts. I'll use them as spares for the 5x version which works well and it's light is properly aimed.
