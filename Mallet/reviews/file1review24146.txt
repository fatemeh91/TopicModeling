review/text: It happens every few months that I cave in to the little merry maid on my back and buy something touted as being 'revolutionary' for storage. I believe it has to do with the happy-dancing-singing-frolicking-"I can't believe how much better my life is now that I have a place for all of my crab dip"-type advertisements that inundate my subconscious when I fall asleep in front of the tv in the "paid presentation" hours of the morning. But I digress.Colors are good. The idea has merit. The execution, however, could use some massaging.My first issue: The carousel system is chintzy. In particular, the container supports. I almost sheered a couple off in my methodical scramble to assemble it and have a better life.My second issue: The container caps don't really fit into the alotted slot. Perhaps I was misinterpreting the diagram that showed them fitting into their container stall. Maybe they just sent me a rowdy bunch of non-conformists. I'm not sure. But they just don't seem to be happy fitting in where they should.My third issue: I almost poked an eye out when the "flip-out" function deployed unexpectedly and caught me by surprise. While I was putting it in my cabinet and anticipating all of the happiness my impending purchase would bring to me, the containers shifted and attacked me. Be wary. They're wiley.All-in-all, the idea is pretty good. Maybe it just takes more than colored, spinnning, plastic containers to bring true bliss to my life.
