review/text: I attempted to find out though all previous reviews which one is better?Sonicare or Braun? Now I know. I used to have Sonicare from the time they first came out and loved it. But I was curious if Braun is as good and bought the new Braun. I must say that they are not equal! I would compare Sonicare to Mercedes and Braun to Traband (the worst east German car ever).--It is loud and feels like a drill. Sonicare truly sound like sonic wave toothbrush.--When it lets you know that you need to switch sides, it sounds like a pneumatic drill--literally!--In my experience it does not even come close to cleaning power of Sonicare. After brushing with Sonicare I always had a nice tingling feeling, Braun--nothing--It seems inferior to Sonicare overall.Here are good things about Braun:--When brushing with Sonicare, you have to keep mouth closed while brushing, because it splashes around (Sonic waves work through water better-closed mouth helps cleaning )Braun does not seem to be sonic wave toothbrush and you can keep mouth open while brushing with no problem. This is good option especially for children.--Brush replacements are cheaper than Sonicare--Because of small size toothbrush, I think you can reach your back teeth slightly better with BraunHope it helps.
