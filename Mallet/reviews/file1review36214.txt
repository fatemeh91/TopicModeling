review/text: ****2009 Update**** After about 9 years of use (the last year of which I used them 5-6 times a month) It needed to be replaced! When it comes to clippers I would only consider buying a pro grade one! After checking all the models & brands (just to see if anything better came out in the last 9 years) ***NOTING HAS*** I went and got another one of these! This is the best clipper I have ever owned!!! The clippers went through 9 years of abuse before they needed replacing and when I finally had to replace them the price was cheaper!!!! YEAH!!! Amazon has the best prices around!BUY THESE CLIPPERS! You will be glad you did!==================================================================================================================****2006 Original Review**** I have had this model for years! And I cut my hair with it 3-4 times a month between me & my sons. It is the best clipper set I have ever owned. Most clippers I buy only last 1-2 years. I have had this one I think 5-6 years! Well worth the money!
