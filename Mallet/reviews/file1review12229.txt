review/text: I want to address the issues that almost kept me from purchasing these.1. "They smell awful/sour/like dog food/like sour milk or yogurt" - Either this has been addressed by the company or those people had a bad batch or something. I am in the super-smelling, easily nauseated stage of pregnancy and these barely have a scent. If I stick the open bottle to my nose, it smells mildly botanical. I was greatly relieved.2. "There is lead content" - This has been addressed by the company. They were always within FDA limits. They now test regularly to ensure the naturally occurring lead content is below both FDA level allowance and the stricter California Prop 65 level allowance (which you might have noticed is a bit -or alot- ridiculous sometimes).3. "They are ENORMOUS/too big to swallow/get stuck in your throat/horse pills!" - I am convinced the people who wrote these have not taken many vitamin supplements before. They are identical in size or smaller than most supplements I've taken. The fact is, vitamins are bulky. Take it with a decent glass of water (8 oz at least) and it won't get stuck. That's the best way to take prenatals anyhow.4. They don't contain calcium - I can't even imagine how big these would be if they contained enough absorbable calcium for a pregnant woman. I'm totally fine with taking my calcium on the side, which ends up being two pills that are each larger than the Rainbow Light prenatal.Basically, these are nothing to worry about (for me anyhow) and BY FAR the cheapest way to take a whole food vitamin prenatal supplement. 150 tablets is 5 month's worth... for $17.
