review/text: I am pregnant with twins and started wearing this cradle during my 4th month and I am now in my 7th month. It has been a tremendous help in relieving abdominal pressure andhelps maintain good posture. On the rare days when I go without it, I am very uncomfortable walking on trips to the grocery store or even just around the house. It adjustseasily and is very comfortable when it's on. The straps do show with some v-neck shirts, but I haven't found this to be a big issue. I highly recommend this, especially for atwin pregnancy.
