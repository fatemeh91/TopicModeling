review/text: All those reviews saying how brushing with the new toothbrush feels just like after a professional dental cleaning, are made the day someone tried their new toothbrush for the first time. This review is written after 3 weeks of using the Oral-B 9400, and I will update it after 6 months, when I will have a professional dental cleaning and periodontal pocket depths measured.That said,* with the Floss Action head, the cleaning feels more thorough than with the Sonicare Intelliclean* the head is smaller and round, so you can reach behind the premolars farthest back in the mouth. I couldn't do that with the Sonicare's oval head.* the Oral-B 9400 does feel like a drill, but only for the first use. On the second use, it feels about 30% as intense as the first time, and on he 3rd use, I got almost completely used to it.* the handle display is of very little use, and you can't see it anyway while brushing (usually). If you really want to see it, either brush against a mirror, or briefly stop the toothbrush, look at the display, then resume brushing. The toothbrush remembers when you left off.* with due respect, the reviewers who posted about bad button placement must've been clumsy. I never accidentally pressed any button while brushing. Also, the buttons need a pretty firm press to activate.* it does not replace flossing (no toothbrush does), and this is clearly mentioned in the user manual* it didn't get dirty (so far, after 3 weeks of use). The head is attached in such a way, through only a vibrating metal rod, that there's not much place for grime to accumulate anyway. By comparison, the Sonicare Intelliclean developed an entire ecosystem of gunk inside the toothbrush head.
