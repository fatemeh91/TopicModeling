review/text: I bought this along with Vit C in gel cap form because a doctor explained on his website that he tests the blood of his patients regularly for the levels of various supplements he recommends and he claimed that pills seemed to result in extremely poor and uneven levels in the body. He also claimed gel caps were much better compared to pills in terms of a more even and reliable absorption into the blood stream.
