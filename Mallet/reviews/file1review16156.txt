review/text: I purchased this set for my first child and only ended up using the nail clippers and the thermometer. The nasal aspirator didn't work as well as the one provided by the hospital. The medicine dropper and spoon weren't useful because most infant medications bottles have a dropper included. The thermometer worked well but too quickly ran out of battery and because the battery isn't replaceable in this model I have to buy a new one. The nail clippers work well and we still use them.From my experience, I would buy an infant nail clippers and a better quality thermometer that has a changeable battery and skip this set entirely.
