review/text: I have been using a cordless razor for 10 or so years now. This is the worst one yet, and the first one to give me a rash every time I use it. I don't have sensitive skin and it still bothers me on sensitive mode. I am still loking for a replacement for me pre Gillete Braun Razor. It was amazing.
