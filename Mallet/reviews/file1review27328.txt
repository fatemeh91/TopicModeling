review/text: i am very happy with the taste of the extreme milk chocolate powder. it taste just like hot cocoa mix either in water or milk. it is okay in water but much better with milk(creamier)it doesnt quite dissolve in water or milk as quickly as the tub says. that is my only complaint. i would have like to seen an airtight peel off seal under the lid instead of a plastic seal around the lid.
