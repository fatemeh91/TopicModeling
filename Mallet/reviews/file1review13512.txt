review/text: I was very skeptical of this deodorant when I bought it. I have been very impressed with how well it has worked. It seems to keep the stink from my armpits down all day even in hot 90 degree days. It is a great non-scented deodorant! I was looking for a deodorant I could use that would not compete with my cologne and would leave my underarms scent free without any aluminum and this is it! I would highly recommend this deodorant!
