review/text: This is a wonderful alternative to lugging around all the pills I take. Recently, I have been forgetting weather or not I took my morning meds, leading me to double-dose sometimes which - needless to say - was bad. I wanted an alternative to the large box I carry with me everywhere I go, but less clunky then a pill organizer. This was absolutely perfect.The plastic of the pill boxes is quite sturdy but - as I realize it is just *plastic* - I make sure not to put the pods into a situation where they may be crushed easily (like a large purse alongside heavy objects). I have read reviews about the pods breaking, which makes me wonder if those who received the fragile pods had either heat damaged or poorly-molded pods. These seem quite sturdy. The only thing that worries me a little is the plastic tab that holds the lids on each container. Each compartment (separated by a plastic divider) is about 1 1/4" wide by 1 1/2" long by 1/2" deep.The only thing keeping this product from getting five stars is the fact that the AM/PM slots lack independent lids. This can be a problem if handling the pods either half asleep or in a vehicle.I would not recommend this for the elderly. Whereas these work for me fine (I'm in my 20s), I can see why the pods/boxes would be difficult for someone with an uneasy grasp and poor eyesight. Though if you buy this set and find it unsuitable for Grandma, these make fantastic back-up boxes for those who suffer from headaches, indigestion, or remembering to take your meds during allergy season or bouts of the flu.
