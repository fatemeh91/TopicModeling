review/text: I carefully read all of the Amazon reviews because I wanted to get a non-smelling Bringaraj oil. Vadik's version has a very strong and overpowering smell but it works as in it grows your hair.This oil damaged my hair, and dried out my scalp. It does have a very minimal smell that quickly goes away but the product doesn't work. Its back to Vadik which smells strong but at least I have a head full of healthy hair.Be careful of the hype I found it to be completely untrue.
