review/text: I have tried many pill containers and these are the only ones I like. They are made of a better plastic that never squeeks like all the others do. I also like the fact that there are caps that have threads on them so that you can separate one stack into sections.When I wanted more of them, I searched for 1/2 hour to find them. They are worth the time!
