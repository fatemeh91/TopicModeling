review/text: Ever get a splinter that is buried in your skin so you have to dig at it with sewing needle before tweezing it out? Not with these tweezers. They are the needle and tweezers in one (sterilize these with rubbing alcohol when using this way). The points are sharp and they will get to what is under your skin. Use them from the side to pull object out. Great value!
