review/text: I bought this a few months ago and used it in our old dishwasher. When I say old, I mean like 15 years old, so there was alot of yuck and buildup in there. I also have well water (hard water), so that leads to even more buildup.I used one bottle of Summit and only barely noticed a difference. I think maybe if I had used it a few more times I would have had better results. I give it 3 stars because I am not totally sure how well it works - I can't say it's amazing, as it did not totally clean up the dishwasher, but I can't honestly say it doesn't work either since my machine was old as dirt and as I said had alot going on with hard water etc.We have since gotten a new dishwasher, so I will keep this product in mind for future use. I do believe it is worth a try and I would buy it again, as well as recommemd it.
