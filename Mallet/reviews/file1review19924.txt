review/text: This potty seat worked well for us until this past weekend, when my son attempted to use it without a step stool. As he was trying to slide off, the splashguard stopped his progress, which caused the skin just above his penis to tear from the pressure of being trapped. He now has four stitches in a very sensitive area, and this was a very traumatic event for him.The splashguard on this seat is pointless anyway, since it's too close to allow any room for the penis to extend, and my son has always had to push his penis down to pee into the potty. A splashguard on the floor chair version seems less dangerous, but on this model, where the seat sits on top of an adult potty, having such a high (and unremovable!) splashguard is just plain dangerous.Parents of little boys, beware.
