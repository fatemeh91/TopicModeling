review/text: We took one of these on a trip to Mexico, to potty train our then 3 year-old in a warm place where he could run around naked. We threw it in a plastic bag and then carried it around at the bottom shelf of a stroller - the stroller folded with the seat still in it when we had to board the airplane. Used it in the airport with great success, and then in the hotel. We started at home about a week before the vacation. By the time we came back our son was potty trained (for the most part.:)He is 6 now, and is still using the seat. We have it hanging on the hook next to the toilet, and there is a step stool right there, too, so he's been completely independent in the bathroom for the last 3 years. He just takes the seat off the hook, settles it down on the toilet and then hangs it back when he is done.
