review/text: Well this stuff stinks....But that's the only downside to this product. I mean if you're gonna have people sniffing around down there I don't guess this would be the product for you, but I love this stuff! I went to the doctor two different times and got some prescribed cream. After using it as directed and doing everything the doc told me to, I still wasn't completely rid of those awful things. So, I decided to try this stuff out, and WOW was I surprised. The smell is a mix of mud and vapor rub (unlike anything I've ever smelled before). When you apply this stuff, it's like sticking an ice cube to your butt :) It may sound weird, but it's an awesome feeling when you've been dealing with the pain of hemorrhoids. It cleared up my problem and now I can sit anyway I want! HaHa. But seriously, this is an item I would recommend to anyone with hemorrhoids.
