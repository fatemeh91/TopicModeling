review/text: I had the Panasonic ES-SA40-K before and loved the shaver. However, it didn't seem to be available anymore so I thought I'd try this cheaper one out. I saw the good reviews and thought it's worth a shot. The first time I tried it though, I couldn't even use it. It kept pulling my hair and it HURT. I've never had such an uncomfortable shave before. Had to return instantly. Not sure if anyone else had the problem but wanted to share my own experience.
