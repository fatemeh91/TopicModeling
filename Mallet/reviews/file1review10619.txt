review/text: The picture is very deceiving on this product only because there isnt anything to compare its size to. the container that holds the roll is about the size of a fifty cent piece. you can use a smaller piece of the tape then it recommends but if you are doing the urine test i recommend wearing gloves since the tape is like tissue paper and the urine travels quickly!
