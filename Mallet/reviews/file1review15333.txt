review/text: I had tried the 2 inch version (largest) of this ring and found it a little loose to receive the full benefit of the desired effect (working with a 6 - 7 inch penis). This 1 3/4 inch ring is the smallest of the 3 versions offered by Tantus. It provides a TIGHT fit. With a little patience the testicles can be pushed through but it is tight getting the ring on! The ejaculation is definitely slowed and the feeling is heightened. Works great! Good addition the toys used by my wife and me; definitely recommend it. However, for larger penises one may want to try the mid-sized ring first - the small ring will be a challenge to put on...
