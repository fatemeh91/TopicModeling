review/text: After taking Thera Tears Omega-3 supplements for 3 months straight along with the Thera Tears eye drops, there has been absolutely no change in my eye dryness or redness. I purchased after reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on multiple sites, but considering that this is nothing more than 1.2g of fat and after noticing no effect myself, I believe this product is just another snake oil/placebo. Don't waste your money.As far as an omega-3 supplement, you can get about the same amount of omega-3 in Now's supplement for half the price and twice the quantity.
