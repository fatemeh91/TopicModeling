review/text: I love melatonin. like many have said, it doesn't leave you with the hangover groggy feeling when you wake up. Many times i'll stay up 2-3 hours tossing and turning not being able to fall asleep, melatonin helps take care of that problem.One fun thing about melatonin you may not know is that it may make your dreams more vivid, though i think that will vary from person. and when i stop taking melatonin or decrease the # of mg of melatonin i intake, my dreams will continue staying vivid or even get more vivid the following 2 or 3 nights.
