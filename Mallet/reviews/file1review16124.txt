review/text: Jack Challem, in his book, "Stop Prediabetes Now:..." recommends L-Arginine to lower blood pressure. I was skeptical because my medication was barely keeping my numbers under control but decided to try the L-Arginine anyway. To my delight, it has been working for me. I prefer it because I have not noticed any side affects from taking it. I'm ordering this brand again.
