review/text: The funny thing is, I remember getting an excellent shave with the first Braun razor I used 24 years ago. I upgrade to a new one every two or three years, and despite all the marketing and technology hype, this one too doesn't make shaving really any better than the previous model.I'd be the first one to admit that every beard is different, but this whisker thing and the new foil shape is definitely overrated. In fact, I still have to pick the whiskers away, albeit it less often. The downside is, compared to shaving with the 7505 I had before, the whiskers are harder to find. The hair seems to curl more quickly.The battery performance is also disappointing. If I use the straight to socket method (rather than charging in the base unit), I get perhaps one or two days longer out of it, but never more than nine days and certainly not "up to 14" as the manual indicates. I just hope I'll never spend two weeks in a beach hut with no electricity.All in all, a decent buy, but not the performance they would have you believe.
