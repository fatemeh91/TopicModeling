review/text: The product is easy to use. I can't confirm it's accuracy, but my doctor said Omron is the best brand. I gave it only 3 stars because it comes with a small cuff, and you have to purchase a large one. Maybe I'm wrong, but I would think that most folks with high blood pressure are also overweight, so a larger cuff should be the norm.
