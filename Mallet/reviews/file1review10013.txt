review/text: Purchased this product after losing over 100lbs. I needed to get a better sense of my progress on my weight loss program and how much muscle to fat ratio I had after such an extreme and rapid weight loss program. The calipers are difficult to use and often give a different reading each time I test the same site. Often the readings are extremely different and make no sense. An example would be going from 30% to 11% fat. Basically it's a cheap product that will do in a pinch to help with a very, and I mean very, rough estimate of my body fat percentage if used with extreme patience. It will do in a pinch but I suggest purchasing a more reliable, and easier to use product for more money if your looking for a more accurate reading.
