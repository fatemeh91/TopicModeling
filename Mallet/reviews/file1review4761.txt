review/text: When it comes to reviewing supplements, it comes down to the trust with the manufacturer and the price. Since the apparent usefulness is mostly marginal or sometimes even non-existent, you've got to go with the manufacturer's reputation because of the lack of FDA supervision. Jarrow is among the better supplement companies based on the past history of random tests published.I had no adverse effects using this supplement. How much benefit did I get? That's harder to answer without a long running experimentation.
