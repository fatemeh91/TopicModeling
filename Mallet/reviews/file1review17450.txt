review/text: Over the years I have grown and shaved my beard several times. I bought my first Remington MB 200 close to 15 years ago. I can't remember what happened to it, but I remember liking it upon first use. I bought a second trimmer about 3 years ago. It worked well, but ultimately stopped charging. ( I have not been able to figure out if the battery is replaceable.....) I dropped the third trimmer and the beard length controler broke. My fault. I am about to purchase a fourth. I tried a few others, but none is as good for the price. Would give 5 stars if I could be assured that the battery was easily replaceable.
