review/text: I purchased 3 of the Elasto Gel Hot / Sinus mask. Have only used on cold so far. They are very nice. Wish they could stay cool a little longer. But they are thin so I guess that is the reason. But would I recomend themYes I would. It stayed cool long enough to fall asleep and no puffy eyes in the morning.
