review/text: I've bought 400 of these in the last year or so. They're a good quality condom at a far better price than most others of similar quality - it would be crazy expensive to go though that many at retail prices. I like the texture (it's less rubber feeling) and they're on the thinner side. They're certainly not the thinnest out there, but the thinner ones sometimes have issues while unrolling that they'll get rolled under themselves... I've never had that problem with these. I can't say I get excited about these condoms per se, but they're always there as my go-to barrier, which does its job and doesn't get in the way.
