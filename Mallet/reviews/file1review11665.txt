review/text: I think this product sounds great, only problem is my 3.5 year old hates the taste. I tried mixing it in his smoothie and it's a little more bearable but he will never finish his smoothie now. I'd say buying it is worth a shot since so many others rated it well but unfortunately for us we will be trying a new brand, maybe in gummy form next.
