review/text: These are definitely the best ones out there. I had the original Tweezerman's (which I paid TRIPLE the price for at a big box store), and they served me well for many years but the tips broke. So I bought these yellow ones on Amazon, and they work fantastic, even better than the originals. They get even the shortest, tiniest hair out. Just a word of warning, though, they are super sharp, so keep the plastic tip that comes with them. You're liable to get stabbed if you don't (I speak from experience).
