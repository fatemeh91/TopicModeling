review/text: I never write any reviews but since I have suffered from Jock Itch for quite a while and this thing has cured my problems so I thought its worth spending some time in writing a review.If you suffering from Jock Itch, I would recommend following things--1. Every time you exercise or feel like you had sweat, take a shower and use this funga soap to clean your private parts.2. After you take shower make sure your private parts are dried properly. Dont use your towel, use a soft cotton cloth and change this cloth every week.3. Change your under garment every time you take shower.4. Try to eat 2 slices of garlic everyday. You can add garlic in your food. Garlic has very strong anti fungal properties. Dont use garlic tablets or slices, use fresh garlic in your food..5. Avoid caffeine and soft drinks and drink lots of water..6. Avoid alcohol specially beer if you still do not recover..7. Take multi-vitamin to rebuild your immunity...I hope if you follow these things, your problem would be resolved..
