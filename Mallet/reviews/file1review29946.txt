review/text: warning: This product has 30mg cholesterol per scoop. If you use it often, make sure you get your blood checked by a doctor. I take about 3 scoops/day, eat very healthy, yet in 7 months from taking this protein my "bad" cholesterol jumped from 98 to 130 (my diet remained the same). Fish oil pills will help keep that down.My initial impressions is that the taste (Vanilla Icecream) is acceptable as I've had tastier with other brands. Still acceptable, and within a week I got used to it and it started tasting just fine. I mix it with just a spoon in a mug . . . small chunks float on the top, but good enough and doesn't really bother me.I find this protein really helps with the recovery period, and it has a great blend of other additives in it.
