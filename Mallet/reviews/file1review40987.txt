review/text: I really do like this detergent, but there is one reason I took off 1 star. It cleans very well and there is no fragrance to linger on anything, but when I fill the washer and add the detergent it takes FOREVER for it to dissolve! When I clean the washer filter I can feel a bit of 'soapy' slickness in the remains and I also noticed the little filter holes get clogged way too easily. I even thought about mixing the powder with hot water in a jar to see if it would work any better, but haven't done it yet. And, would it ever dissolve if using cold water to wash? This problem needs to be addressed. I've never had this problem with other powder-type laundry detergent so I know it's not the water or my washing machine. Any other people have this problem?
