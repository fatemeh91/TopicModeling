review/text: I got this chair for the office. I sit in it every day....but no longer use the massage features. I really thought it was the most comfortable of a few chairs I tried. The cushion is somewhat cheap, but it's not any worse than any other chairs at this price. The leather isn't too bad either for the price. I paid $150, but as many people know...you can get it much cheaper if you look around and catch a sale. I rated it a 3 out of 5 because I still enjoy sitting in it. I can imagine though, I'll be searching for another chair in another year or two.
