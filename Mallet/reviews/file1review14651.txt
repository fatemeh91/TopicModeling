review/text: I won't pan it completely, just share my experience with others who may have the same. I took 20mg/day for two months. I noted absolutely no effect other than a slight wooziness for a few minutes after ingesting, which passed after the first 3 weeks. I tried it for age related short term memory loss. I wish that I had the positive experience reported by other reviewers. I really wanted it to work!
