review/text: I heard about Green Vibrance through one of my favorite bloggers. Since I am trying to cut back on processed foods and ingredients, I made sure I did plenty of research on this product. FINALLY, I decided to purchase it. I drank my drink every morning just to see what happened. In the first 3 days, my skin went from average to glowing. Usually my skin looks this way when I'm jogging and eating a VERY balanced diet. As time went on, I noticed my nails were getting longer as well as my eyelashes....and my hair got sooooo much thicker! I'm not sure about my energy levels because I get up and get going pretty well on my own, but it definitely hasn't hampered it. I can only say to try this product for yourself. I wasn't looking for a miracle product, but I was looking for something nutritious and as GREEN as possible. I was juicing prior to Green Vibrance, and still do occasionally, but this is quicker (and cheaper) and it has been a great buy for me. I just ordered another 60-day supply this morning and decided to write my review before exiting Amazon. Being able to see as many results in a short amount of time is definitely a reason for me to keep buying!
