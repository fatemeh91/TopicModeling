review/text: this Vitamins were the best choice for my pregnancy! - 10 stars!I felt absolutely great! yet I would still advise moms to be take additional Fish oil (or flax seed), Iron at 2nd trimester, Lutein, and &#34;Calcium, D3, Magnesium, B6&#34; (at night) - last ones really helped me with muscles cramps.of course consult your doctor.. :)1- star for the supplier's shipping cost. I had to order second bottle and paid $20 just for the shipping :( - well too bad I didn't know about iherbs.com which delivers world wide for $4-8I learned my mistake and I hope it will help you mommies who left US... :) cheers!
