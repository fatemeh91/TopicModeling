review/text: Not long ago, everyone caught a cold. My husband, all my friends, all my neighbors, everyone I saw out in stores or in the street. It was messy out there.As soon as I started to feel the pre-cold scratchy throat deal start up, I began taking the Gaia Quick Defense capsules. And as long as I kept taking the pills, it seemed to keep the cold from flaring into a full-system response.However: look at the size of that box. 20 capsules. You take 10 a day. That's just two days worth! And once I ran out, I came down with normal cold symptoms.But, my course seemed a lot less severe than what everyone else experienced, and that is not usually how it goes with me. Overall it was still beneficial. However, it's pretty expensive, considering. Do I need to spend this much to avoid (or shorten) my once-or-twice-a-year cold? I don't think so. I'd use it if it was on hand, but I don't think I'm going to stock up just in case.If you have a situation where it's very important that you don't get sick, then yeah. Give it a try.
