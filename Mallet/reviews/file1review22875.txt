review/text: I've been very pleased with how well this sweeps my tile and laminate floors. It's also great for area rugs, which can be difficult to vacuum because the edges get sucked up. On carpet, I would say it will not replace a vacuum, but is handy for touch-ups if your mother-in-law is coming over in 10 minutes, etc. In addition to the usual dust and hair, it's especially great for picking up small pebbles we track in from outside, bits of my cat's dry food, and crumbs on the floor from preparing food. I used to use Swiffer dry mops, but they just push larger debris around rather than picking it up. Emptying out the dirt is extremely easy, and the only maintenance necessary is occasionally picking string and hair out of the brushes. The handle is badly designed to fall apart easily, but we just rammed it together as hard as possible and then duct taped it, and have had no trouble with it since. It may look a little bit ghetto, but it works! The only real drawback with this sweeper is that there is about a 1-2 inch margin that it cannot reach around the edges of the floor. Usually by the time that area becomes dirty, it's time for a wet mop or deep vacuum anyway, so I am not too bothered by this problem.
