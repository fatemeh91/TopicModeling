review/text: This child's toilet seat was very easy to place on the toilet from the first time I took it out of the box and it is very easy to remove so adults can use the toilet as well. As a bonus, my daughter, who used to sit too far forward and might pee down the front of the toilet, must sit a little farther back to avoid the bump in the front of the seat. No more messes or accidents! I like the sanitary handle, too. We would recommend it to anyone!
