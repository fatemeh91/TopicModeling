review/text: The product delivered was not a Pro-Tec brand but instead a Swede-O.The stirrups are not made of Dupont Surlyn, but of an unknown plastic (If you're going to advertise the material a product is made from, it should actually be that).I am not sure if the Pro-Tec would be any more rigid, but I can easily flex the SWEDE-O brace from side to side in my hands with little pressure. If I can do that with my hands, how will the stirrups offer any added protection from rolling my ankle while running?I will be returning this.
