review/text: I have been using Source of Life Liquid vitamins for yours. Amazon offers the best price, especially if you have free shipping. These are the only vitamins that I remember to take everyday because I feel it making a difference. After a week of regular use, you will feel more energized and healthier. I rarely get sick while taking these vitamins. I take at lunch time or after work for that late day pick me up. It's like a shot of energy. Highly recommend!
