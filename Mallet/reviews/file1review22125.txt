review/text: I think this is a wonderful concept. I requested this item on my baby shower list, and recieved it. I have yet to use this item, but the features are what attracted me. The 90 second quick read, last temperature recall, a soft musical lullaby fever alarm, water resistant, digital reading and much more. The pacifier is small enough for a newborn. The directions were simple and easy to understand. The only complaints that I do have are, there is no way you are able to replace the battery, even though it is implied it is a long-life battery.The 1-800# for the company,is no longer working and the warranty is only for one year with proof of purchase. You must also mail $3.99 for a handling charge. I would be leary of that if you are unable to contact this company with the # they provided.
