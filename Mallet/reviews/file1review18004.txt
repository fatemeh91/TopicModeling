review/text: I have tried many types and brands of sleep masks over the years, and have made a few of my own, too. Migraineurs often must have a dark, quiet place to rest, and a sleep mask is essential equipment. The Bucky 40 Blinks mask is by far the most comfortable mask I've used. The mask is soft all over but structured, does not compress the eyelids, and the strap is adjustable so no pressure has to be around your head. I use it resting and sleeping, and (although not a restless sleeper) I never have a problem with it slipping or coming off.After reading some of the reviews here, I'm surprised and left wondering what these folks are looking for. The reviewers who complain about the bump from the Velcro in the back being uncomfortable are apparently using a pretty firm pillow! The Velcro has never bothered me. Also, I don't have a pixie-size nose, by any means, and this mask is large enough to keep all light out, even in bright daylight. I honestly cannot imagine anyone thinking this mask is uncomfortable, after some of the others I've had.I own several of these masks and use them often, and have recommended them to many others. I hope I can continue to purchase them for years to come.
