review/text: Purchased 5 lb of Cookies and Cream flavor from Amazon. Before this, I've only had the Double Chocolate so I was a little weary of trying something new. Thankfully, it tastes pretty delicious. I usually just mix it with a bit of water and stir with a fork, and it always dissolves easily. The little cookie bits at the end are a nice touch, too. It does have a strong mocha-like smell which can be nauseating.
