review/text: My boyfriend and I use this for our 3 year old who has sleep issues. We have used it everyday for about a year, and it has held up well. The base can be powered by plugging it into the wall or by batteries-- which was a life saver for us when we took it camping and our son could have his familiar sounds. The Glass ball is heavy but we tough our kid to not handle it and defiantly no trowing it!The volume to this can be set very low, OR loud (we can hear it in the other rooms of the house) also the light work great, it projects great colours on the walls and ceiling (depending on how you have it positioned). Recently we have painted our sons ceiling a midnight textured sky blue and was very surprised and pleased that the lights still projected so well on it.
