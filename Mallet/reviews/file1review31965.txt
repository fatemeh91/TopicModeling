review/text: The label on the container says "gluten free", but like a lot of things, if you have problems with gluten intolerance then check the ingredient label. There you will find wheat and barley grasses, which in of themselves do not trigger reactions, but can contain seeds, which are the source of the gluten. Are you going to tell me they catch every seed that goes through?I bought this as an addition to my morning protein shake and from the first day I started using it I felt HORRIBLE! Fatigue, diarhea, nausea, all the symptoms that told me I had consumed something with gluten. I finally tracked down the only possible culprit, which is this product. ANYTHING that includes any form of wheat or barley is not safe to eat for a person with gluten issues. The fast and loose labeling protocols for the food industry have once again done us a great disservice.
