review/text: I purchased these from Amazon - at less than half of the local price for the same product from the same maker - and am very pleased with them. The tips are extremely fine, yet strong enough to lift out a splinter easily the first time. I purchased them pretty much for such purpose. I'm not a professional but appreciate a good quality tool. (My earlier tweezers were "stolen" by a security guard in Ecuador who decided I was a danger to an airplane if I kept my tweezers.) My order came promptly as scheduled.I would recommend these to anyone who wants a high quality tweezer at a very reasonable cost.
