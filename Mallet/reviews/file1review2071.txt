review/text: This is a TERRIBLY painful device. I've had it for about 2 and half months. It provides good relief for bunions, as advised. In this regard, the pressuure on the bone of the big toe is light and provides pleasant relief but the pressure applied on the nail of the big toe is simply so terrible that it has caused ingrown toenails and aggravated cuticles. Putting something soft between the device and my toenail seemed to help enough to last the night but 1. it shouldn't be necessary and 2. I haven't found anything permanent to use yet without having to make another purchase for the fix. The idea behind this is great but poorly executed; I've only been able to stand the pain an entire night once with aid. I am currently looking into another model by Bunion Aid that will seemingly put less stress on my nail and can be worn all day thanks to a hinge. I think it could be a lot more effective though equally expensive, if so, well worth the money. I'll review that once I've had it a while. Hope this helps.
