review/text: I have such bushy man brows that for years I used a razor instead of tweezing. There are so many rave reviews of Tweezerman on MUA that I thought I'd give it a try, despite the price.I'm glad I did.I started with the slant tweezers, but I now prefer the point because of their ability to pick up the most microscopic hairs, visible only in my 15X magnifying mirror. I'd tried using other, cheaper tweezers before (most notably from Revlon) and there's just no comparison. The other brands are a joke!For first-time tweezer users, I'd recommend using a magnifying mirror, preferably one that stands up on its own. Pick a location with strong light, preferably in daylight near a window. Grip the hair with the tweezer points close to the root. With your other hand, place a finger flat on the skin near the hair to keep the skin from getting "pulled." It's also less painful this way. With a firm grip, yank the hair--fast--in the direction of its growth. Repeat as needed. Go slowly and do occasional mirror checks (or even better, use a web cam) to make sure your brows remain even. Be careful not to over-tweeze--this product works well and its easy to get overly enthusiastic if you're not careful! If you have a lot to tweeze (as I do) you may want to apply a drop of moisturizer to your skin afterwards.Tweezerman also offers free sharpening (you pay for postage).
