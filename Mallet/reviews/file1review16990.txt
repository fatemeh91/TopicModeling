review/text: It pains me to give this trimmer such a bad review. The trimmer itself is EXACTLY what I want. Great adjustments. Does a fantastic job on trimming everything from my beard to sideburns to whatever. However, here I am less than two years after my purchase and I am looking for another trimmer. Why? The battery has died. Worse, though it is described as "corded/cordless", it only works cordless. In other words, even though you can have the trimmer plugged in, it still runs on battery (which won't hold a charge anymore). I wouldn't mind if I could just plug in and use the trimmer corded but I can't. And the batteries aren't replaceable. Yes, I did follow the instructions on battery maintenance but nothing helps. Looking at the owner's manual, I see that the MB-300 does operate with AC. However, it doesn't look like they make it anymore (if they ever did) so I'm stuck. Does Remington really expect us to buy a new one of these every 18 months?
