review/text: THE SCREWS WENT IN OKAY, BUT THE HOOK WILL NOT GO ON PROPERLY AND NOW I HAVE TO SEND IT BACK, CALL, OR SPEND MY PERSONAL TIME TO GET IT TO WORK RIGHT. THERE WERE NO INSTRUCTIONS EITHER TO HELP. IT JUST NEEDS TO HOOK ON TO A BAR BUT IT WON'T REACH. A LOT OF HASSLE. DOES AMAZON OR DETECTO CARE TO CONTACT ME AND MAKE ME A SATISFIED CUSTOMER? WE'LL SEE. I AM REQUESTING A PHONE CALL FROM BOTH OR EITHER OF THEM SO THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED, OR PLEASE COME PICK IT UP AT YOUR EXPENSE.
