review/text: I purchased the kit to have a smaller, lighter kit for short outings. I think it's a good compromise between the bare essential gram weenies kits that have a butterfly and two aspirin, and those of us (like me) who think every overnight trip is fraught with peril and pack the clotting agent and epi-pens :). The basics for bumps, blisters, and cuts are included. Not much in the way of larger dressings, but let's face it- How many times do you need a trauma pad while on a weekend jaunt? The included manual is packed with practical field information that is useful for all, even city-trained EMS professionals. IMO, The manual and adds significant value to the kit.
