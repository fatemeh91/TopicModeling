review/text: My fault for not thinking more carefully before purchasing. These do provide good support for flats (but don't expect miracles). But you need to "commit" them to a single pair of shoes -- by using the velcro tabs to keep the insoles in place, or glue in place. Otherwise, they slip around (slip forward when you're walking). The description does say velcro to keep insoles in place (haven't tried the velcro yet, but I assume that works well) ... so I guess I wasn't paying attention, or just fooling myself into thinking that I can buy a single pair and switch between different pairs of shoes when needed. Next time I'll try the trim to fit black for dress shoes instead of getting more of these 3/4 insoles.
