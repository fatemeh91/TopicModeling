review/text: This is the best multivitamin I have ever taken! This is great whether you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or just looking for a complete multivitamin. I love the fact that it is vegan, you only have to take it once a day, contains the correct amount of folic that my body needs and it has the probiotics that are necessary for healthy digestion. The price is right for 150 tablets, one bottle lasted me a few months. On my 2nd bottle now and couldnt be happier or healthier :-)
