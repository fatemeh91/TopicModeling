review/text: I suddenly had more meds to take on a daily basis, Morning, Noon & Night. I was using a large flat pill container so that I could seperate my meds for the day, but it was bulky and there was no place it fit neatly to keep my meds where I wouldn't forget to take something.I found this and I am so happy I did!! Each day is seperated into four compartments. The days all fit nicely into their little tray which is compact enough to fit in my cabinet. Each day I set that's days meds in easy reach. The compartments are roomy, but the way this is made everything is very compact.I would certainly recommend this to anyone who has numerious meds on a daily schedule. It works for me and I love it.
