review/text: there seem to be few lukewarm opinions on the headblade among head shavers.... many people find it awkward to use.... I maintain that when you really learn to use it, using a conventional razor to shave your head feel super awkward. I think the headblade sport is actually a better 'starter' headblade... the little wheels are like training wheels almost. Two things must be your mantra with the HB.... keep the wheels ( or base with the classic) in contact with your head at all times and apply NO pressure to the blade!!! that is the difference between a wonderful close shave and bleeding like a stuck pig. Go super slow at first.... that's also important. It's a unique tool, and takes getting used to , but it's worth it!!
