review/text: I have been in search of the "perfect" electric shaver for many years. After hearing my constant complaints about various brands and models, my wife bought me this shaver for Christmas. I have used various electric shavers from Panasonic, Norelco, and Remington with mostly disappointing results. This is my first Braun. I have heard great things about their products and I must admit that I am quite impressed. Though this shaver does not shave quite as close as my Remington foil shaver (which just died after barely a year), it however does shave with absolutely no razor burn or cuts. This really blew me away because I have extremely sensitive skin and could never shave with a dry shaver without intense razor burn. I always bought wet/dry models so I could continue shaving with cream as a means to reduce razor burn. Not only can I now shave dry but I can do so without any cuts, which is another first. The foil is so easy on my skin that I can shave twice a day and I don't need to use cooling aftershave lotion anymore.As with all the electric shavers I have used in the past, this one struggles with neck hair. It does a reasonable job but I still have to follow up with a blade to get the hairs it can't cut. Because this is a dry shaver, it takes a bit longer for me to get a close shave but it is less messy which is nice.This shaver is rather quiet compared to some and has a fair amount of power. I have a very thick beard that grows very quickly and this shaver mows right through it. Unfortunately I am cursed with a perpetual 5 o'clock shadow so even though my face is smooth to the touch it still looks as if it needs shaving.Though this shaver does not produce the closest shave I've ever had with an electric shaver, it is the most comfortable and bloodless I've ever had. I can't give it 5 stars because its not "perfect" but then again there might not be such a thing.
