review/text: I start off every morning with a shake made from this, a little ground cinnamon, a tbs or so of Metamucil powder, and fat-free milk. The taste is great & I'll even make myself up a shake to take with me to class in the evening after work so I'm not ravenous by the time I get home. The only thing I don't like about it (or most "weight-loss meal replacements" in general) is there's quite a bit of sugar. Through hard work at the gym, willpower at work and home, I've lost 16#s in 3 mos but I am NOT following SlimFast!'s 3-2-1 plan (WAY too much sugar and I was ALWAYS starving bc of it.) Great product otherwise, but I DO miss their pre-made shakes in a CAN...
