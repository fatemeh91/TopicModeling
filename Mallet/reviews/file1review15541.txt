review/text: We were in need of batteries for our daughter&#8217;s hearing aids and chose iCellTech as the supplier.The order was placed and notification was received. The shipping was quick, the order arrived on time and the product is good for the price paid. In short, the product is what they said it was, their service is fast. We will surely look to them for future needs and recommend them to those we know who wear hearing aids.
