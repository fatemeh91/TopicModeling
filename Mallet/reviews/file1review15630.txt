review/text: For those reviewers that get multi-day protection from this product, I'm envious. I get 24 hour protection...that's it.The instructions that come with the product state that a single application eliminates perspiration odor up to 7 days.Now, maybe I didn't use the product exactly as the directions stipulated. They tell you to refrain from using any other deodorant for 48 hours prior to your first application of Lavilin. Well, I have too much respect for my family, friends and complete strangers to do that. Ain't happening.But, I have been using if for a few weeks now, so I figure the old deodorant has long since been eliminated from my system. My results aren't getting any better. It works great for a day. After that, I'm not willing to risk going deodorant free for another day. I'm not sure if it's just me, or if some of the other reviewers are more at peace with their natural self. "Hey, I used my deodorant last week. You must be smelling something else".Bottom line...this is incredibly expensive deodorant. It's in cream form. You have to apply it with your finger. Unless you're incredibly flexible, it's gonna take a finger on each hand. The large size is less than half an once. My regular deodorant was 3.25 oz. and a quarter the price. If the price was more in line with other deodorants, I would not balk at all. I prefer it to the smelly greasy normal stuff. But, without the multi-day protection that others enjoy, It's a little too spendy for me.UPDATE...I eventually did attain the multi-day protection that others speak of. I can never tell just how many days protection I will get...sometimes it's over a week...sometimes two days. All in all, I kinda like this stuff. I would probably rate this item a couple of stars higher now.
