review/text: I've been drinking this for breakfast and lunch with unsweetened almond milk and it is DELICIOUS! I feel like I'm cheating because it is exactly like a chocolate milkshake. In the morning I just mix it together but for lunch I blend it up with ice. I like the second option better because it is thicker and helps me drink it slower so I feel full longer. I've only been doing it for a few days but these taste really good and actually do keep me full until the next meal which is what I was worried about. I'm excited to stick with it.I'm also really happy that they have the big cans on Amazon for a good price. I recommend getting the 31 oz like I did so it lasts you a while and you save a couple bucks.
