review/text: But its a little harder to use on the thicker , shorter hairs. I use it only on my upper lip and I have noticed a couple of thicker, stubborn hairs take a little extra time before they come out. I now just pluck them out if they're the only ones left after I wax. Otherwise, I have no problems with this product.
