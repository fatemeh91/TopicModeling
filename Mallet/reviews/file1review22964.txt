review/text: I have an 8 month old daughter, and she hates the vacuum! So It's really hard to vacuum every other day, If I'm lucky I get it done once a week. I needed something in between so she wasn't always picking up hair, little pieces of paper, etc. As soon as I received this I took it out, put it together and started in my living room where we are most of the time. It works AMAZING! This sweeper is great, it picks everything up even her puffs and other snacks! I have not had any problem with the handle as others have said, it's never come loose or fallen apart (I've had it a little over a month now and use it daily) If you have babies, kids, pets, whatever this is so worth it! I would spend a lot more for this than it costs!
