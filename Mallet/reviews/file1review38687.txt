review/text: My husband has been using this product fo a long time, & it works well for his sensitive eyes. I wanted to see if it's cheaper online. This exact same value pack of 2- 10 oz. bottles is $15 something at Meijer, & we signed up with Opti-free for $2 off coupons. Walmart & other pharmacies are a litle more expensive, but not anywhere close to $39. Usually Amazon is hard to beat, but on this product, they're way over-priced.
