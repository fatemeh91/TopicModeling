review/text: Update: As the price goes down I like this product more. Haven't had to scrub the shower since I bought it. Con: I am on my third one.----Our shower was a mess, so almost two years ago moved it from the bathtub to the shower. After a couple of weeks it didn't seem to do much. So I used Shark steam cleaner to fully clean the shower (about four hours of work) til it looked like new. The scrubbing bubbles kept the shower from getting dirty again. Except for a couple of spot that may have been out of the reach, I haven't needed to clean the shower in 20 months. However about 6 months ago the warning signal became dim and last week it died. Going to buy a new one this week.It is a little expensive but if you hate cleaning the shower well worth the money.
