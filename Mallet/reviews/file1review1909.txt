review/text: I bought this product for toenail fungus I had been battling for years. I spent hundreds on laser, creams and gels but to no avail. So decided to try a tea tree oil which worked okay, then I heard about this product. So I mixed the two and let my feet soak for 30 minutes every night. Within a week my toes started clearing up. I kid you not, within 3 weeks the nail on my big toe has begun to grow out revealing a clear new nail coming in. The other three infected toes, one of them has completely cleared...the other two are clearing. The pinky toe was always fungus free. I cannot tell you how HAPPY I am to have my feet looking nice again, FINALLY! Looking forward to wearing flip flops / sandles without nail polish this summer.Also, you have to be diligent in keeping your feet clean and dry. I soak my feet every night before going to bed, then massage with tea tree oil. In the morning wash them again in the shower. I also cleaned all my shoes/boots with a mixture of bleach and distilled water. I spray the insides with Lamisil spray before and after each use. Lastly, make sure to sterilize all your nail utensils as well as throw away all polishes you used on your infected nails. Otherwise, you will only re-infect them.Wishing all the best to those who are considering trying this product. At this point, what have you got to lose?
