review/text: I bought this for my girlfriend (at HER request). So far, its been an excellent product. According to her, its completely accurate and consistent. Whenever I've been to her place and stepped on it, its been consistent with previous uses.The weight reads in .2 lb increments (some other body fat monitors/scales that I looked at measure in .5 lb, so watch for that). The body fat measures in .5% increments which seems okay thus far. Also, the scale stores settings for two different people, which is definitely a plus, like another reviewer said.I actually did some semi-extensive looking around/pricing for these combo scales. Basically, my girlfriend had already let me know that she wanted one and I kinda figured I'd forget about it and wait till the last minute when, one day, while clicking through my goldbox items, THERE IT WAS! When I saw it, I decided to do some checking up.What I found is that there are feature rich models out there that cost [$]+.Well, the greatest difference overall that I found is that the more expensive ones can do the following :* memorize for like 4 to 10 different people* measure in increments of .1 lbs and .1% body fat (these are way more expensive)* i think some would talk to you (cant remember for sure but seems feasible right?)* some were really high tech cool lookingNone of these were good enough reasons for me to spend more than I did [$]Then there were the Omron ones that you hold out in front of you. Those are great I'm sure. The Tanitas however, are scales as well. Obvious plus for the Tanita.In long, I'm very impressed with the 2201, both with its consistency and ease of use And I am extremely pleased that I decided to make the purchase. Easy 5 stars.
