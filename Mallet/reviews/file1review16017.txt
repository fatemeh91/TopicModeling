review/text: It's as simple as 123, If you can't shave your head with this awesome little invetion there must be something seriously wrong with your basic body functions, it's like combing your hair back only with a blade, it comes off nice and smooth. I've been shaving my head for almost 5 years the regular way, with a "face" razor and it took me way too long plus I always found missed spots all over my head and had to go back to them after I thought I was done, annoying to say the least. I bought my Headblade sport about a month ago, I am so pleased with it, the first time I used it I was done in about 3 minutes compared to the 10 or more with the regular razor. I highly recommend this article.
