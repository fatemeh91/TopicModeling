review/text: Sambazon appears to be a quality company and amazon makes it a little more affordable. I like the taste of the powder. It takes a little like baked cherry pie to me and I mix it with a yogurt smoothie or a dark berry juice. The rich color attests to the antioxitant and vitamin factor and I do feel a little more energetic when I take it. You can feel the fiber texture a little and I taste the omega properties some, but it's one of the tastier ways of getting your omega's in your diet- (versus fish oil). Overall, I bought two bottles and plan to finish both.
