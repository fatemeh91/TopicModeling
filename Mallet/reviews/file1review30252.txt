review/text: I guess I didn't read correctly when I was at Walmart and bought this thing. I didn't read that it is NOT cordless. When I got home I pluggged it in and immediately noticed it is very loud and probably powerful. When I realized the cord didn't come out, I decided that I would be taking it back. I'm not into the whole old fashioned thing. The only corded vacuum I want or need are my beloved Dyson's. I'm going to get another Black and Decker CORDLESS.
