review/text: I bought it from amazon.com and my husband just used it 3 times in 3 month and now it is broke. It does not work anymore--broke! I wish I bought it at a local store so at least I can exchange one after 3 month of purchasing. With amazon, you only have 30 days to try and return. Basicly it is not enough time for trying electronic products.
