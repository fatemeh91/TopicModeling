review/text: Appears less effective than a competitor's product from Larrea Biosciences, Inc., which I have used for almost 2 years. Also, being in uncoated tablet form, instead of capsule form, Chaparrel's strong odor contaminates the taste of other pills when stored in a weekly pill organizer. I tried Chaparral because it's considerably cheaper than the other, but I will not reorder it.
