review/text: I have psoriatic arthritis in my hands and I need to write plus do my crocheting. All other grippers were made for pencil diameters only until I found these. There are 2 of each size and I immediately slid one on a large crochet hook - it worked!I was hoping that they would be more squishy and soft feeling but they aren't. Soft enough to use, though!!
