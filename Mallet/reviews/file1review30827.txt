review/text: I have Lemonade Ice Cream, Gummy Bear, and Banana Cheesecake. My little girl love's these as much as I do, the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them. To be honest it was like you were eating them. The smell isn't faint at all and the scents are true to their names. Also the other scents were great also. I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot. It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products. I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too. These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself. You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips.
