review/text: Great Stuff Really....Wore this goody for about 4 hours...felt like someone took the ice picks right out of my shoulder. Yeah it has it's quirks...it can be itchy around the pits...and if you're larger than a size 16 you probably want to add one of those bra extenders to make it larger.My mom tried it on...for about 1 minute and said..."Oh yeah I need one. Order it for me"...Ok..."And one for my friend"...ok. Sure thing...will just go with the 3 pack this time maybe Mom will give me the extra one. Sure, right... ;-)Wear for a couple hours here and there and get some relief...it's not an end all but combined with some other methods: traction, heat and massage on a regular basis I am feeling like I might be able to go out in the real world and be a decent person more often. ;-)Hints...Wear a t-shirt under to prevent chaffing.Wear in only a couple hour stints to start.Tuck some shoulder pads under the pits if it's itching.Use a bra extender if it's too tight.Tag goes on the right side.Be well
