review/text: Let's get the negative out of the way first. The battery cover is very loose and I expect it to fall off at any time. Also, turning on the pearls really cuts back on the vibrating rabbit, which pretty much leaves you a choice of using one or the other. The pearls are also pretty loud.Now, for the positive. The rabbit is awesome! The ears are perfectly positioned and are firm enough to provide just the right amount of friction. The control for the rabbit provides a good range of vibration, which is easily adjustable.The insertable portion is smoother and firmer than toys I've had previously, which is a definate plus. I am well pleased with the product overall.
