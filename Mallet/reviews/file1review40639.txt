review/text: I have been a housekeeper at a B & B for over a year now, and this is the only spray I will use in the rooms (except for the tub and inside the toilet bowl). It cleans very well, and doesn't leave streaks on the counters or mirrors at all. Guests who are sensitive to chemicals always prefer me to use this cleaner (or the Orange Plus), and they have commented that they like the clean smell from either one when they walk into the room - it's not overpowering. I don't usually write reviews about products, but I feel pretty strongly about this one, since it's a big part of my job, and it's the first impression people get when they check in.
