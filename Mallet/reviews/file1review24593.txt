review/text: This stuff is horrible... I took it for about 3 weeks and couldn't take the side effects anymore. The dizziness, the pounding heart (felt like I was having a heart attack), the floating/trippy feeling, unable to sleep... and when you stop taking it for a day or two, you get a 24/7 pounding headache. I stopped taking the medicine about a week ago, and I am still getting dizzy spells randomly. HORRIBLE!! I would NEVER recommend this to anyone.
