review/text: Love this product so very much, It's like a dream to be able to lather, moisturize, and shave in one swipe. It's easy to use and doesn't even feel like you're shaving. There's no scraping or irritation, it just glides smoothly along your skin. I love that I can use it with the shower head on full blast, something I could never do when using creams or gels. If I miss a spot, I can easily go back over it, it doesn't irritate at all. I've used it everywhere, legs, under arms, entire bikini area. It works great, I'll never go back to using creams or gels. It's such a time saver in the shower. One time I was really pressed for time and tried using it at the sink, it still worked, but I didn't wet the area enough so it did scrape a bit.I love that it glides smoothly over the skin, I've never nicked or cut myself like I have with traditional shaving. I remember with traditional razors even with ample amounts of lather I would still manage to cut myself somehow and it always pissed me off to see blood running down my leg. Not to mention it hurt.When I got myself a Venus that was designed not to nick or cut, it worked great, but it did scrape sometimes and I still needed to lather up before using it. Needless to say, I threw my Venus in the trash once I got my hands on the Schick Intuition, no need to lather up, and I can shave with water running down my legs.The refills can be expensive, but I've saved money buying them in bulk at club stores. I've seen them pretty cheap online too. Certainly well worth the extra cost.
