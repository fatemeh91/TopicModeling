review/text: I have bought this soap in another online store and I want to tell you that this is the BEST SOAP EVER. I have suffer from acne since teens years. I was using a product for almost five years overall it help but nothing like the granda pa soap. Grand pa saop clear away within days. I am a thyroid suffer person as well and this soap has help with my dry skin. I have not put on lotion on my skin since I am using the grand pa soap. I had as well fungus on my feet. Thank god its completely gone using this amazing soap. I will never go back to anything but this soap. Dont have to use locion any more for my dry skin. Hope this review help you. I do encourage for people with acne suffer to give it a shoot. Thats why I gave it the five star.
