review/text: This is awesome! I'm just sad I waited so long to try it. I've returned to school and study hunched over (or work at a desk)which tightens up my shoulder muscles. I carry stress in my upper back / shoulder area and the muscles are so tight they 'click' when I find someone to try and rub them.Normally family and friends cannot 'dig in' as much as I'd like or as long. (Cannot afford a $$ massage). This baby does the trick! I'm taking it home for the holidays and my sister will likely try to take it. I just cannot say enough about it. Try it & you will not regret it!! Thank You Paul Nash for designing it!Follow the direction, 10-30 seconds at each pressure point. Anymore and your body will respond as if it is hurt.I did it a couple times a day the first time. Skipped a day b/c I was sore and then used it again but not as long or hard but still found the relief I was looking for. I had a small headache behind my eyes, didn't think it could be allergies and used it on my shoulders, neck and the headache vanished.If I could carry this with me I would!
