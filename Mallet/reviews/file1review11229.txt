review/text: I have been through 3 other digital thermometers that claim to be fast reliable and accurate. This is the only one that truly meets those qualifications - and Mom's need that in a pinch when there child is showing signs of a fever. It truly takes 10 seconds or less! I tried the Bd Digital Thermometer and it took SUPER long, not good for children and even too long for myself (1 1/2 - 2 minutes at least). The Vicks also has smooth, firm tip so its great for anal use on babies. Thank you Vicks!
