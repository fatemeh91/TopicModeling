review/text: BE AWARE OF POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!I have talked to the makers of FertilAid several times about what their product did to me and they just act like I'm an idiot. They pretend FertilAid does not harm cycles. They act as if the suffering my husband and I have gone through is nothing, they refuse to edit their info to add a warning label to their products, and they refuse to remove the words "FertilAid has no side effects". They are liars and they do not care whatsoever about the harm they cause. FertilAid has caused INFERTILITY. People need to be aware of this.When reading through this, please note: I ALWAYS have had cycles that are 30-40 days long. From the reviews, I though that FertilAid would regulate them and maybe shorten them.I was on FertilAid for about 110 days because the directions tell you not to stop taking the FertilAid even if you see disruptions in your cycle. The directions say that it can take 3 months for the FertilAid to work and you must keep taking it to see results. DO NOT DO THIS! IF YOU SEE CYCLE PROBLEMS, STOP TAKING FERTILAID IMMEDIATELY!2/10/12- I STARTED taking FertilAid 5 days before my last ovulation. After a 16 day luteal phase, I had my period. It was the longest luteal phase I have ever had.2/15/12- My last ovulation.3/3/12- CD1, 17 days since last ovulation. I assumed everything was normal and I would ovulate by CD20.4/3/12- CD32, 48 days since last ovulation. Getting very worried, but directions say there may be cycle disturbances and to make sure to keep taking the FertilAid.5/30/12- CD89, 105 days since last ovulation. I STOPPED taking FertilAid. Over 3 months had gone by and enough was enough. I assumed I'd quit taking it and everything would go back to normal. I WAS VERY, VERY WRONG.6/06/12- CD96, 116 days since last ovulation. 7 days after stopping FertilAid, I started spotting very heavily.6/18/12- CD108, 124 days since last ovulation. Heavy spotting continues.7/09/12: CD129, 145 days since last ovulation. Heavy spotting continues. I decided to seek medical help. A 10 day course of Provera was prescribed to start my period.7/23/12: CD4, 159 days since last ovulation. After 44 days of heavy spotting and a 10 day course of Provera, my "period" arrived. CD3 blood work came back normal.8/08/12: CD20, 175 days since last ovulation. Still no O.9/16/12: CD 59, 214 days since last ovulation. Still no O. I cannot begin to describe how this feels.10/15/12: CD 88, 243 days since last ovulation. 243 days. I went to the doctor today and am now back on Provera again. Having a transvaginal ultrasound done in a couple days to check to make sure everything is fine physically and then getting an HSG done after AF as well as starting Clomid. Please let this work!!!11/10/12: CD 14. Exactly 9 months after I started taking FertilAid, I FINALLY O'd today with the help of Clomid. I will have to use Clomid to induce ovulation until I get pregnant. I feel like this nightmare is finally coming to an end!! This is not at all how I planned for this to happen, but I am so, so, so thankful to ave finally ovulated!****The makers of FertilAid should have a warning label on their product. The fact that this has happened to many women and Fairhaven lists NO warnings on their label is absolutely CRUEL.****
