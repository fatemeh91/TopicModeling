review/text: This belt does help support your growing stomach and lessens back pain. What I don't like is that I can see lines from it under my clothes and I have to take it off when I go to the bathroom (fine at home, a pain at work). But overall, it does do what is says it will do. And it helps a lot with back pain and other aches. Good product!
