review/text: I run, bike, or lift every day, one to two hours. I took this per the directions and did not change anything else, not diet or workout. Nothing else changed either! The first few days, I had trouble sleeping, I drank a lot more water and peed a lot more, but don't know if this was from the Cuts or not since I was drinking more water. Over the next 3 weeks, I didn't notice any change in my body fat at all. It didn't seem to affect my workouts in any way.For me, I won't buy this again. It did not help me lose any fat. Too expensive to show no results.
