review/text: i've had small bouts of acne in not so sexy places on my body (back/butt) from working out and this is GREAT. worked on all and i have tried everything! the sulfur smell isn't the best, but if you look at proactiv and many other great acne meds, sulfur is a key ingredient. this is cheap and does the trick. buying it again and will keep using it.
