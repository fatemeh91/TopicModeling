review/text: I took this product this morning because I was looking for an energy boost. Bad idea! Even with taking the recommended amount of water, it gave me a terrible headache that lasted most of the day. This product also makes my stomach hurt REALLY bad!! I also can't sleep on this product....at all. Do not take if you are sensitive to caffeine! I only took 2 pills this morning...over 17 hours ago and I can't sleep.
