review/text: I've been using this in my shop (with a short-pile carpet) for about 8 months now, and it's fabulous! It picks up crumbs, dust, lint and all the random detritus that comes in from the street. It's also fun to push around - the people that have helped me clean are just amazed that it works, which makes them want to use it more.I wonder what will happen when the brushes get worn out - is there a way to replace them?
