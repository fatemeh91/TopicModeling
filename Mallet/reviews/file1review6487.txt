review/text: My girlfriend bought this as a present for me (I think she was tired of giving me massages) and I was a little skeptical but this thing works wonders! I am a triathlete so I work out a lot and while I have a foam roller andOriginal Massage StickI use for my legs I was lacking a way to get the knots out of my shoulders and back.Other reviewers have covered all the little features of this product so I will just cover my favorite use, using the curved end to get knots in my upper back (shoulder blades) and back of my shoulders. These are full of tension and the body back buddy lets me work them out. I'm sure I will come up with some other uses as well.The only negative is my friends think it looks like some sort of kinky sex toy...
