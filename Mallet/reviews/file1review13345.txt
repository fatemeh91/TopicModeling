review/text: I love this product. I have it over my toddler's sheets. I have two that I really used during potty training last year. I now keep one at the bottom of the bed and one at the top as a precaution. In the rare event of an accident, I can quickly remove the soiled one and use the second one instead. These don't hook to the sides of the bed, but just lay on top. For a twin bed it fits the exact width and slightly draps over the sides.
