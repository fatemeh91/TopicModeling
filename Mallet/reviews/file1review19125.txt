review/text: I bought these because they were so inexpensive - and you get what you pay for. First of all, the instructions say to test between 10am and 6pm. But after getting no positive results in 2 months, a friend of mine said to test after dinner (between 6pm and 10pm), and voila - a positive test appeared! However, the bad part was that I got the positive result only after my temp had spiked that morning (which says that I ovulated that day). So it did not predict the hormone surge 2-3 days before ovulation, like its supposed to. So buy these with that in mind. Maybe buy extra strips and test once after lunch and once after dinner. Good luck!
