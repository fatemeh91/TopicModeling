review/text: I have used Dip-it before and it is the best for cleaning my Farberware perculator coffee pot but if you don't want to go to the expense of buying it and the trouble of finding it then you can use Cascade Automatic Dishwashing powder. I put 2 scoops in the pot and run it thru 1 perking cycle and that's it. The pot comes out gleaming. Put the powder in the basket (as you would put the coffee in the basket) and your cost drops like a rock. I find that Windex does a great job of taking care or the outside of the pot without scratching the shiney finish.
