review/text: This is the best tool ever for those pesky knots in my back. There are 2 S-curves on this massager, one side on the S has a pointier knob and the other has a round knob (for a little less direct pressure). The pointier knob side is my favorite and I use it to get relief from the tightness and knots in my shoulders. My favorite way to us it is as shown by the lady in the photo.I brought it into my office last week and my co-workers love it. A few of them went ahead and purchased immediately after trying, one planned to give it to her husband for a Xmas gift. Then this weekend my relatives are visiting and the Back Buddy has been in constant use. We took it with us to my mother-in-law's house because no one wanted to be without it for the afternoon. In fact, someone even wanted to bring it in the car for the shopping trip we took today. It's been going through a rotation of people (ranging from late 20's to early 40's) constantly this weekend. Yes, it looks rather awkwardly large and it's really conspicuous but it's fantastic! If you have knots you want to work on, esp. in your back, get this now. I still prefer a foam roller for my legs/hips but for my back, this tool is invaluable. It also works great on the pressure points on your feet.
