review/text: Our 2 1/2 year old is a picky eater. We were concerned that she is not receiving enough nutrition from the small portions that she has been taking. A visit to the pediatrician yielded a recommendation for this drink and another brand. We bought one set of bottles for each brand but our child preferred these. We have been buying these on Target for $10.99/6 bottles and sometimes if we are lucky, $9.99/set. And we would stock like 7-8 sets each time we go there. Imagine the things that I have to carry from Target after grocery shopping. Anyway, I have been an avid Amazon shopper and was pleasantly surprised when I saw Pediasure here and with Subscribe and Save, I'm receiving 24 bottles of 8 oz Pediasure for about $36 (all in). No need to add for sales tax, no need to go to Target if we are running out and most important of all, no need to carry them from the store. It includes free delivery. I am more than pleased.
