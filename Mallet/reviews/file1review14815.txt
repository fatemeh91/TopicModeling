review/text: I love these bags! they're so much better than the drawstring kind or the tie-flap kind. None of my local stores stock these anymore so I bought a case on Amazon and I'm so glad I did! The bags themselves are very sturdy, the handles are long enough to tie in a knot when the bag comes out of the can, and I've never ever had an occasion when the handles rip off...I highly recommend these bags!
