review/text: It's not as user friendly as I expected. It's a pain to have to adjust it every time I get up from a chair, b/c it rises up when I sit. I did not count the fact there are 3 pcs, so every time you use the restroom, you have to take them apart then put them back together, I guess it's ok if you don't have to use the restroom every 5 minutes (you know what I mean). It is very comfortable when I am standing or walking. Unfortunately, still doesn't not ease my SI pain, but it does give me some support.
