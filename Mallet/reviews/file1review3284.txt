review/text: These are the perfect size. Perfect little "travel tube" to store them in. These tweezers will grip ANYTHING and it either gets removed from where your plucking or what you're plucking breaks in half.Absolutely perfect and I hope I have them forever.*Size is perfect for me and probably 85% of all users, if you have LARGE hands, i.e. Large or XL size gloves you would want the NON-Mini version*
