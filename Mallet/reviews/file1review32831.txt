review/text: These meal replacement shakes taste good but fail to offer any real body. When made with the skim milk they taste roughly like chocolate milk. My suggestion is to add in a serving of fruit or blend it with ice to give it some extra volume. This has an effect on how filling these products will be.Previous reviews focused on the sugar involved in these drinks. While its true sugar is non-nutrative these shakes are fortified and contain roughly 1/3rd of your daily requirements for most nutrients. These products are not for someone on a low carb diet but valuable for someone who is on a reduced calorie diet. Finally the price per serving for the mixes will beat most other products hand down. If you are dieting on a budget you'll want to start here.
