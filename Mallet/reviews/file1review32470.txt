review/text: The item I received is a baby jogger cooler bag, but it is not the same as the one pictured. Also, my bag came without any instructions so I attached it as best I could. Its very small. Im not convinced its worth having. And it does impede the folding somewhat. I was hopeful for some storage since the basket on the city mini itself is fairly worthless. Overall, I'm not impressed. This may be going back.
