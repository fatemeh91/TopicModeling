review/text: I've been using a Turbo Mach 3 for years, and came across this... Being careful to follow the directions, I never could get a really good shave without repeated and repeated passes. It did work well to remove a chunk of skin a couple of times, though. In the end, I'm back on the Turbo... If you're thinking of buying one, I'll sell you mine!
