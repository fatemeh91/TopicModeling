review/text: I was very happy with the ingredients of these vitamins -- my only complaint is that, like most prenatal vitamins, they are so big and annoying to swallow. Rainbow Light also makes mini-prenatal vitamins designed to be taken 3-a-day, but they are much more expensive, so I stuck with these. I would recommend them to others and take them again in a subsequent pregnancy.
