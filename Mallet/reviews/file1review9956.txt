review/text: This is not the tweezers you use everyday - this one is meant to break the skin, like for an ingrown hair or for a splinter. It comes with good directions about safety and cleaniness and certainly does the job in getting under the skin. I haven't tried it on a splinter yet but will the next time my grandchildren give me the opportunity.
