review/text: The Waterproof Jack Rabbit Vibrator is a dual action vibrator. One motor for clitoral stimulation and one motor for vaginal stimulation. The classic "rabbit" design. I haven't tested its claim of being waterproof by taking it in the hot-tub, but don't worry I will!The penis shaped design is supposed to make penetration and thrusting easier, however it is bigger than most vibrators so be prepared with lubrication. The nice thing about this vibrator is that it is made with jelly so you can use water or silicone based lubrication. The jelly also makes it flexible. I found this to be a downside in that it didn't hit my g-spot as well as other dual action vibrators. A plus side is the vibrator's rotating tip that gyrates in circles to tease your vagina and the massaging beads that allow the vibrator head to roll and rub against your G-spot for stimulation.The "rabbit ears" tickle and tease your clit if you can get them positioned correctly. I found the push button control pad to be bulky and hard to use in the "heat of the moment". You get to select from 3 different Rotation and Vibration Speeds or push a button to reverse the spin completely.It uses 3 AA batteries, which is goes through quite quickly. Have plenty on hand. It comes in clear, pink or purple.Once you get past the bulkiness and large size and figure out how to use the control pad of the Jack Rabbit it can produce some great orgasms. For the price it isn't a bad Dual Action or "Rabbit" Vibrator.
