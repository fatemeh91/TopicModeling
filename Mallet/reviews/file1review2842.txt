review/text: I received one of these to use during my hospital stay after a cesarean section. Previously I used store bought bottle of a similar type for washing, but they weren't designed to be lavettes and are not nearly as nice to use as Medlines.I was thrilled to find that I could order a box of 50 online since hard water causes mineral deposits to build up in the bottles.What a deal!
