review/text: This is a strange and helpful item that delivers as promised, and I have never found another one like it.True pitch black with your eyes open. Great for meditation, for doing Win Wenger Image Streaming technique (Google if curious, it's an outstanding method)I seldom use this for sleep, but when I have it works fine there too. (I bet you could nap outside in broad daylight and be in total darkness.)I love this thing.
