review/text: I've been taking this to combat fatigue and chronic yeast infections and it has helped tremendously - more than any other product just about! However, the only down side is that some of the pills have a very strong garlic odor/flavor as they go down the hatch. I wouldn't mind that so much if they didn't advertise that it was 'deodorized'. But since I didn't expect that unpleasant taste, it was quite a shocker.
