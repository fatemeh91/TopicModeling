review/text: I got this new Oral B brush after my last one died in Europe (apparently it was a victim of European voltage differences). I was looking for a while and trying to decide between the Oral B and Sonic Care, which my girlfriend had been using for years. I really liked my old Oral B, and had been using it for about 2 years. So when I saw that this new version had come out, and it had a voltage regulator to support voltages around the world, I thought I was set. It was a big disappointment when I first turned it on. It's got to be one of the loudest toothbrushes out there - sounds like a drill or some other powertool when it's running. It's probably 2-3 times louder than my original Oral B. The other problem is that the handle is much thicker and much heavier than the previous model. I have small hands and found it to be cumbersome to hold, not to mention just too heavy. I think the engineers at Oral B went overboard on this model.
