review/text: This is the second omron I sent back in 3 months. If i were to believe the readings 190/60 I would probably be dead. I took it to my doctors office to compare. On that day when he took my bp with his equipment it sas 130/75 when he took it with the omron it was 185/65 the first unit i sent back was just as bad, but I waited over 30 days to return it to Amazon.They told me they would give me a partial refund. This was 2 months ago, and I still have not received a refund.
