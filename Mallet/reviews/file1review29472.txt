review/text: I didn't find this one to be very comforting during my travels to oversea. the pillow wraps around your neck and it made me get so hot and sweaty, I couldn't get any sleep during the 14 hour flight (I'm sure there were other factors involved in my insomnia).If you're looking for a travel pillow, perhaps a travel pillow made with more breathable, vented material would do a better job.
