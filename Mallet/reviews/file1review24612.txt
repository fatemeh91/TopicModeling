review/text: This is a good product you CANT take it on an empty stomach and also eat meals with it please .I use it right before i go to workout and run on the treadmill . you need to eat even though for me it makes me less hungry or the feeling of not needing to eat(i do eat on it) .Drink water as you would normally .You cant expect to lose the weight if your not eating right and not working out okay.Use this as a jump start to your weight loss plan. Only take one pill to start off (i think it depends also on how much weight you start off at too)This does have side effects which ill list (just like any other pill you take) the main ingredient in it is niacin which will cause you to get RED welts ,thats what niacin does it flushes your body out .so here are the side effectsThis powerful diet pill isn't for everyone - individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart conditions, and are sensitive to stimulants should not take Zantrex 3. Zantrex contains high amounts of caffeine, so while using this fat burner, you can expect to experience some (or alot of) jitters.Aside from the caffeine and the jitters, several ingredients are aphrodisiacs and help sexual performance. So along with a little weight loss, you might find yourself a little more in the 'mood' than usual.Below are some common side effects of Zantrex 3:Jitters, anxiety, increased sweatingIncrease in heart rate, increase in blood pressureNausea, stomachache, diarrheaLoss or suppressed appetite (not necessarily bad in this case)Cold sweats, restlessness, shaking, irritabilityIncrease in urination (as caffeine is a mild diuretic)Caffeine can be addictiveGOOD luck and use wisley (I myself have no side effects cause i take it before my workout eat three healthy meals a day and snack in between (apples , oranges ect..)
