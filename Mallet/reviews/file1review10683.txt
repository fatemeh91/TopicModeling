review/text: I was constantly forgetting whether or not I had taken a certain medication at a certain time, and it was starting to take a toll on me. Ordinary pill containers weren't doing the trick - I don't take a lot of medications, but I do take different ones at different times, and I would forget. No more! This is a LIFESAVER - maybe quite literally. Each day is clearly marked, and has 4 compartments which fit all of my medications (plus my vitamins) very nicely. No more brain wracking!! It's just there!! What a sense of relief!! I would highly recommend this to anyone who takes multiple medications or has trouble remembering. I am so pleased!!
