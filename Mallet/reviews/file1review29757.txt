review/text: These reusable nursing pads aren't worth getting at all. They don't absorb quickly enough and they don't hold anything hardly at all. My baby is 3 months old, and so it's not like there is any type of engorgement (except morning), and they can't keep up with normal nursing. Honestly your better off stuffing a burp cloth down your shirt than using one of these. I think I'd rather use disposables, because at least they work.
