review/text: Unfortunately this product isn't made anymore and I have not been able to locate any, anywhere. I was happy to find it here and should have bought more. It goes on smoothly and stays on for a long time. Helps my chapped lips very well. Neutrogena, please make it again!! Arrived quickly and in great shape.
