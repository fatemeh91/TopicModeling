review/text: This stuff isn't bad for shaving in the shower where others will run of easily. It sticks to you pretty well and is well suited for women's leg shaving and other areas you might tend to in the shower. It tends to load up your razor if you use multi-blades. Good, not great.Update: I have bumped this to 5 stars for a reason that might not apply to all users. The fact that this gel stays clear on your face makes it a home-run for people with goatees or other facial hair that needs precise blade work. Excellent feature!
