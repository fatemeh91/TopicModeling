review/text: I had a mysterious rash on my Rear (crack) for atleast 6 months. It felt like athletes foot; it looked like a diaper rash; one doctor thought it was 5 different skin conditions and test cultures came back with 7 different mysterious results (no diseases)...which lead me to a fortune of prescriptions . Another doctor had his own opinion and recommended more prescription meds & treatments. I researched every rash on the internet and tested out as many over-the-counter treatments as I could find (soaps, creams, everything!). Additionally, I changed my diet and tried natural remedies too. I suspected, through all my research, that I get a skin rash called Intertrigo.[...]Eventually, I came across this product on Amazon. Already, many dollars in debt and my booty still hurting, I purchased "PediFix-TeaTree Ultimates-FungaSoap" & "Baza-Moiture Barrier Antifungal Cream." Whatever the reason this has happened to me, sweating during exercise, chaffing panties, hormonal imbalances..I'm prone to this skin condition. THE ONLY PRODUCTS THAT NOT ONLY HELPED, THEY CLEARED UP MY RASH were "PediFix-TeaTree Ultimates-FungaSoap" & "Baza-Moiture Barrier Antifungal Cream." I HONESTLY & HIGHLY recommend these 2 products!!! I use both as preventative treatments now. I also read that "Zeasorb AF powder" works great for this so I'll be buying that too.Burrows solution did not work and the Domburro powder I ordered never arrived (don't waste time there!)The doctors didn't help me. I had to be my own advocate and research my own symptoms and cure. These 2 products are the only treatments that helped me!
