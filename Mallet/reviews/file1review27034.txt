review/text: I can't speak for all the scientific facts on the label, but I can say that this protein is far better than any other I've tried in terms of mix-ability and taste. The Mocha Cappuccino flavor is downright delicious, mix it with some warm water and it tastes just like hot chocolate. Plus, if you read the fine print, they flavor it with REAL COFFEE, so there's 15mg of caffeine in every scoop. Maybe it's all in my head, but I'd say it gives me a little boost when I take it before my workout. Yes, it costs a little more than what you'd buy at Kroger or Walmart, but it is far superior.
