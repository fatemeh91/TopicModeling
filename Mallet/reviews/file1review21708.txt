review/text: My baby absolutely loves this tub! The soft sides are great for babies just learning to splash and is surprisingly very sturdy. I bought it so my son (who just learned to sit up on his own) would not feel confined in one of those little chair-like things and I could not be happier with the purchase. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a tub for their growing baby.
