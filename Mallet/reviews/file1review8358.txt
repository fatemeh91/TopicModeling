review/text: I bought this brush to use with my hydration bottle and my kids funtainers (which I love as well). I have been having this brush for about a year now and it still looks new. I use it daily and run it through the dishwasher every night. I also use it on my nonstick pans since the bristles are soft enough to not damage the nonstick surface.I would purchase again if needed but no sign of that anytime soon. Would defiantly recommend to a friend :)
