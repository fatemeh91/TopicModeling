review/text: Ordered box of 12 of Surgilube Lubricant to be delivered overseas. Requested for better packing however not done. The entire cost of the goods is around $700.00 USD. When the good is delivered, the entire box is damaged and the lubricant are squeezed out of the tube. Was told that they are not responsible for the delivery of the package. Just want to share my experience with this firm. Will not order any product from this firm from here on out.
