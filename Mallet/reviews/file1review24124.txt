review/text: These are exactly what I needed. I live in a house that is heated with a wood furnace and the house is kept around 12 degrees Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) most of the time. By evening, when I am sitting quietly, my feet start to cool down, and by bedtime, they are like little blocks of ice. I found it so hard to go to sleep with such cold feet. Even with my hand knit wool or alpaca socks, they still got cold. I heat these at bedtime and slip them on before getting into bed. They are wonderfully warm and just the thing I need, and I fall asleep much more quickly as a result. They are not designed to be "slippers" for walking in - they are designed to be foot cozies! If you want something to warm your feet while you are sitting quietly or going to bed, these are the perfect thing.
