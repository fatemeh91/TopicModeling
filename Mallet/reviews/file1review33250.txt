review/text: Love it! I'm very happy with this purchase. Well, I would be even happier if I got them for under $10 (as someone did back in 2007 from earlier review), but still, it's a very good solution for my cold feet. I'm warm and happy!Well, I shouold mention that it's not a good idea to walk in them, but it's not a problem for me because I only wear them when I work with my computer. They do stay warm for about 30 minutes, which is a pretty long time. Also, I should mention that people with small feet will probably be disapointed, because these things are pretty big. I have size 9.5 and they fit me okay, but they wouldn't go so great with tiny feet, I think.
