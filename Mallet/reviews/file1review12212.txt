review/text: I got these pills in the mail a few days ago and have taken them for just a short amount of time, but I swear I can feel a difference already. I was taking a generic over the counter prenatal from Wal-Mart when I was advised by a Dr to try something a little more natural and healthy.Wow, I have a much higher level of energy! I&#34;m no longer pregnant, but breastfeeding so I still take these.Not sure what the 'smell' comments are all about. I still have a strong sniffer, but I think the smell is pretty minimal and I can really only smell it when I stick my nose to the open bottle. They are large, but hardly any larger than other prenatals I have taken.P.S. I read that they give some people gas and that has been true for me too. That's the only downside so far.
