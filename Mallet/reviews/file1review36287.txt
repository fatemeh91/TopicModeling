review/text: Someone needed this item, per doctor's orders, and was told it wouldn't be covered by Medicare. I found it on Amazon for a reasonable price and bought it for her. It was delivered quickly, and was exactly as described. Other than its being warm to use in the summer months, she has no complaints.
