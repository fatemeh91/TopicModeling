review/text: Why pay big bucks or even $15-20 for reading glasses. I got these for my husband because he could not find the 2.25 strength anywhere else. We got 3 pairs of these for the price of 1 and they are great. The low-cost superstores have nothing on Amazon. I find what I want to buy, get the price and check here first; they can usually beat the price.
