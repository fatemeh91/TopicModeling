review/text: These are the GOLD STANDARD for vitamins. I'm not just talking about prenatals here; all "RAINBOW LIGHT" brand vitamins are THE BEST you can buy. How do I know? I've tried them. AND, I keep trying to find something better-but can't! I'm always looking, comparing ingredients, testing them out, and you know what? They're worth every (slightly more expensive than regular one-a-days) penny! I sleep better, digest better, have more energy, mental clarity, my skin is better, and of course with the prenatals, I know I'm getting all nutrients I need from them. When I forget to take these for a couple of days, I notice the difference. See for yourself! I have recommended them to almost everyone I know when the topic of vitamins comes up. You will LOVE THEM. I sure do!
