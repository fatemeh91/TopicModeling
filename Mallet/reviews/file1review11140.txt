review/text: I have3M Scotch Pet Hair Roller Refill, 70-Sheet (839RF-70)2 Ragdoll cats that live mostly indoors. The result is they do shed hair. I have been using these rollers for about 7 years since I bought my cats and they are the only thing that work on clothes well. I bought some from here in bulk and got a great buy with prompt service. Excellent! Thank you.
