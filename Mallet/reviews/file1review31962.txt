review/text: I decided to give this product a shot to increase my intake of green veggies and their nutritional benefits. I have come up with the following daily beverage: I use a Black 28 Oz. Blender Bottle W/wire Shaker Ball mug, fill it with about 20 oz of COLD (from the fridge.....it makes a huge difference) water and 1 heaping tablespoon each ofGarden of Life Perfect Food Super Green Formula, 600- Grams (60-Servings)greens powder, ground flax seed, andGarden of Life - RAW Meal, 2.6lb tubRaw Meal powder. I find a teaspoon of honey sweetens it nicely too. In my opinion, it all mixes up great and the taste is tolerable (not good......but tolerable). I just chug it down; I consume it for the benefits, not to please my palate. While I am still determining the benefits of consuming this product, I can say that I seem to no longer crave sweets & processed snacks. I am not sure if this is due to the Garden of Life powder or if it is some sort of placebo effect. In any case, so far so good.......
