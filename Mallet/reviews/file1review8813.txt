review/text: I saw this product in Whole Foods. I checked the nutritional profile, and was satisfied. I pay particular attention to the iron content: I steer clear away from anything with high iron content. The bottle in the store had an iron content of 3.95 mg. And, that was in the acceptable range (it's about 40% of RDA for a man or a menopausal woman. So, I ordered online. When I saw the nutritional profile again on the bottle that arrived, it had whopping 16.7 mg of iron, that's close to 170% of the RDA for a man or a menopausal woman.Note that high concentration of iron is not a GOOD thing at all: a lot of maladies are associated with this. The body does not have a natural way of getting rid of excess iron: only through blood donation or menstruation. So, if you are getting 170% of your daily RDA from this supplement, and then eat other food that contain iron (like, meat, beans, spinach, etc), you are accumulating a dangerous level of iron.I went back to the store to see whether I misread the nutritional table on the bottle sold in the store. Then I realized that there are several versions. The latest version, version 10.2 has a low iron content. Older version (version 10.1) is the one with incredibly high, almost dangerous level of iron. On the web site, they don't tell you which version they are selling, and they don't publish the nutritional profile.My guess is, they want to unload the older version with this major problem without really disclosing the details of their product.I will NOT buy any product of this company until they clearly show the nutritional profile of the product they are selling each time.This product is going to be returned PRONTO. Very deceptive selling process and hugely disappointing.
