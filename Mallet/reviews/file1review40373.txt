review/text: Since moving to Florida, I am always getting some kind of seasonal nasal congestion,and more frequent coughs and colds.I have learned over time to try and "nip it in the bud" when I feel symptoms coming on.I saw the Gaia Quick Defense was available to use and review for the Vine program, so I decided to give it a shot. I don't have a preference between prescription and natural remedies, but anytime something herbal comes up that may help with a problem, I am certainly more than willing to try it out.Quick Defense is used to "normalize the immune response" and "support respiratory defenses". Bascially,it uses herbs such as Echinacea root and Black Elderberry to help slow down or stop a cold before it takes over the body's immune system. Instructions are to take 2 capsules 5 times daily for 2 days at the onset and then continue as necessary.I had what felt like a sinus infection with a slight cough coming on last week and decided to try out this product before using anything else. I figured if it didn't work, I would just take a cough syrup and/or continue with decongestants as I usually do.While I did find that after taking it for a few days, my cough slowed down and was not as "severe" as the first day, I didn't feel it worked for my congestion and I still needed to pick up a cough syrup to end the cough completely. I feel this product would be good to use seasonally, keeping nasal allergies and colds to a minimum. Anything that can keep me from having to lose time from work or other activities is always welcome. Probably not the greatest for severe colds and flu, but definitely a help to minor common cold symptoms.
