review/text: I am 63 Years Old Male and have been Shaving since I was Sixteen Years Old. I have used so many different types of Blades until I received a FREE Gillnetter FUSION Razor in the Mail Many Years Ago, when they first came out. I have an Average Density and Medium Beard Texture, so in my First Experience I really wanted to Test this NEW Blade. So with taking care of it by softening my beard with just warm water before shaving and then using just plain soap to lubricate my face before shaving, then washing it out with just warm water, I was able to make "ONE Blade" LAST almost a FULL YEAR! When I Purchased my 1st 4-Pack at the local CVS Drug Store & paying about $20.00 for it, I 1st thought this was rather expensive, but when I really thought about it, I realized this was actually less expensive than buying those cheaper disposable blades! And then more recently to FIND OUT that "Amazon.com" DISCOUNTED this Product (3 4-packs for about $30.00, PLUS FREE Shipping) this is about ONE THIRD of a regular Drug or Retail Store's Price! WOW I have NOW Become Not ONLY a "Gillette FUSION" Addict but an "Amazon.com" Addict as well! THANK YOU Gillette! THANK YOU Amazon.com! Jerry Barton, Sr., from the South Poconos in PA.
