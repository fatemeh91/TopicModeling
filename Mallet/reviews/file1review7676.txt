review/text: I first came across this product when working as a doctor's assistant at UCLA Medical Center 19 years ago, as they had these bottles in the restroom. I kept a sample bottle, waiting for the day that I could find it. (Back then, internet commerce wasn't as popular or user-friendly. Now, years later, I'm able to do a search and find this product for sale and thus ordered it.) This really works in eliminating bad (body) odors wafting in the air.
