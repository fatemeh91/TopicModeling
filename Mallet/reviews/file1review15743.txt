review/text: This model pen used to be great. After losing mine after a few years I ordered another one to find that the tip-switching mechanism feels junky and stiff (like it's broken even though it's not). Meanwhile, it's more expensive than it used to be. I don't particularly recommend it, though I don't know if there's anything better on the market.
