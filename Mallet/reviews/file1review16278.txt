review/text: To test this product, I allowed my teenage son to run the dishwasher during his week to wash dishes. I was impressed with how well the product worked. My glasses came out without streaks. But when I asked my son what he thought about it it, he exclaimed, "Oh, wow. The dishes were shining. It was like the commercial." Nothing speaks to the quality of a dishwashing product like an impressed teenage boy.
