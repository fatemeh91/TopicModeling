review/text: I love the Polar thermal water bottles. But they have "dimples" in the sides of them that make them difficult to clean. All my cycling bottles collect a lot of fine road dirt in them. Until now, I've mostly lived with some residual dirt in the bottle. I add soapy water, close and shake. That gets most of the ick out, but not all. But this brush is THE BEST brush for cleaning out my cycling bottles. The handle is long enough to reach the bottom of all my drinking bottles and gallon glass juice jars. The bristles are soft enough that the brush can be inserted into narrow neck bottles. And they are stiff enough to do a good job of cleaning. I don't believe in purchasing lots of specialized cleaning gadgets, but this on is a must.
