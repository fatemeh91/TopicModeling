review/text: Yes, these are the best blades out there. The aloe strip, that some use to gauge when to replace the blade, fades much quicker than the Mach 3, but as it really isn't too necessary of a feature, I would suggest just using the blade for as many uses as you would with your Mach 3 (this will vary depending on the user's beard).As far as price goes, the price per blade of this 12 pack is cheaper than the price per blade of Costco's 16 pack--especially when you use Amazon's subscription feature and consider the no tax.
