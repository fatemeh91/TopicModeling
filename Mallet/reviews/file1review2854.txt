review/text: I used to have a shaver like this one but I was never able to find another until I located some on the internet. The shaver has always been excellant with the exception of it being a little louder and heavier, but I think its because of the larger battery and motor. The price is excellant for a first time shaver and they always last a long time. Being a popular shaver the replacement blades and screen are very reasonable compared to other shavers. I've tried many other shavers while looking for this one and 90% of them couldnt match up unless they were $100.00 and up. I give Remengton an A++++ for quality and performance for the price.Great procuct Remington>>>>
