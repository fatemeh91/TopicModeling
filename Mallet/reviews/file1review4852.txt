review/text: What an overpriced disappointment. All I taste is excess sweetness from Stevia. Why are almost all green formulas sweetened? Either you want the greens or not, but don't change the taste with a sweetener.It's also loaded with Lecithin, an inexpensive soy by-product used as a filler and promoted as something good.... it's not.The only greens formula I know without sweeteners and fillers is Garden of Life Perfect Food, the Original Formula. Better yet, make your own green powders from Barley or Wheat grass, Chlorella, Spirulina, and Alfalfa powder from NOW Foods .
