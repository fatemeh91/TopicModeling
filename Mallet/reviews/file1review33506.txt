review/text: I had scanned reviews of other water flossers and didn't want one that was too "weak". This one is just right. It has settings from gentle to really blast the teeth and gums. I have no complaints. I can see the things falling into the sink that brushing alone didn't catch. I think this is a good buy and definately cleans your teeth and gums.
