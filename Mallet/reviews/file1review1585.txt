review/text: My son's dermatologist recommended this to him for the wart he had in the palm of his hand. The Dr. told me he could treat it but we'd have to come back and it might take a few applications for him to treat in his office. This stick was inexpensive and works!!! I don't have medical insurance so I saved a lot of money using this instead of having the dermatologist remove the wart. I will use this in the future instead of paying a doctor to remove warts whether I have insurance or not. It costs less than one co-payment and is way more convenient!
