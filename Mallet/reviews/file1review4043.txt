review/text: I keep a beard and mustache, so I just need a shaver to "shape" my facial hair. Trying to neaten the mustache with 3 blades is not really a viable option. So the extra blade on the back of the Fusion was what really got me interested. The main bit of shaving is smoother and seems faster, but probably not so much as worth an upgrade from a M3 Power. That said, a good blade shaves smooth and if you've ever tried using a disposable (cos you forgot to pack your shaver), you'll come to appreciate that gillette's blades can last a very long time. The single blade on the reverse is an interesting feature, but only somewhat useful. I'd like to see gillette improve on it, but they probably can't without making it less safe and in this litigious climate they probably prefer to err on the side of caution. That said, I can trim better with the single blade than with 3 (or 5) blades.Gillette probably hates customers like me. I use a cartridge for up to 6 months without replacement. Partly because I don't shave everyday (when you have a beard, skip a day and it's not really obvious). I'm still on the first cartridge so I can't tell how dull it's become compared to a new cartridge, but I still have no problems shaving (and it's 4 months now). Maybe I'll update this review when I change my first cartridge. :)Update: I've changed cartridge/blades but only because the old blades look worn, but with the power on, it shaves as well as the new blade.
