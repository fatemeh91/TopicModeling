review/text: In my admittedly limited experience with protein powder, I've found many brands to be poor tasting and extremely difficult to blend. While I will leave the more technical analysis of this product to people with more experience with protein powder, I definitely recommend it for its ease in mixing and great taste. Plus it costs about the same amount per pound as other brands I've found.
