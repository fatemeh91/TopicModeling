review/text: I've had this tea before from a friend. So when I ordered I assumed it would be the same. HA! I don't know if the box I got had been sitting around for years but that's what it tasted like. No flavor. No aroma of jasmine. May as well have been drinking hot water. And I've yet to recieve a refund or response of my complaint from the vendor or Amazon.
