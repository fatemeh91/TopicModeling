review/text: It's strange that you can't put it in the freezer by itself- it must be in a zip-lock baggie. But whatever, it's a great product! It's soft and has a fun memoryfoam/gel texture that doesn't get unbearably cold for your skin. I get migraines all the time and this is my favorite cold mask I've ever used. Will probably buy another to rotate it out of the freezer. Love it!
