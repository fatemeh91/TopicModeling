review/text: Switch any bodybuilder's Whey Protein drink with some Optimum 100% Whey Protein and watch as he wants to put a barbell through your head for giving him a McDonald's shake. Once you have convinced him that it is indeed a Whey Protein supplement he will want to see the list of ingredients with the important protein to carbohydrates to fat ratios that will prove its fatty content... only to discover that Optimum 100% Whey Protein just beats all other Whey Protein into submission with its astonishing lack of fats and higher protein content. So automatically the bodybuilder assumes that the stuff is probably twice the price of other Whey Protein supplements with half the amount until you whip out the bottle that is twice the size of other Whey Protein supplements for the same price. The end result is simply - every single bodybuilder is switching to Optimum 100% Whey Protein. The only downside is finding out that it is not available and having to pay up for a Whey Protein supplement that gives you less and does not taste as good. Once you are supplementing with Optimum 100% Whey Protein it is difficult to swallow another brand. This stuff has revolutionized bodybuilding supplementation.Calories: 120-Calories from Fat: 10Total Fat: 1g-Saturated Fat: 0.5gCholesterol: 30mgTotal Carbohydrates: 3g-Sugars: 1gProtein: 24gCalcium: 140mgSodium: 60mgPotassium: 220mgEnzyme Blend: 25mg-Aminogen ---Lactase --As an added note: I have tried a few tastes, and Chocolate (also known as Double Chocolate) is one of best all round for everybody. Also Mint Chocolate tastes great if you like Mint Chocolate. Cookies and Cream is not so bad for a change. Personally I prefer Mint Chocolate.
