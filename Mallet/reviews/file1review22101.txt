review/text: When I learned that there were WASHABLE nursing pads, I was excited! I tend to go through nursing pads pretty quickly. These are comfortable, even when saturated...so comfortable, that I hadn't noticed that they were saturated and leaked everywhere! To combat that, I ended up backing the washable nursing pads up with a disposable pad. I go through a lot less nursing pads now! Because of this, I am now going through 1 washable pad about every other day and have to change the disposables even less often. FYI: When washing these, they tend to fold themselves up in the dryer, but they smooth back out easily with wear.Some people may notice that this is the same review as the Lansinoh Washable Nursing Pads, 8 ct. That is because I used these two brands of nursing pads together.I didn't really like the small washing bag that came with these Medela pads. There wasn't much room to put more than 4 pads in it. I think a bigger bag should come in it because there is no way the pads can be clean with them so stuck together.
