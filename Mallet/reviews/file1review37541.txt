review/text: I bought this sleep mask so that I could open my eyes with it on (couldn't handle other sleep masks that don't let you). This one is pretty bulky because of the padding for the eyes. The adjustable strap with Velcro works well, but the mask itself is pretty wide (one side fits all). If you sweat at night, it's going to make it worse. It washes well and seems to be holding up nicely. Sure saves my eyes from drying out and burning as much during the day.
