review/text: Much to my surprise the Thermoskin Arthritic Gloves work better than expected. Not only have they helped relive most of my Arthritic Hand pain, but I find that they help when doing daily tasks... Not sure why, but if my hands are bothering me when I'm doing a project I put these gloves on, and continue with the project. (with very little pain.) They're Great!!! With this cold winter I wear them when I sleep??? Again, I can only say that when I do not wear the gloves at night, I usually wake up with bad hand pain. Just the opposite when I wear the gloves....I would recommend this product...
