review/text: I have been wearing support hose for over 15 years from a DVT blood clot. In the early years, I wore them everyday. Now I just wear them for travel or when my legs feel sore. I don't wear them too often these days. My favorite inexpensive brand went out of business years ago, but I had a supply that I didn't need to look for more until now. I didn't know where to start and reading all the reviews helped me make my purchase.These fit and feel great. I was concerned about size. I'm 5'4" and 130 pounds. The MEDIUM fits great. Also getting them on was the usual tightness that one experiences with compression hose. I've never had open toed before, but I like it. With the open toe concept, I can wear them and around the house and throw on flip flops to run outside. The firm compression has gotten rid of the ache I was feeling in my legs, so they are doing what I need.Got these through Amazon and am going to get another pair.
