review/text: I bought these condoms because I have problems with most condoms drying out, not fitting well, or not being sensitive enough. These were less aggravating than a lot of the usual brands. The feel is better, and it's not as constricting; however, the amount of lubrication is definitely not enough. With a separate bottle of it, these are a lot more functional. I'd tell anybody that has the same experience as me with other condoms to give these a try.
