review/text: when I purchased this product I was using it as directed, I applied it two times a day for over 2 1/2 months. My results were barely noticeable, the darkest spots on my skin were hardly lightened but I did see a difference in some of the lighter spots. I eventually cut down on using it everyday and use it on occasions now. All in all I think this product works best for ''light'' hyper-pigmentation spots.ADVICE- Do not use this product with benzoyl peroxide or hydrogen peroxide ''they will react with each other causing skin irritation and discoloration.''
