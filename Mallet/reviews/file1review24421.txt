review/text: I have plantar's fasciitis and two heel spurs. The podiatrist sold me an orthotic for $25 which did a pretty good job in the beginning, but not good enough. She wanted to put me in specially-made orthotics for $500. I decided to do a little investigation on my own. I ordered this particular orthotic, started with the low, and am now up to the high insert. This is the best possible thing I could have done. It feels so good, the pain is gone and I can walk again! I even ordered a pair for my house shoes. They put my feet in the correct position, and help me walk right. I LOVE THEM!!!!
