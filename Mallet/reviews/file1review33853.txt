review/text: Okay, so I buy stethoscopes like some women buy shoes. I currently own 4 scopes. I have a Littman Cardiac iii, a Littman classic se ii, an AllHeart Cardiology, and this ADC scope. The ADC and Littman cardiac iii (compare at over 8x the price!) are very similar in acoustic quality. I am amazed at the price difference in these two products. I'm done with my search for the best scope on the market! Well, I do still want to try an acrylic.... Maybe in blue? Ha. But seriously, buy this scope. Quit thinking about it and do it. You won't be disappointed.
