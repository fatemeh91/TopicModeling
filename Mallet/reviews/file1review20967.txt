review/text: I have 2 Braun shavers, in both the foil broke very quickly.When I saw the price of the replacement foil I decided to buy a new shaver. I found a Philips/Norelco for $30.If you need a new foil, do yourself a favor and look for a new shaver of a different brand. Rotary blades seem to be more durable than vibrating ones.
