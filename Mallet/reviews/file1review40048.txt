review/text: This toothbrush was pretty sturdy and held up to lots and lots and lots of brushing (okay, so I'm a fanatic). It's pretty cool because it has a stripe in the bristles that changes color as the toothbrush becomes used, so you know when it's time to get a new toothbrush. Also, the longer bristles on one end supposedly help get food unstuck, but they didn't really help all that much. Overall, this was a nice toothbrush, though!
