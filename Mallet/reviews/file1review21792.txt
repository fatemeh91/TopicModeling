review/text: ...I didn't have to tell you that though. They don't work at all, maybe one shade of whitening if you are lucky. I use whitestrips frequently to maintain white teeth. I decided to try this, no results. I am using whitestrips premium as I type this to make up for the no whitening. Oh well, they have a satisfaction guarentee, just keep[ the invoice!
