review/text: I've been using this trimmer as my main tool for shaving since I bought it about a year and a half ago, using it once a week on average. Very happy until a few weeks ago, when I kept running out of power every time I'd shave.The battery won't retain its charge beyond the first 24 hours after charging (for however long). Problem is the trimmer doesn't work when plugged. So basically now every time I want to use the trimmer I have to charge it just before for at least half an hour, which makes it unusable for me.Still 2 stars because it wasn't a very expensive purchase.
