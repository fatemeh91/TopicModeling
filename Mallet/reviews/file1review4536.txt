review/text: What is there not to like in the Fusion shaver? It has five shaving blades that thoroughly cut and smooth out any stubble. Five blades also means less wear/tear on the individual blades and less costs for replacements. It has another blade on the opposite side for trimming of sideburns and and hard to reach spots (near lip line and nostrils). A lubrication strip that is redundant because the shaver is very comfortable and reliable. The head of the shaver pivots with the contour of the face and that again means a more precise shave and less cuts/bleeding. The handle is ergonomic and thick which allows for less fatiguing of the hands. All of these features make for an incredibly close shave that is less time consuming. What else can you ask for? I use it when my beard is beyond 7 days growth and using an electrical shaver is going to be painful. It's now my preferred shaver for all occasions because of it's thoroughness and reliability. The only concern is that the replacement blades are being counterfeited by bogus manufacturers; so if you find a hard-to-believe price for the replacement blades beware and go to Google for websites (Ebay) that have articles on spotting the fakes. I found the best price on genuine replacement blades on Amazon. This is a great product that can't be improved. It's just that good. FIVE STARS A+++.
