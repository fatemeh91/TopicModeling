review/text: After many years of laziness, I've finally bought this power toothbrush. I should have done this long ago. Not only does it do all the work for me, but the built in timer has actually gotten me to brush longer than I used to with any other brush. Floss action head actually gets some of the stuff in-between the teeth too. Not a replacement for flossing, but still nice.Only downside as I see it is the hard plastic that the actual brush is made out of. Every time the back of the brush touches a tooth, I get a very interesting sensation that runs all the way down my spine.Overall, a solid product.
