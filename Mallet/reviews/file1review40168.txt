review/text: I was looking for a kit to start using when I started to doing yoga and other home workouts but was unsure if I would stick with it, so I did not want to spend too much money, so I selected this kit figuring that I would upgrade later if I felt like it or would not have wasted alot of money.I am still using this and working out and have found no need to change things. The kit is complete with a strap, mat and blocks which is perfect for doing yoga and has held up well to use.The bag is nice, but not great, though I do not use it often since I just roll the mat and put it aside when I am done in front of the television.
