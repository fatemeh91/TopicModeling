review/text: I've used Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein for many years and always loved it. Occasionally I have tried other brands and always come back. The price is right and the flavors are usually great. Double Rich Chocolate tastes alright. I'm not going to lie, it doesn't have the best taste. It used to taste quite a bit better but over the years the flavor has changed. Not as good as it used to be but the ingredient list has been improved. With 24 grams of protein and 5 BCAA's, yet only 3 carbs, you can't go wrong!The powder mixes easily in any shaker bottle. I usually mix it with water, but it tastes better if you mix it with milk and/or some fruit. Goes down easy with a few ice cubes.Again! This is the best protein on the market for the price! Sure Optimum Nutrition Hydrowhey is a more refined product that can be digested a little better, but for the price you can't beat this Gold Standard.I have also tried a couple other flavors. Double Rich Chocolate was what I used all the time. But the flavor isn't as good as it used to be so I've experimented with some others lately. I still drink it but I like to mix it up and swap flavors now. If you don't like Double Rich Chocolate, try another flavor. You'll eventually find one you will like.Here is a list of the flavors I have tried and how I rank them (strictly on flavor alone --- 10 = Perfect .... 1 = Bad)Banana Cream - 9Strawberry Banana - 5Delicious Strawberry - 6Double Rich Chocolate - 7Extreme Milk Chocolate - 5Tropical Punch - 6Protein is not meant to taste perfect. It's meant to be a workout supplement and the taste is just a bonus. Take them for the nutritional benefits and the ability to use them as a meal replacement. ON Gold Standard is simply the best. You can't go wrong!
