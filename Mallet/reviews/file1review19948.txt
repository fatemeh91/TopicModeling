review/text: This made the adult toilet seat less daunting to our little girl when we started potty training. I thought the "arms" under the seat used to secure it to the large toilet seat were suppose to fit under the adult toilet seat, but it still fits snuggly and doesn't wobble at all. Now, with just a step stool to help her out, our little girl is using the big potty all by herself!
