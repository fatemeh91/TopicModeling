review/text: I have tried many different diet pills in the market, and I must admit that this is probably one of the best!! I suffer from big appetite and my cravings are always out of control; however, one pill in the morning decreased my cravings significantly. Later in the day, I realized that I didn't even crave chocolates or pop like I always do; it made me NOT think about my food!! Another plus is that it doesn't make you all jittery like other diet products...no problem falling asleep at night! One downside is that it doesn't pump you up or give you crazy energy; however, if you have enough motivation to get some exercise done, you should be on the good track! I'm so happy to find a product that doesn't make my heart pump like crazy!! Best for the price!
