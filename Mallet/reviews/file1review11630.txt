review/text: I've eaten things that taste like sawdust and sugar as well as sickenly sweet "health food bars" of questionable merit. This is a good product that I feel safe in using when my blood sugar is low, knowing that it really was created for diabetics who want good control. It tastes fine, even for someone who doesn't care much for candy bar type foods. To my tastes, this is far better tasting than the oatmeal raisin flavor. I like that Glucerna comes in two sizes so I eat only what I really need rather than indulge in extra calories.
