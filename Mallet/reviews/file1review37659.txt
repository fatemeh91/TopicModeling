review/text: This is the deodorant that I travel with because the stick fits into a toiletry bag easily. The smell of this formula is very good and it does offer all day protection. There are two things I don't like about stick deodorants though. First, it's sticky and a little uncomfortable when you put it on. Secondly, unless you really have the deodorant stick far enough out of the container, you can sometimes scratch your underarm with the sharp plastic edges. Otherwise, I'd give this product a thumbs up.
