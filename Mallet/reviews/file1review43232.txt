review/text: The ONLY reason I bought this clipper set is that I am living in eastern Europe for the next 2-3 years, and this is the only dual voltage set I could find. I bought my Wahl set of clippers over 10 years ago and they still work great, just not on the 220v electricity where I am now living.This Conair set came with dull scissors (my 10 year old, never sharpened scissors that came with my Wahl set are sharper) and a cape that is as thin as a garbage sack (I'm using "shampoo" capes that I bought at a beauty supply shop instead). The guide combs seem more flimsy than the one's in my Wahl set. Also with out guide combs and the adjuster in the shortest cut position, there is still hair visible after clipping with the Conair, but not with the Wahl.The Conair has a 5 position blade adjuster, where as the Wahl adjuster doesn't have stops so it can be in an infinite number of positions. A couple of years ago I dropped the Wahl and threw the blades out of alignment, with the stoppless blade adjuster I could set it just right to bring the blades back into alignment.Bottom line unless you need dual voltage like I do, buy a Wahl.
