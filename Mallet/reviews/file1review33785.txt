review/text: I tried Tend Skin several years ago after seeing an ad for it in an airlines magazine. I had long suffered with ingrown whiskers caused by shaving and had tried numerous cures, even prescription medicines for the acne-type bumps these whiskers caused. In truth, I did not expect much from Tend Skin, but I saw results fairly soon and decided to stick with it. I apply it daily as an aftershave after using an electric razor. It not only reduces the number and severity of ingrown whiskers, but also makes my face softer and smoother, and I believe it even helps reduce wrinkles and lines (although it makes no claims in this regard). I've been a Tend Skin user for more than five years and don't ever plan to give it up.
