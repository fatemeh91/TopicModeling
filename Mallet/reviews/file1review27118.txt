review/text: I bought this shake because of it's high reviews. I have previously been drinking Herbalife protein shakes but wanted to switch to whey protein for the price and for more protein. My sister even recommended this product to me saying it was delicious. I mixed it up in my shaker cup and poured it into a glass. The aroma it gave off was terrible. It smelled like rotten eggs! I tried it anyway and sure enough, it tasted like it too! I thought maybe it was a bad batch so I had my sister try it. She said she thought it tasted fine. Maybe this is how all whey protein is??? I don't know, but definitely not for me.
