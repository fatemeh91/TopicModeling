review/text: It didn't get off to a great start with a dead battery.We have an older Vicks V965 Basal thermometer. Basal thermometers are the more accurate version needed for tracking ovulation.So we wanted a spare as a backup or for travel. Fortunately, Amazon had it.Or not. Apparently this is the V965R. This version is not a Basal thermometer. The rapid reading feature advertised might have been a hint, but who would have thought it with the same model number?This thermometer measures by waiting until the temperature reading starts to level off. It's not clear how level is enough for it, but the times vary from 8-25 seconds and the readings vary by about half a degree, which is very significant when an 0.4 degree temperature shift is normally interpreted to signal ovulation. So our confusion aside, the thermometer is very inconsistent.
