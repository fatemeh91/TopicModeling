review/text: Each packet contains 5 grams of sugar so I dontmake this a daily habit even though it's so tempting.The fizz and genuine orange taste are refreshing andit's a healthier alternative to orange soda. It doescontain quercetin (component of real vitamin C)but no tannins so I'm not 100% sure about the efficacy.Nevertheless I highly recommend this as researchshows 100 mg of vitamin C daily reduces lung cancerrisk.
