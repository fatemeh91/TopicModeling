review/text: I am highly pain tolerant and have used a home electrolysis pen in the past. I tried this and really cannot tell that anything is happening turned all the way up to 10 the first time. As other users have said, the needle retracts so you find you are only touching the surface. The pen I used in the past definitely had current, this one does not. I wish I could find something that worked but almost everything has negative reviews. Don't buy this.
