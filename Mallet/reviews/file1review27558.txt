review/text: I remember the days when the only way you could mix a protein powder was with an electric blender. This mixes easily in my shaker bottle and tastes pretty good too. I spoon in some creatine powder with it a few times a day and I'm ready to go. Buying the 10 lb bag makes it a great value too. Don't let the fools at GNC trick you into thinking their gold card is a better deal than this!
