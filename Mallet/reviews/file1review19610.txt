review/text: My husband and I bought a couple different potty seats from locals stores and we constantly had to reposition our son so that his pee was going in the toilet and not every where else! This potty seat is perfectly designed.. we set him on the potty and don't worry about a thing! Fits perfectly on the toilet, doesn't slide around and it's white so it isn't a terrible eyesore. And if the pee hits the inside of the potty seat there are no cracks or seams or anything for it to run into it just runs straight down into the toilet! Easy to clean! Seemed a little pricey for a what it is but well worth it in our opinion especially since we just threw the others away! Will be ordering another so we have one downstairs as well! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a potty seat.
