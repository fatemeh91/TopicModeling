review/text: I read the negative reviews about the handle coming apart, but decided to order the Bissell Sweeper from Amazon anyway. Glad I did. Yes, the handle, as delivered, does keep coming apart, but that can be fixed. A 3 foot, 7/16 inch wooden dowel from the hardware and two small sheetmetal screws solved the problem.It's a nice product for a quick sweep of rugs, but not for wooden floors.
