review/text: I won a 40 pack of this stuff in a contest and I thought, what the heck? Why waste it? So, even though the flavor (cake batter) wasn't that great, I enjoyed the shake. After a week or so of having a shake a day (to which I added a handfull of frozen mixed berries) I started to feel better ~ kinda' pumped up. After a couple of weeks my physical therapy began to take off in effectiveness.You see, I have had chronic back problems for the last 10 years or so and had been through surgery, etc. and was continuing a program of phys. therapy to keep trying to get off the pain pills.Well, I could feel the support trunk muscles growing, getting stronger and my back is hurting less and less and the vicadins are getting fewer and fewer. Plus I feel a lot better overall and have lost weight! Go figure. I'm not doing any weight lifting, just the physical therapy exercises and isometrics during the day but I can feel the muscle mass and my therapist is really impressed as well.I will add that I am a 58 year old male & I've read that protein supplements are helpful as we age.I would have never have tried this stuff if I hadn't won that first box but, what a stroke of luck that was.Also, the chocolate is WAY BETTER a flavor and goes very well w/the berries I like to add.
