review/text: I bought this product and started seeing immediate results. My metabolism has always been on the slow side; as such, I'm always gotten cold easily and had poor circulation in my extremities. In the first week of using this, I could FEEL the difference! I was warmer, less hungry, etc...it seemed to be working like a charm.But now, at the beginning of the fourth week on these capsules, the effects seem to have worn off. I'm back to my old hunger levels and snacking habits, and I'm cold again. I don't know why, but it seems as though my body gradually became accustomed to the capsules and reacted accordingly. :( Definitely not for long-term consumption.
