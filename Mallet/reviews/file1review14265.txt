review/text: I'm not sure what it is, but there is some sort of design flaw in this thing. It really does seem to clean, but the automatic dispenser doesn't last very long. It eats through batteries every week or so. I've tried every combination possible: new batteries, different brand of battery, returned/replaced the unit several times, with always the same disappointing result.
