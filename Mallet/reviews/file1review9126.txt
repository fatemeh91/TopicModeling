review/text: I have been using Green Vibrance for a couple of years now and just recently started purchasing it from Amazon. Since I have been using it I have not been sick to any serious degree. I was exposed to someone with a cold for a couple of hours and had to use the same keyboard. I only had some slight sniffles with a very mild headache afterwards. This year I was exposed to someone with a bad case of the flu and my body responded only with some slight weakness and I was a little more tired than usual. I drank lots of water and got plenty of sleep and only had those systems for a few days.If you are not used to green drinks, the taste and consistency might be a bit off-putting. Stay with it and you will be rewarded.
