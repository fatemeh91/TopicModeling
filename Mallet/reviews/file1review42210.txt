review/text: This is a brilliant item. In the nickel sized charm is a piece of paper that is twelve inches long! If you use a fine point pen, a great deal of information can be put on it. The quality of the chain is great, the clasp is sturdy too.Since the owner writes on the paper, there is no need to involve anyone else with sensitive information. If the information should change, then it is easy to edit the paper in the locket.Very good worthwhile item. High recommendation.The one caveat is that if you have any dexterity issues, help must be sought out. The charm is a bit difficult to open up.
