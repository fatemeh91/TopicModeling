review/text: When I bought this I was thrilled at getting a 5 in 1 piece of equipment at a great price. But slowly my enthusiasm waned. Its too long to fit comfortably in my pocket, the finish could have been better. Finally the disk shaped attachment at the end of tuning fork broke loose and now I don't use it anymore. Inferior product at cheap price.
