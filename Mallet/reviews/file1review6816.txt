review/text: Just started scanning my photos and slides and needed more than a magnifying glass or 5x loupe to examine the fine details without eyestrain. This loupe accomplishes that with clear optics, no perceptible distortion and the ability to get light to the areas under examination. Very impressive for the price I paid.
