review/text: I bought this for my 2-year-old grandson who is just ready for potty training. I chose this one because of the excellent reviews and the brand name. It's perfect! It has a knob on the back that can be turned so that it fits exactly over the regular toilet seat firmly. We hang it on the wall right next to the toilet so it's ready at a moment's need, and when a little guy has to go, the seat needs to be ready right away! And this seat is perfectly formed so that a little person's bottom is cradled with room for the little fountain that we hope will ensue. :) We looked at other brands and tried some, but were unhappy with them all. Either the seat wiggled, or was made of a material that would absorb the smell that we want to flush, or the front was too low or uncomfortable for a little boy. Buy this--well worth your money!
