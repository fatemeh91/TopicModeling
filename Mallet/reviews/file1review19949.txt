review/text: My 22-mo. old loves to hang out while we patiently wait for the results. Great seat b/c my child is no longer scared of the toilet (he used to be afraid to fall in w/o the seat). Fits great and is easy to use and store. Highly recommend for all those entering the world of potty training and good luck.
