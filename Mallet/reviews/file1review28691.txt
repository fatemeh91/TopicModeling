review/text: Despite what anyone else says, this is the best and most consistent Whey Protein powder on the market...i've had a lot of bad ones. It tastes awesome, no artificial-tastes...haven't tried all of the flavors, I always alternate b/w the vanilla and either of the chocolate flavors- they are spot on delicious.A quick word about mixing/preparing these- Some reviewers make this so much more complicated than it has to be...it's this simple: Buy 1 or 2 Nalgene wide-mouthed bottles to use for this (and the inserts that make sipping/drinking easier if you like, I don't use tho). Put a scoop or 2 of powder, a big handful of ice, and as much water as u see fit. Shake like hell, drink. The ice serves to keep ur shake cool in the warmer months, and does away with the need to have an expensive "shaker bottle". Shake before each drink...stays delicious to the finish.I tend to mix almost 2 scoops, and drink 1/2 before my workout and the rest on the way home. Use Optimum Nutrition's Natural Casesin for your b/w meals, slow release protein needs...this will keep you from being ravenous throughout the day, especially the day after a really hard workout. On weekends or non-workout days, i tend to mix both products for a one-two punch.Make sure to consume some protein and carbs 30 min before your workout, but most importantly make sure to get some protein in your system less than 40 min after your workout...this has been studied and proven. If you don't do this, your body starts eating muscle and your gains go out the window.Cheers, and happy muscle gains!
