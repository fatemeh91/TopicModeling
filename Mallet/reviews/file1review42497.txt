review/text: I've been using a few different brands of protein for a couple years now. I wanted to give something else a try mainly to change up from chocolate or vanilla. While this is a decent protein product, the berry blast is a little tough to choke down. It does somewhat taste like "Berry Ice Cream" as they claim, but a really bad warm melted berry ice cream. I won't be getting this flavor again
