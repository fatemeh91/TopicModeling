review/text: these strips don't whiten your teeth AT ALL, even if they did the bottom strip only covers 6 teeth so you would look stupid with both white and yellow teeth when you smile. You should use trays and gel, it gives you great results and dosen't cost half as much as these strips....stay away!!!!
