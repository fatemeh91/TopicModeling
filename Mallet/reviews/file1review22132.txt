review/text: This soap is a lot better than what you get in the store, but Aubrey could do a lot more with it. First off, this soap is only 85% organic, so the rest of it is the same stuff you're probably trying to avoid. TheAubrey Organics - Herbal Liquid Body Soap, 16 fl oz liquidis 100% organic, but neither of these soaps contain anything to really get rid of the toxins that collect in your skin on a daily basis.If you stick with Aubrey, which is a good company, a better option than either of these would probably be theAubrey Organics - Sea Buckthorn Nourishing Bath Bar, 4.0 oz bar.Another good option is theSea Buckthorn Soap - 4 oz - Bar....but overall this is still a very good soap.
