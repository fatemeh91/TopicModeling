review/text: I recently bought this cuff because I'd been asked to monitor my B/P by my doctor. My brother had done some research and this one came recommended, so he bought one. I tried it, and it was easy to use and had good instructions. If the cuff was another inch longer it would be perfect for most men. I bring it to work to take my pressure around lunch time, and other coworkers have tried it. It is borderline for most of the males, and for me it just fits, but I'm only 170-175 lbs. The 200 pounders are right on the edge of it working for them. They hold it shut so the velcro doesn't let go. If you are over 200 lbs., get the larger cuff. I went to the discount department store chains and the model below this one w/out an electric cord was $10 more and this unit was $20-30 more, so it was worth going online to buy it. I also brought it to my Drs. office when I went, to see if it was calibrated correctly and it was very close to what they got.
