review/text: At onset of a cold or anything with similar symptoms, I was taught to take a combo of vitamin C, aspirin, and echinacea - one pill of each, the vitamin being the largest. This usually works for me, with the caveat that this should be taken ASAP - as soon as you feel a little iffy. One or maximum two such doses ward off the disease. If that does do not slay it at the onset, then I keep taking vitamin C and whatever is most appropriate for what has turned into a more pronounced condition.So how does this Gaia mix work? As well or better than any of the echinacea-only pills I have used before (Whole Foods brand or Natures Pantry brand).The one thing I take issue with is the multiple pills per day they recommend. I see no reason to do this - otherwise you will burn through this box in a couple of days.Overall verdict: recommended.
