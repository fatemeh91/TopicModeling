review/text: I have used this product for almost 20 years and have always found it to work very well. I have read, from other reviews, the formula has changed, not to my understanding. The packaging has changed from the small black container to the white container and possibly the portion in this container is smaller. Doesn't matter, one of these containers lasts 3 months or more and the best part, I don't feel like I'm toxifying my body with all the chemicals in standard underarm deodorant found on the shelves of grocery and drug stores.
