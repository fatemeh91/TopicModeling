review/text: I chose this bombilla after reading the reviews of several different brands. Everyone seemed to like this one best, and many reviewers were able to compare it to others. I had used one other brand years ago, it was okay, but not as nice as this one.It is truly a joy to use, and although I have yerba mat&eacute; that is extremely fine ground, it truly does strain it all out. It has a nice heft to it. Goodbye to tea strainers and french presses, this is my new favorite way to drink mat&eacute;!! PS, The shipping was the same for two as for one, so I bought two.
