review/text: Comfortable and convenient for light days or as a tampon backup. The wings prevent leakage, and the covering is more comfortable than many others. There's also enough adhesive to keep it in place, and the wrapper is large enough to use for disposal as well. All in all, a good product -- and better than its imitators.
