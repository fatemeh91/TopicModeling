review/text: I was looking for a good set of scales because I recently had started working on tracking my weight loss. I wanted to make sure that I could track my downward journey in quarter pound increments. I sometimes need a little mental boost to keep me on track making all of the changes to keep my attitude positive. This scale fits the bill. I highly recommend that if you are looking for a scale that is reasonably priced and accurate you look no further. I was surprised that when I was going to health clubs to find one that I wanted to join, that in the men's locker room, I saw a few of the exact scales that I purchased in a health club. That confirmed that I made the right decision. And, yes, I would buy the scales again and recommend these to a friend.
