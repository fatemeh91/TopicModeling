review/text: I bought this wheat germ oil as a suggestion from a friend. I have a long scar on the back of my neck from surgery. I've had it for seven years. The skin around it is raised and hardened, so I figured I'd have to learn to live with it. I've been applying the oil to the back of my neck and scar for about a month now and I can already tell that the skin is softening, feeling more pliable. If you have a scar that's a nuisance, I suggest trying Country Life Wheat Germ oil.
