review/text: I bought this for my grandmother for Christmas. She has been suffering from arthritis in her neck, and she has been miserable for about six months. She had another collar she had purchased at a Wal-Ma@#. The collar she bought was a generic one for neck discomfort. She was waking up several times during the night from the pain, and she was getting very little rest. Her neck was hurting all day, and she her range of motion in her neck was severely limited. I bought her this and heated it up in the microwave as directed. She immediately told me how great the soothing heat felt on her neck. She has been using it for a few weeks now, and she feels so much better. Now she comes to my house without a neck collar on, and she is laughing a lot more. She is acting the way she used to, and seems so much more energetic. She says her neck is still sore, but the pain is so much less now. I could not be happier with this purchase and the relief it has given my grandmother.
