review/text: This is the first Kava product I've tried. I have anxiety/sleep difficulty and am a recovering alcoholic. I am very wary of prescribed med.s, and especially ones for anxiety as most are addictive. I have taken this Kava for a week now, and do find it helps me relax, and fall asleep easier, and have a better quality of sleep in general. It is subtle, similar to Melatonin for me. I was concerned about potential health risks (liver damage) and side affects (nausea, headache) that I had heard about Kava, but so far haven't had the experience of any. *If you are currently on any MAOI medications, Do Not Take Kava.* Also, be sure that It is only the Kava Root (not stems and such) in the product, this one is good.
