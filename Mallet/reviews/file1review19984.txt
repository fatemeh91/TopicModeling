review/text: These size "0" gelatin capsules work just as I expected them to. They snap together when closed, they weren't very sticky when put in my mouth like some other gel caps can be, and I could swallow them much easier than "00" size capsules. For what it's worth, I purchased these at a local Vitamin Shoppe (one of the sellers for this item).The easiest way I've found to fill a capsule or two after weighing your supplement dose is to use a tiny paper funnel (make a small cone then cut off the tip). I only use my capsule filling "machine" when I make 4 or more pills at a time (and even then I'm still using a funnel).
