review/text: This is my favorite supportive knee brace for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which requires a lot of contact between sparring partners. Because it is guaranteed to rub against the other person a lot, the rounded plastic hinges are really key for not having your training partner hate you. The metal squared hinges just don't work well for grappling and end up tearing through your gi anyway. This brace also stays in place better than most. This is the one I use when my knee is tweaked and it NEEDS support. The neoprene sleeves with no metal supports are good for keeping the knee heated up, but I find do nothing for allowing injuries to heal while still training.
