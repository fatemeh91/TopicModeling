review/text: I love this stuff! I have been preparing for a fitness competition and found this brand at the Natural Grocers. I tried some other brands as well but this one really has some consistency to it. The others were really watered down when even just adding 6oz instead of 8oz. I would reccomend this brand to anyone and my favorites are the Chocolate fudge and the Vanilla cake!
