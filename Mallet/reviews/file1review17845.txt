review/text: I am an R.N. and also a Diabetic. I have used this dispenser every day, twice a day. I use one for my morning pills and one for my evening pills. This way I can set them up for a month. There are times when I have forgotten to take my pills or really couldn't remember but with the Royalty pill organizer all I had to do was look and see what day the last pills were taken. They have been very helpful in managing my Diabetes, helping me to take medications on a regular schedule every day. I highly recommend this item to be used, especially for the elderly who often need assistance in organizing and correctly taking their medications.Cecelia R. Peterson,R.N.
