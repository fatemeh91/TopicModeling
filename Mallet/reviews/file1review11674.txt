review/text: These batteries have never yet failed me, the charger works great, the trickle charge feature is an extremely desirable option (not all chargers have it, but this one does). I keep a spare set of non-rechargeables in my camera bag as backup, too, which no photographer should be without since you never keep track of how many hours you've actually put on your batteries. This one also comes with an automotive plug, so you can recharge batteries in your car or RV overnight - very handy for campers. In short, this item is not a waste of your money. The batteries included are better than the standard rechargeable ones you can buy at your local WallyWorld, too.
