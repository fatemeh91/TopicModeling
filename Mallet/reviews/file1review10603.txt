review/text: The size of the mirror is not big enough if using to style your hair. It's difficult to get the mirror in the right position to see the back of the head. Once it's in position, the width of the mirror is too small to see well. Also, the suction cup did not always stick well. This mirror is more hassle then it's worth. But it does work well for putting on makeup. I did like how it expands and folds up for storage. It also came with a bag to keep it in.
