review/text: The taste was a little disappointing but I don't like peanuts anyway. The bars were very filling and gave me a little boost. I'd say these are all that they promise, although, they're a little pricey for my wallet. I'd recommend them to anyone who likes peanuts and is looking for a bit of a pick-me-up during the day.
