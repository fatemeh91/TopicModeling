review/text: I recently had a large amount of pain from my tennis elbow and I needed some sort of support to decrease the pain. So far it has been great. It keeps my elbow warm which helps increase blood flow and it also restricts my motion to help keep from over-stretching and overuse. Very useful tool for any elbow pain. Very pleased.
