review/text: Glad to have finally found this battery on Amazon after looking for it at Target and Radio Shack. First shipment was lost and vendor was good enough to replace it 2 weeks later. So after a long wait, finally got it installed in my faucet for my Watt kitchen RO unit. BUT Watt admits their indicator is merely a timekeeper and goes red in exactly 6 months to remind you to change the filter. I don't really think you need a battery to do that. And the model I have is designed where the battery sits on the sink surface and gets wet. (old one was corroded; new one is shorting out)
