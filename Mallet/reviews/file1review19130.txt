review/text: I tried these and my only complaint is that even when positive the line isn't much different then the test line. It is clearly not as dark when negative and I used BBT to verify ovulation. The tests do work and are easy to use. No instructions are included in the package but a web site is given on the invoice that has them.One little tip...I tried was using them as a mid stream since I find the whole cup thing a bit unsavory. I found I was able to do it and get the same results regardless. I don't know what the manufacturer would say to that, but it saves money on using the mid stream version of the test.
