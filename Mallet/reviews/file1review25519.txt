review/text: This is actually the 2nd one I've bought. It works as advertised but just doesn't seem to last long. The 1st lasted about 1 year but when you condier it's probably only used a minute or so once or twice a week that's really not a lot of actual use before it just quits. It did the job fine and when you get down to it I suppose it's pretty much a disposable item since the price isn't much. I just expect it to last longer.Will it do the job, yes. Will you have to replace it, yes.
