review/text: My home based company, doing ceramic and stone restorations, has used these grout brushes for years and were VERY happy with the product until the company, OXO, decided to change the look and texture of the bristles. What you see pictured to the right is not the brush you receive, but rather the old version. The new design has an altered head shape and the bristles are much softer and splay apart quickly like the cheaper versions found at the large box stores. In the past I have gotten the pictured version at Ace Hardware for the price of about $8.00, exspensive but because of their bristle sturdiness well worth the price. My question is this....OXO, why change a functual design, and Amazon, why not update your web site with the current picture of the product?
