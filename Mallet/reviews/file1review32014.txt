review/text: I bought this product mainly because I like to enjoy a healthy, active lifestyle; however, I do not enjoy eating vegetables and this is the perfect replacement. I work out regularly and mix this in with my chocolate flavored protein shake, along with some chia seeds and which work great for digestion. To be honest the product is great I feel healthier and more rejuvenated in general and get my daily servings of vegetables with ease. As people have mentioned before the taste is really bad and its hard to take down with just water alone. The health benefits easily outweigh the bad taste and as long as you keep this in mind when chugging it down you shouldn't have any problems, also many juices mask the taste very well. I just put this in my post-work out super shake which tastes terrible, but if your mentally prepared to put in the effort to work out and live healthier drinking this in your post-workout shake shouldn't be a problem.
