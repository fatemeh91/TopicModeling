review/text: I began using this deodorant in 2008, when I was undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer. The doctors refused to let me use regular deodorant, as it interfered with the radiation process. I smelled bad, using the other natural products on the market. Then I found this stuff, and I have never changed from using it! I apply 2x per week, and love it. Furthermore, the mail order house I bought it from discontinued the product, and I was beside myself until I thought to find it on Amazon. Saved!
