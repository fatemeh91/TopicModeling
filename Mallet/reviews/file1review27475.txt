review/text: It was strange to try this flavor after drinking the plain chocolate flavor for a while. The mint seemed overpowering, and...different...not like mint chocolate ice cream, like I was expecting. I wasn't a fan of this flavor the first couple times I tried it, but since I bought it, I figured I may as well get my money's worth. Well, after the initial flavor shock wore off, I really began to enjoy the mint chocolate. Now that I'm used to it, I think it's perfectly delicious, and would definitely buy it again. I just had to realign my taste expectations with reality.
