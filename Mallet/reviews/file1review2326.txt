review/text: This product is a life saver. I think it really works. I wasn't sure about it until I ran out of it and couldn't find it in my local stores. My eyes became really dry and uncomfortable, even with my daily Restasis. I'm looking forward to the day when I won't need anything for my eyes, but until then I'll make sure I have enough TheraTears on hand.Amazon rocks btw - fast delivery, excellent wrapping, good prices. Thanks!
