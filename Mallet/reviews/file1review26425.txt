review/text: It was worth the money, it worked nicely for a while. It stopped working properly after 4 months though. When I flip the switch to the 'on' position it doesn't always work or it will work and then stop working, off and on. This can be very frustrating. It was so inexpensive though, I'm getting a new one- same brand.
