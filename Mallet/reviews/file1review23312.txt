review/text: UPDATE: YES, THIS HANDLE DOES CONTINUALLY FALL OFF NOW! VERY FRUSTRATING! SO I JUST PURCHASED BISSELL SWEEP-UP MODEL 2102-B FROM KOHLS.COM. SAME PRICE AND THE HANDLE SCREWS TOGETHER. LOOK FOR COUPONS ONLINE TO GET A % OFF AND FREE SHIPPING SO IT ENDED UP COSTING ME 15.00 AND A MUCH MORE SUPERIOR PRODUCT!!!!! I THOUGHT MY FIX TO THE HANDLE WAS GOING TO WORK, BUT IT DOES NOT!!!! MY NEW OPINION....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.BISSELL SWEEP-UP, MODEL 2102-B. ITS BLUE! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!!!!I work for a well-known Steak Buffet, and believe it our not, when that place closes, Servers are expected to clean the floors with a short handled broom and dust-pan. NO VACUUMS ARE PROVIDED. I noticed that several Servers purchased their own cleaning tool. Not having a lot of money, I decided to try this. IT IS AWESOME! I read all the reviews and was concerned about the handle problem. I put the handle together, went outside and tapped it on a hard surface several times, from both ends, and then attached it to the thing. That handle is going nowhere! So to test it out, I have two furry dogs. I ran it over my area rugs in the house, thought is was actually doing nothing, until I opened it to empty it. TONS of dog hair, so I KNOW this will be perfect for my job. Sure beats being slumped over a broom and dust pan for like an hour. Finishing up at work quickly and then get the hell out! GREAT PRODUCT AND SUPER FAST SHIPPING! By signing up for "prime" I got this item shipped FOR FREE AND GOT IT THE VERY NEXT DAY In fact, I will definately be purchasing another one just for my home. Totally recommend this product if you have carpet and want something to use in between big-time vacuuming. And yes, it worked just as well on my kitchen floor, which is tile!
