review/text: I have had problems with my back for years. I've been going to the chiropractor for the past 5 years and they have done a great job. However, I have always suffered from muscle pain even after having adjustments. My chiropractor had the backknobber in her officer to sell but I wanted to do research on it. I'm glad that I did because I stumbled onto the Body Back Buddy. It seemed to be a much better quality and it is. I LOVE MY BODY BACK BUDDY! It really gets the tightness out of my muscles so I don't have to go to the chiropractor as much. It is well worth the money which is less than 1 visit to the doctor. This is the perfect gift for someone with ongoing back pain.
