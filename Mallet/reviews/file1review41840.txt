review/text: I hardly right a review of products, but my dentist, yes dentist recommended this, and I have thanked him many times already. My teeth feel clean all of the time, my gums are pink and healthy and I am brushing more than ever before. Three times a day. He told me not to use the polish head more than once or twice a week. I call it the welfare toothbrush, for obvious reasons, looking at the price, but I would gladly buy it again given the opportunity.
