review/text: I never expected to be writing this review but here it is - we get older, a spouse becomes ill with an incurable condition and we're back to protective covers and pads that are quite a bit larger than the infant ones we threw away so many years ago.This protective mattress cover is convenient to use, washes well and I would't know what to do without it.Yes, I actually use small pads on top of it just to be safe but before we had those, it was just this mattress cover alternating with a large pad as I stripped the bed in the morning, did that laundry and put it back on the bed the next day.Good product at a reasonable price.
