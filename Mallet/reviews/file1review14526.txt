review/text: I ordered the Neutrogena Foot Cream in the white box - a white tube with blue and red writing, but received the Foot Cream with a white and red box with white and red tube. Since this is not what I ordered, I will probably be returning it. For one thing, what I received smells pretty strong and I'm not sure I can handle the smell of it. The Foot Cream in the all white tube does not have a strong odor like this. Not very happy that what was pictured is not what was shipped. False advertising??
