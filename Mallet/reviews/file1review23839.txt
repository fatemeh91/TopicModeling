review/text: I enjoy the capability of folding the cane and placeing it in a bag to take with me when i go places. It is sturdy and easy to handle.I recommended it to my sister-in-law who was going on a trip and she needed a little extra support after knee surgery. She also bought one and says it is perfect for her traveling when she needs it.
