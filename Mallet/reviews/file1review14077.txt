review/text: I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the "shelves" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out.
