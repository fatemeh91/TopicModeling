review/text: Two months ago my hemmies started acting up. At first just pain, burning and itching. So I tried the so called #1 OTC stuff. They got worse. So I tried the witch hazel route. Some relief but then they started to bleed and I also developed an anal fissure. Talk about pain and bleeding. I was resigned to surgery until a friend told me about this stuff. What the heck, it was my last shot. I ordered both this and the pills and received them both in 4 days. The minute it arrived I tried it. Wow such a cool relaxing feeling. the pain was gone. The next morning, no blood. No pain. Hmm, I put more ointment on and went to work. came home, no pain, no blood. I have continued using it twice a day now for 4 days and still no pain and no bleeding. can this be real? If its a dream, dont wake me. As far as the smell goes, well I was raised with parents who, when you got sick, put camphor oil up your nose, Vicks on your chest, mustard plaster on your back, ben gay and absorbene jr on aches and pains so this is just reminding me of the good old days. I like the smell. better than fish oil.I know one thing, I will never be without a tube of this in my medicine cabinet. Once again China has bailed us out!
