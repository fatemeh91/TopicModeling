review/text: Bought this because my usual choice (Method Smarty Dish) was out of stock. Enormous waste of time and money.Any dish that isn't essentially hand-washed before going in the machine comes out dirty. The tiniest fleck of food will hold on to any surface and must be removed beforehand.The gel also appears to not rinse that cleanly, either. Pretty much everything you eat off of the dishes after using this stuff will taste of lavender. There are certainly worse aromas to have around your food, but I'd rather have none at all.Avoid.
