review/text: I bought this when I was 8 months pregnant with my now 5 month old son. We used this for a week(if that!) and decided we didnt need it. We just used the bare changing pad and because its kinda cold we just layed a cloth diaper under the baby. Worked fine. This is a quality product though. Like I said I just dont think you should waste the money!
