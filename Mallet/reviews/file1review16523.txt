review/text: Gaia makes a consistent product, always fresh and reliable, and after trying many other similar blends, I have found this to be the best for me. In supplements some companies are better than others, and Gaia is one of the best. Their product will have the amount of extract as listed, always.I first learned about this product when a friend's oncologist recommended it to her, as an adjunct to her western medical treatment.This is just a fantastic product. I am using it to treat my ferret for cancer. It does not seem to completely cure it, but seems to arrest its growth. Ferrets are very prone to certain sorts of cancer, and I have used this for five ferrets, for both insulinoma and adrenal sarcoma, with great results. All of them have lived a normal life expectancy, and passed away from other causes. I have recommended it to several other pet owners with similar results. As with all treatment, earlier is better. It is very safe, and I have never seen any side affects. Keep in mind that dosage on label is for average of 180 lbs. and divide accordingly, can be diluted with purified water if desired.I give 2 weeks on, one week off, in a cycle. During the week off I administer golden-seal root/ echinacea blend. For my ferrets with adrenal disease I give melatonin drops added to each of the above dosages. Each dose is given 2X daily, mixed with a small amount of ferritone for palatability. Can be mixed with small amount of food, or soaked onto a dry treat.Having had opted for surgery on previous ferrets, only to have the cancer rapidly return, this is now my 1st line of defense, and administered at the 1st tell-tale sign of illness. I highly recommend it for anyone without access to a competent pet surgeon.
