review/text: This is my first electric shaver, so I can't say how it compares to others. However, I have to say that shaving as an experience is much better with the Braun Activator than with a traditional razor (I was using the Mach3). I'm just happy to be done with the mess of shaving cream and the cuts on my neck. There are still a few spots that don't get cut very close (particularly below/under the jaw) but I'm quite satisfied overall (especially since these spots were tough with the Mach3).
