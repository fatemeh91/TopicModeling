review/text: You can figure out your pH with this product but sometimes the color is splotchy and in between the numbers. It does the job well enough to know my salivas pH which is what I wanted. I liked that you could rip off what you needed instead of having pre-cut strips, but it doesn't rip that easily. I might buy this again but I am going to try another one and compare before purchasing this brand again.
