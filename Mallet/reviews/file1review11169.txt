review/text: I picked a box of this up several years ago when my 3 yr old had a terrible cold and was up night after night crying b/c her nose was too stuffy. Coughing so badly from post nasal drip she would cause herself to vomit. I was aprehensive at first using a spray decongestant on a young child...I know first hand how quickly you can become addicted to OTC nasal sprays unfortunatly. She absolutly hated the application of this stuff, but begged me to do the other side once she reazlied it actually worked.A year later, I was pregnant and got a terrible miserable cold and had nothing on hand, so I tried these drops and to my surprise they actually worked. Now, I know you shouldn't use things like this w/o consulting your OB to be sure, but I was desperate and close to the end of my pregnancy. If it could unplug my nose in a few minutes I'm sure it can quickly help a child.We have moved a few times since then and we lost the bottle or threw it out and now my oldest has a terrible cold keeping her up crying at night, nothing else is helping. She begged me for the nasal drops that worked, but I cannot find them in any stores around here anymore. Figured they were pulled from the shelves. I was so happy to see them on here, I know by the time they come, she will be hopefully over this cold, but I can keep them on hand for an emergency situation in the future.
