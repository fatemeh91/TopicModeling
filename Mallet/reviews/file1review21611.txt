review/text: My 6 month old had outgrown his infant bathtub and so I searched for something that would allow him to sit and play safely. I looked at bath seats and other tubs, but liked this one. We've kept it inflated since we got it (two months ago) and have not had a problem. It has a handy drain and a suction cup to hang it on the wall in between baths. It did have that strong plastic smell at first (like all blow up toys/pools), but I just aired it out for a few days before using it. My little guy loves it and I love not having to worry about the hard sides of the tub. Also not having to fill up the whole tub saves on the water bill!
