review/text: I have potty trained four kids now, and I wish this product was available earlier. Simply the best toilet seat out there.Top Two Reasons Why This Is The Best:1) It does not slide on the toilet like many of the other seats do. The kids don't feel like they are going to slide off the toilet.2) The potty "guard" in front is very effective for the boys. Many of the other toilet seats have a removeable guard, and the kids just pull it off and drop it in the toilet.
