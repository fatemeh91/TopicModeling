review/text: I love these vitamins. I started taking the larger-pill version which worked great but were sometimes hard for me to swallow. So I found this smaller-pill version and have had no problems at all. They make me feel great, too. I am taking prenatals right now and therefore am on hiatus with these, but my Husband is taking them and he loves them (this is a man who never took vitamins before and never liked to).This is a nice vitamin and I recommend it!
