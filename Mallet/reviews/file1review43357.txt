review/text: I purchased these at a local store because I REALLY want to improve the products used in my home and around my two toddlers. I'm always trying to keep on top of cleaning the house but at times the chemicals can feel overwhelming. I have to say these wipes are my new favorite thing. Sure you do need a bit more elbow grease than a traditional chemical based product but; ahhhh....it's nice to not feel as though my hands are losing layers of skin as I clean. AND ahhh...the fresh scent is much more pleasant than any artificial want to be fresh scent in an ordinary product. My bathroom sink has sparkled even days later. My granite counters gain a streak free shine. Even my kitchen table toddler messes stand up to Method. The best thing of all is my girls like to help clean but with other products I had to say no for fear of the chemicals with these it's all YES. Glad I finally tried Method and can't wait to try some of their other products. My home feels 'greener' already.
