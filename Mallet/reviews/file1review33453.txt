review/text: This is our second such device; the first one served us well for more than ten years. This replacement has a stiffer, less pliant hose. The motor seems to be stronger, pushing out a more vibrant and thinner stream of water, which, when inadvertently aimed at soft skin tissue, under the tongue for example, causes a degree of pain. The nozzle is located under the blue plastic container of water and we find it awkward to remove. The water tank is easy to use; we normally put in two small glasses of water and when we are done, we let the hose drop into the sink and the water left in the container drains out into the sink. We find that we are making less use of this model than we did of the previous one.
