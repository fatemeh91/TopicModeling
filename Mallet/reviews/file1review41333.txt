review/text: ... I decided to try the Extended Pleasures. Wow I think they worked a little too good, as I had trouble reaching climax. They have benzocane in them which makes you fairly numb, and I think that they're a little thicker than normal condoms. IMO they should have a touch less benzocane and be a little thinner.After you put it on you should wait a minute as it takes the benzocane about a minute to take full effect. Then go to town...
