review/text: I purchased this thermometer a couple of months back, and the first time I used it on my baby, it was LIGHTNING FAST, ...so fast, I didn't believe it. I don't even think my baby knew he had a rectal thermometer used on him! I would recommend this to all new parents for it's speed and ease of use.
