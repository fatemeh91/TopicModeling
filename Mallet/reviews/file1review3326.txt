review/text: Martek Labs supposedly processes the algae with the toxic, petro-chemical based hexane. Because no residue is left, they don't have to list it, but it's nasty stuff. Read the Cornucopia Institute's report on soy and see the reference to algae-based DHA. I'm trying to find other brands that don't use hexane.
