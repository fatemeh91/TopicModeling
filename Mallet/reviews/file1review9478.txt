review/text: I have used this a few times now and I am really impressed with how much and how easy it lathers up..you really do get ALOT of lather from just a small drop of cream. I say this is my #2 shaving cream because I also currently use the CO Bigelow /Proraso Brand shaving cream along with the Proraso pre-shave prep and that is my favorite simply because combining those two products together creates the closest shave ever and I tend to have sensitive skin and this keeps the burn at bay since it provides the cooling effect, I do not get ANY burn at all when using the Proraso. With the Truefitt Hill Ultimate Comfort cream, I still had just a little razor burn so that is why it gets bumped down to #2. IMO, you would be hard pressed to find a better shave cream...I wish I would have discovered the "old-school" shaving (brush & old-fashioned cream) years ago, my shaves have never been better or closer. To all of you dudes out there still shaving with the aerosal foam/gel cans, take a look at the ingredients and see what they put in that junk...no wonder it's only $4-5 dollars, and it's no wonder why that junk is horrible for your skin...No way I will ever go back to the cans again..Overall A+ shaving cream..
