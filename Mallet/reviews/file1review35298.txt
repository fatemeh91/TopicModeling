review/text: This is my second One Touch Electrolysis unit I've owned; the first lasted 20 years. Works just as advertised; however, the needles are very delicate as they should be and easy to bend--the problem with my first unit and I couldn't find replacements. If the user follows the instructions precisely so as not to irritate and scar, results are quite satisfactory. I am very pleased and will purchase another if necessary.
