review/text: I love this. There are so many good things to say about it. It is as all natural as you can get in a cleaning product, I like to clean and my dogs follow me around so I needed something that would be safe. It smells amazing, the mint it so light and refreshing and so much better than other glass cleaner smells. The best part it how great it works, I love it on all things shiny, and even my granite counter top. I use this first before polishing it, this cleaner gets all the gunk off, safely, and really adds shine to my counter tops. I love this stuff and it works so well! This is better than most other glass cleaners I have tried.
