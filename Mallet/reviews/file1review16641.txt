review/text: I bought this for my boyfriend after the other personalized one was stolen. (it was a one of a kind wiley e coyote pic on it) For the price of this engraved Zippo it really is a great deal! Someone will look pretty dumb holding a zippo saying, 'this zippo belongs to Stanley XXXX III, the best ever dad, boyfriend, and friend.' He loves it!
