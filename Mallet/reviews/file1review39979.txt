review/text: I was very disappointed because Gaia Herbs claims that the product is designed to support healthy thyroid functioning. But they fail to mention that it's only for those who have hypothyroidism. Since I have hyperthyroidism I experienced a very bad case of diarrhea, heart palpitations and anxiety attacks. It took me over a week to realize that all these symptoms were related to the supplement.
