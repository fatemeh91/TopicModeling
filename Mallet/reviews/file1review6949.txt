review/text: I purchased this massager as I have a few previously. As other reviewers have stated, this product comes a little under-powered. Like other massagers I've purchased I made some modifications to the internal pivet point of the arm and it enhanced the strength as desired :). I place a cut piece of rubber washer from a garden hose under the vibrating arm between the two fastening screws. Adjustments can be made by lossing one screw and tightening the other till the desired effect has been obtained.
