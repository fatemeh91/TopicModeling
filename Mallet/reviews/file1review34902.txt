review/text: I've tried one other brand of melatonin, 3mg, from a friend (which is why I can't remember the brand) but the "normal" vs. time released is a big difference. With the non-time released, I fall asleep fast, however I do wake up about 4 hours later. It is usually quite easy to fall back to sleep though. With this natrol timed release, it is about equally as effective at helping to fall asleep, without any interruption in the night. Yet I have more trouble waking up and feel considerably more groggy in the am. I've decided to switch back to non-timed release, but I still give this 4 stars as it does exactly what it says, the whole 8 hours of it. I am somewhat sensitive to caffeine so I think my reaction to this melatonin may reflect that, as the "tired" feeling can extend 9-10 hours after I fall asleep.
