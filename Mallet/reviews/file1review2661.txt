review/text: ive tried many lubes and would have to say that this lube is the best. the other lubes i tried get sticky after a while and make it uncomfortable to use. this lube stays soft and smooth no matter how long it stays out. the only thing i dont like about it is when you get lube on the outside its pretty slippery to hold, but i guess thats a positive note.
