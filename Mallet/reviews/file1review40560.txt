review/text: The box of 12 (plastic) bottles of Rinse Aid came with about a third of the bottles leaking/damaged, apparently from either poor packaging, packing or shipment. A replacement order was fulfilled swiftly at no cost (other than my trip to the post office), but seepage all over the packing box, as well as the outer Amazon box, once again forced a return for which I'm seeking a refund.
