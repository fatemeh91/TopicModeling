review/text: I've been using optimum nutrition gold standard double chocolate flavor for 4 years and simply put, it is great for me. I'm a 180 lb guy who works out a 4-6 times per week. I usually make a shake for breakfast with chocolate soy milk but have drank this brand with water and it dissolves well and doesn't have the terrible protein bitter after taste. I actually look forward to my morning shake because it's essentially a chocolate milk shake after adding some ice cubes.If you're an intense body-builder/sculptor there are leaner and more effective protein supplements available but for the work out to be active/look good/be healthy set who aren't as concerned with body fat % this stuff tastes amazing, is a great cost ($0.40) per serving, and gives you plenty of protein.
