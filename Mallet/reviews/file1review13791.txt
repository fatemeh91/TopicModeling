review/text: This is an outstanding product for its portability and ease of use. But the reason it does not get five stars is based on the fact I was led to believe that I would get a second one 'free.' Yeah, except for $13.98 shipping and handling! That is a heck of deal, huh? For a product that is about ten dollars? RIGHT!
