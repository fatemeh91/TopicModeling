review/text: This is the worst mop I have ever owned! I really expected better. Now I understand why the replacement sponges were in the closeout store. They are wonderful, if they would just stay on the handle. I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad. The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor. I give up on Mr Clean mop products.
