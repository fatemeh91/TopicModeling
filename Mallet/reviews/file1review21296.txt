review/text: I have had a sonicare in the past and was in the market for a new toothbrush. This one is very good. I like the 30 second stutter that happens as you brush. It makes brushing mindless and helped my boys know how long to brush each area. There is a high and low setting that was useful for the kids. One problem I had happend 2 weeks after the purchase. My oldest boy dropped the tooth brush in the sink and a corner broke off the bottom. Not to worry it still worked and charged. Then 3 months later I started having trouble with the vibration of the head. I think my boys were pressing too hard on their teeth. Now it does not vibrate at all and its useless. I can't really fault the tooth brush but...thought I should mention it.
