review/text: My two-year-old milk-lover's diaper often leaks overnight, so I tried this Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector, and the Blue Max waterproof bed pad. I put them under the sheet, and wash & dry them with the sheets. Both have been washed and dried about half a dozen times, and still look new. The only drawback I've noticed is that they don't stay perfectly flat against the mattress, but they're pretty close. I wanted a couple more, and I chose this one instead of the Blue Max, because of it's longer length. This longer pad comes to within a foot of the head and foot of the bed. Both are a good width for a twin bed. If you were buying this for an adult, the extra length might not matter as much as it does for a toddler who moves all around the bed.
