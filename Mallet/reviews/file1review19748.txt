review/text: Highly recommend this toilet seat, it's a little more pricey, but worth it. First bought the cheap kind and then ended up buying this seat anyways. The seat attaches easily to any toilet seat. Very sturdy, no sliding around or coming lose. I was finally convinced when I saw how excited the kids at the home daycare where to use it, I also purchased the matching step. My little girl is almost obsessed with potty training and we just leave the bathroom door open and she can use it herself with very little help. Of course we spend a lot of time reading books while she sitting on her throne, with great success by the way.
