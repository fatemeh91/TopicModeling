review/text: We had the Baby Bjorn LITTLE potty chair that sat on the floor and used this with our son from the time he was under a year old until about a week or so ago (when he turned two). It worked great for infant potty training, but he was getting big for it and we were having trouble with messes on the floor from misguided actions.This Baby Bjorn toilet ring works great! I love how it is adjustable. We have a round toilet seat and this adjusted easily to fit perfectly! It doesn't move around at all when it is in place on the seat. I have had NO trouble with his pee spraying out and making a mess, though I can see that IF he leaned back, the potential is there (but what chair is that NOT true about? Just teach him that this is not a lounge chair!).This seat is also great as it has encouraged our son's independence. He now wants to push the stool over to the toilet and climb up himself and try to do it all by himself. This seat was a good buy and worth the money.
