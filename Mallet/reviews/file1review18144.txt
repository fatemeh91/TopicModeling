review/text: This mask is very easy to wear. The way it is made allows you to "blink" even while wearing it. No pressure on your eyes. My hubby watches tv with the sound off. The light bothers me and prevents me from falling asleep. This mask works perfectly to block the flickering light, allowing me to snooze.
