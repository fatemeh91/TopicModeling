review/text: Although these pads are thick and may show thorough clothing, these are ideal for long-term nursing. I nursed for 1 year and never had a leak. I sometimes use disposable pads when I returned to work, and those always leaked after 4 hours. You save so much money if you buy 2 packs of these and wash them instead of buying disposables. I just wash them with the baby's clothes since I was always washing anyway.
