review/text: I ordered the Body Back Buddy over a month ago as a last resort for a lifetime of middle-back pain. I am in otherwise excellent shape...I run daily, do gymnastics, and lift heavy weights. With over 12 years in the active Army, I've deployed on combat tours, ruck-marched hundreds of miles, and jumped out of airplanes. Sometimes after exercise, I wouldn't be able to breathe deeply due to the middle-back pain, right under my shoulder blades. To get rid of the horrible pain, I tried everything: massage therapy, muscle-relaxer pills, stretching and even tennis balls in socks. Some would provide great relief for a day or two, but I felt the pain shortly thereafter. I read a book called the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, and it mentioned this type of device. I thought, "Why not? It can't put me in MORE pain, right?"The very first night after I received it in the mail, I used it just like the pictures showed. At first, the pressure was too almost too intense for me, but I kept at it for a few more minutes....all of a sudden, I felt this sort of "pop", and my back loosened up instantly! I was so excited, that I felt around my body for more "knots", and over the course of a couple weeks, have been pain-free! I still use it every couple days to rub out any tiny uncomfortable mini-knots that I feel forming, though.I fully recommend this product.
