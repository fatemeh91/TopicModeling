review/text: I have used this brush for years for cleaning my Vitamix Super 5000 Blender Container Blades. The bristles are flexible yet strong enough to withstand repeated assault from the very sharp stainless steel Vitamix Blades. Not a single bristle has been cut by the blades and those blades are really sharp. It works great for glass tumblers and smoothies cups too. It is durable and everlasting.
