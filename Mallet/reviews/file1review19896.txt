review/text: We just adopted 3 year old boy/girl twins and this seat is perfect for both of them. The adjustable dial makes it a tight fit on our toilet seat so the kids don't slide around. The "bump" in front is high enough to help everyone get seated just right and there's plastic that goes down into the toilet enough so no spraying comes out between our toilet seat and the actual toilet. We love this seat!
