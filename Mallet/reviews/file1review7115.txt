review/text: Shaver's on/off switch is defective on the inside of the main casing. Once plugged in it starts and stops intermittently. Also, it will not charge its battery at all. None of this is the seller's fault.Guess I'll try the Braun product instead if going to the trouble of sending the defective shaver back to the manufacturer.
