review/text: very good product for treating skin affected with skin fungus...I myself experienced some ringworm in some interesting places that looked just aweful. After continuted use of this product, I find it helps aid healing the skin and well worth the peace of mind it brings. The affected site returned to normal in about one week, and I am relieved.I highly recommend.Best Wishes to all,DL in NY
