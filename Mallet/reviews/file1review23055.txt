review/text: All I wanted was something that could quickly breeze over my carpets every couple days so I only have to drag the vacuum out once a week or so. This is it. I read a bunch of reviews first before I decided on this sweeper.I've worked a few places where we Hoky'd and I pretty much knew what to expect. I only bought this instead of a Hoky because it was cheaper.My only complaint is that it came in a box within a box within a box. So wasteful!Addressing other reviews:It does NOT do anything on floors. It's advertised as a CARPET sweeper. I wasn't surprised.Doesn't suck up like a vacuum so you have to go over an area a couple times. However, it works. It does NOT replace a vacuum.I just did all my carpets in the whole house and the handles never, not once fell out. I was pretty enthusiastic with the thing too. I'm not sure how people are putting this thing together, but you put a part of the handle inside the other and kind of twist to keep it in place. Mine wasn't even wobbly. I even was going over shag.Like I said, I wanted it to pick up stuff in between vacuuming. Mission accomplished. It even picks up kitty litter no problem.Affordable and super fast and easy to empty.I would recommend this in a second, but if you want it for something other than what I've described, it may not be for you.
