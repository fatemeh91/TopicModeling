review/text: My husband and I have been TTC for 2 yrs with no luck (yet) so after much research I decided to order Vitex. My cycles were anywhere between 35-40 days and I had little to no CM. I took it as directed last month and noticed 100% improvement in my CM and I ovulated on day 15 which is unheard of for me! So far, this cycle seems to be identical to last month which is awesome! I haven't gotten a BFP yet but it has helped regulate my cycle!
