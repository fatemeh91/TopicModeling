review/text: For at least a year now I have suffered terrible pms symtoms up to 2 weeks before my cycle including terrible bloating, breast tenderness, cramps, break outs, etc. It was horrible, and there seemed to be nothing that would help including seeing my regular dr, my gyn, you name it.I've been taking DIM plus for over a month, and low and behold, it's miracle!A week ago my period came and I barely had ANY of my usual symtoms this time. I was almost surprised when it arrived!Since my symtoms are normally pretty severe, I take 3 a day and increase to 4 a day when PMS time is upon me.Made a MAJOR difference in my life. This stuff is gold!
