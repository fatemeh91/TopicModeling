review/text: I have been wearing compression stockings following blood clots in my leg a year and a half ago. I could hardly bear the thought of those pantyhose for another summer. Lo and behold I found these - garter tops - no sticky silicone dots - and OPEN TOES. My toes can breathe in my sandals. Of course, you can tell they are compression stockings, but they are comfortable, so I do not care!!
