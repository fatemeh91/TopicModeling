review/text: My wife has cut my hair 4 times using the Andis cordless hair clipper kit. It works well and has held the charge for at least 1.5 hours so far. I do not suggest using either the straight comb (points are too sharp) or the scissors (too dull which pulls rather than cuts the hair). However, the clipper itself and the comb attachments all work as advertised. So far the kit has more than paid for itself since I save about $18 every time I use it.
