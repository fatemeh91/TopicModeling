review/text: I bought this brush to scrub the inside of my olive oil bottles. From the photo of it, I thought it was a smaller, narrower brush than it actually turned out to be. Unfortunately, it's too wide to fit through the openings of those olive oil bottles. However, it's a terrific brush, and I found a different, better use for it: it's fantastic for the daily cleaning of my pet bowls! Since the head of the brush is wide and round, it makes circular cleaning a breeze! Much easier than the flat brushes I have used for years for cleaning my dog and parrot bowls. I would have never considered it for pet bowls until I held it in my hands. Very satisfied!
