review/text: I love Truefitt & Hill shaving creams and this product is fantastic. It gives you a very smooth and comfortable shave with little to no irritation or razor burn. Plus you only need a small amount of this product for each shave, so it lasts a long time. My last one lasted over 8 months. I highly recommend this.
