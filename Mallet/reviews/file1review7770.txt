review/text: This brush is too stiff for general dish or glass cleaning. It's probably better at scrubbing. Holds very little soapy water in it's bristles, this can be an issue if your not cleaning something already immersed in soapy water. The bristles at the end of the brush don't stick out enough to clean in front of the brush, e.g. trying to clean the bottom of a blender. Very limited usefulness for me.
