review/text: On 11/24/2012 I compared the L-Protein amounts in my Whey protein supplements to the AMINO complete ingredient list. Big difference, the Whey has substantially more of everything I am interested in except L-Ornithine. I will be ordering L-Ornithine from NOW foods or another manufacturer. When I saw the other recent post indicating you would need 40 pills to do the job, I had a big laugh. That is exactly what I told my wife this morning. The higher dosages are what Dr. Oz is recommending for G.O.A.L., 2000 mg combined.
