review/text: Like the other users here, mine had limited battery capacity and after about 3 years was dead even after a charge. Opening it up, I expected to see more than the single AA rechargeable battery (and a very low milliwatt rating one at that). The Philips replacement battery is 6 dollars plus shipping.I replaced it with a generic AA rechargeable ($2.25) with 4 times the mw rating. Big improvement. I hate to throw stuff away without at least trying to fix it. This is a task anybody with a screwdriver and soldering gun can do.
