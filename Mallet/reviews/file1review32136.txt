review/text: I took up shaving with a blade again recently, and was looking for something beyond the normal shaving mug. This cup really did it for me, and I was enjoying it very much. I found that if I stuck the little cup with soap in the microwave for about 15 seconds, the soap would melt and re-congeal nicely. The only thing wanting was it didn't have a lid. I thought, 'OK, well I'll just sculpt one (I can do that).' So a few weeks of shaving, and I got more soap, and was really enjoying using my new kit, and... I knocked the shave cup off the counter, and it shattered into a dozen fragments. Sigh...Dont get me wrong, I loved the cup. Custom made, really beautiful, and worked great.I replaced it with one of those 4" porcelain custard cups (a deep one) from the cooking store, which cost me about three bucks. It works great too.
