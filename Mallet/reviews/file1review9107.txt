review/text: This product was first recommended to me by a physician friend about 15 years ago. I have been taking it ever since. I feel good when I take it. I am a very health conscious person and I take a variety of supplements; this is my favorite (although omega 3's are also very important). There are many greens products on the market; check the ingredient labels and you will see that Green Vibrance is the best. No, it won't cure your every health problem. No, it can't replace a healthy diet. Yes, it is a darn good supplement.
