review/text: We received this as a gift. We took it out of the box and put it together when we were doing our nursery. We tested it a couple of times and it worked fine. Now our baby girl is due anyday and it doesn't work. The gears inside are all jammed up so we can't even use it manually. We can't take it back because we don't have the box anymore and we received it as a gift so we don't have a receipt. We are just glad that we received it as a gift---and not wasted our own money on it.We are very upset that we didn't even get to use it.
