review/text: It has been one of the best products I have ever used for the prevention and/or the reduction of time with a cold or flu. Just take as directed at the first sign of symptoms. Easy to carry, great tasting. No drama, like shooting stuff up your nose, like it may occur with other homeopathic medicines. Try it, you'll like it!
