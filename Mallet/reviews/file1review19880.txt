review/text: I originally wanted this seat, but decided to try a cheaper model. It was awful. We have an elongated toilet and it slid all over. And it was puffy and thus horribly tall. It also had all sorts of parts that made it hard to clean. We immediately went back to get the Baby Bjorn and LOVE it! It fits perfectly on our elongated toilet and is a breeze to clean. I love the molded splash gaurd and the hanging handle. It's worth the extra money!! Also, we have the Baby Bjorn little potty and love that as well.
