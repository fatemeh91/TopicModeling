review/text: I highly recommend this product. I have used the same for many years on my laminate flooring and it doesa great job. Cleans and puts a shine on the floor. Easy to use. I just spray and clean with the pad andfinished. I started with this cleaner when I purchased my flooring 12 years ago and will continue to use.
