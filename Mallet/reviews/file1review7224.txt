review/text: My husband got this for me for my birthday. I have used it once and have really liked it. I am pregnant and frequently get sore feet. When I used it for the first time, my feet felt good after a long time. The water gets very warm and toasty which I love. It was a bit too much for my husband. But it easy to just turn the heat off. I love the little remote too. But you have to hold it close to the unit for it to work.The only con is that you cannot use any bath oils etc in this and hence I give it 4 stars.I would definitely recommend it !!
