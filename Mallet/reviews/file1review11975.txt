review/text: I got my wife these pills for an incredible deal, 90 pills for 10 bucks. That offer seems to have gone away but they're still an amazing bargain at $15 because of their quality. My wife started taking these and within a few days she told me that she feels more energy, feels cleaner, and feels an all around positive difference. We are not expecting, but these vitamins are doing a great job of keeping her healthy and preparing her body for when it happens.Now, to address concerns by other reviewers...The smell. I stuck my nose in the bottle and took a big whiff, these pills smell fine. They smell like plants pretty much, no wierd pungency or animal product rancidity, just herbal plantyness. Granted.. when pregnant smells get wierder.The size. These pills are the size of pills. Whoever said they were big must be used to tic tacs. When pregnant you might not feel like taking a pill, but you should do it anyway because it's good for you and baby.The taste. I havent taken one, cuz i'd feel silly doing that, but my wife has no complaints about taste.For price, purity, and effectiveness, I don't think you're going to find a better deal. Buy these, the 90 count seems to be the most vitamin for your dollar.
