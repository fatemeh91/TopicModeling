review/text: i'm still in the process of trying different low carb bars, but i'd have to say the atkins bars are the worst tasting. they taste like cardboard. blech! and all the flavors taste almost exactly the same. AVOID!! the only good thing is that they act as a great appetite suppressant. after eating one, im not hungry for HOURS!
