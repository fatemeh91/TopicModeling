review/text: I owned a previous version of this shaver that was very similar to image on this site. I lost the charger for my old Remington MB-45 so I decided to order a new one. What I received instead was the cheap black and grey version of the MB-200 shaver, which is available directly from Remington at half the price I paid on Amazon. Cheap and poor quality version of this shaver. From now on I make this purchase locally and in person so I know what I am buying. MB-45 is a quality product, but no longer available, MB-200 is a cheap, poor immitation.
