review/text: Have used this product for years and find that for me, it is the absolutely best way to floss effectively. My dental appts. are now favorable after years with gum disease. When my original Hummingbird broke and I realized that I could not find it in our drug stores, target, etc., I was truly distressed. However, I took a chance that Amazon might lead me in the right direction.My only complaint is that the refills are horrendously expensive.
