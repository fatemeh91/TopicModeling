review/text: I needed protein that was a good value and wanted to try something different than muscle milk or any of the other countless brands I have tried in the past. This fits the bill well. I take two scoops to get 48 grams of protein...I am a big guy at 6'2 and 250lbs....so 24 grams at one sitting is not going to cut it for me. I love the fact that it mixes very easily with a spoon or fork. The taste is neither good nor bad when mixed with water. Muscle milk tastes much MUCH better...but also has double the calories. This is perfect for what I need.
