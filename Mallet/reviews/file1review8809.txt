review/text: So I've been smoking since I was 13, which is about 8 years now. For my whole life I always had no energy, no attention span, no mental clarity, etc. I started taking this a little over a year ago. I kept smoking while I was taking it.Let me tell you right now, this is what you have been looking for. I got a .73 GPA in high school, and was failing out of college. With this, all of a sudden I could understand everything in my textbooks. I was shocked. I began reading everything I could get my hands on. I was waking up at 6 am every morning on time for class, jumping out of bed full of energy. I began doing 1 mile jogs every morning. I got straight A's and a B for the first time in my life. The mental clarity and physical energy this brought even allowed me to comprehend emotional issues I wasn't confronting. I was STILL SMOKING and eating crap during this time.Now I don't smoke, eat all organic, and drink this every morning. Vibrant Health, you have no idea how thankful I am to you people for making this. If I get rich once I'm out of college I will gladly donate to your company. Everyone NEEDS to know about this.Here's my morning shake:1 scoop green vibrance1/2 banana1 tbsp fish oil/cod liver oil (carlson's or norwegian naturals)1 scoop hemp or whey protein1 cup apple or grape juice
