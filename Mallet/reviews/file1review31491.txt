review/text: I received my .5 kit today, which I bought for solo backpacking. It's even smaller and lighter than I expected. Quality seems good. I'm quite pleased.The earliest expiration date on any of the medications is May 2011, about 14 months away. I'm not a doctor or anything, but those meds are probably OK to use for 2 or 3 years.They no longer use Aloksak bags; the bag is labeled "Dry Flex."There is a fair amount of room in the ripstop bag for other gear. I had no problem fitting an AMK Pocket Survival Pak inside. The waterproof bag is already pretty full, however.
