review/text: I used these wipes first to clean my kitchen. About halfway through, however, I kept smelling this gross, slightly nauseating scent. I thought it was our garbage, but after sniffing that, noticing no smell at all, and then taking it out just in case, the smell was still there. As I continued to clean it kept getting stronger and I wondered if a squirrel had gotten in and maybe died in the walls. I then itched my nose with my wrist and got a large whiff of the problem- the stupid wipes.Now, I don't know if this is a problem with some of them (like maybe they went bad on the shelf before I got them due to a lack of preservatives or chemicals) or if they just all smell rancid. But I would definitely go with something else if you want a "clean" scent.
