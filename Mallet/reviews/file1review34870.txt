review/text: Not Bad...Now to be honest I'm not a big fan of these cheap razor's but I like to try this stuff out once in a while.I cannot speak for others but my particular razor arrived shave ready so I think that these razors must be batch specials and some people are getting some razors sharper than others.But to be honest my first shave was far from perfect tho the razor arrived here quickly and in good condition.But frankly I had to smoothen the edge by carefully honing the blade on glass and then I stropped it 40 times but after that I got an acceptable shave.The flip side is the quality of the steel is poor and I have to re-sharpen the blade say every third shave as the steel will not retain its edge.I will probably keep this razor as a souvenir item and move on to a blade holder as that way I can get a really good close shave but I don't have to mess with hones or stropping or none of that.As it seems kinda silly to pay 100 or 200 dollars for a good straight razor and then you gotta pay say 40 or 50 bucks extra to get the blade honed right as it just defeats the purpose of a inexpensive shave.HOWEVER:Be careful especially if you are -BRAND NEW- to Straight Razors as this Razor isn't a KNIFE but a REAL razor period.Mine needed a good stropping to bring out a better edge on the blade but it was still sharp enough to cut me right out of the box and its real easy to give your self a good cut and possible even facial scaring if you are not 'REALLY CAREFUL' with these.Anyhow since my Razor needed 'Some Work' I wont recommend it as a shaving razor but I think it a fair 'practice razor' both to practice sharpening and to see if you really want to shave with one of these before you spend serious money.Personally I liked mine but they 'Are Sharp' so please use due caution!.Indiana ED
