review/text: I have had a really terrible immune system in the past, and I normally get sick several times a cold/flu season, last year I was sick the ENTIRE month of December with a cold, then bronchitis, almost to the point of pneumonia. I started taking these because I have an in home child care now, and I really can't AFFORD to get sick. I cannot tell you how this nips the sickness right in the bud. I am so convinced that I have begun taking 2 tablets a day so I just don't even get the inkling of being sick. I begun having cold/flu symptoms last Friday, tired, achy, freezing cold and shivery, and I downed six of these. Within three hours I had terrible garlic breath, but lost the foggy, achy, chilled feeling and felt at 100%. I really believe these played a huge part in that. This is a great value, and less than half the price of Whole Foods. I subscribed so my husband can start taking them too. Excited about my new immune system!
