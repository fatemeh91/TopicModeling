review/text: I'm on my feet a lot and have recently started to give me problems. After much research I found these low profile gel cups. They are extremely comfortable, don't slip around and are a lifesaver!! Going to buy more because I find myself switching them out into the shoes i'm wearing for that day. I wear a size 8/normal width shoe and they fit perfect.
