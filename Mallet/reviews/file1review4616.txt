review/text: I bought this on Amazon as it is not yet available here in India. The replacement cartridges they are very very expensive. (of course Amazon has it on sale right now, but they are still too expensive).As far as the shaving experience goes, it is absolutely fabulous. It is extremely smooth and saves time while shaving. The lube strip seems to wear out faster than the Mach 3, but I could be mistaken there as I've been using it for a a few days only now.Once a week I don't shave for a few days (weekends... one gets lazy) and the razor cuts through with ease, as if it were cutting through a days growth. Not only that, I used to have problems with hair getting stuck between the blades, whenever shaving after such an interval. with the Fusion it is not an issue. The hair washes off under the tap (means faucet for those who didn't understand "tap"), no struggling required.Expensive as it is (like other reviewers have observed as well), I'm not going back to the Mach 3 that I used earlier. and certainly never to the Sensor excel I used before that. No regrets at all.definitely definitely recommended...
