review/text: I receieved the Valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym, after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous. I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems. I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull-up, and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in. My advice, this product is poorly made and cheap. A complete waste of money. Go with something better, and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric.
