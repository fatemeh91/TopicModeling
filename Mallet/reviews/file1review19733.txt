review/text: My son was using $10 similar potty seat, but it collected so much urine when he went pee, and we were so tired of clean up by disassemble the parts and wipe inside as well as outside every time he went. So I started looking for another one that can be put on and off the toilet. I read a lot of reviews on this one and felt good about it, so I purchased. The potty trainer fits so well to our toilet and I was so happy about it. My son is very picky and hate changes, but when he saw this one, he rarely fussed about it and sat on almost right away. That itself was a big accomplishment, but when he went pee, it splashed and leak from sides of the center part even though he was leaning down and made mess. I was disappointed. Now he learned how to stand to go pee, so we don't use this for that anymore, but he still uses it to go poo. I think it is a great potty seat for girls. So I will keep it for my youngest daughter.
