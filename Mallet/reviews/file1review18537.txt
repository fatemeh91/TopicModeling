review/text: Great pen, very cost effective. A friend recently purchased a pricey MontBlanc and likes this Cross a little better. Good balance and weight, sturdy construction. I carry it everywhere, and use it when grade papers.Would cheerfuly order another, next time in fine point.I think a few of the apogee pens have stainless nib; I'd go for the 18K gold nib again. Steel nibs feel scratchy.
