review/text: I am troubled that this dietary supplement is being advertised as a treatment for psychological disorders. Any person that needs or would benefit from taking Lithium on a daily basis should have a prescription from a doctor and be monitored with blood tests.This product is not for the treatment of mental disorders as the description claims but instead is a dietary supplement for hypochondriacs. Do not be fooled into thinking this is the same Lithium Bicarbonate that you pickup at the pharmacy.
