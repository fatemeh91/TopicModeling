review/text: I have a binky thermometer that is a different brand then this one but it works the same. I bought it thinking it was a good way to take my son's temperature, but after trying to use it twice I realize I shouldn't have wasted the money on it. My son is used to latex binkies and the nipple on this thermometer is silicone so he didn't want to keep it in his mouth. It also took about 3 minutes to get a reading, not the 90 seconds the package tells you. You're far better off just getting a [$$$] rectal/oral one at your local pharmacy store.
