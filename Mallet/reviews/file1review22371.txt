review/text: I admit that while it wasnt a necessity, Ive enjoyed having this cover. When accidents happen, it completely soaks everything up and doesnt puddle onto my changing pad (I still do clean it though). It hasnt fallen apart in my washer and Ive already washed it many, many times. Baby likes that he doesnt have to be laid on a cold pastic-y surface when its time for a diaper change.
