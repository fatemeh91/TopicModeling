review/text: I don't think it works as well as it claims to, but it does work at least a little better than the other "natural" deodorants I've tried. I like it because it doesn't have much scent of its own. It's not true that one application will last for weeks or a month. I'm finding I need to apply it at least every few days. I'm curious to try the "Now" brand of underarm deodorant cream and see how it compares to Lavilin. I've ordered it so we'll see. I would buy this product again even though it doesn't work quite as well as it claims to.The one thing I am concerned about health-wise is the "micro" component. Supposedly nano-particles of ingredients like zinc oxide are carcinogenic. I'm not sure whether this product uses the nano form of zinc oxide or not.
