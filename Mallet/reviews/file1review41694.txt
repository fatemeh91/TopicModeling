review/text: Not bad but...(1) The handle is still way too slippery when brushing although it is less slippery than other Braun/Oral-B electric toothbrushes are.(2) The various features are mostly unnecessary gimmicks such as 2-minute timer vs professional timer. I found at least one feature which doesn't work despite the claims in the manual. No problem, the feature is useless anyway.
