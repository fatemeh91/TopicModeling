review/text: This is a great shaver. It gives a great close shave. It's the tool to use if your like me and suffer from razor bumps. I used to use a mach 3 turbo which gave me a pretty close shave and the bumps to match. They were completely gone after about 2 weeks of using the braun 8585. My only regret is waiting so long to by one.
