review/text: I have cystic acne, and this on top of some antibiotic ointment mixed with some zinc oxide cream does absolute wonders to either get rid of cysts before they are a problem, or at least hurry them up. After years of antibiotics that stop working, Accutane and homeopathic remedies... this isn't perfect but it has worked consistently for longer than any other treatment. I'm so thankful for Columbia powder
