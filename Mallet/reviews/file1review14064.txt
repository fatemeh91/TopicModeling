review/text: Unfortunately, this product does not work the way the picture implies. While this product is exactly what we were looking for, it doesn't have a strong enough infrastructure. As soon as you put items on the shelves, it sags and things fall out. Definitely returning and getting something plastic that can actually hold things.
