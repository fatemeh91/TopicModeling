review/text: I have never had anything work so well...almost too well.You have to be careful though: taking 4 will clear your bowels but like watery stools....and I am not kidding.But by the end of the day, you feel cleaned out...not quite like an actual colon-hydrotherapy cleanse, but pretty darn close.I would recommend this to anyone.
