review/text: With two kids and two dogs tracking dirt, grass, and leaves through the house every day my floors looked terrible a day after vacuuming. I bought the Bissel Sweeper to keep things tidy between vacuumings. It does a great job of that. I needed something that was quick and easy to use and worked on hard floors and carpet; this sweeper does it all and does it pretty well. It even gets a surprising amount of the dog hair off the carpet. I can make a quick run through the house while dinner's on and then only have to vacuum once a week.As an added bonus; I really like that there is no motor - I can sweep when the kids are asleep or I'm on the phone; and it cost less and should last longer than the powered versions.
