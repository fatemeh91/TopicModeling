review/text: I have struggled with irregularity for as long as I can remember. I started taking this two weeks ago, and I haven't felt this good in a long time. I didn't realize how much is affected by not being regular. I feel lighter and cleaner, and I have sooooo much more stamina and energy. I'm not a doctor, but here are some helpful hints when taking PHP:1. The directions say to start with 1 rounded teaspoon, but I recommend half of that to begin. I was a little bloated for the first week until my body adjusted to the powder. After that, I increased my dosage about 1/8 of a teaspoon every few days and am up to 2 teaspoons a day now. Don't be afraid to lighten up the dose until your body adjusts. It will work no matter what.2. Don't mix with water. It tastes like cardboard, so juice works better. I mix one teaspoon with 18 oz. of Crystal Light and I don't taste the powder at all. The label suggests at least 8 oz. of fluid, but I tripled that to kill the taste.3. And, use a reusable water bottle. This stuff settles if you let it sit for more than a minute, so you'll want to close it and shake it up every so often.I feel great and will definately order more!
