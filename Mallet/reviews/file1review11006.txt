review/text: As someone with many digestive issues, I have tried many different products over the years with mixed results. This one definitely belongs to the "better" category.I like the idea of adding greens, specifically chlorophyll to the regular food intake (never did care for neither could 'stomach' the wheat grass juice) and my whole digestive tract always feels lot better when I use this at least occasionally (I take many supplements and it's just hard to keep up with all of them on regular basis :).There is also Mint flavored version available, but has lot stronger and not very palatable kick to it, and does not feel nearly as good going down. This 'natural flavor' truly has pleasant natural taste and has been a welcome addition to my diet.One thing I would recommend is NOT to drink it straight. Dilute it into glass of water, or else it will stain your teeth pretty badly and only professional teeth cleaning will be able to whiten them back (regular brushing won't help). Took me a while before learning this lesson (my dentist thought I was drinking 'too much green tea' which I don't).
