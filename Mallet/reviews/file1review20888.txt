review/text: I have used a blade my entire life and i bought this razor expecting that it wouldn't shave as close as a blade. However, i expected it to be quicker/easier with less irritation. I have a pretty heavy beard and i have sensitive skin so i thought i would try this product to get away from some of the irritation of a blade. I WAS WRONG! It took me longer to shave with this and i had more razor burn/irritation than i do with a blade. The razor did okay on my face but on the jawlines and the neck it didn't cut a darn thing.Now after experimenting with almost everything i feel like i can tell you what the best shave is. If you want the best/quickest/least irriative/closest shave, this is what you need to do.first, the best blade is the Mach 3 Power, the other Mach 3's will do but the Mach 3 Power is the best. I tried gillete's new power fusion with 5 blades and it didn't even come close to the comfort and closeness of the Mach 3 Power.second, the best shaving cream is the Nivea Shaving Gel, i get the sensitive skin but any of them will do. Nivea is the thickest /creamiest lather you'll find.(make sure you shave after the shower when your face is hot and wet)
