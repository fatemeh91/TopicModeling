review/text: First of all the instructions are not very detailed. I had to look up better instructions on the companies website. After I finally got everything hooked up and tested as they did instruct, the machine didn't work. The line indicating active current would move, but there wasn't any current. Also, the tweezers wouldn't grab the hair no matter how hard you squeeze them. I am returning the whole thing to them as quickly as I can get them to give me a return authorization. I love amazon, but I will never buy anything from Shopemco again.
