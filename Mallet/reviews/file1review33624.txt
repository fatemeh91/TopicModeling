review/text: I have this unit, a WP-65C that just broke and a WP-65W and I prefer the 65 series for the following reasons.Pro1. Pressure is greater. Even though it is listed as lower, it is higher on both of my W65 units and allows me to really get into gum pockets where my wisdom teeth used to be.2. The tips stay in.3. The water reservoir is larger.4. Replacement heads are still available.Cons1. Slide switch can move too easily (I fixed this with a rubber band and may super glue the next handle on high).2. Hose broke. This was after years and replacement head with hose is available.3. Larger footprint on counter.4. Noisier than UltraI took my 65C unit apart after the hose broke and it is a very simple design.Could have been fixed parts I had if I hadn't broken the fitting on the head by using too much pressure.These devices are much better at cleaning the gum line plaque than floss by a long shot. I can even get stuff out from between my teeth after flossing so it seems like a no-brainer as far as dental hygiene (thank God for spell checker on that one...).Here is the Ultra model:Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser
