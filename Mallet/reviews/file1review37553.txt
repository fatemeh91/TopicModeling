review/text: Although Speedstick is a trusted brand it has given me severe rashes everytime I use it. I thought musk was a safe sent to use and for a while my body could handle that specific formula but when I changed to a different scent of deoderant my skin became discolored, irritated and broken. Even when the slightest amount is applied it stings my skin. I no longer use this product for such reason.
