review/text: Solgar Whey Protein is a very pleasant supplement that I'm confident recommending because:1) It's not nauseatingly sweet. The taste is very subtle. I've tried it with just water and another time with milk. If you are looking for something that tastes like a milkshake, I'd try Jay Robb Whey or put the Solgar in a blender with your favorite fruit and sweetener.2) Solgar Whey mixes and dissolves better than any whey I've tried to this point. It's nice to just see a little foam on the side of the glass after drinking instead of clumps of unmixed whey stuck to the sides of the glass.3) Like another reviewer noted, it's the only Whey Consumer Reports tested that didn't test for more than trace amounts of heavy metals. It's nice to know the stuff your drinking doesn't cause kidney problems. (On a side note, Consumer Reports only tested a few brands. They picked several from the same companies(BSN, EAS, and Monster Milk.)4) The Solgar Whey does a good job of curbing hunger cravings. Typically, I get really hungry at night as well as in the morning before breakfast. However, I feel full and really good long after drinking the Solgar Whey.5) They use a non-chemical extraction process for the whey.For the most part, I try to stick with Organic products. When I don't find a brand that I trust, I look to all natural products. Solgar is a brand I trust. For those interested in other supplements and vitamins, the brands I use and trust are New Chapter, Solaray, Jay Robb, Megafood, Standard Process, and Solgar.
