review/text: I love this product. It's the only one of its type that I have found that is relatively painless (after the initial 'exposure') and performs fairly consistently. I have continued to replace it over many years. The downside of this product is that it does have a finite lifespan, which is about 2 years. There are no replacement parts or service programs that I am aware of that do a good job. In other words, when I have had it serviced it does not return in tip top shape. I can tell that I've bought only a couple more months... long enough for me to replace it and receive the new one in the mail.LOVE this item!
