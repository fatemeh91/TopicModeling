review/text: The advertisement makes a person think that it will fit any bathtub faucet. It does not fit the typical square faucet. I ordered the sprayer and paid premium shipping to get it here after my wife broke her leg. After trying the adapter, it would not work. I had to find a different product to be able to help her bath.Jerry
