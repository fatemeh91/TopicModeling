review/text: Looks kind of funny, but there is a crazy amount of uses for this. Reaches anywhere!Takes some time to get use to and find the right knob.I found the best place to use it is in bed. This way, all your mussels are relaxed.I personally have to go to massage therapy every week to keep my back from pain. With this tool, I am able to get into places the therapist would normally work on. I get pain relief within minutes!I would recommend this to anyone who has chronic mussel pain.
