review/text: I have CMP and a bulging disc in my neck and pain is a constant companion, as is the numbness and tingling down my left arm. I tried heating pads, microwave heat noodles, rubs, creams and sprays, but none were as effective as this collar.I like this collar is light-weight and easy to heat. The velcro allows me to custom fit it to the contours of my neck It molds to my skin, applying heat to every nook and cranny.The only downside, is the length of time it stays warm, but they state in the paperwork that it will only retain heat for 20 mins or so. But that is twenty minutes I can walk around with the heat on. Then, it takes less than two minutes in the microwave to re-energize it.It isn't perfect, I would like it to stay warm longer, but it is what it is and it works. Lovely heat hugging my neck as I cook etc.
