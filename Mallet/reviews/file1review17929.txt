review/text: I know this microfiber cloth is stated as being a great lens cleaner, but for me it's a great universal cleaner! I mainly use my Spudz microfiber cloth to clean the touch screens of all my portable electronic devices.I own a Motorola Droid X smart phone, Apple Ipod Touch 4G, and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, and this little wonder can clean them all! And it does an outstanding job, especially on my Android tablet, which seems to attract finger prints like no other device I own. It can take more than pass wiping the touch glass. I do notice though that it seems to work the best if I use the moisture from my breath on the capacitive glass, right before I make a pass with the cloth.And as for the size, well it's perfect in my opinion. It easily covers and cleans my smart phone and ipod, and yet is still big enough to cover the 10.1 inch real estate on my tablet. Also, once you're bundled it up inside the little carry bag that it is attached to from the inside, I hardly notice I'm even carrying it in my pockets anymore. I would think it would be highly unobtrusive for any conceivable carry situation, from your pants pocket, purse, or just toss it in a backpack or laptop bag. Actually I found it to be much smaller than I thought it was going to be, by looking at the pictures on this page before I bought it. I would say it's not much bigger than a US quarter once it's wrapped up inside it's bag.Overall I'm very pleased with thus purchase. For a do-it-all lens/screen cleaner, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better alternative in a perfect, easily carried microfiber cloth.
