review/text: Hi,I don't understand the women reviewing this product. I love the smell and it is not that overpowering considering some perfumes that are out on the market. I have nasal problems and sneezing attacks with using perfumes that are overpowering and this doesn't affect my nose the way they do. I smell the scent when you put it on, but it fades after a while and is very subtle. I love this product and I continue to use it.
