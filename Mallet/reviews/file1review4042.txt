review/text: Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Packagemay not be the greatest value out there, but if you have aGillette Fusion Power Razor, Phantom, 1 razorthese refills are what you need. While I can understand that some accuse Gillette of a gimmick, I can say that these razor blades definitely do seem to shave closer than the Mach 3 version. So if it's a gimmick, then I too have been fooled.However, as it pertains to value there's no doubt that these come at a premium price. I was hesitant to accept it at first, but after using these refills for a while I am willing to accept the premium. Perhaps its because of the extra blades, but these refills seem to last longer than my Mach 3 ones did.I've also heard it said that Gillette manufactures refills to a lower qualtiy than the initial blades. Once again, I've been using mine for a long time and didn't experience that first hand. But be aware of this for yourself as you try these refills. That way you'll be able to report if I have been fooled about that too. :)I think this 8 cartridge pack will last me a LONG time. One word of advice, don't store them in your bathroom where the steam will degrade the blades before use. Store them in a dry pantry or somewhere else till use.Enjoy!
