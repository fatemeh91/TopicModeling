review/text: I was told by a natural/holistic healer to take elderberry juice concentrate to boost my immune system and it is supposed to be especially good for the resperatory system. I have been suffering from a chronic cough and so far it seems to have gotten less severe. I am only on my first bottle so haven't taken it long enough to get the full effects, but will continue to take this product. One bottle lasts for a whole month because you only need to use a tsp full every day because it is concentrated. It mixes real well with grape juice, 7-up, applesauce, even trickled over vanilla ice cream! This gentleman highly recommended this particular brand {Wyldewood Cellars} as the best he had found on the market, so I was thrilled to find it being sold by Amazon.com. It has a pleasant flavor, not bitter at all and is all natural. "Good stuff"Elderberry Juice Concentrate 12.5 fl. oz.
