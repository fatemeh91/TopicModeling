review/text: If you are seeking a good quality then do not expect that this will be the product to buy. For the cost you pay, it may be OK, but personally I prefer to pay some extra and get a better product like Dura-Stick II Electrotherapy Electrodes, it cost almost double, but defiantly it is much betterBeware that the adhesive conducting layer is not good at all and that will limit the number of times you use it.Also, the shipping price is so expensive - but it is also expensive on the other product I am suggesting to use.
