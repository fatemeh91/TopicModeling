review/text: Keep in mind this product is for severe dry eyes, not for folks who have occasional issues. That being said, this will make your vision blurry for a bit but does work pretty well and helps much better than drops. I do use this with drops. Oddly enough, when I bought the smaller tubes of the same product it stinged a bit when it went in my eyes, but this large (very large) tube does not. I am not sure why - whether I am used to it now or what. I do think this is useful and helpful for those who need some longer lubrication in the eye - for me it works for a couple of hours on cloudy days (you know how weather works on your eyes!)
