review/text: I'm not a fan of the using disposable things, but because these are very thin and I don't use them very often I think they're great. Tuck a few of these into your diaper bag and you will be ready for any messy eating occasion. Great for restaurants. My only issue is that they are easy for kids to pull off because the tiny Velcro fastener isn't very strong. And the "Stay-Open" pocket hasn't proven to be that useful. But they DO NOT LEAK; clothes stay nice and dry. They have a nice snug neck and they're a good size. Being able to throw them away is fabulous. I would also recommend them if you don't like having your bibs get stained with spaghetti stains.
