review/text: I have got to say, this protein is great in taste, value and overall quality. I used to be taking a GNC generic brand of whey, but this blows that by a thousand miles!Tried the French Vanilla Cream, must say it was awesome. I'm personally a vanilla lover and although at first it tasted different it was because the GNC one I was using wasn't as great! already ordered my second tub, this time Cookies and cream :)Cons: Its not really a con, just that it took me a good shake around to find the darn scoop. Was hiding all the way down the tub.
