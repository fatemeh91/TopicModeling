review/text: Its a plain ol' zippo lighter. Works as you would expect and the quality is great. Doesn't really differ than other zippos other than the color.The Orange is a nice bright hunters orange, but not florescent or pastel as some reviewer has said. I think the matte finish may have contributed to some thinking it looks somewhat pastel but it is very vibrant and I don't feel like it was painted with a 1992 orange..PROS:-Quality zippo-Color is greatCONS:-None
