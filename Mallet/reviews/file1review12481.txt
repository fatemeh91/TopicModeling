review/text: I bought Oxy Powder a couple of years ago as a colon cleanse, but really ended up using it as a stool softener when irregularity crept in. I used to have major issues with constipation and never found anything that brought relief without pain and diarrhea. However, Oxy Powder does just that. I rarely get constipated anymore since changing my diet and adding probiotics, but when I feel it creeping in, usually just one Oxy Powder will do the trick, with no side effects. I LOVE it.On a side note, my husband, who seems to be especially sensitive to any kind of product made for the intestines, goes running to the bathroom after taking just one pill. So, while it works VERY well for me, not so much for him.
