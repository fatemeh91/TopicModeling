review/text: The combination of this supplement and punctal plugs in my lower tear ducts has resulted in virtually no dry-eye! :D Each container contains a one-month supply (at least from what my doctor recommended), so it's not super-cheap for a supplement, but it has been working for me and I don't mind the cost too much.
