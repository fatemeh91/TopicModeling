review/text: These tweezers take out the shortest, tiniest of hairs. When paired with my 15x magnification mirror there is not a stray eyebrow that is safe from being plucked! Just be careful, I left it sitting out one day and accidentally punctured my finger with it, ouch! Some reviewers say they have difficulty pulling/grabbing hair with these tweezers, but I never have a problem - I think the trick is to hold the tweezers more parallel to your face and pull in the direction of hair growth.The price on amazon is really good too - I have seen it at big box stores for between $17 to $22, and currently on amazon it's only $11! If you have amazon prime you can get free shipping and save yourself the gas it would have taken to drive to the store, win-win!
