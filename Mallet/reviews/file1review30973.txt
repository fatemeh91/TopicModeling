review/text: I recently went back to taking Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM because of severe arthritic pain in my left knee that suddenly emerged. (I had stopped taking it about a year ago because of a major study that showed that Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MCM was not effective, but have since learned that this study was funded by Celebrex...anyway, that is another story.)I had been taking another Glucosamine supplement for about two months, as well as using Penetrex as a topical anti-inflammatory and doing PT exercises. My knee pain had lessened substantially. However, when I shifted to the Osteo Bi-Flex, my knee pain pretty much completely vanished...within three days! At first, I couldn't figure out what could have caused the improvement, but the only change I had made was shifting to the Osteo Bi-Flex, so I have to think that it made a real difference and surprisingly quickly. I'm definitely going to continue taking this indefinitely to hang on to the cartilage I have left. My orthopedic specialist says that Glucosamine effects are the placebo effect, but I don't think so. (Maybe he is receiving gifts from Celebrex). However, if this is the placebo effect, I'm all for it...no pain and no side effects (that I know of).
