review/text: Have been using this monitor for over two years. Has never given me any problem. I took it to my Dr.'s office to compare it to the Dr.'s equipment to check it's accuracy. It produced an accurate reading. I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend to anyone looking for an automatic BP reader.
