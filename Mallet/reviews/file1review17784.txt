review/text: I have used this product when necessary for the the last four years. I tried other things with my most recent cold and was dearly disappointed. This will allow you to sleep when dealing with nasal congestion and a sore throat. I have no idea what else actually will do that for me. Sudafed/Actifed are awesome for stopping the nasal flow, but they make me feel awake and jumpy and abnormal. This stuff, day or night, lets me cope with the occasional (Thank God!) cold I get. It makes my throat feel better and it helps me sleep. What else can a girl with a cold ask for? Best yet, it doesn't make my stomach sick. Clear the shelves and just give me this! And you, too! Feel better!
