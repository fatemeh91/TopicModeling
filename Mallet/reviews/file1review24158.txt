review/text: These feel great and do a great job if you can't afford a masseuse to work out your kinks. I had 2 issues that cause the downgrade to 4 stars. One is that the body back buddy is slightly too small for me. I am 6'1" with long arms and I feel a bit constricted using it. I think there is a larger model available and recommend anyone over 6 foot go for that instead. The other problem is that the end cap on the accumassage just pops off very easily. I'll probly wind up putting some epoxy in there to keep it on tite.
