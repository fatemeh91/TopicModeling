review/text: My husband has tried several deodorants over the years. Mitchum used to be his favorite but left white marks (and hard, non washable "gunk") on his T-shirts. I found out about Dry Idea and it has become his favorite deodorant! I use it as well, the unscented version is great for men and women alike. The gel version is also great.I buy a lot of products on Amazon, however I find their shipping fees on these products to be extremely high. If you buy several at a time you are better off buying them on ebay.
