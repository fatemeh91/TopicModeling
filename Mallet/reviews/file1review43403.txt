review/text: I am 6 months pregnant and have had pretty serious spd since about 4 months (where I have constant pain in my pubic bone area). I was desperate for something to help since I am a waitress at least 1 night a week and am on my feet more than I'd like to be. I was very skeptical at first thinking this would not help at all. However, I did notice a significant difference by wearing it.CONS: It is a little uncomfortable especially at first when you are trying to get used to it. It is a bummer that you do need to pin it to your bra depending on what type of shirt you are wearing.It would be nice if you could adjust the belly part of the strap of it. Also, it's pretty obnoxious getting in and out of it. Lastly, it's annoying to have to wash the bottom part that detaches by hand. Trust me...it's a must!PROS: It does help with the pain...which to me was all that mattered at this point. I do like that I can adjust the straps that go through your pubic area. I thought it would make my shoulders sore but it doesn't at all. I got the size that it recommended for me and it seems to be working fine. I agree that the tighter the better it will help. However, I am not in my 9th month so maybe I'll disagree then. :-)If you are in pain and want something to help and don't care
