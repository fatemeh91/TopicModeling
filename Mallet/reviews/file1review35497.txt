review/text: I mix this into my Whey protein shakes, and it works great. Much preferred over the name-brand label that adds sugar (sucrose) to their product.I also give it to my dog who's always had constipation issues. I just add some water to it to make it into a cream-of-wheat type texture, and mix it in her food. She loves it, and it works great for her, too.
