review/text: I liked the Degree deodorant. I think that it lived up to its claims. It kept me dry and clean smelling through a tough week. I've been using a more ""natural"" deodorant lately and noticed that it hasn't worked well. It was refreshing to go back to one that did the job it was supposed to. I'll buy Degree in the future depending on the price.
