review/text: I agree with the previous customer - these vitamins are the best. I've tried many other multi-vitamins, from supposedly, "great" companies but keep coming back to this one. For one, you only have to take one of them not 4 or 3 at each meal. What's more is they do not upset my stomach and usually a 'one a day' vitamin that has any worth at all, tends to upset my stomach. So, for me - it's a tried and true product.
