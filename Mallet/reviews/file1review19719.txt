review/text: I have a long toilet top at home and it fits perfect. I even Bring it with me to stores and it fits on those toilets to. I taught my son to push/move his privates downward so urine goes into the toilet, so there is no mess while sitting. Just FYI from another review. This item is sturdy, easy to clean and great to take with you when you are not at home.
