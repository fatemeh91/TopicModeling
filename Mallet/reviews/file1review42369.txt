review/text: I ve used hard wax since I am 15 years old, and this brand it's pretty decent quality, in comparison to argentine hard wax. I only get this when i run out of my argentine wax supply. I just wished they would make bigger pots. This size lasts enough to do my armpits, lip, and half leg twice a month.
