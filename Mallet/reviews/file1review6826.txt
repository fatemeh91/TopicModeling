review/text: I'm more than happy with this magnifier. The problem with a lot of these type of magnifiers, is that you get too much shadow from them which makes it hard to see whatever you're trying to look at. Not so with this one - the design of the base allows for a lot of light. One other thing I liked about this magnifier, is there are two holes/slots in the base of the unit, with allows you to slip a bit of string through them to make a loop where you can attach it to a lanyard.
