review/text: I have been doing step aerobics and running for many years and recently my heels started to hurt when I put weight on them. I ordered these heel cups and they relieved the pain almost immediately. I have been wearing them non stop, even around the house. The reason I deducted a star is because as other reviewers have noted, they tend to slip around. Next time I will purchase an entire insole and see if that stays put better.
