review/text: I can't really add anything more than what has already been written. I feel the flavor of the double rich chocolate is good enough. Not as good as a shake, but who would expect that? Definitely a good way to get the needed protien needed to grow muscle. I also don't get the "gas" attacks that I sometimes get from other protein that I have tried.
