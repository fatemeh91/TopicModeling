review/text: Description states that this is an invisible solid but is is not. It is a white, powder-based deodorant and it is most certainly visible upon first application. I made a poor choice to purchase this before reading all of the reviews. I read the top rated review which stated &#34;no white residue&#34; and thought I was in the clear (no pun intended).I used the deodorant once and it began clumping and flaking just as any common white stick will. I will not risk ruining countless shirts as similar deodorants have in the past. Buyer be warned. If you want an invisible stick, this is not it.
