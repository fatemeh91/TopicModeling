review/text: Getting ready to return this one, as it has yet to move an iota. The instructions are nonexistant, the iconography confusing, and everything but the highly-touted brass nozzles is made of paper-thin plastic. Is it so hard to make a sprinkler that waves back and forth... without fail? That used to be the norm, not the exception.
