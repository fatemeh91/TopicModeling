review/text: We all know ON gets consistently rated #1 whey, so thought I'd try for myself. The ingredients in this protein are good, i.e BCAA's, glutamine and whey blend, so it really comes down to taste. This double rich chocolate was delicious and mixed well. I had it with milk but think it will be pretty good with water too.
