review/text: This purchase just goes to show that you get what you pay for. Claiming to be a cutter for the 2000 Series Braun shaver, this cutter is too big and obviously not the product described. They also sent me 12 of them. ?? I have contacted the company and we'll see if they will take care of the issue. To add insult to future buyers it seems they have raised the price since I bought it as well. Caveat Emptor-Let the buyer beware!
