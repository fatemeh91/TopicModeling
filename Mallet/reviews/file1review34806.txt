review/text: I just gave this a try for the first time today and I am totally impressed with how soft my laundry was when it came out of the dryer, especially since I only used the soap, no fabric softeners or dryer sheets. The reason I gave this a four instead of a five was because I can't really smell the fragrance. I will definitely purchase again, maybe just use a dryer sheet to get a little more lavender scent.
