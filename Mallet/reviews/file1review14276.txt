review/text: love this product... have not had a problem with it not working. (perhaps prior reviewer has mineral buildup from hard water?). i found that an initial heavy cleaning using a magic eraser to remove soap scum buildup and other deposits, then regular use of this cleaner produces great results. i do have to do a manual cleaning about every other month, but this is just to get some horizontal surfaces where stuff can buildup, and to counteract the fact that i have three sons and a husband who all share one bathroom, yet i'm the only one who remembers to use the shower cleaner.
