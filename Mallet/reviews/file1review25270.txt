review/text: I bought two BA-151 replacement batteries that didn't fit until I removed the labels as the opening in the headphones would not accept the extra thickness. I was disappointed that the battery life in both batteries were about the same but only roughly two hours before needing a recharge. Don't know if the genuine Sennheiser battery would be any better but past reviews suggest that the short operating time might be typical.
