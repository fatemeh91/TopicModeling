review/text: I really liked that you only have to take it 1x a day. There is a dual pack available that contains an Omega 3 supplement with additional folic acid, so taken together, you get 1000mg of folic acid a day which is perfect for prenatal development. This was the only supplement I found that contained 1000mg of folic acid. The multi is vegan, the supplement is not. The supplement has an orange oil additive to prevent fishy tasting burps or reflux.
