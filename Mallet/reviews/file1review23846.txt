review/text: This little Waterpik does a great job! It has enough pressure (it is adjustable) to do what I wanted it to do. I just had nasal surgery and have an attachment given to me from my ENT. I use this Waterpik to flush my sinuses with saline and prevent scar tissue. The reservoir has just the right capasity to do both sides of my nostrils; easy to work, easy to clean. If you use it for teeth (which I haven't), this size would work just fine for one person at a time.
