review/text: I first used this deodorant when in Germany (as some of the other posters) and was not disappointed. It lasts a long time, has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering, and does not rub off on clothing. The only downside is that in the US the deodorant costs double what it does in Germany, but is still worth the price. I have gotten nothing but compliments when wearing it.
