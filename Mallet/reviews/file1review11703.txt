review/text: I add 3 tbsp of Happy Bellies Oatmeal to a bottle and shake it up for my toddler to have as a breakfast shake. He loves it and drinks it down everyday! I'm not wild about the sugar calories but I'll do anything to get the 240cal and a boost of fattening up into that wiry body! I will admit that this same 240 cal w/ fiber product is available @ Sam's Wholesale Club for $36 but w/ Amazon you do have the added convenience of saving time and gas from avoiding a physical trip out of the home.
