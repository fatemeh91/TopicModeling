review/text: I bought them for my kids to replace the usual bag of frozen peas that we use. I was hoping that, even frozen, these would be pliable so that you could shape the pack to the "boo boo". When you first take them out of the freezer they are hard as a rock. As they thaw, they soften a little, though and you can form them around the injury. One thing I love is that one side has fabric on it and the other side is plastic. So I don't have to wrap it in a towel to put it on my son's skin - we just put the fabric side against his skin and it works great. On the whole, I'd definitely buy them again.
