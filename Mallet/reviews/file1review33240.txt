review/text: This product is like putting a heated bean bag in a very loose oversized sock. It is NOT designed for walking nor standing. If used in bed, the bag WILL fall towards your heal, leaving your toes and top of your foot cold. The outer bootie will eventually fall down also. There is nothing to keep the bootie portion above your ankles. Overall this is a very poor design and a waste of time and money. You are better off buying a good pair of heavy socks, heating them with a blow dryer or putting them in a clothes dryer.
