review/text: This is my first trimmer... I mostly use it for trimming my french beard.I think this is very good if you have the right expectations.... its a trimmer, not a shaver.Plus not great at shaping/carving, but overall, a pretty decent trimmer... easy to clean and operate. It could have been a 4.5
