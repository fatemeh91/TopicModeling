review/text: I have sensitive skin and other anti-persperants make me itch after using them for a few days. Almay does not. I am also sensitive to scents (allergies)and the unscented feature is also a big plus for me. Almay controls perspiration and odor as well as anything I have ever used and my pits are not sticky after applying. Excellent product!
