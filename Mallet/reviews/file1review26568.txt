review/text: I love this cushion! It is lightweight and convenient to use. The elastic strap fits over the back of many chairs, keeping it from falling on the floor, which happens so often with other cushions. Since it is inflatable, it can be filled to suit the user, and conforms well to the back, and to shifting body position.
