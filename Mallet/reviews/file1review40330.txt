review/text: Several people told me that their kids were sick and there was a bug going around. I first was warned of the symptoms - sore throat, coughings, and fever. I was hopefully that I wouldn't get it, but I was realistic too. I knew I would be coming into contact with many of these people and also be in public places where they had been.Then a couple of days ago it began - I had a sore throat and began to cough. So like a flash of light, I remembered that I had this Gaia Quick Defense. I read the instructions which said to take 2 capsules, 5 times a day for 2 days. It seemed easy enough. I started that night. Woke up that next morning feeling sorta the same - not getting better or worse, which I thought was a good sign since many people got sick very quickly from what I had heard. That day I continued to take the other capsules as instructed along with lots of water. I never once took anytime off of work. But, I did use a neti pot to clear my sinuses. Otherwise this is all I took. Today is the end of the 20 capsules and I feel perfectly fine.I think I reacted at the perfect time before I got sick. The instructions said to take at the very onset / first signs of sickness - which I did. That may make a big difference compared to those that have been sick all day and getting worse. But, I feel great and am very happy with the results. Being skeptical at first, I am now a fan. I will get some more of these so that I have them on hand for next time.
