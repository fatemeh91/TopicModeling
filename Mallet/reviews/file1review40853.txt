review/text: Although it didn't drastically change my 4 1/2 year old sons behavior, it definitly took the "edge" off. I stopped giving it for 3 days, after 3 weeks on it, and noticed a difference as well as family and friends. Im also pairing this with "Nordic Naturals Children's DHA" a cod-liver oil suppl. that is known to balance behavior. I would definitly recommend this to a parent with a child who displays some signs of hyperactivity or who is somewhat oppositional.
