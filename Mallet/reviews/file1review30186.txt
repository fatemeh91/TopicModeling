review/text: I've gone through a lot of grommets... this is certainly an extremely well made grommet. The plastic is heavy and the insert spins with positive stops and snaps in solidly. Unfortunately, what I received is slightly different then what's pictured. Most notably is a smaller opening for wires, which is just a bit too small for what I need. Otherwise, it's a great piece.
