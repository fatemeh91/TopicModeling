review/text: Those who say these are the best TENS pads ever, I don't think they've ever used a good TENS pad to know better, 'cause these aren't the best, or even close to it. They aren't horrible, and they work okay the first couple of times, but after that, the gel really breaks down. For me, that wasn't a big deal, since I had some electrode gel on hand to use to re-gel them. I think for the hassle, and for the cost, I'd rather get something a little more expensive that work better and stick and gel better.Plus, I'm not sure what the black bag in the picture is, because the pads came in the mail in simple plastic bags, with no writing or anything else on them.
