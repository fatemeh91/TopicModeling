review/text: So I just finished my first 2 lb container of whey gold standard, double rich chocolate. I have to say it tastes GREAT, especially if you mix it with a banana and some peanut butter. Ordered my second one last night.I use a blender to mix my protein with milk, so I never have any problems with the mixing (although I haven't tried mixing it in a blender bottle where you shake it around, but I can't imagine it being much different).Whey protein is absorbed very quickly in the body, so this is the best protein for a post-workout shake. If you're having problems with the taste (which isn't bad at all in my opinion), just throw in a banana and two tablespoons of peanut butter.
