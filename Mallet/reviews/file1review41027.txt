review/text: These work great for 3rd shift workers who want to stay alert all night without getting so jittery they can't wind down when they get home in the morning. Thanks to big brother this product is no longer sold in the gas stations in Kentucky. They have no problem selling candy cigarettes to small children but when selling a product meant for adults to adults they seem to have no problem dictating their will. I order mine on-line now and save big on the bulk order. READ THE LABEL!! It says 2 servings on it several times, if you take more & get sick it your own damn fault.
