review/text: No kitchen should be without one of these. This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers. I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily. I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen. Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago.
