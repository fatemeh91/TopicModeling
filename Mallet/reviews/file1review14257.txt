review/text: This is a waste of money. We had bought this a while ago with the two refills. It does not cover your ENTIRE shower, it only hits the area where the cleaner streams to. The ONLY good thing about it is it smells nice.Have you seen the commercial? It shows a bunch of people cleaning at about face height. That is exactly where this system cleans. They don't show them cleaning near the floor and the cleaner doesn't go down that far.Please don't waste your money on this!
