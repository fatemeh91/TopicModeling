review/text: Funga Soap is a life saver! I had a severe case of jock itch that wasn't responding to any other treatments. I tried Lotrimin Ultra, Lotrimin spray powder, Zeosorb, and the generic over the counter creams. Nothing worked. Finally after nearing two months with this horrible rash, my wife ordered Funga Soap. After just one wash I could tell it was working and my rash was drying up after just one use. It may sting a little bit depending on where your rash is located but only for a few minutes. After that there is a cool, refreshing feeling that sooths. Two days later (two treatments per day) my rash and itching were gone. Why Funga Soap isn't in retail stores I'll never know. Funga Soap is amazing.
