review/text: These are great. They come exactly as described/pictured and hold a good amount of pills. It may not fit up to 25 pills unless they're small. I have a lot of supplements I need to take - medium sized capsules - and I still get them all in, closed securely, and without any "spills" in my purse. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient way to get their supplements/meds taken every day.
