review/text: It is what it is, as long as you expect something which looks, smells, and feels like a soft white shower curtain pillow case with a envelope style close. If you need (close--envelope closes are not water tight) to absolute water protection, this is probably what you need. If you don't need something quite so...dramatic...you should look elsewhere.
