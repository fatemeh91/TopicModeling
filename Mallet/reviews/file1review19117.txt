review/text: These strips really do offer the earliest response as to yes or no, however the result can be so very difficult to read that you might still be left wondering. Also, they do not come with instructions. They come with a website that you must visit to read the directions. I highly recommend printing the directions off and storing them with your unused test strips. It's a great deal for the money, however "First Response" test strips are so much easier to read, only take 2 days longer to use, and do not require you to have a cup on hand. These test strips are best done in the privacy of your own bathroom, as you will need a cup to do the test and you need 5 minutes. Don't read the results too soon, as you may have a false negative. They are perfect for the woman that is using an ovulation predictor kit and will therefore know what day she can reliably test on.
