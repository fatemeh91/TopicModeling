review/text: If you are looking to buy this to boost your milk supply for breastfeeding, it is definitely worth a try. With my first daughter, my milk started giving out when she was about 9 months. I would pump about 1/2 ounce combined. After taking the recommended dosage (check out the kellymom.com website recommendations: [...] ) for one day, it doubled my output the next day to 1 ounce of white gold. :) I never got my full supply back, but this definitely worked immediately. I have a friend who has been taking fenugreek regularly to maintain a very normal supply after hers dropped out when she got sick. Side effects do included that you start smelling like maple syrup and so might your baby. I didn't mind this! This is definitely worth a try before giving up breastfeeding, good luck!!
