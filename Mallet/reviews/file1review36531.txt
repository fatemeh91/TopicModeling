review/text: I have had System Jo products in the past that have been hit or miss. This one is a miss for me. It wears off quickly and leaves a sticky film everywhere. The biggest thing that annoys me is the fact that I could not find the ingredient list before purchasing. I am pretty strict about what I buy according to the ingredients. So for everyone out there, here is a list of INGREDIENTS: purified water, glycerin, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl paraben, propyl paraben. If I had known that this included parabens (a preservative that can cause allergic skin reactions and have been found to interrupt the endocrine system), I would not have purchased. Who wants to chance an allergic reaction on their genitals?!
