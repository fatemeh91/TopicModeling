review/text: I wanted to purchase the perfume but found I didn't have that much money to spare so I went for the perfumed lotion. I have to say that this lotion is a man - magnate! Every time I wear it, I get men running after me and telling me I smell so nice. It's so crazy that even my dad and my uncle both in different cities wondered what perfume I was wearing and started to sniff my wrist. The greatest thing is you only need a tiny dab behind your ears, neck and wrists and it lasts and lasts. I will purchase a few more soon.
