review/text: Though the knob sizes don't vary much the shapes and angles of the knobs provide a wealth of pressure points to address. Because of it's length, there's a variety of different leverages and pressures it can apply unlike the smaller implements. I've gotten the most relief using this implement, I highly reccommend it.
