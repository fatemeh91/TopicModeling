review/text: The product is awesome. I purchased a set of these for my dad because he was having joint problems in his knees. He needed some sort of support and weight redistribution. This product was the answer to all that. It allowed him to become more mobile for longer periods. It's amazing how a simple product like this can make a huge difference in his life. It's on the pricier side, but it well worth it. The only drawback that he has is that it takes a little getting use to.
