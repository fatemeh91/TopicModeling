review/text: I am a hiker and have a ball of foot problem on my right foot. I was looking for something to take the pressure off the front of my foot and thought these were worth a try. On first trying them I found them very uncomfortable, especially in my trail shows which have some of their own arch support. The pressure on the arch area, with the lowest insert, was more than I expected. I found that my hiking boots, with no arch support and with the original inserts removed, were tolerable with the walkfit so I decided to try wearing them. I started by wearing them to work, then for a short walk (about a mile) and gradually up to a longer hike (6 miles, significant elevation change). The walkfit was never comfortable, but it did take the pressure off the front of my foot by putting more of the weight on my arch. During the hike I developed a bruise on my arch and decided that these weren't for me.I think these could be a good option if the arch area had some padding and if the inserts were permanent so they stay in place.
