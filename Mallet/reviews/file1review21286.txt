review/text: I bought this to replace a worn out (dead battery) Oral-B 3d electric toothbrush. The Sonic seems much easier on my gums, and seems to be an effective cleaner. I'm not thrilled with the 30 sec timer (it stutters), but perhaps it's forcing me to brush longer. The sonic action really seems to get the toothpaste into all the nooks and crannies, but also (unfortunately) onto my shirt. You really have to make a conscious effort to keep your mouth closed, and even then toothpaste will inevitably leak out. I think the sonic action liquefies the paste much more than manual brushing. A great toothbrush overall.
