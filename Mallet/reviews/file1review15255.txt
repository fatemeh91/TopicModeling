review/text: Energy bars are a hard sell -- they're either too sweet or too dense or too grainy or too gooey -- you get the picture. These Balance Bars do a nice job of combining flavor with nutrients and energy. The interior of the bar is dense and chewy with a nice berry taste, although it's hard to taste the berries sometimes. The yogurt covering is a great touch -- delicious and not too sweet. My roommates are split on the bars, however. One roommate loves them and plans to take them in her purse for a quick snack whenever she needs an energy boost. The other roommate, however, hates the texture and can't imagine eating one again. Overall, these bars are surprisingly good for energy bars. Just remember that you're consuming a nutritional supplement and not a candy or granola bar.
