review/text: I feel like it is a big ripoff to keep buying new sponges and to have them come unglued after a few uses. I cannot believe that a company of this size cannot find a better solution to the problem. I also feel that you are taking peoples money by selling a good washer and then selling inferior sponges. Once you have the washer it is natural to buy refills, and by the time you figure out that the product is defective you have already thrown away the wrapper and have no recourse, but to not buy more.
