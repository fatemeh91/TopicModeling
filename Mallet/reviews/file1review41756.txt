review/text: I was disappointed after I began to use this and went for a checkup, the dentist said I wasn't cleaning good enough and when I had the sonicare, all good reports from the dentist. The carring case is nice and the set looks fancy. I don't even use the polishing mechanism because I can't find any polish...or maybe I am supposed to just use toothpaste?
