review/text: I like the design. I wouldn't trust it to be leak proof sideways in a gymn bag, but is generally well sealed. The biggest downside is the frozen inner core. It definately imparts a funny taste if you use it. Otherwise your drinks will taste fine. The lower portion has plenty enough room to hold a scoop of protein powder or recovery mix. The mixing blades are useful for standard mixes, but not that effective for protein drinks which tend to clump more.
