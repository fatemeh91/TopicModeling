review/text: we've gone through multiple cabinet locks, and I have found that they are either very difficult to install, or easily broken into by toddlers.This lock, though difficult to use at first, actually keeps my kids out. I don't use the acutal locking mechanism. I tighten the lock enough so that the kids can't get in, but loose enough so that I can slide the loop over the cabinet pull and get into the cabinet.By far, I think this is the most effective system, and nice because i don't have to drill holes into my cabinets.
