review/text: My number one product was Designer whey protein and this is the first time I use the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey. The tast is ok if you drink it with water or milk only. I choosed the dark choclate flavor so it's not sweet at all. I used to enjoy the designer taste better. As far as the results, I don't see it yet because I'm not consuming it on a regular basis but my friends got big and cut using it. The level of protein is higher in it than other protein shakes and the price is reasonable. I would recommend it for others.
