review/text: I bought this for sore muscles. Does not do a thing, like putting on regular hand lotion and works about the same on sore muscles. Did not do as advertised. I would not waste another dime on this product. I have tried other products that actually work, so I know the difference. Do yourself a favor, buy something else. Only good thing about this product is no one knows your using it due to lack of menthol smell.
