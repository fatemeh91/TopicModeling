review/text: It's true this handle doesn't really do much for anyone trying to enter or exit a car unless they have someone strong holding onto the car door, and that's probably not so good for the door. It has, however, been very useful to us in rounding corners, traveling over speed bumps or rough roads, etc. - especially since we use a swivel seat as well while traveling. Some cars come equipped with handles above the windows that would serve the same function, but ours does not. So this is very useful to us.
