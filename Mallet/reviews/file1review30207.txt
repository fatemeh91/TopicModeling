review/text: We've gone through several of these handhelds over the past 15 years or so. This is the best for sure. Great suction, decent cord length, easy to clean out the trash. All that plus its (as of 1/11/11) under $ 30! I highly recommend it. Whatever you decide, I urge you to stay away from anything with a Shark brand on it! We've owned 2 of those things and both were terrible (luckily for us one was a gift!). Both are in a landfill somewhere now.
