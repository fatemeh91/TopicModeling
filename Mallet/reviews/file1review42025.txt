review/text: I purchase what I thought would be the whole herb Balm of Gilead, to my surpise I received fifty capsule in a baggie with a stick on lable that said Balm of Gilead. Wow do I feel cheated. I spoke with the seller who was nice but did not seem to know how Amazon Market Place operates she state that I could have chose the herb I explained capsules where not mentioned at all in the advertisement, not to argue, I request a refund. from the time I place my order and received it has been about a week now I'm wondering how long will it take to get my money back (since I live in the same state) so that I can buy what I paid for. the advertisment also stated 2.1 oz well I'll be lucky it it 1/2 oz i'll be more careful next. I work to hard for my money to be cheat. P.S. How do I know what in those capsule since it not factory sealed. a baggie for real !!!!!!!!!!!! It ok to give to your family and friend in baggie but when you are paying top dollar a baggie just dont work for the general public. Ms. Galloway.
