review/text: I purchased this product because I was feeling the first signs of a cold or flu coming on. I didn't take it until the next morning when I really had developed symptoms and felt like crap (body aches, headache, painful coughs, weakness and dizziness.) I then started taking it as the directions suggest for "imbalance": 3 tablets every 3 hours. When I woke the second morning, instead of feeling even worse, like my typical colds, I actually felt better. If I had been taking this all along, I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten sick at all. This is a must for your medicine cabinet and preventative routine! Very effective even at healing/curing!
