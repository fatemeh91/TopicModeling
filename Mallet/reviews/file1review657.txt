review/text: This budget knife does a fairly good job at cutting bread,tomatos,roasts ect. The knife is light, features a sticky rubber handle and has a very thin blade. I expect a good year out of this knife before replacing. The knife is manufactured out of aus 6 steel (OK for the price) and is produced in Japan. I would probably spend more money next time and buy the F. Dick offset bread knife.F. Dick 7'' off Set Bread/ Utility Knife. Serrated Edge.If your a budget minded consumer that wants a good knife at a compelling price, made in JAPAN vs China, this might be for you. Kershaw offers a lifetime promise on all their cutlery and free sharpening for life, a good bonus for something at this price point
