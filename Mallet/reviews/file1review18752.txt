review/text: It pays to keep your clipper blades lubricated "after" you have cut hair and are preparing to store your clippers. Put a small amount of the Oster Clipper Blade Lube/Oil on the blades and then turn the clippers on for a few seconds to spread the oil over all the blade surface. The oil will cling to the surface and keep your blades from rusting or pitting until your ready to use the clippers again. The "lack" of lubrication allows the blades to pit and/or rust, causing the blades to pull or pinch the hair on your next hair clipping procedure. The bottle has a large quantity of Lube/Oil at a very reasonable price. Protect your clipper investment.
