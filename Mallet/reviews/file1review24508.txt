review/text: I purchased the FootSmart Gel Cushion for my mother. She had a botched surgery several years ago and has minimal padding on that part of her foot. She told me these have been the best invention since sliced bread. They stay in place and do not slip around like other remedies she has tried. She cleans them daily and they still maintain the ability to stick in place. I'm so glad I found them for her and give it all five stars!
