review/text: MY MOTHER USED THIS FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER! IF YOU HAVE ANY OPEN WOUNDS, ARE A BURN VICTIM OR HAVE BLOODY SORE SKIN FROM FECAL MATTER AROUND YOUR "STOMA" DUE TO BEING AN OSTOMY PATIENT, YOU WILL FIND THIS SOLUTION ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS FOR CLEANING YOUR SKIN! USING A WASH CLOTH AND SOAP AND WATER ON SEVERE OPEN WOUNDS CAN BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL. USING THIS SALINE, YOU JUST LET IT DRIP ONTO THE AREA AND LET IT DRY. IT CLEANS THE AREA EXTREMELY WELL AND DOES IT WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DISCOMFORT AS POSSIBLE! CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT!
