review/text: Ok this stuff is terrible. These reviews have to be fake. Like other reviewers have noted, because the wart medicine is mixed into the chapstick like material of this stick, it makes it completely useless. Also its hard to really target just the wart since the stick is so big. You are much better off doing what I did and buying Compound W which is a gel and extremely powerful. I'm having much better success with it. You get what you pay for.
