review/text: Not sure why taste is a factor...I think it tastes healthy. I mix one scoop of Perfect Food with one scoop of vanilla flavored protein mix and eight ounces of water. You're drinking a full days supply of vegetables in one shot. Not much to ask for increased health and assistance in staving off disease! I've used all sorts of "health foods" over the years and I can honestly say that this is the first time I feel real, positive effects.
