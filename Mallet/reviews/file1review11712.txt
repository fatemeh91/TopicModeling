review/text: My kid doesn't want to eat anything. So my friend suggested to get Pediasure for all the vitamin content that it has. It seems to work, but because it's so sweet and resembles by taste melted ice cream, now it's the only thing my kid would eat. I guess it's a lesser evil. He loves it. I just wish they offered it in a variety pack.
