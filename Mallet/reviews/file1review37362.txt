review/text: I had never epilated before I bought this gadget, but I was *so sick* of shaving. My skin is pretty sensitive so I always have razor burn, which made me just want to wear pants all the time to avoid the razor!The first time I used the Silk Epil, I will confess, was pretty painful (I had never waxed my legs before, mostly because I am a wimp). I got out my favorite movie and watched it to distract myself for as long as I could stand to epilate. It took me several days of short episodes to complete the whole process--BUT the first time on each leg was the worst (taking ibuprofen beforehand helped). I think it had to do with the density of hair; once I went back and started "cleaning up" rather than doing the whole leg at once, it was much, much less painful--just a little pulling. And oh, the hairlessness! It's a wonderful thing, especially when it lasts for a few weeks.There have been mixed reviews about the pain-relieving head; I really like it. The longer I keep the epilator in continuous contact with my skin, the more it helps. Also, I like the razor head; I haven't been brave enough yet to try epilating near the bikini line, but the razor head shaves satisfactorily without giving me razor burn.I will definitely be recommending this item to friends!
