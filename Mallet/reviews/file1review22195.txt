review/text: I go through lunch boxes like these a lot. So throwing them away doesn't break my heart. My wife has a tendency to leave them at work with food in them and the box gets the foul stench inbeded in it almost impossible to get out. So to the trash it goes. What I noticed with these is after one or two uses the lids were not fitting on. The product it self only has a few uses regardless any carelessness. These are still too expensive for only getting a few good uses out of. Considering these are hand washed, and have not been in a dishwasher dry cycle I never imagined the lids to warp as the did.
