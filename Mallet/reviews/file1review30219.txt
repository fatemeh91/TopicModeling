review/text: I cannot begin to explain what a complete and total rip off this product is. The pieces won't stay together, the suction is subpar, it falls apart if you look at it. Having experienced Black and Decker "quality" before, I should have known that this would be their standard substandard, but other reviews convinced me that maybe B&D; had turned around.They haven't. It's un-usable if you want to use the rotating head. I'm sure if you're just using the handheld part, and don't want the rotor brush, that it picks up crumbs just fine, but as a pet hair vac, it's pointless. It's heavy enough that I bruised the bejebus out of my foot when it fell apart and fell on my foot.It's loud, it's low quality, and a better use of your $30 would be to set it on fire to see the pretty colors. After multiple attempts to fix their design flaws, including duct taping the pieces together, I've just put it in the charity box.Avoid this waste of cash. Seriously.
