review/text: I can't stand the taste of Metamucil so I decided to try this out. As advertised, I can't taste it at all but my Wife says she can. The water is definitely clear and not gritty.I don't think it's as effective as Metamucil but it also doesn't make me gag so I say it's the winner. Take this and eat one or two Kashi bars per day and you're golden.
