review/text: i purchased this product not for human consumption, but for use with my dairy goat herd. I have seen the results in just a very short time. Hoof problems are starting to disappear and I haven't had a single doe experience any problems kidding and no white muscle disease in my kids.Next time, I will purchase a case of it.
