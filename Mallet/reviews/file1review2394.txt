review/text: I have been on a quest to find the best lube I've tried Wet, Wet light, Wet platnium, Gun oil, swiss navy, Liquid silk, Astroglide, ID Millenium, to name a few. None of them hold a candle to Pjur bodyglide. It works better, last longer and gives superior lubrication for a consideraly longer period without reapplication. very little goes a very long way. Cleans up with soap and water. I highly recommend this product.
