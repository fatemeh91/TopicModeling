review/text: Pros:-Small-Great stats (high in protein and calories relative in size)-The Chocolate and Mocha Chip tastes Great-No chalky tasteCons:-Fiance thinks they taste awefulBefore I bought this product I always thought Balance bars were low in protein and just a womans meal supplement. Well, now they are my main protein bars and eat them all the time between meals when I am hungry.I would give these a 5 star, best nutritional/protein bars I have ever tried. No chalky taste, very smooth texture (overly smooth compared to others) however, the fiance hated them. Not sure why, but she could not even eat them, however, she loves the Cliff bar brand.
