review/text: This blood pressure monitor works very well. This is the 2nd Omron BP monitor we've purchased, the first one was very similar (about 6 years ago), and the display on it recently died. I checked with Omron about repair, and since that particular model had been discontinued, my only option was to purchase a new one. I did a lot of research deciding whether to get the arm cuff model again or a wrist cuff, and decided on this one. It's very easy to use, has a nice display, and is very accurate. Also a great price!
