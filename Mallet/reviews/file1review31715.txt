review/text: I purchased this in an effort to reduce my blood pressure. I closely monitor it and it has read lower for the last few weeks by as much as 10 points in both the upper and lower numbers. Of course this may just be how it affects me, but its a small capsule which is easy to take and has not had any side effects whatsoever.
