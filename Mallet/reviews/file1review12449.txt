review/text: I have tried all sorts of night splints and this is the easiest to put on and the most comfortable to sleep in. It keeps the foot at a very comfortable angle, but doesn't have any means to change the angle. Just keeping my foot in position while I watch TV or sleep has made such a difference. It has an open bottom and you can walk around the house with it on. I do stretching exercises and this keeps the tendons and muscles from shrinking back afterwards.
