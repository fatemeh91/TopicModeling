review/text: Reminiscent of the woodsy, pine aroma worn by the great woodsmen of late 19th century Pacific Northwest, this elusively alluring scent is as close to the Platonic ideal of manscent one can reasonably get. Four ounces of fluid fragrance freedom, and it's only a spray away! You want depth? You got it: It's got low notes, middle notes, top notes, a whole spectrum of notes!, and it will bring your natural musk to new levels of masculinity. Have a nemesis? Summon his most ignoble fetor in face of your favorable funk. Hell, apply it in all your pulse points (hint: behind yo' knees, etcetera...) and have a party! Buy a cake, maybe with a little lumberlady [sic] stowed inside? Your lumberfriends [sic] will love you! Just make sure you spray this scent before you spray anything else. (Might as well give a lil' spray to the guys too. Who knows? Maybe they need a good whiff more than you!) Can't recommend this spunky spritzer enough. It's a bull market for good smellin' confidence and a bear-ova-one for stank! Just be sure you order in bulk: gotta make that shipping worth it ;-)If this company were public, I'd invest the bank. Buy this stuff. It's dank.
