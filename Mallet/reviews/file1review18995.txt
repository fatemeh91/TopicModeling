review/text: I use Benefiber EVERY DAY. Since the shortage I've looked for it everywhere (like everyone else).The people selling it here are being greedy!! I just paid $15 for the CVS brand "Easy Fiber" 125 servings, which I've been using for a few months now and I cannot tell a difference. I am VERY picky about texture/taste and this, like the Benefiber, is colorless and tasteless and textureless. Don't get ripped off!
