review/text: For my first pregnancy, I used the Twin Lab pre-natal vitamins (which aren't bad as far as "content"), but they made my stomach extremely uneasy and sometimes almost to the point of either vomiting and/or passing out. These, though, are absolutely amazing for ease-of-use and being all-natural is a HUGE PLUS (as we are moving to organic, as much as possible). It's truly unique that you don't have to take "with" food, but rather either before or during a meal. Fantastic product and love the larger bottle (great value). I am an avid researcher on products, bargains, etc. and this is the BEST; hands-down, you need not look any further. Enjoy and best of luck to anyone who is "trying" like we are! Blessings!
