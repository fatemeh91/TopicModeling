review/text: The Almond Brownie bar was OK. The taste was just as good as any other power-type bar that I've tried. But it wasn't something that I'd crave. I expected it to provide me with more energy, kind of like taking a vitamin. Perhaps not that day, but the next. To be honest, I didn't notice much difference in my level of energy. With the price that they charge for purchasing a power bar, I don't think I'd recommend it to friends and family. I do think that I may purchase them again for myself though.
