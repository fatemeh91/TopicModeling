review/text: We just returned from a 23 day trip around the world, focusing on China and Korea. I bought this at a luggage store and wasn't sure if it would work well or not. I loved it! I ironed maybe one or two times just because there was an iron set up already, but other than that, we would pull clothes out, spray it on and follow the directions. I am searching it now to buy more since we travel quite a bit. Definitely a great product!
