review/text: Some reviewers mention light coming in around the nose (something I haven't experienced) and pressure on the back of their heads from the thick velcro (something I haven't noticed). I'm worn my Bucky Blinks on every flight, many camping trips, and several weeks of mornings (between old and new blinds), and found them perfectly comfortable, light, unobtrusive, darkening, fresh... Others made my eyes or face sweat, pressed against my eyelids, scraped against my ears... these are perfect in every way!But if you've got a larger-than-average proboscis, or a highly sensitive head, you may need to darken your space in other ways.
