review/text: Lets' face it; sometimes the price of an item will tell you the quality. I am used to buying $15-$20 tweezers but I thought I would buy the Luma Tweeze Pro as I need another pair of tweezers. Well, its BAD, not worth it.1. They are not sharp. I tried to sharpen them but because they are made of a cheaper metal, they can't be sharpen well.2. LED light, the light is blocked by the tweezers when you get close to your eyebrow.3. Magnifier glass gets on your way as you must to keep the tweezers in a specific place in order to use it.4. "Grabs even the finest Hairs" yeah, whatever.5. You have a 60 day limited warranty but you have to pay $ 5.99.6. After 20 minutes, my fingers were killing as I tried hard to use them.Good brand tweezers can be sharpen few times before they wear out. These, I bought them today; they are already in my garbage can.
