review/text: I bought this for my father who has recently been put on regular medication. He is a very active businessman but tends to get focused and forget to take his pills so I thought this might help. It has. The E-Pill Cube is not exactly the coolest looking thing, but it is loud and easily concealable. The compartments may be removed to make it smaller, for example, so it will fit in a desk drawer or a briefcase. It is also very easy to use, which may be a factor for older folks or people with arthritis. If E-Pill came out with something that didn't look so institutional, I would give them five stars, but this thing is just too ugly, even though it works.
