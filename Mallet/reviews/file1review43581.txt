review/text: We bought this blood pressure monitor about a month ago. It has been working properly as far as we know. There are some fluctuation with the readings. The first time reading is high, the second lower and then fluctuates. But I am not sure if this is due to the monitor or rather the natural blood pressure fluctuations.Anyway, we are satisfied with the machine.
