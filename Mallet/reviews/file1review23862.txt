review/text: My first purchase of a Bay Rum aftershave. This one is very light with just a subtle smell of spice more than rum. Does not sting and goes on very smooth and cool. Can tell there is some moisturizing effect due to the witch hazel. All organic ingredients and is Vegan with no animal testing. Produced in Tampa Florida. Overall a good light aftershave for daily use. Scent actually lasts a long time at least four hours or so which is quite good for an aftershave.
