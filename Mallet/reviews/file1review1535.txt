review/text: I have to admit, after trying an array of OTC products to get rid of my son's wart with no success, I was skeptical about paying for another. And it was just by chance that I happened upon a review on amazon for this product saying I needed to give it a try that they had found success where they hadn't before....so I gave it a try.After one week of application of every night- my son's wart is completely gone. Day 1 and 2 we didn't notice any change. But day 3- a major portion fell off completely. (The wart was the size of a pencil erasure.) Day 4 and 5 you could tell the day after that it was affecting the deeper potrion(core) of the wart, and by day 8 you couldn't even tell anything had even been there.I recommend this for anyone who has a stubborn wart- it work! You just have to stick with it.It comes in a convinient size no mess stick (Like chapstick) that lets you apply directly and sticks to where you rub it on. In our case we did cover up the wart with a bandaid- just so he wouldn't get the medicine on carpet, upholstery, ect. ect.-I wish I had started with this first! But in the end it save a trip/and money to the dermatologist!
