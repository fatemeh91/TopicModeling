review/text: Only one gripe but it seems to be making itself more and more apparent to me. The batteries rattle around inside the body of the Stylus and the feel completely changes. I had been using Radio Shack batteries prior and never even thought about fitment because it was never a problem. Won't be purchasing these again. I plan on keeping the remaining three as a backup set.
