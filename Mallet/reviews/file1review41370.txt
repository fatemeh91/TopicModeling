review/text: If you have feet problems and need a good insert, these are worth trying out. Fairly inexpensive, they haven't warn out and they make your feet feel much better. I was diagnosed with Morton's Neuroma and plantar fasciitis. Both hurt like heck. After I had the podiatrist make me a fancy pair of inserts only to find that my feet didn't respond well to them, she recommended Superfeet! Best investment for my feet.
