review/text: Maybe I misunderstood what these do. It makes me eat... a lot. Also, these caps are HUGE and the serving size is between 4-6/day. That is a lot. I already take about 12 vitamins a day (necessity, due to gastric bypass), I can't add any more.The main reason I did not like them is because when I take them, I eat a lot; they make me hungry.
