review/text: At first I loved this big fellow but, it is very difficult to keep it lubed and it requires tons of lube. Even my own lube from the G-spot is not enough. I tried the g-spot lube since bottled lube is not enough but, still it is not enough. I tried petroleum jelly and that made it worse. The material is just not conducive for play for more than a minute. Maybe I can sell it used on Ebay. LOL Karen
