review/text: This is a powerful caffeine product that beats energy drinks. I don't need to lose weight and haven't lost any while using this product. Taking it before meals is what triggers the weight loss. For energy you can just take one or two with a glass of water. I use it to get through tough days at work and it definitely makes me work harder and faster. I would advise that you start out with just one pill regardless of what your goals are. You need to see how you react to this stuff because too much will make you feel sick. Also be sure to drink water. Once your body gets used to the high amount of caffeine you can work your way up to two pills at a time.
