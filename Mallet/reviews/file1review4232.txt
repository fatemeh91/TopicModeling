review/text: These are pretty good blades... let's face it, they get the job done.Some people say they're costly, and I agree they're not cheap, but neither is buying an electric razor. Sure, you may be able to buy one for $30, but look at the reviews... usually they suck. Sometimes you pay over $100 for a good one, and even some of those aren't that great.If you buy these on Amazon, they're much more affordable. I still agree they're somewhat overpriced, but they work pretty well, and I don't cut myself much. The life-prolonging tip on the other review sounds great as well, though I haven't tried it yet.
