review/text: In the years of youth the human body abundantly produces a special water-gelling molecule called HA that is largely responsible for producing these visible signs of youthfulness. That is because HA, a key component of collagen, is the body's natural "space-filling" molecule... ~Bill Sardi, researcher and authorAfter using a Hyaluronic Acid face cream by Derma E on a daily basis, I took a second look in the mirror and my skin was literally "plumper" as if it was more hydrated and healthy.I have also started buying the Solaray Hyaluronic Acid as a dietary supplement after reading about people in Japan who eat a sticky gelatinous root vegetable instead of rice have smooth skin, flexible joints and full heads of hair even when they are quite old. Researchers have finally concluded that they have unusually high levels of hyaluronic acid in their bodies.Each capsule contains 20 mg of Hyaluronic Acid and 50 mg of Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid). These are "enteric coated" capsules so they survive the stomach.Also look for Pycnogenol and the All One Protein Powders, especially the Antioxidant blend.You might also want to look for the Derma E products:Microdermabrasion Scrub - Salon Quality exfoliation right in your own home!Astazanthin and Pycnogenol Age-Defying Moisturizing Cr&egrave;me~The Rebecca Review
