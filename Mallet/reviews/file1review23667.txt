review/text: If you need Extra-Large latex gloves, these are excellent quality. The one-size-fits-all don't! My husband uses these for gardening and other heavy-duty cleaning chores. They could last for more than one job, but once he takes them off, they can't be easily put on again. These are a bit more expensive than the one-size, but they're worth the price!
