review/text: I started taking these for minor ailments, which were prescribed by myself from personal research. I have to say that when I take multivitamins I feel better and this seperate C vitamin and bioflavonoids are great for pumping up the C/anti-oxidants in your diet. This particular vitamin/bioflavonoid combo is especially useful if you don't like to eat fruit. I started taking too many and felt weird so I cut back to only one a day. Various research has pointed to doses as high as 10,000 mg/day (that's 10 grams!!!)for certain treatments, which seems extreme. I was trying 3,000 mg/day (one at breakfast, lunch & dinner) but it proved too much too fast for my body. Start with one a day with your biggest meal and see how that works and if you want to take more then add another at a different meal and see how you feel the next day. I have no complaints about this vitamin and this manufacturer has a good reputation from what I have read.
