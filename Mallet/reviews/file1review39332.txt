review/text: The brace did wonders for me! I have had back pain since I was 13, and this is the only product that finally gave me releif!However... I can see why some people would have problems. It is far too uncomfortable to wear against your skin, I wear an undershirt beneath it. You cannot be lazy, while it is far easier to have good posture with this brace, you still have to make sure it is pulling your shoulders *back and not *up. I also noticed it riding up my neck, but it didn't bother me so much, my back still felt good.Notice that the connector is a bra connector. My boyfriend didn't want to wear it because he thought people would think he was wearing a bra. I think some men might find this product embarrassing. Also, it's pretty small, and it wasn't even close to fitting him, and he's not that wide.I had a very good experience, but this product is definitely not for everyone. I suppose a lot depends on what exactly is wrong with your posture. If you tend to arch your shoulders forward, like me, it's wonderful! But if you tend to slouch, it might not be so good.
