review/text: Since I have had my daughter on this, I noticed she has not been falling sick as she used to. We put this in a shot glass of OJ - at first she didn't like it but we eased her in with the idea of a cute cup and drinking OJ (we usually disallow OJ in the morning but keep her to soy milk or milk). She started getting used to it and now asks for it in the morning if I forget.The taste is great - it's an orangey pineapple.Only thing is it's hard to mix it well in cold solutions. You really have to mush it in against the walls of the cup. And you wouldn't put this in warm solutions because there are probiotics in this. But that's something that is easy to live with.I haven't been able to find any other palatable colostrum solution for little ones out there and this one works well.Highly recommend.
