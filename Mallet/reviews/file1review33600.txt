review/text: I recently purchased this item and am very pleased. I am a person who HATES to floss. After twenty something years of irregular flossing habits, I decided that I needed to do something. I read many reviews about WaterPiks, the Conair model, and a few others. I decided that this would be the best choice.The Good:Provides a very clean feeling.Does not hurt.Easy to use.Attractive.Quality Design.It holds a lot of water.You can mix mouthwash with the water.The Bad:Surprisingly Loud.The coiled tube gets twisted and can be annoying to correct.The &quot;pause&quot; button should be a &quot;go&quot; button.All in all, I am happy with my purchase. I recommend this product.--Note: My mother was a dental hygienist for twenty years. After I purchased this product she informed me that people who overuse waterpiks can cause unwanted damage. Gums form a natural V in between the teeth, and excessive use can cause that tissue to recess. The key word is excessive. Use the product no more than two times a day.
