review/text: I am using this cloth to clean my glasses as well as the surfaces of rented DVD's that seem to have dirt and grit on them. It works very well for both uses. I always use the cloth with a professional lens cleaning spray.I'm hoping that the performance is unchanged after the cleaning cloth is washed per their instructions (no reason to suspect that it won't continue to perform well)
