review/text: Wow, what a horrible item. I did not purchase this through Amazon, but at another retailer. On its FIRST use, the fabric part of the brush separated from the actual plastic holder. The fabric is not secure AT ALL. And it is pieced into the plastic holder, a separate piece on front and back, so that both sides can easily become separated from the holder. Never purchased something this useless before. To make matters worse, there was no way to re-attach the fabric back into the "teeth" of the holder, so it was tossed into the garbage. Why aren't companies held liable for selling worthless items?????? Yes, I am angry.
