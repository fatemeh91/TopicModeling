review/text: If you're skeptical, keep reading!I'm 23 years old, married, and ttc. I've always had irregular periods, excessive bleeding for long periods of time, and periods that went MIA for over a year or two. After years of period trouble, I went on the pill before I got married (big mistake, especially for someone with my menstrual history), went off a year later, didn't have a period for two months, then got one suddenly. After that period-nothing. Still no sign of a period six months later. I heard about Fertilaid and thought, for the price, it couldn't hurt either way. After less than two months of taking it (i'm about to start my third consecutive month of fertilaid), my period returned, my first ever NORMAL period. Only five days, as opposed to my 11 to 12 day, heavy, helter skelter few and far between periods I'd had in the past. This really works if you have a history of irregular cycles or periods. Try it. You'll be amazed! I was and still am!
