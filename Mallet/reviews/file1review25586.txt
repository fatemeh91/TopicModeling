review/text: I just fired up my new trimmer today. It worked much better than either of the two other products that I have tried. The testing ground was nose and ears. My nostrils had so much hair in them that the hair ebbed and flowed with every breath like squid tentacles. But this trimmer handled the challenge well. The only reason I did not award 5 stars was because I felt like the hair was almost being pulled, so the trimming process made me a bit edgy.Please do not ask me to borrow nose hair trimmer. It is for my use only.
