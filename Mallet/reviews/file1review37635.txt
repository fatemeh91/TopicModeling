review/text: I usually use Speed Stick, but I enjoyed the Secret Sheer Dry Solid. It was easy to put on and didn't leave a white residue on my underarms. I felt it worked better than some anti-perspirants that I've used before. I felt dry and good smelling. I'd tell my friends or family to use this one.
