review/text: These little beauties help to remove plaque better than floss. You moisten the tips and insert the pointed end between teeth with the flat side next to the gums. You use a gentle-in-and-out motion to clean between the teeth.My dad got me using these as he loves them and I have to agree. I just found the mint flavored ones and now prefer the mint to the regular flavor. Toothpicks will annoy you after you use these stim-u-dents.~The Rebecca Review
