review/text: I use mine so much I bought my sister one as well. Exactly one minute in the microwave and rest it over your eyes. Does a great job relieving sinus pressure. I use a different one for "cool". As a bonus when you heat it up it smells like oatmeal. Sometimes I just use it to relax even when my sinus issues aren't acting up.
