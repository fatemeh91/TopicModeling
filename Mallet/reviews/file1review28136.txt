review/text: Optimum Protien & Muscle Milk have been good supplements for me over the years. I've felt that they both mix well, digest well, and are absorbed well. I'd give ON the edge because it seems to mix a little better, and is easier to digest. Sometimes these powders can be gassy or cause 'back ups.'If you are looking for a good lean protein supplement this is it! I'd reccomend it over Muslce Milk & CytoSport & BSN
