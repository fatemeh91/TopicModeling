review/text: I received the ordered Wahl Shave System, but the &#34;Foil Guard&#34; was not included in the shipment. I would like Amazon.com and/or Wahl Clipper Corporation to send me a &#34;foil Guard&#34; that is missing from the shipment. I do not have anything to cover the Foil Head of my shaver.Secondly, this product is way too loud when it is turned on for operation. I am thinking of returning this product for REFUND. The product does not live up to the way its performance is described.
