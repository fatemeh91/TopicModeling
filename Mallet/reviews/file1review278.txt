review/text: ...keeps going and going and going. I got this jack rabbit as a replacement for my last one, an original jack rabbit, in which the cord became faulty. I was looking for an upgrade to an already proven product. The plastic odor goes away after washing, so no issue there. I've already had it for about 2 weeks, and it's worked every time. No complaints here. So far, so good. I liked the jack rabbit before, and I still love it even more. It's definitely a keeper. The jack rabbit is my second favorite. I only say second favorite, because my hubby is my all time fav. This toy keeps up with my high drive. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.
