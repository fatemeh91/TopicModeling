review/text: After trying every soap and deodorant on the market, I hit the net trying to find a product that would reduce sweating or eliminate the smell caused by my sweating. Ten minutes after a shower or bath, the smelly order would return. Particularly in the summer months. This problem caused me to be self-conscious especially during sex because my female parts would release an unpleasant musty odor. The first internal deodorant that I found on the net was almost $60. Of course, I had to hit Amazon for reviews. During my research, I found Chlorofresh with the same ingredients at a more affordable price.I finished my first bottle about three days ago. I must say that it does work. However, you `MUST' still wash your body `Daily' and apply a mild deodorant. I started taking two pills twice a day. I took a trip to Texas and had to increase the dosage to three pills twice a day. It was 103 degrees etc........ NO UNPLEASANT ODOR! YEAH! I must also add that I haven't experienced any cramping from the product.I want to add that during my research, I read another review on Amazon and the author stated that he/she also use Hibiclens three times a week on their private areas. Therefore, I purchased this soap as well. The soap and Chlorofresh works great together. After washing with regular soap, I use the Hibiclens daily on my underarms and private area (Every other day or three times a week would be fine). If I only take the Chlorofresh without the soap for about three days, I notice a slight change in female odor. The same as I'm noticing a slight change in body odor since I've been out of Chlorofresh for a few days. Not horrible but a slight change. Bottom line, for me these two products work well together. I didnt give Chlorofresh a 5 because I have to use Hibiclens as well.
