review/text: This seemed like a great idea but when I received the item I realized the &#34;seeds&#34; move all around without borders sewn to keep them in their place. Therefore, it is quite the hassle to spread it all out evenly. In the picture it appeared there were quilted squares and I assumed each section held the seeds in place. not so.
