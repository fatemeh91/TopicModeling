review/text: I was always against supplementing. To me, it seemed somewhat unnatural and I wanted to build a strong athletic body rather then one that was huge but had no purpose or practical use. I didn't want huge bulging arms, a 200lb chest or be able to bench press 400. As a martial artist (I do chinese wushu, which is similar to advanced gymnastics in terms of the toll it takes on your body), I needed to build a body that was lean, fast and flexible. I accredit this product with helping me, and currently, achieve that goal. You won't get BIG of this product. What you get is exactly what you need if your aiming for the build that I am still working on getting. If your a man/ woman who wants to build that athletic body everyone ogles at in health magazines, this product is probably right for you. If you want to get huge, you may want to try something else.
