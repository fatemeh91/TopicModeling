review/text: The most disgusting eaters I know both claim it's an age-related problem that will affect us all in time. Not sure I agree with that theory: Phil and Dalton are only in their fifties despite their hairy nostrils, wrinkly skin and pot-bellies.However, the fact remains that they drool and dribble at lunch like a pair of senile old men, which upsets those unfortunate enough to share their table.Since I bought the shirt bibs their eating habits have not improved but at least their work clothes (that they proudly claim to wash each year, whether they need it or not) appear less stained.I have deducted one star only because there is no below-bib guttering to catch the foul liquids that stream down their unshaven faces and soak their heavily-soiled trousers.
