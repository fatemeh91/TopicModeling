review/text: I've preferred blades for years, as most electrics give me bad razor burn and don't do a good job getting the flat whiskers on the bottom of my neck.This razor does a good job getting to all of the whiskers. It gives me a blade close shave, and after a few weeks of persistant razor burn my face doesn't suffer much discomfort. Williams 'Lectric Shave did help a lot. At this point it's like I have been using a premium blade but get a closer shave with less mess.The self cleaning idea is wonderful. The cleaning fluid lasts a good amount of time, even with almost every day use. I like the lemony smell, and the razor does a much better job when it's clean.An earlier reviewer mentioned they picked this razor over the 8985 because it doesn't have the nagging LCD. There are enough lights to communicate with you on this model, so don't feel like you're missing anything by choosing the 8585. Save the difference for some more CCR2 refills.One quirk that I picked up on w/ the razor and stand is a faint, very high pitched sound that they make when plugged in. It's similar to the sound that a TV makes when you turn it on. I could imagine that if somebody had a quiet, "echo-y" bathroom and sensative ears to these types of noises it might become an annoyance. Most people won't notice the sound at all, though.The Sales Rank on this product is very high, and with good reason. It does a very respectable job and has many quality features to go with it.
