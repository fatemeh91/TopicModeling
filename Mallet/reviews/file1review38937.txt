review/text: These are the same great blades that I used for 25 years. I stayed with them for two reasons: the handle is super comfortable and easy to grip, and the blades are sharp with a perfect angle. However, the moisture strip on these particular blades is dry and brittle. The strip fell off the first blade I used. I'm on the second blade and the moisture strip is just as ineffective as the first although it hasn't fallen off, yet. My legs look like they've been through a paper shredder. I doubt I'll buy them again and learn to be happy with the new blade and handle designs that are on the market.
