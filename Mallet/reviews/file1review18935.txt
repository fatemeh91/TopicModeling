review/text: I severely pulled the outside ligament in my left knee due to a bad landing practicing a running jumping sidekick. This brace gives pretty good support but doesn't have stability necessary to allow for contuinued practicing when pivoting, or turning.It does provide fantastic support for everyday use and has allowed me to continue to be mobile with light martial arts practice. I would definitely say it's worth the price!
