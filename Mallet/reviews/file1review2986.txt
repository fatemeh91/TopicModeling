review/text: My boyfriend and I ordered these condoms because we had run out, and thought the price would be worth it even if it sucked... What we found out the first time we used it was that it feels like there is barely anything there. My boyfriend describes it as plastic wrap, being super thin, and i have to say that i have found my favorite condom now. Even the light pink color, and very low smell is pleasing. I totally recommend these, and hope everyone will at least give these a try :DUPDATE:When my boyfriend and I had some friends over, we decided to see just how much one of these condoms can hold. I went into the bathroom, and filled the whole thing with water. The only part that broke was the area near the band, all the way at the top. The amount of water in the condom was enough to fill the sink. It stretches so much! ^.^Extreme update, like almost a year later...We ordered more of these condoms, as I had given away a bunch before, and everyone i know loves these. My boyfriend and I say that these are the best we've tried. They're comfy, durable but sometimes you need to add in a little extra lubrication.
