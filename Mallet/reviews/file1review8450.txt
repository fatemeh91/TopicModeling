review/text: It's not that I don't like it *completely* because it's sorta-kinda usable, but I don't know for how long. It's pretty flimsy, and I'm afraid to put a lot of pressure on it. I bought it to use with my Hydro Flask stainless steel drinking bottle, and it is too flimsy to do the job correctly. It was a $5 add-on, and I couldn't be bothered to return it. YMMV.
