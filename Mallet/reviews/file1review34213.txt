review/text: This Cream saved my A$$. I was thinking about passing because of the retards rating this product a 1/5 stars, said F it its 10 bucks gonna try it.I saw some bad ratings because people said it burned or it smelled bad or blah blah blah, They are just a bunch of babies. First off, If you put some stuff on an open cut / hemorrhoid, its going to burn. Sounds like they need to wait and let it heal a little before they use it. And 2nd off, I think the smell is actually kind of pleasant.Didn't burn for me, and the smell is not even strong. Its more like a fresh air smell rather than vicks rub or what ever some guy said in the 1/5 section, and my A$$ doesn't hurt right now so take your pick! A couple bad down votes or my legit leet review.Just get it and save your a$$!!! Literally!
