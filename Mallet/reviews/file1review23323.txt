review/text: I use this in my classroom. One of the students has the job of floor inspector, which involves using the sweeper to pick up any crumbs, pieces of paper, etc off the floor. It is a popular job because of the sweeper. But the sweeper can take several passes to pick up some things. Still, a good value for the price.
