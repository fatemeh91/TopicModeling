review/text: I've used the Boston cleaner for decades and recently found out about this product. I tried it and found it to be a bit better than the more expensive Boston version. Not 'head and shoulders' above the Boston, but still noticeably better. And considering that is is a few dollars cheaper for a 2oz. bottle versus a 1oz. of the Boston, it's a no-brainer to continue to use the Lobob ESC.Of course, if I'm in an emergency and can't order this stuff quickly enough (and I'm in serious need), I'll suck it up and pay (or overpay) for the Boston until I can get this product back in my house.
