review/text: After two weeks, the massager stopped working. I even replaced the batteries but it would no longer turn on. I had to return the product for a refund.Also, the battery comparment easily falls out of its slot in the cushion whenever the cushion is moved and often sticks into your back.The memory foam flattens out and doesn't really offer the support I needed or expected, far less support than a normal pillow.
