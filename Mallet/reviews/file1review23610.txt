review/text: I picked up this soap because my toddler was having trouble with dry skin during the winter. After only a few days, the dry skin was gone and the red bumps cleared up. I also gave it to my husband who suffers from Eczema. It worked to relieve his symptoms as well. It also has that great baby lotion smell!
