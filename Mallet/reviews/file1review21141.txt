review/text: I want to love this heating pad, really I do. It's big enough to get where I need it to, it delivers hot moist heat automatically, but the one thing I can't get over, is that you have to keep your hand on the switch the entire time in order to deliver the heat. I used it regularly for constant back pain, but when I lie on the bed, in order to place the pad where I need it to be, and in the position I need to lie so I'm close enough to where the power cord is in the wall, I still have to contort my arm in order to grab the heat switch and keep it delivering heat. Its just become too hard. I understand the theory behind the hand help switch, but couldn't they just put a timer or auto shut off or something. It is VERY inconvenient to contort to keep this thing hot. It feels so good when it's working, but there has to be a better way to use it.
