review/text: Soap comes out when you press the button at the top. It also comes out on its own, without any human intervention. This means filling it more often, plus wasted soap.This brush offers bristle replacement, which is a neat feature. I was considering replacing the bristles when the brush fell apart completely. It wasn't dropped or misused. I think the brush just isn't very durable.I wouldn't buy this brush again.
