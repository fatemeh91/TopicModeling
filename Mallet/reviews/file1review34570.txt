review/text: As I've gotten older I've noticed that my lips have gotten a lot darker, so I wanted to try and protect them as much as I could. Even though I don't lick my lips or anything, I still end up getting some of it in my mouth and it tastes terrible. It is also very, very white. Unfortunately I don't think that you're ever going to be able to find a sunscreen lip product that isn't gross. Anything that is easy to wear probably just does not contain enough sunscreen. So with that caveat: the product itself works. You just may not want to use it for everyday.
