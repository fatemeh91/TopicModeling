review/text: These are not chew sticks, they are toothpicks! They allowed me to stop smoking with very little cravings. They taste great, and the flavor lasts for awhile, not as long on the cinnamon flavor, more so on the tea tree which is essentially a mint flavor. I prefer the taste of the cinnamon, but the cinnamon sticks tend to shred really quick, not so much with the tea tree. They smell great and taste great what more could you need... beats a cigarette any day.
