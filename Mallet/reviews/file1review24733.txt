review/text: These are very poorly constructed. Maybe it's the hot TX sun, but all five I purchased broke within just a few uses. The plastic is cheap and split apart or broken. Not abused as I set them up and left them. Used no more than 10 times each. May be good in a cooler climate, but definitely not a product for use in the hot sun.
