review/text: The diastolic pressure seems consistent, but the systolic (higher number) changes by 20mg or more between two readings taking one right after the other. Also found similarly dramatic differences when switching from one arm to the other. Good to give you an idea of where you are, but I wouldn't rely on it for very accurate one-time readings, particularly with the systolic.Also note, if you get a wrist monitor, it's important to hold your wrist at chest level - it will be falsely low if it's above your heart and falsely high if it's below your heart.I bought the wrist monitor to save some money, but just spent a few extra dollars to replace it with an arm cuff one.
