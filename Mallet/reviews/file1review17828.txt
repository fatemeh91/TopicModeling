review/text: This is an excellent cleaner, since we cannot purchase the cleaner with Pepsin any longer for gas permeable rigid (hard) contact lenses. When your lenses get to the point you can no longer clean with anything, go to your lab (where you bought them) and have them use checmicals only they can buy.
