review/text: You may want to do the math before you get suckered into buying the "new and improved" Areds2 version of this vitamin. The only difference between the original "Lutein" formula and the new Areds2 formula is the addition of 1000 mg of Omega 3. However, you now need to take 4 (four) Areds2 tables daily instead of only 2 (two) tablets of the original Lutein formula. OK, so it the Lutein formula doesn't have fish oil. Fish oil is cheap.Here are some #'s for you: At Costco, you'll pay $31.99 for 180 tablets LUTEIN tablets . That's .$18 per pill or $.36 per day because you take two tables. (At Amazon the Lutein formula runs $26.09 for 120 tablets so that's $.22 a tablet or $.44 per day for two tablets). You can buy Fish Oil at Costco for $10.79 for 400 tablets - $.03 a tablet -- or you can purchase Costco's Kirkland Fish Oil through Amazon for slightly more ($14.24 for 400 or $.04 a tablet). It will cost you DOUBLE to take the Areds2 formula! Areds2 is $28 @ Walmart (cheapest I could find) for 120 tablets....that's $.23 a tablet but don't forget you have to take 4 a day so that $.93 a day.Let me think. Do I want to continue with the original Lutein formula at $.36 a day plus throw in one Fish Oil tablet for $.03, thus spending $.39 a day? Or, do I want to switch to the new improved Areds 2 formula, taking 4 -- not 2 -- tablets a day and spend $.93 a day?Let the buyer beware!
