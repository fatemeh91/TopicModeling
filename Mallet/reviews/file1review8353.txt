review/text: We have a couple different sized stainless steel bottles and this brush works well for cleaning them, we use this brush solely for that rather than also using it for dirty dishes or anything that might contaminate it with gunk. It's pretty soft anyway, so probably wouldn't, for example, be stiff enough to clean the dried latte residue out of your travel mug. But for water bottle cleaning it's perfect.I don't understand the water-in-plastic thing, let alone the millions and millions of bottles being thrown away daily. Although recycling the plastic keeps them out of the landfill and many other places they tend to be discarded, it takes more energy than producing a new plastic bottle. How about we just stop the plastic water bottle madness?! This brush and a couple stainless steel water bottles, and your average tap water (some areas might need filtering) are the way to go.
