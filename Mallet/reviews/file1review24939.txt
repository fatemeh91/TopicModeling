review/text: Me and my husband have been trying to conceive for four years now. Got pregnant last year but miscarried 4 1/2 months into the pregnancy. Ever since then my periods have been irregular, I would get them for two weeks then stop for one then again. Me and my husband started taking Fertilaid about 3 weeks ago. 4 days after I started I got my period. Bright red, a little bit more painful but it lasted 5 days then I was done. It was amazing!!!!.....still no pregnancy but after trying all kinds of natural things so far Fertilaid is the only product that has regulated my period therefore my ovulation. We will be purchasing our second month soon and are hoping to get good news for the beginning of the year
