review/text: I love ALL, however, maybe I read it wrong when I ordered this. When I received the items the boxes were so small. I only purchased these thinking I was getting much larger boxes. Well it on me not the company because I did not read the dimensions and measurements to know the actually size of these items. Overall, ALL is a good soap detergent so needless to say it gets my clothes clean and it good.
