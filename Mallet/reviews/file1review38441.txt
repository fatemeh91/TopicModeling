review/text: Just received my new Emjoi Optima and am very pleased. I've owned a Gently Gold model for about 3 years and will never go back to shaving. I'm writing this review to compare the 2 models, for anyone who is trying to decide which one to buy. The Gently Gold works great, but I prefer this newer model. I think it is faster -- and epilating can take a long time. I love having the interchangeable shave head, too. Even when I've taken my time, I have often found myself looking down at my legs when I'm at work, looking at a wide swath of hairy leg. Today, I epilated, then quickly finished off with a shave, and I'm sure it's the smoothest my legs have ever been. The Gently Gold is rechargeable and can be operated without a cord -- a nice feature, but only lasted for about a year.A general comment.. I never wait 5-6 weeks between epilating. By doing it once a week, there's really very little discomfort. So why not just shave? Can't explain why, but I just don't find epilating to be as tedious as shaving. When your hair grows back after epilating, it's never stubbly, just soft.
