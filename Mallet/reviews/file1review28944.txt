review/text: I bought the ON Whey because of the good reviews it received. I cannot objectively judge the effect of whey in general, but it seems to work for me. I trained every day of the last month and drank one shake before and after the training. I usually prepare the shake with water, or 1/2 water and 1/2 milk and the taste of "Extreme Milk chocolate" is very good in both cases. The powder dissolves fast and the shake doesn't foam like some other products. I will be buying this again.
