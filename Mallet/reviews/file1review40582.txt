review/text: I have used a few different brands of natural dish detergent and had been happy with all of them until I tried this one. It simply does not wash my dishes. There is food stuck on everything, which is funny since I started scrubbing all the food off my dishes when I realized this stuff doesn't work. And no, it's not my dishwasher disbursing food, it's brand new, and awesome. Once I'm done with this stuff I will going back to my favorite brand of natural dish detergent, BioKleen, I highly recommend it.
