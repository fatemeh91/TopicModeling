review/text: Here's an item for babies that really fits our needs. Our baby boy is six weeks old and needs a bath now and then, like about every other day. This lightweight folding tub fits our kitchen double sink perfectly. It has a non-slip liner across the bottom and will hold about a gallon or so of water. My wife bought a little floating thermometer that ensures the temperature to be just right. We leave the water running during the bath and there is no problem with drainage into our fairly deep sink. When the bath is finished, there is a convenient drain in the bottom of the deepest part of the bath tub. Once emptied, the head and foot parts of the tub fold into the center portion to greatly reduce the size and we have a perfect shelf available for storage right in our kitchen only a few feet away.We were a little apprehensive when we first tested the tub. How would the baby react to his first bath? Well, he loved it! Every time we use it he stops crying or fidgeting and relaxes to the feeling of the surrounding warm water. It couldn't work any better, but he's now at 11 pounds and I expect the tub will be too small in the near future. Well, it certainly fit our needs for this stage in his growth.Gary Peterson
