review/text: we bought this crib for our newborn and without a doubt it was a great deal. the tub is just deep enough to get em clean without over filling being an issue. the people that said its a hazard because it "collapses" obviously didnt get the right size tub for their sink. ours fits great and i assume itll last long enough that she will be able to out grow it before it breaks. the only minor issue is the hinges. be careful with their toes and put down a washcloth. simple as that. :) thanks for a great product at a great price!
