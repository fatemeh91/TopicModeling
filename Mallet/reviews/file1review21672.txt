review/text: I had the bath chair for my 6 month old and every time she would reach for a toy, the chair would tip over and she would go face first into the water. So after lots and lots of researching and reading reviews, I settled on this tub. I am so glad that I bought it for her. She loves it! On occasion she will lift her legs and the water will make her body float backwards, but the side always catches her head. Not once has she fallen into the water.We don't deflate it. After reading reviews it seems to be that the deflating it and reflating it over and over is what caused the seems to become weak and leak. So we leave it inflated and just tip it upside down to dry.I wish I had this bath for my other 2 kids when they were babies!
