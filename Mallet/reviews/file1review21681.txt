review/text: The inflatable snug tub is great- exactly what we needed for our 6 month old. She loves it! It gives enough support for her to lean on if she needs it. It fits great into our guest bathroom bath- we keep it inflated and hang it up to dry between baths. The bottom is a little slick but putting a towel or washcloth under her bottom solved that problem. We havnt had any problems with the material it seems like sturdy plastic. Would definitely recommend this product!
