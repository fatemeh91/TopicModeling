review/text: I really like this lighter. It's main problem is it's NOT dependable. One light is high, the next light is low, one flame may be higher than the other. I have done everything to adjust the flame (flames) to no avail. Like I wrote, I DO like this lighters feel. I'm hoping it will eventually break-in.
