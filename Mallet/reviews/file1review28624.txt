review/text: I tried the Chocolate flavor stuff and I have to plug my nose to even get it down. It tasted so bad. But I read that a lot of people were liking the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor so I gave that a try.Best Protein powder (That's not extremely fatty) that I have ever had. I can easily drink it will water, milk, or whatever.My only complaint (about most powders) is they need to package the scoop on the outside. I hate spending 10 mins to dig through the powder to find that thing.
