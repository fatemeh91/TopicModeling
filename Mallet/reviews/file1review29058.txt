review/text: As nifty as it looks, this razor is surprisingly second-rate. Unlike my previous Braun razor (from 1999), this shaver doesn't even have a 'lock' setting. And since the on-button is very touch-sensitive, it's practically a guarantee that it'll accidentally go off in your luggage. Whose idea was that?Also, I find I have to go over the same area several times for it to be shaved to my satisfaction. Sure, it has a beard trimmer (which I barely use), but lots of other, assuredly better razors have them too. Without the sucking.
