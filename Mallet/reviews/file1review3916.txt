review/text: I used the white strips once, but didn't even finish the package because they're such a hassle. I found that after a while the strips simply stop adhering to my teeth and I literally can't keep them in place inside my mouth for the recommended time - they end up wadding up like plastic wrap. Since I had braces, my teeth are very straight, so I switched to Aquafresh white trays, which worked out much better for me as they are VERY easy to keep in place.
