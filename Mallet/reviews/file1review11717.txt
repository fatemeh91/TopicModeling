review/text: I have been giving my child these products for 2 years & she loves them all. The problem is not with the product but the prices charged on this site. Everyone knows you can find these for under $10 a six pack in grocery stores, plus you can use coupons. I have NEVER paid more than $8.00 for this. I only joined amazon mom for this product & I`m sorry I bothered.
