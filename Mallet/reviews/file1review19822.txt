review/text: I bought the red/white one for my son 1.5 years ago (he's 3 now) when he started potty training, after having purchased and returned many other brands that simply did not stay put on our TOTO elongated toilet seat. I just made sure that the "paddles" underneath this Baby Bjorn seat are out of the way, placed it on top of the TOTO seat, and there it stayed, without slipping at all. I don't even use those "paddles" to grip the toilet seat; the rubber ring around the entire outer edge of the Baby Bjorn seat sufficiently holds it in place. I then purchased additional ones to keep at my in-laws' and parents' places (they have different brand toilets, but this works just as well on those), so that their other grand-toddlers and my kids can use it when visiting. It's one piece, and no cushion, so it's super-easy to clean. The seat and hole are big enough for my son to continue using it for a little while longer. This is definitely worth every penny.
