review/text: I watched a video review of this pelvic exercisor and thought that it might be of use over all the others out on the market. After giving it a go, I found that no matter what side you use (they tell you to start with the smaller side), it is very hard to hold on to and slips out easily due to the smooth surface - even with the help of holding it in. I was looking for something that would enhance my kegel exercises, but this is not the tool. One good thing, it is smooth and comfortable, but it is hard to use if you want to strengthen your PC muscles.
