review/text: I am very pleased with the Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSense. I recommend it highly. It's easy to use, easy to read, seems accurate. I like the two warning indicators -- irregular heartbeat and high reading. I also like that it can also use the provided AC adapter. This model has a memory but I don't believe it can be split across 2 people -- i believe there are more expensive models that can be.
