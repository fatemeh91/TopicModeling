review/text: Undisputedly best Whey Protein in the market. I tried the double choclate flavor. Its very good. i didnt changed any flavors,i was addicted to it. i might change the flavor in future.Have a Rich Protein Shake after your workout as below..Very Delicious and Nutritious !!1-11/2 scoops of ON 100% whey1 full banana5gms of Dextrose or sugar (use dextrose for spike and fast absorbance to muscles)Blend it..Its really very delicious and nutritious post workout shake.Taste - 9Mixability-8Efficiency-9Price- 9Value-9Pros- Its taste,value,results, mixability and price.Cons- it smells a lill uncomfortable if you uses just with waterStack it with ON 100% Casein(slow releasing or bed time protein) if you are looking for serious gains or into a body building.Go For it !!
