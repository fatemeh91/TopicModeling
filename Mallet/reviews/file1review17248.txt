review/text: I am now on my third Remington MB-200. I have been using this trimmer since 2006, from the days of the old model.The old model lasted me three years, and would have lasted longer if I didn't lose it. The new models are the one that needs to be replaced every year or so, it seems. These trimmers are built cheap and they break quite easily (the hair-door at the front that you need to lift to clean hairs from underneath mostly). If they do not break, the battery will die on you first - currently my trimmer can't last more than three or four shavings without recharging.To be fair, I do use this trimmer for more than just facial hair: I use it to take haircuts (I am almost fully bald, so I just trim my head once in two weeks or so) as well as other parts (armpits, pubic hair) and it does do a great job, so I do use it almost on a daily basis.For the price, especially if I calculate how many trips to the barber it saves me, I can't really complain; however, I can't stop from thinking that perhaps for $10 more or so I could get a trimmer that does a much better job. I think this time around I'm going to try a different trimmer and see if there's a big difference.I'd say get this one if you want to do &#34;general&#34; hair treatment. Don't expect this piece to be too specific and get into the nooks of your face and curve the perfect beard, it is not going to happen. Use it for general &#34;damage control,&#34; if you get my drift.
