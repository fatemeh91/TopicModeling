review/text: I've read so many things on this stuff. The price is unbeatable on here. Sesamin is great for your liver, kidney, lipids, some fat oxidation and much more. I wanna get some of this for my mom in the future.As far as the other review, I was confused because how can you rate something you haven't bought and if you have bought it.....its on the side of the bottle??EACH CAPSULE:Sesame Oil(Sesamum Indicum)(Seed)(Standardized For 500mg Sesamin Lignans) 1000mgOther IngredientsCandelia Wax, And GelatinFree Of: Yeast, Wheat, Gluten, Corn, Soy, Milk, Sugar, Salt, Colors, Preservatives.Contains No Solvent Residues, Allergens, Artificial Flavoring Or Colors.
