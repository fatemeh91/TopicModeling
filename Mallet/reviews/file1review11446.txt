review/text: I been enjoying the Treasures of The Sea Bath for 12 years now. It has a pleasant smell that relaxes your senses after a stressful day and I love how it turns the water blue. It leaves your skin feeling soft and silky. I do miss the tin that it came in but I have enough that I have collected over the years and I do believe that the plastic container has more then the bag that came in the tin with the loofah sponge.
