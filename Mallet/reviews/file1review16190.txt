review/text: There's been a run on lice treatment in Wal-Mart so I only managed to get a couple of boxes of Nix as recommended by the pharmasist. The rest of the family had to make do with the Equate store brand.Despite carefully following all the Nix instructions there were still loads of live lice in the hair immediately after treatment. The store brand (much cheaper with more active ingredients) worked great and those heads were still nit free a week later.Treating a whole family for lice is very expensive so pick something that is going to work first time, and that is not Nix. Then comb, comb, comb and comb again, daily for at least 10 days.
