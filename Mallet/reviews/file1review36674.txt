review/text: I really enjoyed the fresh scent of this soap. It really invigorated me and the scent lasted all day. I usually use regular scent Irish Spring but I'm switching to Sport for an even fresher scent and longer lasting deodorant. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to smell clean and fresh throughout the day. It's antibacterial too!!
