review/text: Its been a month since i began yoga and so my first time using a sticky mat. This intro to a yoga kit has been good. The mat is relatively sturdy, although there is a smally snag on it (not sure if i did it with my toe or it came that way), but it does not seem to be expanding.The colour is a beautiful purple, and the bag is very sturdy and holds every thing comfortably.All and all, this kit is a good introduction to yoga for beginners. I recommend it hold heartedly.
