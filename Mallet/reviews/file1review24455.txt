review/text: This product does not work, it's a lot less effective than the previous hair, skin & nail product I'd been taking. Frankly, I don't believe that the product does anything at all. I began taking hair, skin & nail vitamins because (1) I have nail discoloration (dark streaks) and (2) I wanted fuller, longer hair. For the past year, I'd taken GNC's Hair, Skin & Nail formula which seemed effective (the dark streaks in my nails were less noticeable, my nails grew QUICKLY and my hair became marginally fuller). I decided to give Country Life Biotin a try to see if there's a more effective product on the market. In short, this product does NOT work. My nails stopped growing (I used to have to cut them every 4 days, once I stopped taking the GNC product and switched to Country Life Biotin I only had to trim every 2 wks...growth halted), also, the dark streaks have returned! I wish that I could give this product back. I will try another biotin product and if that does not work, return to GNC's Hair, Skin & Nails.
