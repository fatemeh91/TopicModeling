review/text: I cannot say how much i love this product, i have never been able to use wax and get all my hair out unless im a a salon,the wax strips dont work for me, i have been relying on threading and tweezing for my upper lip and eyebrows, both of which are very painful to me. I tried this wax for facial hairs for the first time a few minutes ago and all the hair is gone with the first try and its allmost painless.i could see all the lil hairs on the wax with the roots they look like a lil brush , lol .im gonna buy the wax for the body ,im excited to try it and say goodbye to razors and daily shaving.
