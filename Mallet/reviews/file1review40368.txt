review/text: I'm not a fan of nutritional supplements that needlessly price gouge customers. Holistic companies like to criticize the medical community, in part, for their expensive drugs. Yet here's another supplement company playing by the same game. There's NO reason for these pills to be as expensive as they are. Particularly given the mediocre results. Companies like this prey on the fact that most anyone would willingly pay through the nose just to not get sick.I was saving these, hoping I would never need them. But my hubby and I were both coming down with a cold, and grabbed this bottle hoping to find some relief and avoid becoming full-blown sick. That's when we noticed this bottle is only a 2 day supply for ONE person. So we went to the local vitamin store and picked up an additional bottle of 40 for a whopping 32.95. (plus tax, over 36) We did a 3 day cycle, 1 day over the recommended cycled of 2 days. And guess what -- these expensive supplements didn't do a darn thing to help. Not one iota. If anything, we felt worse for wasting an extra 36.00 for nothing.Bottom Line -- sure, the black capsules look chic and slick, but this is just a newfangled snake-oil. Don't bother with these. I'm going to look into Now Foods supplements to see if they have a more affordable alternative that actually works. Now Foods makes great supplements that are reasonably priced. But I'll never waste money on these Gaia Herbs again, that's for sure!
