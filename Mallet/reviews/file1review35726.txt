review/text: This is very much like natural tears. Which my optometrist recommended. He said stay away from the "red eye reducing" stuff. This product really does relieve the loss of the natural tearing ability of my "older" eyes. I'm 69 and I guess my eyes qualify at being "older". Can't hurt to give it a try.
