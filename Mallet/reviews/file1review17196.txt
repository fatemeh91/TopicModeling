review/text: I bought this as a replacement for another Remington shaver. Unfortunately, this shaver is simpler (and cheaper) as it doesn't have a short, second cutting blade, for trimming along the moustache and other close areas.The unit shaves very well. However, the one I bought malfunctioned - a piece of spring fell out of the head, misaligning the blade - and I cut myself.Overall, this shave is somewhat problematic and not as good a product as before.
