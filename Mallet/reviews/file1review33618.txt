review/text: I love WaterPik products. The only reason mine stopped working after 5 years was because my son decided to hide in the bathroom and use it for a contraption he was making. *sigh* The product is highly recommended if you only want to buy one once...and NOT use it like an 8 year old to fight the forces of evil in the bathroom.
