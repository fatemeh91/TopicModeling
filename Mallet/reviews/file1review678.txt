review/text: Shape Magazine, August 2006 issue rated Zoe's Chocolate Delight Bar as one of their favorite chocolate bars. The funny thing is that the nutrition facts for Zoe's Bars have the same terrific nutrition as the bars that they selected for their high fiber category - that means high fiber and great taste. Can't beat it for energy and satisfying your chocolate craving without eating a candy bar.
