review/text: We have used the Kandoo hand soap for a few years now and I find that the brighter the color of the soap, the more likely my kids are to wash their hands. The only drawback is the streaks of purple or green all over my vanity.So, being "green" I bought the refills but someone threw away the dispensers since they were empty. But now I can't find the soap anywhere. I am sure that I can use another dispenser.
