review/text: i was desperate for relief and i saw the reviews and thought i would try it. it does have a weird smell and i found out you should wear gloves when using because your hand will smell like musk all day. it also does get warm as it is repairing tissue so you have to be prepared for it and it does become less intense the more you use it. Ive told my friends how have gone to Oriental market places to get it
