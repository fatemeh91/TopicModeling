review/text: Gold Standard whey protein is IMO some of the best. But I would advise to stay away from the TROPICAL PUNCH flavor! I tried it with water, then tried it with berries and bananas. Gross either way. No recipe has saved my shake from this overpowering, chemical-tasting fruity flavor. I will update this review, when I try another flavor.
