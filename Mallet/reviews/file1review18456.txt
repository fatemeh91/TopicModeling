review/text: I convinced myself that since I was about to start a new job where there would be more writing (vs use of computer record keeping) I would "need" a reliable pen that not only wrote clearly and smoothly but was not going to contribute to hand contractures/discomfort. I found what I was looking for in this pen and in fact it makes the significant amount of writing actually fun from an artistic standpoint.My only complaint is that the gel refills run out in a couple of weeks...
