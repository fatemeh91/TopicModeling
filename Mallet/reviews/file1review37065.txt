review/text: I thought this was going to make flossing easier and faster but that's not the case. The flossing isn't as useful with the lack of power from the device. The picks are not that great either and you will end up spending a lot of money buying refills. At least it comes with a AAA battery.All I can say is just stick to the simple flossing because you will end up spending a lot of money in the long run while not getting that much better of a clean.
