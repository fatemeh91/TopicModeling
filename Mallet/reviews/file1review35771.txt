review/text: As an avid basketballer (and now an old man) I have been a devotee of the Swede-O ankle braces for more than a decade. Did use the kind with the plastic splint that fit in the side pocket. Sometimes uncomfortable as it chafes the ankle bone. This model uses straps instead, that criss cross the ankle and velcro to adjust. I have used for a month and they are more comfortable, yet still as stable as I need. A little more work to put on, as they are more snug than the other model, and the other old men get impatient waiting for me to strap it up. But it is worth it when I later watch them writhe on the floor and grab their Swede-O-less ankles.
