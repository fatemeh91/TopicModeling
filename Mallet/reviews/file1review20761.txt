review/text: I purchased the Braun several months ago and last weekend I packed my old Remington 3 head and went hunting. I got a MUCH closer shave with the old razor than I did with this OVERPRICED Braun.Buying the braun was a BIG MISTAKE!!!Save your money and buy something else. I wish I knew how to return this overrated piece of junk.Jack
