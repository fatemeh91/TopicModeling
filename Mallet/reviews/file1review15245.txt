review/text: I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars. They were terrific. But, they put them in new packaging (fine, who cares, right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them. They're sickly sweet now, they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a "chip" in sight.It's all bad. I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast. No more. The new ones are so bad, I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them.
