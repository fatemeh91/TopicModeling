review/text: The HeadBlade is a neat concept that just tries too hard to be innovative. I received one a few weeks ago, and committed to trying it (it seemed pretty cool, at first), but it just doesn't deliver the goods. It can do a passable job when you follow the directions and get used to using it, but I think that most of the 5-star ratings here are based on the novelty. My regular old disposable razor does a better job at keeping a close shave without second passes, and I always knew where the blade was landing when I brought it down on my scalp, as opposed to the HeadBlade, which put the wheels practically in my eye if I was shaving the hairline above my forehead. Sure, you can get used to it. I did. I still find a regular old razor to be a closer shave and easier to maneuver around the nooks and crannies around the ears. Of course, with the headblade you also have to have a regular old shaver for the rest of your face, which makes it seem rather pointless and redundant.The bottom line: The HeadBlade is perfectly adequate as a shaver, but, then so is any other half-decent razor on the market, even disposables, and you don't have to relearn how to use the good old standbys.
