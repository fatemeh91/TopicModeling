review/text: We've tried other brands of diapers for our son, and all of them were either bulky and hard and/or leaked through the night. Huggies Supreme fits our son very well, they don't leak at night or during the day. For the other reviewer, I recommend changing the diaper more frequently instead of waiting until the diaper overflows. Also,why is this reviewer allowing their child to go around with an overflowing diaper? All diapers must be changed on a regular basis. All diapers will eventually overflow if not changed regularly. Huggies Supreme works well with our child and haven't had a problem.
