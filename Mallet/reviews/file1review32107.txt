review/text: I've had a tide stick at my office for 6 months. The three times I've used the stick, after a salad dressing spill, coffee stain, and mustard stain, the stick has gotten rid of the stains, but leaves a white stain instead. In some of these cases the white stains are more salient than the original stains.
