review/text: This was a GREAT beard trimmer while it worked. But the charger has completely stopped working, so it is broken. I really have not owned this thing that long. Very disappointing. Can't suggest buying a product that breaks down like this.I don't understand how companies that make products to do such a specific thing are incapable of success. How are battery companies not able to make batteries that work? It is just unbelievable to me.
