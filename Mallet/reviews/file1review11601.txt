review/text: I'm on my second lot of 16 after thinking that my quick charger might have ruined the first set. So I switched to a trickle charger with a fresh set of betteries only to learn that it's not the charger, it's the batteries. Most of them will not hold a charge longer than a few days. Totally worthless.
