review/text: Once upon a time, Norelco was Norelco, and not Norelco Phillips. They used to make a fantastic trimmer that didn't try to be everything to everyone, like the current one they offer. It was a beard and mustache trimmer, and it did a fantastic job. Would hold a charge for months, didn't have 8000 attachments.Why do I mention this thing? Because this Remington seems to be the God-child of that old Norelco I had for years. It's solid, feels good in the hand. It has ONE trimmer attachment, not six. I don't want to trim my ears with it, and it won't do it, unless I was crazy enough to stick the corner in my ear and chop half my ear off. I need it for my mustache and beard and it does an amazing job. The number on the front actually measures out in fractions of a centimeter what the depth of the blade is. It holds a charge for a good long time, is neat, and sharp. I don't know what else you could ask for a trimmer, except to get it half off - and, oh yeah, it did that too!I highly recommend this over the Phillips Norelco G370 which I had before. I lost chargers, the stand that comes with the shaver doesn't really allow for charging in place.. it was just a mess. Get the Remington and save yourself a lot of trouble.
