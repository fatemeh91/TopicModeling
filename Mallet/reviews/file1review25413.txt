review/text: I must admit that my son hated the one I bought for him. He probably didn't use it right. Just inserting it into a nostril and moving it around doesn't cut it (pun intended). Instead, turn it on and insert it about 1/4 inch into the nostril, then out, then in, etc., focusing on each area you want to trim. You can tell when its done trimming an area by the change in pitch.The cutter head comes apart easily for cleaning. I oil the cutter with a drop of light oil, such as baby oil, after each use.
