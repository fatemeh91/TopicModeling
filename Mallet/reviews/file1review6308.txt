review/text: I bought a tube of Penetran probably 15 years ago and was amazed at how well it worked on my severe arthritis. After all, it had cost me $10 for 4 ounces, so it should work. All through the years, whenever I used it, I found amazing relief, so I was dismayed when it ran out. Fortunately, I found it on Amazon, now $12 for 2 ounces (a good price considering inflation), and it really, really does work!
