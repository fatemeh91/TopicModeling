review/text: Noni juice has a LOT of claims, but this is not unusual for a lot of "miracle cures" and even jokingly claims to have cured cancer.It smells like foul toilet water, and tastes very bad, but not as bad as caster oil.I have allergy problems, and it made claims it does wonders for inflammation/allergies. I'm not a beliver in any kind of medication unless it actually works, so placebos have no power to affect me. I took it everyday for a week, and I noticed no change. I feel just the same. One time I caught a bad cold and started on noni juice. Nothing.My own experience is that you have to believe it works to make it work. Some people have this notion if it tastes bad it gotta work. It also costs about ONE DOLLAR AN OUNCE (that's the recommended dosage on the bottle). That's part of the placebo--it costs a lot so it has to do something.So I wasted about $17 on something that looks, smells, and probably tastes like foul toilet water.How much of this is placebo? Or getting better even without taking anything?Most people who make these outright claims are the...distributors.Be aware that I read two people (on medical journals) had liver failure from what is linked to Noni juice, taking the standard dosage of 1 ounce a day (actually one woman took 2 liters over 3 months). (30 mL daily developing liver failure in about 3 months--about Liters...30 mL daily for 90 days = 2700 mL. This is 2.7 Liters, so she took less than one ounce a day.) Both had no prior history of liver problems.Though this liver failure/toxicity is rare, it STILL happened.How does it interact with other medications? I don't know. I wouldn't want to be the guinae pig that finds out either.Just be careful when you deal with herbal cures. The miracle claims are no different than thousands of other snake oil treatments, and mostly from the distributors. The FDA does NOT regulate herbal cures, so their toxicity, effectiveness, etc., etc. are unknown.Don't say I didn't warn you.
