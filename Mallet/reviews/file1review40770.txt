review/text: This saves so much time!! Do you ever get home from the gym at 7 and have to be ready for a date at 8? This razor is great because it saves the time of using shaving cream. You just put it under the water for a second, then use it where ever you need to shave! Arms, legs, even bikini area! I shave every other day, and the cartridge lasts about 2 weeks, which is the same length of time that I kept any other kind of razor. The cartridges are a bit on the expensive side, but I don't mind paying for such an ingenius product.
