review/text: I have super sensitive normal to dry skin with red blotchy patches on my cheeks all year round (not sure what it is from but in Winter my skin gets very red with eczema). I thought I had just about tried every cleanser recommended with no big relief. Someone suggested this brand of cleanser & of course I "thought" another over priced cleanser that is going to dry my skin out, WOW what a super pleasant surprise! First off it's quite concentrated so you don't need much (bonus there!) & after washing my face (& I REALLY mean this) for the absolute 1st time my skin felt clean, refreshed, & not all tight & dry as usual! This cleanser is liquid gold to my skin! I love it & would recommend it to anybody. If you think it's maybe to expensive do a search & see if you can find a free sample as I did first but I am certainly ordering a bottle of this! I just can't say anything bad about it & I do speak my mind! Highly recommended:)
