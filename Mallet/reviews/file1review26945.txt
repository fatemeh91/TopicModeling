review/text: First I wanna say that the reason i picked this brand was because it has won awards for best protein supplement product and because it was very popular on amazons most purchased list. I am reviewing the Cookies and Cream flavor and if i blind tasted this product i would not be able to guess and flavor. The flavor isnt so much cookies and cream but a sweet something. I also would not be able to tell you this is a protein powder shake because 1 scoop in a blender bottle has 0 chalky texture. There is no chalky flavor just sugar milk. I am going to increase the amount of milk per 1 scoop because it has that same sugar effect as Yoo-Hoo cholcate milk. Its a bit sweet but not chalky. I will continue to use this product.
