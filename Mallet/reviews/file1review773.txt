review/text: This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and "cold body syndrome" which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower. Within one half hour of taking this guggul, my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours. Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while.
