review/text: O.N.'s Whey Gold Standard is the best out there. It's pure, and it can be added easily to your other supplements. I wouldn't buy anything under 5lbs because your going to have to use a few scoops per day for any results. Don't be fooled by many other Whey products that have fillers, like ones you can buy from Walmart. Amazon has the best price for the 5 pound container. Get it.
