review/text: I have purchase two of the Bissell sweepers; one for my home and the other for the office. I use it to pick up various things that get tracked in on the floor and snacks dropped by by 2 year old. Sometimes it is not practical to run a noisy vacuum cleaner during business hours so it perfect for tidying up.As far as the complaints with the handle, I have had no problems with the two I have purchased. However, you do need to tamp the handle down firmly to prevent it from coming apart. The garage floor worked best for me.
