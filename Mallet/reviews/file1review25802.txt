review/text: This is a good product. However, it does not contain any fish oil. Keep in mind that the current research indicates that DHA and EPA (found in fish oil) are responsible for supporting heart health. I personally take this product in conjunction with NOW's Ultra Omega 3Now Foods Ultra Omega 3, Fish Oil Soft-gels, 180-Countto get the best of both worlds.
