review/text: I originally got this because I was taking a bunch of flights in a short period, and I needed some relief from terrible airplane seats. This thing worked very well on planes, although it sometimes pushed me too close to the seat in front if there wasn't much legroom.Anyway I began using this every day in my office maybe a month or two ago, and it has worked great there too. Unfortunately, it now doesn't seem to hold air, or as much as it used to, so the support is provides is much diminished. I'm not sure if this will still be usable on planes in the future, but I'm definitely going to have to get a different one for every day use. Of course, this thing also only costs $15 (at least on Amazon right now), so I can't really complain that it didn't last that long under every day use.I still give this four stars because it did do the job while it lasted, and it's honestly more convenient to have this while traveling, rather than a full size cushion that doesn't deflate.
