review/text: When I bought my Evolt E-500 it came with a genuine Olympus battery, and I bought a knockoff to use as a hot spare. Admittedly they are new and performance will degrade over time, but in identical conditions the genuine Olympus lasts up to 500 pictures and the knockoff barely 300. I bought a second Olympus battery and have more confidence going out into the field.
