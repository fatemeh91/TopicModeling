review/text: I found this lube on a trip to Good Vibrations in San Francisco. The very helpful sales assistant gave me a lube lecture, explaining the differences in silicon-, oil- and water-based lubricants. Liquid silk felt the most natural of all the lubricants I checked out in the store, and it does not get sticky like other water-based lubricants. It's the best!
