review/text: this is a great tool for the home and office. I am a busy mother, who sometimes doesn't have time to go for a massage. After 3 uses, this tool pays for itself. Go easy on the first time you use it. You would not be able to treat all the knots on your back with one session. Limit yourself to 30 minutes on the back, if you go more than that, you would be causing damage to the muscles. One session every 3-5 days is enough to start and then once a week, and then biweekly, and later as you need it. Great invention!!! it melted the pain away while I watched TV.
