review/text: Today 9/21/2012 I received my first bottle of Fertilaid in the mail. As soon as I got it I went ahead and took a pill and have also taken the second pill today tonight I will take the 3rd one. My husband and I are trying to have a baby. I have faith that this will work but I'm also nervous that I'll get my hopes up. I have been reading all the reviews and most of them sound great. I just want to know if this is really real? is it really going to help get us pregnant? I'm keeping the faith in it but if anybody has already used it id be happy to hear what you have to say about the product. I believe the reviews but I would believe more if it was being told to me. Thanks! Good luck to me and anybody else trying :)
