review/text: My buddy swears by this stuff but I think he's over it ;)Now I'm not much of a lube dude in my personal usage but I got a little sex toy along the way and I'm sure glad I had the ID!My bud claims it made things nice and tingly... don't know about that, I didn't notice my pants getting hot or anything ... this stuff seems good although I don't have much to compare it to.You can add water, rubbing alcohol (yeeeouch!) and other wetness to reinvigorate the lube if you've outrubbed its slickness.When used with a condom it was fine, good even... I didn't really get clear feedback on whether my lady gave a crap about this particular brand but my buddy's old lady seemed to like it quite a lot. Your mileage may very.This stuff is a fun alternative to not-having lube... I'd recommend it if you're luking for some loob ;)
