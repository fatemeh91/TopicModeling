review/text: This was recommended to me by my dentist and has really improved the health of my teeth and gums. If nothing else, the fact that there is a timer which counts down (I think it's two minutes) will help you make sure you do a good job on your teeth. The action of the tooth brush really gets things clean though. According to my dentist, the way this thing works, it gives you the same effect as flossing, although she said it is not a replacement for flossing.Had my first checkup after using this and got good results. My gums are looking at lot better than they were previously, as are my teeth.I had a Sonicare for several years and like this one better. Sonicare is great, but this has the circular action, which I prefer to the back and forth.
