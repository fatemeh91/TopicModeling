review/text: The Baldfader I ordered did not work. I carefully followed the instructions for aligning the blades, contacted Wahl and followed their troubleshooting instructions and still could not get the clippers to cut at all - they just scratched up my scalp. I promptly returned them and just got a small and less expensive beard trimmer at my local pharmacy, which has worked just fine. It may have been anomalous, but my experience was very poor.
