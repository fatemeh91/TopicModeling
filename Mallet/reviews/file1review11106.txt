review/text: I got to say, emergen c orange doesn't taste too bad, and sometimes when i drink it, it makes me very relaxed. I don't really know how much of an effect it has on any illness, but its worth a shot. It really doesn't have any side effects from what I saw. If you're someone that drinks alcohol, smokes and chugs caffeine, don't even waste your money on this or any vitamin supplement.
