review/text: We fell into the new items that seemed like must haves and found must we could live without. But Bibsters are a new item that we can't like without!We lost 3 before having our daughter so she is spoiled to say the least. She is typically dressed from head to toe in matching Gymboree so bibs are a must come feeding time. Cloth bibs were to messy to deal with so we picked up a box of these. These are great! The big ones cover the entire front of her top and they absorb any liquids she might slip without allowing it to soak to the shirt. Plus when you're done you toss them!But what would you expect from Pamper's...nothing less that a great item in our case!
