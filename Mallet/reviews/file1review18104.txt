review/text: This eye mask is awesome if you want some room between your eyes and the mask. That was always my pet peeve with other sleep masks. It also acts like "goggles" so your eye is enclosed and light doesn't seep through. It's a perfect fit for my face, but I see from other reviews that it doesn't work for everyone. I have a thin and narrow face with high cheekbones if that helps.My only gripe is that after a year (I know, a year is a long time), the bottom of the inner liner is peeling away from the outer part of the mask. I think elmer's glue would hold it in place when I decide I must fix it. For now, it doesn't affect the performance or comfort of the mask.I highly recommend this one. I've tried the other bucky masks and the flat type of masks and this one is FAR superior in comfort and light-blocking!WARNING: I just ordered a new one and got the blue/brown floral combo. I ordered that one because it was the cheapest one for some reason. Now I know why! The first one I had was chocolate brown - no problems. The blue/brown floral one SMELLS like petrochemicals. It's this horrible nauseating gasoline off-gasing odor. I tried washing it lightly in the sink tonight, so we'll see if that helps and if it doesn't peel like the other one did after washing. I still feel that despite these setbacks, having room for your eyeballs is a huge necessity, so I will continue to use these masks and will purchase in the future (although in chocolate brown, not a petrochemical pattern)!
