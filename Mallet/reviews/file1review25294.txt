review/text: I am having great results with this product. I started taking it as recommended in "Fatigued to Fantastic" and noticed that my severe back and hip pain was improving quite a lot. I then got cocky and just forgot to take it for a few days. I woke up in the same old pain as I had prior to taking the End Pain pills. I quickly took a few that morning and instantly noticed an improvement. I won't stop again! I just ordered a few more bottles just to be on the safe side.
