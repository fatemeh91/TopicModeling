review/text: I have been using this patch for about 6 weeks and I have just placed my second order. Is it "the answer" to all weight loss problems? Does the fat melt off magically? No. But I have lost 5 pounds this month without doing anything different. And that is something different for me...because I do not lose weight easily...even with starving and exercise. You see, I am over 50 and the weight came on within the last 8 years. 5 pounds is not a lot....but this time next year....maybe I will be a size 3!!! Just a joke. But...I am going to re-order, and see where this goes!
