review/text: This arthritis cream works wonders. It is like a dream come true. My knees bother me, so I put some Australian Dream on them, just a small amount. I didn't detect any smell or surface response such as cooling or heating. In about a half hour, the joints were much better. I didn't reapply it for about a week, and was delighted that the effect was so long lasting.
