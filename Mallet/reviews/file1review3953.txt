review/text: I had used Eugalan Topfer Forte in the past after having taken antibiotics. This product will help anyone recover from the damaging effects of antibiotic use. I had difficulty remembering the name of the product and local health food stores did not carry Eugalan Topfer. After several internet attempts trying to recall the name I found the product. This product is better than all other probiotics or yogurt that I have taken for this purpose, especially those in pill form. Once mixed as per directions, Eugalan Topfer is a tasty, easily consumed beverage with a vanilla flavor. You will enjoy the flavor and health benefits.
