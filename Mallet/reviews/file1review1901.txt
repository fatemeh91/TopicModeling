review/text: Wow!What a pleasant surprise!This was intended for my husband,he has been having toenail fungus for a couple of years now.Not really knowing what to expect,having read and re- read the reviews decided to give it a chance.Wow!He has been using this soap for a month.Every evening before shower,he applies a few drops and rubs it on the affected nail and leaves it there for 5 to 10 minutes. A month later boy oh boy what a change!For a start the black colour on his toenail has completely disappeared,the overall condition has improved!Such a relief.Thanks again!
