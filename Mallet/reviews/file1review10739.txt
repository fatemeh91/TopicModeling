review/text: I have been taking heavy doses of medications, mostly vitamins, for over 3 years. In that time I've searched for a way to keep all of my pills straight. I have the little ones and I have the Big Ones, but everyone has the same problem. How do you keep track of them so you take them when they are due. These little boxes do the trick. My Pharmacist gave me a pill box when I had been released from the hospital. The problem was it help the whole week, not just the one day. I don't know if I'm going to live long enough to take Friday's pill but I am here long enough to take today's, Tuesday, pills. Why should I be taking a whole week with me when all I need is one day. These little boogers solve all of the problems and they are one of the most inexpensive pill box on the market.I grab today's pill box, slip it in my pocket, and I'm off for the day. I have found that the lids fold all the way back and stays open for use any time of the day. They fasten securely so my arthritic fingers can get them open, and they are some what water resistant to the coffee others will spill . If you can find a better one let me know. I've found them in the deep size and the not so deep size. They are pretty much the same. BTW, They made great stocking stuffers for the holidays.Good Pill SuckingJohn in ABQ New Mexico
