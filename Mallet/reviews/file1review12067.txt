review/text: I think these tablets are good. I'm pregnant but can't seem to feel any different taking them. Plus I am scared to take one pill everyday due to the high level of Vitamin A and it's effect on the growing fetus. The daily recommended Vitamin A should not exceed 2500 units while this vitamins offers up to 4000 units of Vitamin A. BE CAREFUL CONSULT WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THESE AS YOU MAIN PRENATAL VITAMIN THROUGHOUT YOUR PREGNANCY.
