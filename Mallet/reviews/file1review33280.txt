review/text: Don't get me wrong. This heat wrap feels wonderful and has the contours that heating pads and other hot packs lack. I can't complain about that. My only problem with this wrap is that it loses it's ability to retain heat for long periods of time the more you microwave it. I am not sure why, because I have the warming booties from this same company and they retain heat just like they did the very first time I used them. So, I am not sure what is going on with the shoulder wrap.The first time I used it, the heat lasted close to an hour. Now it lasts about 20 minutes before the heat levels off significantly. However,I would still recommend it just for the coverage it offers. It covers the top part of your back down to the middle of your shoulder blades and across the top of your shoulder and down you chest to about two inches past the collarbone. It is very malleable, so you can adjust where the herbal balls go if you need more heat in certain areas. I love that feature!! I also use it on other areas of my body because it can easily take whatever shape you need and it is sorta heavy, so it stays put!! It is also very aromatic. At first the smell was very overpowering, but that also fades the more you use the wrap. Overall I am not disappointed that I bought it. It is certainly better than anything else I have used thus far and it eases the pain from my arthritis and fibromyalgia enough that I don't use my painkillers as often, which is a good thing!
