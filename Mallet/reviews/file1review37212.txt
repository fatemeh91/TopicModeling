review/text: I am a paraplegic. As such my hands and wrists get strained and sore often. I do not have arthritis.I noticed some heat but nothing to write home about. I do have the correct size but the compression aggravates my condition. I think just a decent set of warm gloves or a muffler works much better for me.I never have been a fan of fingerless gloves but you will need the feature if you get these. They have enough compression that getting them on and especially off is not easy. You will be wearing them while you do things. Even if it is just punching a remote, writing or handling small items. I'm left to wonder how the reviewer that likes theirs gets them on and off as it takes dexterity and a good pinch grip to get your fingers to release. I can do it but I imagine someone elderly with arthritis having quite a time. Maybe the other reviewer has assistance.If you can't pinch and pull very well you will probably need help getting them off. But if compression aids in pain relief you may like them. I have good circulation and did not notice much warmth at all. Maybe only those with "cold hands" will notice a benefit.If possible find someplace local to try out first. Good LuckOne last thing. These are made of a neoprene like material and all the seams are sewn to stick out. So the gloves are like wearing something inside out but with stiff seams sticking out around the fingers. I found it agravating when using my fingers and hands. You may be able to see in picture. just be aware of this. they're made to be smooth againt the skin but are a bit rough on the outside what with all the seams sticking up.
