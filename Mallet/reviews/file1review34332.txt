review/text: These are exactly what I was looking for. The brand that I used to use went "out of business" aka "hard to find anywhere". So when I found these online, I ordered a lifetime's worth. When you see the collection of lint etc that collects in this bag after even just a few washings you are so happy to be using these. They attach to the end of washing machine hose as the dirty wash water is flushed away. The stuff in the lint trap would otherwise be flushed down the drain eventually going to the city main water drain. The bulk of the lint could eventually clog up the narrow pipes in you house and eventually you'd have to call for a plumber for drain cleaning. So this simple little product saves you a lot of money over time. These bags are much better than the metal lint trap that is stuffed into the tub drain hole. To remove those, you really have to touch them. When the mesh bag is removed, you don't really have to touch the gunk in the bag. That's what like most.
