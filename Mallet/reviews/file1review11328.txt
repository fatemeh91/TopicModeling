review/text: This is one of those items that you cannot buy online, at least without 1st trying it on in person. The one I bought was too small and would only have been useful for a specific set of circumstances. This may be a case of self-medication that is wrong; the knee is our most fragile joint, given the stresses it is under; to put so much force onto it, such as these bandages, without doctor supervision, may be a mistake.
