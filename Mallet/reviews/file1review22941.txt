review/text: My wife and I both like our carpet sweeper very much. It picks up fibers (threads) and dirt from regular carpet as well as indoor-outdoor carpet that our last vacuum cleaner missed. It is lightweight but sturdy. It is quite easy to handle. We like the brushes at the four corners. It is a terrific bargain!
