review/text: I bought this stuff with huperzine and they are both the same size pill. When I take thems, (1 pill each) it kind of feels like I'm not myself. It is a little weird because I'm still in control, but the anxiety of speaking doesn't affect me. It may be a stretch to say that it gives a confidence boost, but it certainly feels like it seeing as I'm saying things I usually wouldn't. I can confidently say that this isn't a placebo.HOWEVER, be warned that if you don't eat anything or if you take too many you are going to get nausea which won't make you hurl or anything, but it will make you feel unpleasant/uncomfortable. Nonetheless, good stuff.
