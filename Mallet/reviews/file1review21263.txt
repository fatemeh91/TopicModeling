review/text: I love the Sonic Complete, especially because I'm one of those people who need a brush with a head on it like a real toothbrush...not a small round one. This brush does the job, removing plaque effectively. I'm a dental hygienist, and have used the Sonicare (which stopped working), and the other Oral B Braun round head brushes. I prefer the Sonic Complete.
