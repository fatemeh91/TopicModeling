review/text: Our bodies are odd critters that handle things differently at different times in our lives. I tried this supplement years ago for joint pain and did not feel it was at all helpful to me, although my old dog seem to have a bit more life in him when he used it at the recommendation of my vet. Now I have full blown arthritis and a knee that hurts all the time. So I am taking it again. It is helpful, although not magic. Losing more weight and more exercise is the magic I need now to avoid or delay knee replacement. I have had very good experiences over years with Nature Made products and generally trust that they give me what they say they put in the bottle. I think it is the best product I can find at a reasonable price on the market today. My experience with Amazon and this product is positive.
