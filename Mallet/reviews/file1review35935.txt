review/text: I had one of these when I was younger. My mom got it for me when I had braces and it really helped keep my teeth super clean.I'm glad I was able to find this toothbrush again. The design has been updated since my last brush, but it works as I remembered it. My teeth feel so clean and so much cleaner than using a sonicare brush.
