review/text: I ordered this on a Saturday night. I had it the following Saturday morning. I would have liked to have seen it ship sooner. I think it would have shipped the next Monday, however i believe it was on Wednesday when it actually went out. My only reasoning was I am a paramedic and needed my stethoscope back in service as quick as possible, therefore i ordered 2 just incase for the next time. Quality is top notch and the diaphragm works just as the original did (light pressure for high tones and firm pressure for deep tones). It would have been 5 out of 5 stars if it shipped on Monday!
