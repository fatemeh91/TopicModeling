review/text: This product is a complete waste of money. It does nothing more than a normal laxative can do, however the side effects are a lot worse. This product causes severe bloating and cramping. As the manufacturer tells you, it also causes loose stools. Don't expect to travel far from a bathroom while you use this product -- you need to have it close by at all times, as your ability to hold your bowel movements in for longer than 30 seconds will be extremely compromised. Also, if you have a work out routine -- completely forget about doing it while on Oxy Powder -- you will not be able to work out for longer than 5 minutes without running to the bathroom. This is a complete waste of money.
