review/text: Avoid delicious strawberry.. It has to be one of worst tasting proteins I've had.. The chocolates (extreme milk and double rich), creamy french vanilla, cookies and cream taste pretty good... Going to try rocky road next..Update: Rocky road is great.. 5 stars for gold standard all together.. But now ON has decided to no longer participate in the subscribe and save plan.. Sure going to miss that.. Delivered just in time for the previous one to run out..
