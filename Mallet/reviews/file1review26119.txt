review/text: I love this lotion. I have tried lots and lots of lotions and I have decided that this is the best hand lotion for me (most other lotions leave me with dry hands after 45 minutes or so) This lotion does not feel greasy, it keeps my hands moisturized for much longer periods of time than the others, it does not have any smells, and I like the way my hands feels after application. I wash my hands or get them wet doing dishes, house chores, etc., about once an hour or two.
