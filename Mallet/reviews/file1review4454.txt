review/text: I figured I would try these razors because Amazon.com has a great return policy if it turned out that these were fake, but I see no indication at all that these are not the real thing. I've been using the same style razor for a few years, and its quality and longevity are superb. Some people are so convinced that something "will be" fake, that even when the real thing is in front of them, they won't see it. I am happy I took a chance to try these out, I will buy them again.
