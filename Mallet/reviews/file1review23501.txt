review/text: I do not have IBS but this was recommended to me by a friend who does as a fiber supplement. I have been very pleased with it. I have been working on finding the right dose for me and following the directions to increase it gradually. Right now I am at 1 teaspoon in the morning and 1 teaspoon at night, and that seems to be about right.I wanted to comment on the reviews about it clumping. I like to drink it with plain water which I get from the dispenser in my refrigerator. The instructions say to stir it with a fork when you add liquid but since I have to press on a button with the cup to get the water it is impossible. But I have found that I just put the fiber in the cup, add the liquid and stir with a fork afterwards as best I can. I do get plenty of clumps, but then I just put my cup in the refrigerator to keep it cold, and let it sit for about 5 -10 minutes, or even longer. Then whenever I remember I just go and it is crystal clear, all the clumps are gone and it is nice and icy cold. I usually just leave the fork right in the cup when I put it in the fridge so I can stir it one more time to make sure it is all blended. I try to plan ahead and do it before I walk my dog, then when I get back and am thirsty I have a nice glass of water ready to go, and I am drinking my fiber too!
