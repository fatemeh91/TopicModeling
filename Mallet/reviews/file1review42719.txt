review/text: I have MS, and a friend with MS recommended this as helping her fatigue and cognitive fogginess. I have both. It helps me enough that I continue taking it. I take 3 per day. I got a book on Rhodiola and learned that you should take it on an empty stomach, which I do. I highly recommend it. This is the only brand that was studied scientifically. I understand there are many brands out there, and not all may be standardized as this one is.
