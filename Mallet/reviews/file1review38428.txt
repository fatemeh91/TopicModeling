review/text: I used a much older epilator and really liked it, but it had seen its last days. So I got this one. I didnt feel any pain, probably because I had been using one for so long. The OPTIMA is great. Its small-fits in the palm of your hand and is contoured. It's not for the face just the body. I had never used my old one on my underarms-just a regular razor. But I did use this OPTIMA under my arms and had no pain at all. Bye the way, in the years that I've used an epilator I've never had an ingrown hair. I like using the epilators because the hair takes longer to grow in and is much finer over time. When the companines say that it's not just a selling ploy-its the truth. A definite bonus.
