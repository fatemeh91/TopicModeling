review/text: These gloves are awesome. I work on medical and lab instruments. Gloves are mandatory.(blood exposure) Gloves are plentiful and available at all my customer sites. Unfortunately the gloves are very thin and/or too small. Because I am doing mechanical repairs they break and tear all the time. On site gloves usually lasted less than 5 minutes.I bought a box of these and have not had a torn glove since. They are durable, have good tactile feel and textured grippy finger pads. I feel very secure and safe from unexpected exposure.I no longer drop tools.Thumbs up!
