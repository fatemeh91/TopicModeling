review/text: I have owned this product for nearly three weeks now and I love it simply because it really works! I have yet to spot a single spider or mice. The main reason that I bought this unit was to repel rodents away from my car. I just spent $4500.00 on my car to replace the engine wires and the main computer that was fried due to the rodents chewing on engine wires! This unit is really fantastic, I no longer see rat/mice trails any where near my house. There is only one thing that I 'm trying to find out and that is, why some of my guests can actually hear the unit? Not that this bothers me at all but I though humans were not supposed to hear the low frequency that this unit generates.
