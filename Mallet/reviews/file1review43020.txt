review/text: I had a hayfever attack at my parent's house and I took some allergy medication. However, it takes a long time to work. My mom gave me this while I waited for the medication to work -and within a few minutes, my throat stopped itching, my sneezing stopped - it worked very quickly! Highly recommend it.
