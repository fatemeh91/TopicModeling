review/text: Arrived just in time for the 4th of July. I used it on my dogs who are both very afraid of loud noises like fireworks and thunder. It worked like a charm! I will always keep this on hand. Living in KS, we get lots of strong thunderstorms. I've used it several times with great results each time. It just calms the dogs and they're able to relax and even sleep through the storms.
