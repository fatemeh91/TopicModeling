review/text: I bought 2 of these matress covers in a twin size to fit my toddlers "big girl bed". They are great. The cover has elastic on all sides so you get a good fit on the matress without it slipping off but not so much that you need help to get it on or off. It has prevented 2 'accidents' that would have damaged the new matress. It's also cushioned and adds some softness to the bed.I am very pleased with the cover.
