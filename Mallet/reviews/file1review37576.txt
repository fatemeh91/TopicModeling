review/text: I've been using Speed Stick deodorant regular for years. It is effective at killing stink. It has a nice smell when you apply it. The smell is not overpowering and it is not noticeable after a few minutes (I have smell sensitivity). This product does not stain clothes or leave any marks. I tried Tom's and Trader Joe's natural deodorant but neither of those worked and I could smell my own BO long before the day was over. While I like to buy products that have no animal testing, I draw the line with BO and use my Speed Stick deodorant. It's great for men or women and it's inexpensive.
