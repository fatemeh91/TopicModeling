review/text: Sometimes in my busy day, I don't have time to stop for a meal. There I've said it. I know it's not healthy and I should. But sometimes it's impossible. Between work and the gym and commuting and everything else. There's just not time.Enter the Cookie Dough Balance Bar, the bestest of all high protein energy bars. It's smooth with little chunks of cookie dough goodness mixed in.
