review/text: i mix it with 3/4 cup of milk and 3 ice cubes - it is wonderful! my trainer suggested i start getting 160 gm of protein a day (1 gm for every pound of body weight) i use this as my breakfast and as a snack before bed. That takes care of 60 grams! I would never make it to 160 without it. The chocolate one doesn't taste nearly as good as the vanilla.
