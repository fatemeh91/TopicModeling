review/text: I originally got this product for my husband and it was so good he told me to try it. I did and it has worked wonders with my "bad knees" that they don't feel bad anymore. I can get up and down with no pain and no "popping" of my joints. This product is wonderful and I'm getting ready to buy some more.
