review/text: I am very hairy, for years I shaved everyday only to feel stubbly, my sister showed me this a year ago. We started with my armpits..very painful the first time, even made me bleed, but I love the results! and the more I use it the less painful it is. For the first time in my life my skin looks and feels smooth..you don't see all the black hair stubs like you do with shaving. So until I find a permenant hair removal solution I'll keep using it...Thanks!
