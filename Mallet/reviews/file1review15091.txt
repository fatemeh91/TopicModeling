review/text: Been taking couple drops Can C/Brite Eyes once a day for at least 10 years if not 15. I don't know if it's working, I don't go to doctors much.Told I had some cataracts long ago.Vision getting slightly worse. Am 68 yrs old. I am a certified/certifiable skeptic but still 'feel' it's working to some extent; my eyes have never been good.What can I say? There's nothing much else to do. Except lots of C and sunglasses and phytochemicals/lutein/zeanthin/red pepper etc.Mike
