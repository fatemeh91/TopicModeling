review/text: Just buy it guys. If you like a quality shave most days of the week then go for it. I switched months ago for a multitude of reasons. Firstly the blades cost dramaticaly less and are of a higher quality than most disposable multibladed cartridges. Secondly, the closness that can be safely achieved means less irritation, thus, less burn and ingrown hairs. Lastly, there is the style element. What a remarkably sturdy, all metal, durable peice of workmanship. Combined with a standard pure bristle brush and a glycerin soap(having the added bonus of not smelling like a deoderant, unlike can gel), this method of 'old school' shaving exfoliates and wakens you up in the morning. Additionaly, unless you have a face that bares a remarkable resemblance to the surface of the moon - I.E. pitted, then there are no more cuts than with 3 or 4 blade razors.
