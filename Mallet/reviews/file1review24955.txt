review/text: I bought this probably a year ago and it has just been sitting in my cabinets because im so bad with taking anything. well i finally started using it because i was so sick of having wacky periods. i started to take it the 1st day of my cycle. and actually i didnt even finish them but let me tell u, i have never had fertility signs in my life! this month i had eggwhite CM and also I ovulated and had a posative OPK. and 30 days later my period came. I know I didnt get pregnant off of it. could be because i didnt BD on my ovulation day but im just happy i got my AF on time. And its funny i dont even have menstral cramps or bloatingness like i usually do. i dont know if it was the pill or what but i love them enough to use them just to get my period on time.
