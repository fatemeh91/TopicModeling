review/text: I have used this product for over sixteen years and found it the best bag on the market! The bags come out of the box and open easily (unlike some others I've used) and are very sturdy and easy to pull out of the trash can with the convenient and strong handles. The bags are easy to tie closed with the handles, but still leave a convenient set of handles to carry the bag to the city bin. They can also be used to store things you want to keep clean and dry but need to access occasionally.AMAZON, PLEASE BRING THIS PRODUCT TO YOUR SITE!!!!!
