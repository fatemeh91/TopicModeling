review/text: I thought I was getting an incredible deal. I purchase the hard tablets from a local store for $15 for 90.When I saw 240 for about $20 i bought on. Only problem? The capsule dosage is SIX capsules vs the hard tablets being THREE. So really I broke even just about.Positive note: The hard tablets smell horrible and taste horrible. The Capsules mask most the smell.DO they work? I've been taking them daily for the last week and still sick BUT I truly believe I would have been MUCH sicker if I didn't take these. My body seems to be fighting hard, its just a wicked cold.
