review/text: I ordered this product on Wednesday morning before 9 and couldn't believe it came the next morning before noon! It is the fastest online purchase I have ever received with Amazon using standard shipping. Was happy to be able to make a protein shake that day when I got home from the gym and found my package on the doorstep. Product is good, not as good as the meal replacement which tasted fine without any additives but it will do and tastes great when you mix in some fruit or fruit juices. I just wish they would put the MET-Rx meal replacement powder in a canister form so there isn't so much wasted packaging material which is why I chose to purchase the MET-Rx Protein Plus in the scoopable form.
