review/text: Plax Anti-Plaque Dental Rinse is a fantastic product. Your teeth really feel cleaner, even before brushing. The peppermint flavor is good, not too strong like some pre-brushing mouthwashes are. I plan to continue using this product and would have no problem recommending it to my friends and family.
