review/text: This is absolutely amazing. We had something die (rat, bird,?) in our attic and could not get to it to remove it. We had 3 different handymen try to get to the dead animal and even cut a hole in the ceiling of our bathroom where the smell was but could not reach it. So we were told that we had to let it go until the odor disappeared. The odor was horrendous, to the point that we couldn't use that bathroom. I purchased Natural Magic Odor Absorbing Gel, Citrus Scent and the odor disappeared almost immediately. Seriously, it was magic for us. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. If it works on the smell of dead animals, it should work for anything. I wouldn't care if it only lasted a month, it saved our sanity.
