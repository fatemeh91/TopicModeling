review/text: The monitor works as designed, however, it consistantly reads my BP about 6 to 10 points lower than the larger Omron model with the arm cuff. Tried to contact Omron via email and was unsucessful. I was instructed to call, which does not work for me. Therefore I adjusted my thinking regarding the readings I'm receiving.
