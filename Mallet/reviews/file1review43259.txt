review/text: Around the 22 week mark of my twin pregnancy, I knew I needed some support for my ever-growing uterus. I found out about the Prenatal Cradle through a book on twins. I had tried several maternity belts out before & had to return them, as they did not provide enough support.I found it easy to adjust to & comfortable to wear.I am now almost 32 weeks pregnant, and I still wear my Prenatal Cradle Best Cradle every single day. If I don't wear it, I have more frequent contractions & both my belly and back hurt.
