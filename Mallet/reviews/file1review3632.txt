review/text: I used just regular ceramabryte and yellow scrubber for months (I couldn't find a store that carried the scraper). It does a great job if you are diligent about cleaning. But to get off the small spatter marks that cook on quickly, I needed the scraper. My stove top looked brand new afterward.
