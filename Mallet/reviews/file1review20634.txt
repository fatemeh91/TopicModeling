review/text: My Braun electric shaver uses this cutter and foil. Its instructions suggest that they should be changed every 18 months. If you want to keep getting a reasonably quick, close shave, I'd recommend doing it once a year. I'm getting a MUCH better, MUCH faster shave with the new cutter and foil.
