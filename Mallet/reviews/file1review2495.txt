review/text: This book is used in homeopathic studies in colleges. It is an excellent resource on identifying, recognizing and knowing exactly what flower you are working with and what it's purposes are. Everything from how to ease a belly ache to how to sooth a scar or tend to anxiety is in this book. It's a wonderful 'teacher' in it's very pages.
