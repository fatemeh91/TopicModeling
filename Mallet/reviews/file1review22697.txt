review/text: I heard that this product doesn't REALLY work. It's just that you THINK it will work that makes it work. So then it works?It does seem to take the edge off and make me feel a little better when I'm feeling particularly stressed. I've also given it to my dog when there are thunder storms and it helps him as well. I've had a friend give it to her great dane puppy after he kept destroying his bed/crate and he stopped freaking out at night (p.s. -- if you have a great dane puppy, letting it sleep in bed with you while it's little is not a good idea. It will get BIG and still want to sleep with you and destroy your house if you don't let it.)Anyway, I'm a fan of Rescue Remedy. It works for me, so I'll continue to keep it on hand!
