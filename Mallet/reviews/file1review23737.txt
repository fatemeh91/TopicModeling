review/text: These orthotics were recommended by my podiatrist for plantar's fascitus. They are comfortable and began relieving the condition fairly soon (now it seems I'm completely heeled [yuck-yuck]). (To be fair, I also applied occasional icing in the evenings and exercised my ankles every morning.)These orthotics are kind of chunky and may not fit (together with your feet ;^) in some low profile shoes.
