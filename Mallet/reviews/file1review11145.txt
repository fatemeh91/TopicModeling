review/text: Of the pack of 12 lint roller refills (which I love) 3 of them were defective in that they would stick to the inside of the actual roller and was hell getting off. That ruined the refill use and one of my rollers as well. I did, however, contact the Scotch company and they replaced these refills. They sent me a box to send the defective ones back. I am now a afraid to order these in bulk again. May or may not. But I do love the way they remove cat hair.
