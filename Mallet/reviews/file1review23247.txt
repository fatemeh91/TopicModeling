review/text: Im glad I read reviews reminding to hammer the segments together. My pieces have not come apart since my daughter tried it out before I was finished assembling. We both use it and she loves it. It picks up quite well much better than I had expected. Hopefully she can start helping me out more with this. I havent emptied it out yet although I know its full. One issue is the rubber bumper keeps coming off its annoying but not a deal breaker and not really necessary for us anyway.
