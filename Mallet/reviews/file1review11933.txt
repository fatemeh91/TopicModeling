review/text: I am a huge Rainbow Light fan. I started taking these prenatal vitamins while I was trying to get pregnant, took them through my whole pregnancy and post natal too. I just love them. I love that they are all natural and contain *extras* not found in any other vitamins like - super greens, enzymes, ginger (for nasuea), raspberry leaves, etc. I've never had trouble swallowing the pills. Highly recommend!
