review/text: This is a pretty amazing product, especially as it's organic. I spent the summer working outside doing forest restoration and it worked fine with a single spray for each arm on most days. I don't sweat too much, but even the hottest and most humid days (100 degrees and mid-Atlantic humidity hauling stuff around) only required 2-3 sprays to be effective. It seems to last a long time too, after 5 months use it's still 3/4 full.
