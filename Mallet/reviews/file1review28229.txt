review/text: I first tried it by simply blending a scoop full with just water. I could not bare the taste of it. However, during the second time, instead of using water, I used V8 juice. It definitely made it more bearable and easy to drink. I also tried blending it with a cup of milk and a frozen banana. It came out very thick with a consistency of a smoothie. It tasted good, but I think I still like blending it with V8 juice.
