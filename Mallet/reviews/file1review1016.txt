review/text: I did not see a increase in supply with this product. I did notice that my pumped milk was more fatty after sitting in the fridge though. I was taking a double dose and took it round the clock, never missing a dose. I am past a year of breastfeeding and that may be why I did not see a boost. The alcohol taste is completely disgusting. I felt like my breath reaked of the alcohol afterwards and I just couldn't rid the taste from my mouth for several hours. If I try it again with future children, I will definately make sure I get the alcohol free version!
