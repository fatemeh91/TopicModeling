review/text: I have owned an ADAPT-A-LAP from the very first time (Mr. Blum) invented it. I have arthritis and my hands HURT. I am able READ books large and small. It adjusts and is extremely portable. And you don't loose your page. I also have the waist strap so I can read in my hammock!!! Thank you, again, ED.!!!(Ps You didn't leave me your NEW PHONE NUMBER!!) ;) I have used it for at least eleven years.
