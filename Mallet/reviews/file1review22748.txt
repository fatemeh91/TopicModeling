review/text: I didn't take this product to burn fat as I don't believe there is a product that can. I started using this product after 1 year of supplement free training. I hit a plateau once I reached 160 pounds & 10% body fat and wanted more definition. Thats when I started taking Animal Cuts.At the end of my first cycle I went from looking defined, and in pretty good shape, to lean and cut. The definition in my arms and abs finally came through and whatever 'puffyness' that was on my body melted away. I already had all that muscle when I started Cuts, it just wasn't coming through. Animal Cuts helped me to take the next step to define and expose the lean muscle that I already had.Also, many people complain about all the pills that you have to take. To me, thats the BEST part about it! You have the ability to pick and choose which pills you do or do not want to take. For example, if your body doesn't respond well to caffeine or you are uncomfortable with the jittery feeling, then simply remove the caffeine portion of the pack!I think this product should only be used by people who are in a similar situation as me. If you still have to burn a few more pounds or gain a bit more muscle, then I wouldn't suggest this product. I don't believe it will help you burn fat as much as cardio and steady diet will. But, if you've reached you goals (weight and body fat % wise) and are ready to expose the muscle you've worked hard for, then take Animal Cuts.
