review/text: Yes it does have a "lullaby" scent which we LOVE!! If you have allergies or are sensitive to scent you may not way to buy an entire case. However, we love it so much my husband and I now wash our clothes in it too. Its a great delicate formula that you can use on anything from baby clothes to lingere.
