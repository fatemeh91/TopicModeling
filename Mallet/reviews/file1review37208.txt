review/text: I am 28, 5'6" average build, average hands (you know, my ring finger is a standard 7). I ordered the medium and they were slightly big. Almost right, but not snug enough to feel like they would help. So I sent them back and they quickly and happily sent me a pair of smalls. These fit nice and snug, however I couldn't bend my fingers without the fabric pushing my knuckles straight. I was nervous to alter them, but I ended up cutting almost an inch off of each finger and now they fit great. I think for a man, or a person with longer fingers they would be fine, but for someone like me, don't be afraid to cut them until they feel right. In the photo, they are shown above the knuckle, which is how they came, but I felt the fabric was a little too ridgid (but that's what makes it supportive) to have cover my already sore knuckles. That could be me though. They don't fray either, so don't worry to take the sciccors to them.I have yet to wash them, so I don't know how that will be, but they are comfortable and so far don't make my hands all sweaty. I don't notice the "warmth" that is supposed to make you feel better, but I definitly feel more supported while wearing them.UPDATE: A year late (with occational use) and many washing- where I cut them to make them the right size, the stitching has come all undone. I will have to resew each finger, which is not too bad, but the material itself has not frayed.
