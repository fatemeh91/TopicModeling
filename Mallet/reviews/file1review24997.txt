review/text: I just got this on the 21st and I've only been taking it for 4 days. Well low and behold, I've started my period after over 70 days of not having one. If this is how it's going to be with these pills, then I'm all for it! I've been irregular since my first period, so this is a nice change. Can't wait to see what else these pills have in store for me! Will keep everyone updated :)
