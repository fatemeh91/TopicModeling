review/text: I am not giving it five starts as I have not become pregnant yet. Will update if I do for sure, as I know it will give hope other to women going through the same as me. I am on my second bottle but will keep taking it because it helped me ovulate (which doesn't happen normally). I was diagnosed with PCOS and me and my husband have been ttc for over a year and a half. I was also on Clomid for three months and I didn't get pregnant.So, I decided to try something natural. Started a diet to help my PCOS (no milk products and no wheat, high protein) and regular exercise. Just bought a fertility monitor (instead of the pharmacy ovulation tests, as they can be hard to read) like a month ago and surprisingly it showed that I ovulated this month. So, FertilAid definitely helped with that besides making my periods very regular (30 days).
