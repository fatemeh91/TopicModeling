review/text: I was ready to go to the doc and do the laser thing. I was miserable. I thought I'd give the natural remedies a try before going that route. So last week, I purchased Fargelin tablets on Amazon and am taking 3 pills, 3 times-a-day. I also bought Avatrol capsules here on Amazon and am taking one of those caps once-a-day. I also purchased some Mayinglong Musk hemroid ointment here on Amazon. (Good stuff!) It's been just one-week since I embarked on this plan of attack and the 'roids' have shrunk and all my pain is GONE! I don't know which one worked the wonder, or if it has been a combo of all, but whatever it is, I am so thankful for the relief. I also purchased Yerba Prima psyllium husks at Amazon (not Metamucil) and am now regular as a Swiss train. Total cost was about $120 but has saved me from a $2,500 operation. A GREAT return on investment! I hope and pray you have similar results. All the best!
