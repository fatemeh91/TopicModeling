review/text: Not sure how I'd even sleep without this stuff. It really helps relax plus does stop the brain from over-firing (meaning if the mind happens to be spinning about events of the day or great ideas for the next day). I take 3 a half hour before going to bed and sleep soundly through the night. A beautiful thing!
