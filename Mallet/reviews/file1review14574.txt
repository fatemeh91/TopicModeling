review/text: I've owned several Sabona's over the past 20 years or so. This one is lighter weight and has more magnets than any of the other bracelets from Sabona. The catch is very unique...when you open it, it still has a hook that retains it on your wrist so that you can't lose it (as I have already done with two before)...so, yes, it takes a small amount of work to remove (I never do) and you likely won't be able to do so in the dark. I'm a physical man who skis, roller blades, windsurfs, snorkels, bikes, etc. I can't prove that these bracelets work, but I CAN say that I've had many physical injuries from physical activities and none have involved my wrists since I've been wearing these bracelets (one on each wrist). And I originally starting wearing them because I thought my wrists were the weakest part of my body and were the most likely to be injured (I've actually shattered my femur). Makes me wish I had these bracelets on the other parts of my body. Yes, they call this a Ladie's model, however, I found it much more comfortable, lightger weight, and had more magnets than the models labeled as "MEN's" models.
