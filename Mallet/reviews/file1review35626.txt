review/text: I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me. I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose, but that was enough to really affect me. About a week later, I did see that it had faded my brown spot, so it does work, I just couldn't deal with the headaches. It must be very toxic in some way. I would steer clear of it. An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it, but I thought it would be okay for short term use. I guess I was wrong. I am trying the Niacin products now, and so far, no headaches or anything alarming.
