review/text: When I get it down to the right amount of air for the proper support it is wrinkled. Also it's not very wide. Maybe just barely wide enough for my 36" waist. A "PlUS" WAS THE ATTACHED PLASTIC STRAP WITH CLIPS TO HOLD IT IN PLACE ON THE CHAIR. Still it's the most comfortable I've found. My chair is perfect except for it needed just a little lower back support. Now it's perfect, except for the ugly Wrindled cushion on it.
