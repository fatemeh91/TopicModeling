review/text: My parents had one of these all through their 60 year marriage. Since I seldom get around to taking out the electric vacuum cleaner for the kitchen carpet, I thought about this kind. I was delighted to find Bissell still made them and ordered one right away. It performs really well on little crumbs and dog hair and is really easy to empty. My husband was amazed that anything not electric was still worthwhile. Not perfect but a big help and sure worth the money!
