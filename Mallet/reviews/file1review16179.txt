review/text: Great product from a great brand. These are the only full-spectrum vitamin e capsules I can find that are free of all allergens. Most vitamin E caps contain only the d-alpha tocopherol isomer or a complex with d-beta,d-delta, and d-gamma tocopherols. MSM Complete-E contains all the tocopherols plus alpha-, beta-, gamma, and delta-tocotrienols, as they occur in nature and which are normally missing in supplements. A balance is needed as tocotrienols serve very specific purposes for cholesterol reduction, brain and heart health, and cancer prevention. I was getting them from Whole Foods and for some reason they stopped carrying them, so hopefully Amazon will continue to make them available.
