review/text: When I bought this product it came with 3 cans(14 servings/each) which would last me 21 days if I keep up with substituting 2 meals for a shake. I thought it was the best deal at $16.99 but better deal when you subscribe & save. Also, my next ordered, they emailed me saying that I'll doing more savings at $12.43. It can't get anymore better than that. Even if you had a coupon to save a $1 & go to Walmart which cost $7.99 a can. No bueno. Haha. Love this deal they got!
