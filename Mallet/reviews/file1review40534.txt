review/text: A nutritionist suggested I take Liquid Calcium after I complained that calcium carbonate pills were making me constipated. I normally associate calcium or magnesium supplements with the taste of powdered chalk---for that reason I can't stand antacids---so I was a bit skeptical. Surprisingly, the Bluebonnet Blueberry-flavored liquid was not only pleasantly flavored but smooth and easy to swallow. I noticed right away that the cramps in my feet and legs following a long day of walking disappeared. Two caveats, however: the first week I began taking the stuff, I got diarrhea from the magnesium and had to taper the dosage to one tablespoon a day. As my digestive system got used to it, I could slowly increase my intake to the recommended two tablespoons. The other is that the vitamin D3 in Liquid Calcium comes from lanolin. I'm not vegan, but a member of my family is and will not take this supplement on that account. It's too bad: I don't understand why they can't find another source for D3. But it is a good product and I recommend it for those who don't have issues with animal products or lanolin.
