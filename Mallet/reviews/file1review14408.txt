review/text: Me and my husband bought this stuff for my 3 yr old. She gets motion sick in the car just trying to get from home to her doctors office. Knowing this we were very fearful of a 13 hour car drive to NY. This stuff smells absolutely horrible but I am writing about the effectiveness of it not the smell. In the 26 hour car drive, 13 hours one way, my daughter got sick twice. Once going up and once coming back. Both times I think it was actually mine and my husbands fault. We thought of it as regular medicine and applied every four hours or so. It says use as needed but my daughter didn't give us much warning. When we applied it at every restroom stop it worked much better. She was much more cheerful. I would use this again for her because I don't want to give her pills. If you are worried about the smell use in a well ventilated area and apply with q tips. Otherwise hold your breath and wash your hands after applying.
