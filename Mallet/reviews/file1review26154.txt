review/text: I've been so excited to get this in the mail and it finally arrived today! If you're looking for a lip balm, this is it. If you're looking for a lip GLOSS, then look elsewhere. This is exactly what I wanted. I like the natural look with something that gave my lips the moisture they need WITHOUT the gloss. Every lip "balm" I've tried that has worked well just had a little too much shine for me. And the rest that don't give that shine don't moisturize long enough. This is perfect - buttery with a little bit of sandy texture. Rub it well for a few seconds to exfoliate and then it turns into a silky buttery texture that moisturizes like WHOA. Now I don't write reviews. In fact this is my first one. But I just loved it so much that I had to share! Classy glass container too. It's a little bigger than my usual lip balms, and I know other people have said that the heavy and delicate container makes it difficult to carry around. Seriously, it's not that heavy or delicate that you can't throw it in a wristlet for everyday use...The price is a bit steep, but there's actually a lot of the product to last I'd say at least 5 months. A little goes a long way. And is it just me or is there a tingling sensation and a little bit of plumping?
