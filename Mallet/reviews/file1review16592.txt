review/text: I have recently purchased a Zippo lighter from Amazon.com. The only complaint i have about said lighter is it comes with no fuel. Please be sure to buy yourself some zippo lighter fuel or any lighter fuel will work. However DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES use Butane or Gasoline for u could damage your zippo and possibly injure yourself.
