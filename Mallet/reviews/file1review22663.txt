review/text: The Jeanie Rub massager is powerful and really gets the circulation moving, while relaxing the receivers deep muscles.This is a great tool for getting clients to a place of letting go of the day and completely relaxing tight muscles.*Note the massager is not for long time use but for loosening tight muscles so they are ready to receive deeper levels in a massage or reflexology treatment. I use this with both Reflexology and Reiki clients, with wonderful results.
