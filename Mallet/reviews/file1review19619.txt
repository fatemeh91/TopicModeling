review/text: They're not perfect (our 3 y.o. son is not potty trained yet), but they're the best that we could find, after getting two other types of trainers. We bought three of them. One is for our home, one is for their preschool, and the last one is for their babysitter's home. Our daughter is doing very well, so hopefully our son will follow her lead.
