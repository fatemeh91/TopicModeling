review/text: I ordered these to help with my Morton's Neuroma. I really am liking the level of comfort provided for the area covered by the cushion. The only downside to wearing these is that sometimes if I don't get the cushion positioned just perfectly, I'll get an area off to one of the sides of the cushion which gets a sort of pinched feel to it - so I have to remove my shoe & sock to reposition the cushion. Other than that (which is really a small price to pay for being able to walk comfortably), I am enjoying these.
