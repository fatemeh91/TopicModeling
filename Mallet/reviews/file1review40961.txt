review/text: This product is useless and so are the raving 5 star reviews. All I got was square patches of darkened irritated skin after trying this for a month. Three months later I still have dark squares on my back (no bikinis for me). And its not that my skin is sensitive- its as strong as hide, I've never had a rash/allergic reaction in my life until this!!! Very disappointing!The happy 5 star "reviewers" have only ever reviewed one thing - these patches. the ones who give real reviews have reviewed many things over the course of time on amazon. Dont believe all that you read!
