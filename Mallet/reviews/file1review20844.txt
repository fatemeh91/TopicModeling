review/text: I would agree that this is the highest-qualilty shaver out there, but don't think it has solved in wany way the inherent problems of this horrible technology; razors are much, much easier on your skin, provided you shave properly and with high quality products. And although the Braun does give a close shave, it does not compare to a razor. My experience is that doing both takes approximately the same amount of time, with a razor being much more precise. I'd stay away from the 8585.
