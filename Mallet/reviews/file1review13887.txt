review/text: Four Paws Quick and Easy Pill Dispenser was just as I expected after seeing my Vet using this product on My fussy male cat who refuses to take his worming pills every three months for Tape Worms. He caught on after 3 trys of me slipping it into his food and treats and refused to take after that. BRAVO! To my vet that hipped me to this product. Now for future treatments in all my other cats and kittens, this will literally take seconds to use. Thank You Four Paws!
