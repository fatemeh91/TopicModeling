review/text: I got these after trying out a workshop at a local Zen center. I wanted to start a mindfulness practice, but I have bad knees and had a real problem trying to sit (even at the Zen center on their Zabuton). I really like this set and being able to spend more time figuring out how to sit comfortably has let me make a lot more progress in my practice.The cushions are nice and comfortable. I like the buckwheat zafu more than the kapok one I'd used before as it really settles around your body and supports you. The zabuton is comfortable and I haven't had the problems with my legs falling asleep I had before. The one caveat is that I'm 5'11" with somewhat short legs for my height, and the zabuton is just barely big enough for me.
