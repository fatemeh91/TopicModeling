review/text: Perfect for my grandson who is 3. He had one nightime accident and it was simple to just take it off with the sheets and throw in washer. Also, I like this better than the disposable pads because it doesn't &#34;rattle&#34; as he moves around on it. It's under the sheets and he doesn't feel it or hear it.
