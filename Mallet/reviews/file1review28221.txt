review/text: I had used several different protein stuff including Muscle Milk and Nitro Tech. Muscle Milk became my favorite, sole choice and cannot be compared to other products. I recently purchased 100% Whey Protein Chocolate and Vanilla just for curiosity. This product tastes better than Nitro Tech and some other protein products, but it tastes far worse than Muscle Milk while it does not seem to work better than Muscle Milk. It is true that Muscle Milk has more calories than this product and has small amount of allegedly unfattening fat, but Muscle Milk tastes truly great and has many helpful ingredients including vitamin and creatine.
