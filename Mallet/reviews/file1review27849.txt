review/text: Decent tasting protein and good price for value of protein. I prefer fruit flavors to the regular chocolate and vanilla shakes and this fits the bill. The best tasting fruit flavor is still 4ever fruit whey isolate, but this is much cheaper. It mixes easily in water or crystal light. Tried it in almond milk and it was not so good. Also it only requires a shaker bottle no blender, big plus for me since I carry it with me to work and the gym.
