review/text: Overall, I was very pleased with this product. It was effective, and went on smoothly without staining or clumping. I tend to prefer unscented products but the light powder scent was not overwhelming. The features I disliked had to do with packaging. The lid did not stay on well and a very small turn of the wheel produced more deodorant than was needed. I am pretty loyal to the deodorant I currently use, but I like this product and would use it again. I would also recommend it to friends and family.
