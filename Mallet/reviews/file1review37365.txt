review/text: This model is a lot better than the previous Braun model (which i used and owned). Plucks hair cleanly at root and can pluck small hairs, which the older model had difficulty achieving. The "comfor rollers" are amazing. I do not understand how those little things work, but they definitely make the epilating process a much less painful one. I would recomend this product to anyone who is looking for a quality, superior (and not costly)way to get rid of nasty body hair. Thumbs up!
