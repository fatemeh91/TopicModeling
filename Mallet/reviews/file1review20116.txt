review/text: Powerful enough to make me stop taking them. I took these pills as a way to rid my body of excess estrogen stored. I was on my period when I started and took them for 5 days. my period lasted 4 and then it stopped but my chest tenderness that usually comes and goes with the ending of the mensrual cycle, never left and i wond up getting a second period a week later thus i became irregular and had no idea what was happening. So I stopped taking the dim and the bleeding stopped a few days after having returned for 6 days. Be careful
