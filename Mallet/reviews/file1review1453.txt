review/text: The seller of this item ships for free and they are quite fast getting them out the door. I was worried about installation and the column seemed slightly flimsy at first, but assembly was a snap in spite of not reading the directions very careful, and it seems quite sturdy once assembled.The accuracy itself seems to be great. Like all balances, the accuracy is phenomenal. No stepping on and off and getting wildly different results like with most scales I have had.Definitely worth the price if you are serious about watching your weight.
