review/text: I purchased this product because it was cheaper than Body Mint, and I'd figure they'd be the same. Body Mint is wayyy more effective than Chlorofresh. Chlorofresh requires you to take up to 4 (max is 6) pills a day. Body Mint only required for me to take it twice a day and it was effective in regulating my BM but neither were effective in eliminating body odor.
