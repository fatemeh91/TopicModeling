review/text: I don't take the time to review most my purchases but this sweeper is great! No, it's not a Kirby that'll lift your rug off the floor but it does exactly what you would expect from a sweeper. It's great for a quick clean-up when you've got small children that leave a trail of crumbs wherever they go. No batteries, no cord and very little noise so it's not a problem when the kids are napping.
