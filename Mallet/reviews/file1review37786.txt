review/text: I was diagnosed with Dilated Cardiomyopathy, which is a heart disease characterized by weak pumping action due to weak enlarged heart muscle. The function of my heart five years after being diagnosed had declined leading to a possibility of heart failure. I was told by a friend about this Coenzyme Q10 and researched it thoroughly. Even though the doctors didn't support the use of it for my heart problems, I tried it anyway at a dosage of 100 mg a day. Within 3 months my heart improved by a great amount. So I now take 150 mg a day and am hoping for a full recovery. I will not know how much it has improved until my next visit. It is a great supplement with no side effects (at least I never read of any or had any myself). It helps lower blood sugar, helps you lose weight, and helps replenish cells in your body. I can't say enough good things about this supplement.
