review/text: After back surgery I was not able to bend and had trouble with such basics as putting on my socks. I got this sock aid but only used it a few times. It works on very stretchy socks only, and stretches them even more.I found that a short UNGER The Nifty Nabber 18" worked better by grabbing the top of the sock without having to put the whole thing into the sock.
