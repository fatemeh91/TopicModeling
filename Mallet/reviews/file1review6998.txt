review/text: I used three different products before, two of which were Panasonic. One of the Panasonic models pulled out my nose hair so bad that I would be literally crying at the end of my session. I decided to try something else and went for this Wahl product. It's not a pretty looking model, but when you hold it in your hand, it feels solid and sturdy. The motor is surprisingly quiet and it did it its job. Not a single hair pulled.I would have given it 5 star, were it not for the price. After I placed the order, I found the same product for about the same price at a small local beauty supplies store.
