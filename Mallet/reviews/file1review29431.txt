review/text: Cool little wrist blood pressure monitor is accurate and is convenient way for me to determine my blood pressure. Naturally a 2-3mmHg difference between left to right arm is normal, the right being higher. I found out that a difference of more than 11 mm Hg in the systolic from the left to right can indicate a blocked artery forming, and 20-40 mmHg as a blocked artery in the heart. So I got this to help me determine on a daily basis what my BP is. The irregular heartbeat detector goes off now and then for my female, I suppose she has some heart issue but at the same time I wonder if its a false alarm. The manual says that consistent irregular detection is what is needed to determine if a person has an irregular heart beat, which I figure means that its sensitive and by doing it over a course of a week or so would help eliminate human error.This device gave me the same numbers as when I go to the drug store and use the blood pressure monitor there.Another nice little bonus is that it has a memory function that shows up to 30 readings for a person and the average BP, which is what I needed to know to accurately know my BP. It has a memory 2 (M2) which means it stores 2 people's readings.
