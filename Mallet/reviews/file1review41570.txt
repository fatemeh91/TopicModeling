review/text: Let me start off by saying my dentist recommended this brand vs. the other brand out there due to the fact Oral B works in a circular motion. Apparently that is better for your gums! So I went out and bought this. I like the product, it makes your teeth feel great. I guess what I question is the need for this "posh" model. First off, the 30 sec interval timer(part of the 2min timer feature) isn't that great, I can not distinguish the "shuttering" which is supposed to inform me to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth? And the LCD screen, what is the point you can't see it while brushing! However I do like the polisher brush. I guess I would say if you are on a budget stick w/ with the older version of this model, honestly there is no true need for all the extra features of this model to make it worth droppping $100 bucks. And you don't even get a protective cap for the head! only a storage unit which is too bulky to have on the counter. Save yourself some money and just get the older model.
