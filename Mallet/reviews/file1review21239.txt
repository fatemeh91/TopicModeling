review/text: This toothbrush is much better than the Oral-B Crossaction Power that I used earlier. The head is nice and small and gets into hard to reach areas, the brush stand has no exposed metal (it's really cool from an engineering standpoint, they seem to be using a magnetic field to charge the battery), so it's pretty safe to leave by the sink.After using the brush, my teeth feel smooth & clean, like after going to a dentist. It takes a little getting used to but the bristles are soft and don't hurt your gums.I've been using the product only for a month, some other reviewers were disappointed with the battery life, I can't comment on that yet. However, I think Ni-Cd batteries are happier if you put them through full charge/discharge cycles, a full charge lasts a week. At least 250 full charge/discharge cycles is what I expect out of Ni-Cd's, charging once every week gives me about 250 weeks (little more than 4.5 years). I don't actually think I'll have the toothbrush that long, but the point is that I think the battery should be fine if you don't charge it everyday.Also, this really shouldn't matter but this toothbrush is made in Germany.
