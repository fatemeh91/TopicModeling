review/text: This potty seat fit on all of my different toilet seats without a problem. My son can sit on it for long periods of time without getting uncomfortable. He's on the younger side at 18mo and the fit is just fine for him. The splash guard could of course be a little higher but we haven't had any major issues with this one. It does what it's supposed to and the ability to adjust the seat for a snug fit is what makes this seat so good. Other seats have slid around and this one stays put.
