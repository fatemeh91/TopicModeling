review/text: I initially started using this when I was nursing my now 3 1/2 year old and did not want to take an antihistamine for fear my milk would dry up. My seasonal allergies were so bad I could not just suffer through it so at my sister's urging I gave Hyland's Hayfever a try. Awesome stuff! Last year I tried Claritin because I thought it would be great if I only had to take something once every 24 hours rather than every 4 but it didn't work for me so I went back to Hyland's. I am now expecting again and am glad it works so well because I wouldn't feel comfortable taking anything else while pregnant and I have horrible seasonal allergies.
