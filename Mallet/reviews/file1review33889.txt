review/text: I bought this stethoscope in an attempt to replace my regular one, which had begun to slide out of the perfect angle with which it had to be set at in order for me to hear anything. I am amazed at the clarity with which I can hear heart and breath sounds with this inexpensive stethoscope. It's so comfortable, too. I have often had problems with the shape, size, and/or texture of the earpieces of different stethoscopes, but these feel like they were made for me. I am very happy with this purchase; this stethoscope definitely qualifies as a replacement for my regular stethoscope.
