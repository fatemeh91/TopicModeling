review/text: I was introduced to this product by my chiropractor. I had been suffering from constant lower back pain due to improperly lifting heavy lawn bags filled with grass clippings. My chiropractor applied it just once and I was pain free by the next day. I ordered this bottle for my husband who recently had rotator cuff surgery and suffers from constant shoulder pain. He says Prossage works better than any of the other products he had been using.
