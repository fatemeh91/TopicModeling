review/text: Strengths: Fast charging, sleek and ergonomic design, easy to clean, international voltage adapter (low-end panasonic models dont have this feature), 2-yr warranty (again panasonic lacks this)Weaknesses: Heavy, Vibrates a lot, Noisy, Does not have battery low indicator, the trimmer is almost useless, cant be used for wet-shave, does not shave very closely around neck and chin.Summary: I got one of the closest shaves on my cheeks and moustache. However, the neck and chin area were not the best. I had to dig in there with the shaver to get a good shave.A dry-shave irritates my skin for a few hours... probably because I m not used to it. So the next time I m going to try a dry/wet Panasonic shaver.In spite of the weaknesses, I think this is still one of the better products. Panasonic ES7035 is the closest competitor in terms of features and price.Needs a battery-level indicator as it is pretty useful if one travels a lot and needs to find out the battery status.
