review/text: I just treated my chin, lip and cheeks. The treated hairs and their roots came out easily. I suggest you relax, take your time. Yes, it hurts. This doesn't sound like a positive review for a product, but if I dropped and broke this machine, like I did my last one, I would buy another one immediately. (BTW, I am the wife of the owner of this account.)
