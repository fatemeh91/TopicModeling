review/text: Great relief for muscle and ligament aches do to tension and over work. I had chronic pain of muscles, tendons and ligaments because of some bulging discs in my upper spine. When I use this tool to put pressure against those sore areas, my pain goes away. It is the best substitute for a body message and helps me stay limber and pain free. Best use of my money in a long time.
