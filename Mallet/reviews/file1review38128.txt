review/text: I looked at a lot of different eyeglass cleaning products and these little pre-moistened ones are the best approach.Do you do a lot of computer work? Wipe your glasses and then wipe off your monitor with one tissue.I ordered a lot of these little boxes and keep some at home and some at work.
