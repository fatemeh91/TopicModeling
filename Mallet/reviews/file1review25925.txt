review/text: I got this for charging both AA and AAA batteries for my digital camera and Mp3 player. It has lived up to my expectations. The batteries charge relatively quickly and the lights inform me of when it is done. The only complaints I have are that the charger gets really hot while charging, which concerns me somewhat, and that the unit itself looks cheap. I also wish that the plug in had fold down progs like most portable devices have these days. That would be a big plus for travel.
