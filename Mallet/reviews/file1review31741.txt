review/text: I wonder how widespread this is since many people might not open this until they really need it? In my case I thought I was getting a steal since I was in the market for a new dry bag to augment an existing survival kit. The bag however was broken, there were no snaps on the other side of the bag for the zip lock style enclosure to lock together. The kit itself however is in good shape, all the components are quality. I'll probably end up using a waterproof cell phone case for my own "pocket survival pak".
