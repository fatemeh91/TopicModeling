review/text: Just received my order and it is the 12.0 version. Although I have just opened my order, I'm happy and confident that I made a smart purchase for my health. Before ordering, I picked up a smaller supply from my local healthfood store to test it and as a comparison to what I was previously using. I used to take Vitamineral Green as my daily nutrition supplement but had to stop because of cost and a change in my employment situation. I can honestly say that I feel confident of getting the same benefit from this AND getting a two month supply for less than the cost of a one month supply of VM.
