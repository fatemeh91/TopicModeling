review/text: If you haven't had the pleasure or necessity of using a Thermophore heating pad you have been depriving yourself of a very useful comforting and therapeutic tool. Made in the USA by Battle Creek Equipment since 1931. I became acquainted with the pads 30 years ago through an older friend that had suffered from Polio as a young woman and found that the Deep-Heat Therapy was still a great comfort in those same muscles. I have Fibromylagia and find the long pad (model 055) extremely comforting. Take a look at the different sizes available.
