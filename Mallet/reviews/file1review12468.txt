review/text: I have been searching for a perfect foot splint for a few years now. This is not a perfect solution. It is by far the most comfortable splint that I have tried. I have tried Cool Stretch boot forms, Dorsal Night Splint and Dorsal PF Night Splint by Alimed.The Dorsal PF Night Splint wins hands down for comfort, ease of use, and wearability.
