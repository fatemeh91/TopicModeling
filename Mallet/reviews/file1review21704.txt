review/text: We bought this tub in 1997 when our first daughter was only six weeks old and used it on the bathroom counter (between the sinks) to lower her into shallow water and bathe her. When she was able to sit up on her own, we started using it in the regular tub. I can't say enough good things about this product. It's easy, convenient and environmentally conscious in that it uses a LOT less water than a regular bath. We actually bought a second, and used it for travel. Now we're expecting again and just ordered a new Snug Tub.
