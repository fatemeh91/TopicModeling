review/text: During a recent travel trip carrying a heavy back pack, I strained my trapezius. I ended up suffering for months with daily constant tension and pain. Anti-inflammatories and pain killers prescribed by two sets of doctors werent helping.I didnt have the money for private physio so after some internet research I purchased this tool. It really works! I was able to locate the trigger points in my trapezius and after applying heavy pressure for a minute on each one I could feel them "release". After about a week of 10 minutes of daily use my pain and tension had really subsided now about 80% back to normal!
