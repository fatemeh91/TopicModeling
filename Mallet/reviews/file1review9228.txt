review/text: The item pictured is not what I received like the previous reviewer - it's blue, not yellow - and it is not a 'Every Which Way Dust Mop refill' - it's a microfiber dust mop refill that 'fits Every-which-way' dust mops. Big difference. It's smaller, not as full - save your money and buy elsewhere, bad selling tactic.
