review/text: I saw this shaver in few ads and I really liked the way it looked and was impresed it had shaver trimmer and shaper in it.Well only until I opened the box and tried it for the first (and last) time! It took me over 30 minutes to shave half of my face and it still left a lot of places with plenty of hair on them. Btw i also tried the shaper which didnt work at all!the only thing it does well is look good in the box !
