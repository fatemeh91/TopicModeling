review/text: I've been using this product in my breakfast smoothies with bananas, strawberries, juice and protein for about 6 months and I am very satisfied. As someone who juices fruits and veggies, Green Vibrance is very convenient for the daily routine. I recently started a new job that to my surprise required 12-15 hour days for the last 4 weeks and my energy levels have been amazing. At the end of the day, I marvel at how good I feel.
