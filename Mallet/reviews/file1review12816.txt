review/text: I just purchased 2 more of these. I find them excellent for a sinus headache when used as a cold pack. I wanted to have one to use as a heat pack and bought one for my daughter in law. You can also turn them around and use them on the back of your neck and don't have to hold it in place. I received them in 2 days from amazon. Great item.
