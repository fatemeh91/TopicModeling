review/text: I've had mine for about a year. Its large size, considerable weight and thickness, together with the large velcro strap, make it easy to fasten securely around my neck with good contact on the upper back and neck. I use it over a thin summer shirt, or under a heavier winter shirt. I also use it at bedtime, lying on my back with the pad between me and the pillow. This has been a particularly marvelous remedy for tense muscles in my upper back and neck. As other reviewers have noted, it is a little tricky microwaving it to just the right temperature, and it doesn't stay warm an extremely long time -- but these are very minor points in comparison with the strengths of this excellent product. My experience says this one is worth the money, and I have no hesitation in recommending it.
