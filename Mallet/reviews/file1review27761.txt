review/text: I got halfway through the bottle and could NOT get myself to finish the rest, it's TOO SWEET. Yeah, they're saving the consumer calories, but the sucralose dosage in this stuff is overkill, highly recommend ON's "Any Whey," it's all natural; "Any Whey" will be my next purchase on Amazon. My only credibility I have is I have lost count of the bottle's of Optimum Nutrition Pro-Complex Whey since first using in 2005.. hope this review helps.
