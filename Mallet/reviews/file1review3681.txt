review/text: I rarely write reviews but I felt very motivated to add my two cents here in recognition of how much this product helped me with insomnia and constipation. I took four caps a day and topped it off with a glass of CALM (another magnesium product) and felt somewhat better in three days. After two and one half weeks, I was much, much better. While magnesium is in many foods, there's probably not enough of it anymore so we are all mag deficient. I'm positive I was because it also helped with a restless leg syndrome problem, and that, after two weeks. Now I take four caps per day, no Calm anymore and supplement with a big serving of raw vegetables each morning (I cut them up and take them to work in Tupperware)and of course, constant water. The pills are big but weighty so they do go down pretty easy. Also, taking four, but two at a time is working good for me. Forget melatonin, drugs, laxatives, fiber cereals....those are not the right solutions. This is. Thanks to all who posted before me and convinced me to try it. After six months of the mag in this form I am even feeling it in my mood-- very calm!
