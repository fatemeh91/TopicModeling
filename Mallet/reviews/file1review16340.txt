review/text: We usually use Cascade liquid or a store brand or even Finish liquid. We tried these once before, but I thought them a little expensive. Now having done the math...and looked again at how clean the dishes get. And surprisingly how little residue these leave in the washer (the liquid we have been using leaves scunge on the bottom of the door)...I have been won over.We will use this and the Finish Dish Washer Freshener from now on (if you haven't tried that, go buy one now! Our kitchen has never smelled better--it's especially nice right after doing the dishes).
