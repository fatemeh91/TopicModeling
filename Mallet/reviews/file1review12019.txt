review/text: I was overall happy with the purchase of these vitamins. I didn't have a problem taking them...until probably halfway through the bottle. I just got so tired of pill popping (between this and DHA, and others), that these started to make me gag a little. The edges are just a little rough vs a large pill that is smooth.However, they never gave me any illness and it sure is nice to take one a day. But after my bottle ran out, I switched back to 3X day. I also personally just thought spreading the dose of vitamins out during the day might also be beneficial (and I don't have a problem remembering).Overall I would recommend these though! A great dose of everything you need in a natural form (no colors, additives, etc).
