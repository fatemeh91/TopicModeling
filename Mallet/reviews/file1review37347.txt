review/text: After reading reviews and wanting a hair removal system that I could use on my bikini line, underarms and legs without shaving or going to the salon for waxing, I purchased this item yesterday. Beacuse I had already shaved my legs before purchasing, I was unable to test it on my legs, but I did do it on my bikini line. I have very course dark hair on my bikini area and I have been shaving for a few weeks because I have been taking my 7 month old daughter to waterbabies classes. I put a cold ice pack on the area before starting off about 30-40 seconds and then I started. My area was already short due to last weeks shaving. As I went over the bikini area I was surprised at how little pain their was. It was like a litte pinch, but it subsided as I went along. Now the area is smooth excpet for some ingrown hairs I had to take out with tweezers because of the shaving. The after effect was redness and the feeling I just had a waxing. No pain or anything. I have tried other epilators in the past and they all went back. This one I am keeping. I will have to try it on my legs and underarms when the hair begins to grow back from shaving. This is fantastic. All ladies should try it. Just remember, in the bikini area, make sure you use the trimmier attachment to make he hairs less dense. Also try the ice if you are very sensitive to pain. I will update my review in a couple of weeks when I get to try my legs.
