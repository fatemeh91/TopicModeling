review/text: Take a teaspoonful about 45 minutes prior to your workout and be amazed at the results. If you are "intensity oriented" in your workouts, this is the one. Then follow your workout with Universal's Glutamine. There are lots of high-priced creatine products but this is the best Value (Quality/Price) on the market.
