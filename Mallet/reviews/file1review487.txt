review/text: Best Part? Nice Girth (unusual for a rabbit). Worst? Length. I find it too short. And the "off" button has stopped working (maybe it wants to keep going and going and going? *L*) I have to untwist the bottom pannel and loosen the batteries to turn it off.Overall it's OK. It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I'd like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer.
