review/text: This little thing works great. I understand what the other reviewer is saying about the plastic in the landfill but I have to admit this thing works great. I have always had a problem flossing every day with regular floss but since I bought this Hummingbird I floss every day. I have a sonic toothbrush as well and the combination of both really cleans my teeth and gums. I hope the previous reviewer will forgive me but I am hooked on this little machine. The only problem I see right now is the price of floss picks. They range from $3.50 to $3.99 for a 15 day supply. This can get pretty pricey after awhile. I watch for coupons and specials (Amazon). I agree with the previous reviewer that it would be nice if we had a machine like this with replaceable floss.
