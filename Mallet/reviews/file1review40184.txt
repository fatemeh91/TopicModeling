review/text: I also read the consumer reports rating and decided to try it, especially since it only cost $1.09 at Target. With all the magical ingredients (including high abrasion baking soda) of all the other toothpastes tested, this product had the best stain removal, lowest abrasion, and the lowest price! The best possible combination! The only slightly negative aspect is sensitivity, which is not experienced by everyone. If this occurs, using less or brushing with a basic toothpaste every other time should resolve this issue. This is advice from my dental hygenist who has used Ultrabrite for many years, and like me, remembers the annoying commercial when this product was first introduced.This product is a great followup to whitening your teeth with "Natural White".
