review/text: This kit comes with both whitening toothpaste and special bleaching formula. After using as instructed for more than one week, I can safely say that my mouth feels clean and refreshed. As a toothpaste, it did very well. However, I haven't noticed any brightening. It may take longer than a week, so this may be premature -- we'll have to wait and see.
