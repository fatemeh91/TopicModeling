review/text: I love the Aveeno Oatmeal lotion and oils, so I was trying this one out because it smelled so good at the store. Unlike the other Aveeno products I used, this lotion just stayed sticky and tacky. I tried it a number of times, in a variety of environments (putting it on before bed, before work, immediately following a shower) because I liked the scent so much, but unfortunately, I just felt sticky.So, to summarize, I recommend all the other Aveeno products, but this one, as good as it smells, is no good.
