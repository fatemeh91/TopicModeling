review/text: The bathlift appears to work okay, but I have sent an inquiry about it and received no answer! It came with no instructions, and I have two pieces left over which I don't know what to do with! Also, would like an idea about how long a full charge takes and how long it lasts. And will bath oil gum up the works? All these questions I sent to them and have never had any answers.
