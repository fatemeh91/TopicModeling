review/text: The writeup said that you would get an instruction booklet. Well, I got the tool with nothing else. I have no idea how to use this thing. I wrote a note to Amazon customer service asking if I could get the instructions. They provided me an email id that wasn't correct (the guy who answered my note didn't know what I was talking about.) So, it might be a good tool, but I have no idea how to use it.... I will probably return it, but it is so such an odd shape, it will probably cost a lot to return....
