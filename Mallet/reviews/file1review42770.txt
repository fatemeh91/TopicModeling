review/text: THIS PRODUCT IS MISLABELED.IF YOU HAVE A SENSITIVE STOMACH, BEWARE!!Although the container prominently proclaims the product to be "Gluten Free", it certainly is not.I have tried several probiotic brands before (8-10), this is the first one that made me sick. FOR DAYS. Each time I took a pill I felt sick to my stomach and had the same reactions I have when I ingest gluten. But the box says "gluten free" so I thought I was having a die-off reaction. Until day after day, I had symptoms that I ONLY have with gluten exposure.I googled "gluten" with "Primal Defense", and sure enough tons of gluten sensitive individuals report that they have gotten glutened from this product.Shame on Garden of Life. I spent my hard earned money on your product to try to improve my health. Instead your product has caused damage to my digestive system for weeks.Garden of Life has high quality products, I've tried others before. Please, please, fix your labels. Don't make people sick.
