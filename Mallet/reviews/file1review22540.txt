review/text: This is a great idea for thermometers. I like it a whole bunch better than having to use a rectal thermometer. I just hate having to do that. This thermometers takes the same amount of time to use and is not as accurate, but a fever is a fever. The only problem I have with this is that sometimes she doesn't want to suck on the pacifier. She is breastfed and isn't always cooperative with bottle nipples and pacifiers. She will eventually take it though. Fortunatley, her temperature has never been high enough for the lullaby feature to work.This isn't very expensive and I think it is a must have in any home with a baby. I have a collection of thermometers (two digital, one pacifier, and the ear one), this is one of my favorites, second to the ear thermometer.
