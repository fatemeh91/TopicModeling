review/text: The product is a good economic source of L-Arginine. You will notice within 2 days a meaningful change in bloodflow and pump while working out. I take the product in the morning on an empty stomach in as little ice cold water as possible. This way it goes down in one gulp. The taste is the most aweful thing I have ever tasted. It is so bad that, some mornings, my stomach gets sick just thinking about it.You need to decide how bad you want the performance and effect.
