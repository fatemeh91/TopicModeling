review/text: Dealing with infertility, I needed to save $ where I could & these test sticks helped me do just that. I was blessed in being able to get pregnant on my first cycle of fertility treatment & my test detected it right away on day 28 of my cycle! It was clear, easy to do just like a drugstore test, & cost much, much, much less money! I have recommended them to my fertility challenged friends as we all tend to go through ovulation sticks & pregnancy test sticks like water & these will save so much money for everyone!
