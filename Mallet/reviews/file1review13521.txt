review/text: My sister bought smartsoles (actually bought 2 pairs and has them in her boots and her sneakers)and loves them. We go walking together every other day and after hearing how comfortable and how energized she feels for the last month, I decided to buy 2 pairs. Well I didn't check the size info and I have size 11 feet ( yes I am also over 6 feet tall..one very tall woman!!) Though the smartsole fit my sister's size 8 feet perfectly..they were a no go on my huge boats.I contacted smartsole and they took my return promptly and nicely..could not have been nicer. I appreicated how easy it was...not like the seller that sold me the faulty farouck chi hair dryer that not only does not make my hair straight..it burns my scalp like crazy!
