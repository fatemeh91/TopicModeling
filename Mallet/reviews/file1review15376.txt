review/text: That previous review can only have been written by a representative of the company. I purchased this product last week at Whole Foods. From the research I did, I knew that TRUE oil of oregano is hot to the taste. So I bit into one of these "oil of oregano" capsules, with its thick gelatin lining, and the tiny amount of substance inside tasted entirely like olive oil. Olive oil! It had a slight taste of oregano, but certainly no more than your cooking after you put a dash of the spice into your food. So the lesson: if you want expensive "OLIVE oil" capsules, by all means buy these. But if you want "oregano oil" capsules, look elsewhere.
