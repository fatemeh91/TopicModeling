review/text: Protein powder supplements are a blind item from a nutritional standpoint. Optimum Nutrition is among the most respected names in the industry which is why I decided to give their 100% Whey protein supplements a try after the GNC brand I had been using changed their formulation including a flavor I didn't like.While I have to trust in the Optimum Nutrition name that the supplement is what it says it is, I can attest to the fact (as a chocolate lover) that the taste is quite good and the powder dissolves easily in a shaker. Whether supplementing my breakfast or after the most grueling workout, the flavor and texture are quite compatible.
