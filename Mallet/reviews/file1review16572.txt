review/text: I have heard how reliable Zippo lighters are so I purchased the kit that had the street chrome lighter, fluid, and extra flints. I am very impressed with the quality and it lights every time. It isn't terribly windproof but compared to some other "windproof" ones it surpasses other brands. I like the street chrome because I actually use the lighter for backpacking, fishing trips, etc. and do not have to worry about banging up the outside. I like it enough that I'm buying more for groomsmen for an up-coming wedding!
