review/text: I've almost finished my bottle of this, and my skin has completely cleared up. It wasn't that bad but it helped smooth everything out and I am thankful. I'm going to go to a lower dosage now though (maybe 5,000 iu) because it's not safe to take large amounts of Vitamin A over long periods of time. Even people taking Retin-A only do so for a few months. Also you should take vitamin D with it. Anyway, if you have skin problems definitely try it out.
