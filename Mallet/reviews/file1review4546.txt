review/text: The first thing that came to mind, and many have already said it, was the Saturday Night Live skit with a 15-bladed razor. I thought, "Come on, FIVE blades?"Then I tried it.Holy smokes, I think there is actually a product that lives up to its claims. I'm 45 with pretty sensitive skin - nick and burn easily. This razor does it and good. No nicks at all, and a smooth, comfortable shave. I use it with Neutrogena's Razor Defense gel, and think there isn't going to be any better combination.(This is for the manual razor. The notion of sticking a battery/vibrator in a bladed razor just gives me the willies.)
