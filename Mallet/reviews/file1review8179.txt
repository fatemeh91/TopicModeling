review/text: My sodastream water bottles were getting a nasty film on them that could not be removed with simple rinsing. I've tried soaking them overnight and then scrubbing them in vain with a chopstick. I was able to remove the gunk, but I needed a true bottle brush that would fit. Thank goodness for amazon, because the local stores did not have any bottle brushes that would fit such a narrow mouth bottle.The only issue I have is the bristles might be a little too soft, so I have to soak my bottles overnight with a bleach solution in order to loosen the gunk. I could scrape the film away with a chopstick.
