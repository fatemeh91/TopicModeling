review/text: I had issues with getting my cycle regulated after I had been off of Nuvaring for 6 mos. My husband and I wanted to try and conceive and my body was not cooperating. I had cycles ranging from 29 - 37 days. I would get positive OPK tests but based on BBT, I never actually ovulated.I had heard about Fertilaid on [...] so I started to research it. After reading so much positive things about this supplement, I thought, can't hurt!! So, I ordered it immediately.I started taking it about 2 times a day - on about day 3 of my period. I only took for about 1 1/2 weeks when I actually ovulated. I could tell based on stretchy cervical fluid.Fast forward a few weeks... I got a big fat positive pregnancy test. My cycle would have been about 29 days had my period actually started.This product is amazing!
