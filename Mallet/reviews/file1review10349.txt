review/text: Please note that there are no active ingredients listed on this product. This is not at all good folks! Traditionally Hippocampus potency medications use Sea Horses as their main ingredient. Sea Horses have been proven beyond doubt to be worthless in the treatment of anything. To make matters even worse, THESE CREATURES ARE ON MOST ENDANGERED AND THREATED SPECIES LISTS! Almost all true practitioners of Tradition Chinese Medicine, when questions, will admit fully that Sea Horses are absolutely worthless in treating anything!What makes matters even worse is that these Hippocampus medications also traditionally include in their ingredients such things as ground whole geckos, tiger bones, fur seal genitalia, and a number of other ENDANGERED SPECIES!I have absolutely nothing against Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and in fact use some products myself. But this stuff has been found to be completely worthless and by purchasing it you are being a part of destroying quite litany of critters which are almost extinct.I think you could build a very good case that to use such a product is absolutely morally wrong! If you are having a problem with ED chances are you need to loose a bit of weight, stop smoking, lay off the fast food a bit or simply go out and buy the little blue pill. Or it could be that your time is simply over, i.e. you are getting old...hey it happens to all of us if we are lucky enough to survive. Get over it! If you do suffer from ED...hey, I feel your pain friend, but trust me, there are better routes to take than useless concoctions that are whipping out entire species from the face of the earth!Anyway, unless you know what is in this stuff, it is not a very good thing to purchase and use it.I am a bit shocked that this site allows this stuff to be sold here.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
