review/text: I am a regular buyer on Amazon, with a pattern of buying 25 items a year for the last 5 years (yikes!) and I have never written a review about anything I bought.I bought this razor based on the high acclaim that other users have given it. I have been using Mach 3 blades for the last several years, and decided that I might try to save a bit by buying an upper-end electric.In short, I'm not THAT impressed, and continue to shave with both a Mach 3 regular razor & this one. My biggest complaint is the dismal job it does under your jaws and on the neck. I know you're suppossed to give an electric razor 3-4 weeks, but this has not helped. My search for the perfect electric continues.The pros for this razor include how fast it shaves, and what a good job it does on flat surfaces on your face. I think because it has a big flat retangular head, it does poorly on neck area because the entire head can't be firmly placed again your skin. That's probably why a Norelco with it's triple head design does better on neck areas and small areas (if you have a big neck, maybe this electric will perform better).Other aspects such as looks and build quality are a consideration but for me they fall a distant second to issues such as the shaving quality. The razor might look good, or have too big a base for cleaning, or clean itself but when I'm at work, I will remember the razor on how poorly it shaved my neck. Overall, I would happily spend another $100 to get a razor that does half a job that a Mach 3 hand-held blade and good old shaving cream will do.
