review/text: There have been a lot of fake blades going around on the internet from what I understand. I'm not sure if these were or not but I can say that they were not good. The blade was shaky and buzzed when I turned on my razor. (I have the vibrating style) And the blades seemed like they were not in the right place as they felt like they were jagged and cutting me.I can't recommend this product and will go back to buying my razors in Duane Reade or CVS.
