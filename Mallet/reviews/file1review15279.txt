review/text: I was really excited to try the Balance Bars. I'm always looking for a snack that I can keep in my purse. The Balance Bar was good for the purse because it didn't crumble. The flavor wasn't too bad. I don't usually care for chocolate/fruit combos, but this one was pretty good. This snack could also double as a quick lunch; it was pretty filling. I'll definitely buy this item again.
