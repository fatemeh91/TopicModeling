review/text: I bought this toothbrush about 2 years ago and have happily used it ever since. It leaves the teeth feeling clean and is not too bulky to hold. I find the timer buzz convenient and easy to ignore if you chose so. Can't see why people find it annoying.Both my husband and myself use the same model - we just change brush heads. The brush head replacements are inexpensive and come with different colored rings. The battery holds charge forever, which is great for trips. We've taken it to 8-10 day trips without the charger, and used it both twice a day, and it still had charge. Highly recommended.
