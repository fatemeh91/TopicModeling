review/text: (Well I don't have it yet so those 5 Stars don't mean anything.)...I took a look at Brookstone.com re their warranty.I didn't see much but I do trust the reviewers who wrote that repairs sucked.However I did spot Brookstone's all-in-all-done $20, 2 year, hopefully no hassle, Replacement Plan.Though rarely would I buy such a plan it seemed worth it in this case. I couldn't find a better rated foot spa to take a chance on so this seemed to be the best idea to cover the possibility that I get one of those One Star Lemons.I came back to Amazon to order it but I could not find the Replacement Plan as an option so I headed back to Brookstone to order it.That's it... just thought I'd mention the replacement plan to you and to Amazon cuz I know that Amazon reads every word I write, right! geo
