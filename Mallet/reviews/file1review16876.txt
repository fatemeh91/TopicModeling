review/text: I had problems with my son not washing his hands every time he used a bathroom. And every time he did wash his hands there was a total mess all around the sink. So I've decided to go for foamy soap in a fun package to encourage him to do the right thing. It worked like a charm. Now his hands are washed EVEN if not necessary AND my sink is always clean.
