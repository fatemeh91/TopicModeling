review/text: I bought this for cleaning my Nissan Thermos and it works very well for that. It has a wide mouth but is deep and cannot be cleaned easily with other cleaning methods.The reason I gave it four stars is because even though it works for what I purchased it for I have tried using it for cleaning a reusable glass bottle that I have and it was too thick to fit into the narrow opening of the bottle. The plastic rod that the bristles are attached to is too thick to fit into multiple bottles that I tried. It does not work for cleaning bottles that have an opening approximately the size of a wine or beer bottle.
