review/text: Ten years ago when I asked my doctor about Glucosamine/Condroitin, he told me that it doesn't work for everyone, but it was safe and worth trying to see. I'm one of the fortunate ones for whom it has worked. It has helped keep me mobile and flexible and pain free. Nature Made uses USP to independently verify their products so I trust them to provide what they say on the label. Amazon's subscription service makes it easy.
