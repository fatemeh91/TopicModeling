review/text: The purchase of this product was very smooth and I was so excited to get this tub! Our daughter had outgrown her infant tub and needed something a little bigger to sit and splash around in. This was great, for a while. It's slightly bigger than some other inflatable tubs, so if you have a small tub be prepared for a squeeze. I also liked that you could keep it inflated and hang it to dry using the suction cup attachment. Unfortunately, it only lasted a few months before a very small tear appeared on the side seem. I would expect that to happen eventually after extended use, but we only had it a short time and only deflated and blew it back up 2-3 times within that time span (for traveling). May be we just got a defective tub, but I didn't want to take the chance of wasting money on another tub only for the same thing to happen again, so I ordered a different one. Bummer.
