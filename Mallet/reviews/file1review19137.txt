review/text: The first couple times I took these tests, they came out negative. The next two came out darkly positive. Over a week later, I took it again for the heck of it and it was another dark positive. I had pregnancy symptoms so I took a pregnancy test (the same day that I got the positive ovulation test) and turns out I'm pregnant. This is fine, since we were trying but I think this could be dangerous in certain situations if these tests are defective!
