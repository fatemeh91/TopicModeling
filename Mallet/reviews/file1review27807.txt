review/text: I've been using ON Whey exclusively for a number of years. I absolutely love this stuff and drink a scoop or 2 after every lifting session. As for flavors, Rocky Road is by far my favorite. I can add plenty of water for a bigger drink without worrying about it tasting awful. I tried strawberry, but it tastes too much like pepto for me - and double rich chocolate needs to have the right mixture of powder to water or else it tastes nasty. My buddy has even recently switched from his protein to ON due to better price and positive reviews all over the net and at our local supplement store.This protein tastes good and is very filling. It is smooth, no chalky feeling of after-taste like some other brands. It also mixes very well with water. I used to mix vanilla with orange juice and that worked well too. Mixing with milk produces a very thick drink though, and hard to stomach after lifting (personally).
