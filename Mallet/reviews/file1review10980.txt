review/text: I am a massage therapist and have experience with several products which aim to reduce pain. In fact, it's a staple that I travel with, whereever I go, and I keep a bottle in the car, one at the office, and a few at home (just in case). People come to me with their aches and pains and, in addition to other options, I usually tell them about a spray like this (and give them a bottle I happen to have closeby!).I mainly use Biofreeze spray and when comparing the two, I like that much better. It seems more concentrated than CryoDerm, as I can feel the effects better and the spray goes more on my skin, rather than floating around in the air, like the CryoDerm. It's like the particles are smaller and lighter with CD.I can spray biofreeze in the car and others can smell it, but it doesn't affect their breathing. When I spray this in the car (and I notice it, too), it goes into mouth and eyes and makes breathing difficult. This is with windows closed or open climate control on or off. I use a muscle spray in the car often, so I have tried various "configurations".Also, I can "feel" the BioFreeze working for many minutes after I've applied it. With the CryoDerm, in my experience, the effect wears off quickly, so I need to reapply (if my passengers can stand it).One good thing to report is that, with both sprays, I do not experience any skin irritation or ill effects from using it. I generally have sensitive skin and use only natural products, organic when feasible.Just a note, I have been known to spray products such as this on the back of my neck on an especially hot day, to help feel a bit cooler.I see a lot of positive reviews, so it may just be a personal preference. I recommend that you try a few different brands and find the one that works best for you. For me and my clients, friends, & family, that product is BioFreeze Spray.I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you, too.
