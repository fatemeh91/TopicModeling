review/text: I got hooked on these with my newborn in 1988. After using them for the typical infant uses, I started using them as dustcloths (absolutely no lint), cleaning cloths (holds expensive cleaners well and can be used over and over), etc. The latest is that I use them to clean my Harley. Absolutely no scratches, ever! Just try a pack of these for spitcloths and other uses. I actually used disposable diapers, but these are great for everything else.
