review/text: I have only had this unit for about 3 days, so far I like it. The shave is closer and smoother than I used to get using regular razor[Gillette Sensor Excel]. I am happy with it.I decided to write a review even though its too early because, before purchasing I looked for reviews and did not find many. Hopefully my review will help others in their decission making.I will write another review at the end of 30days.For now, I am a happy camper, pleased with Remington. Will continue to use it. I even used the pop-up trimmer on side bruns it works well.
