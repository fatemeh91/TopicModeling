review/text: I've been very happy with the Mach III for the past few years --but then a Fusion razor and cartridge came in the mail and I figured I'd give it a try.I'm probably a good one to test razors... see my photograph--not only do I shave my face, (though I typically have a goatee), but I also shave my entire head as well.I've been using the same Fusion blade now --daily on my face, and just about every third day on my head-- and despite some claims to the contrary, it's still going strong... after almost three weeks!!Why has my blade lasted this long, despite my pretty heavy usage? EVERY time I shave, after thoroughly rinsing the blade, I GIVE IT A QUICK SPRAY WITH SHOWER CLEANER. (Such as "Clean Shower" or any of the no-wipe cleaners that you spray after using the shower.)Then I set the razor so it's standing with the cartridge end down.This does two things. The shower cleaner ensures that no film of water remains to dry on the edges of the blades, leaving spots for microscopic rusty areas to form,) and standing the razor blade-side-down makes sure that gravity takes any debris or water that MIGHT be left on the blade, DOWN and AWAY from the blade edge, since the edge of the blades face UP when you have the cartridge down.Prior to doing this on the Mach III blades, I'd also get about 3 or 4 good shaves out of a blade... but once I tried it, I got as many as 30. It makes a HUGE difference! I should also point out that I almost never get nicks and cuts. (I've been shaving my head for about 4 years, and I think I've nicked it shaving ONCE... .part of the reason is because I'm very careful about using my blade-cleaning technique.)Note to Gillette... Send me a lifetime supply of Fusion cartridges and I'll consider removing the blade-life extending tip from this review! ;-)- Jonathan Sabin
