review/text: As a regular user of L-Arginine power, 3 to 4 grams per day.Con: This brand tastes awful, of course all brands taste bad, but this one is the worse so far. I mix each 2 gram portion with full glass of OJ.Pro: This brand is less glumpy, by that I mean doesn't clot up like the other brands. Also the price is economical.If you don't mind the taste or after taste, go ahead and use this brand.Best regards,Doug
