review/text: This trimmer performed well during the first year of use: sharp blades, fast, ergonomic, and easy to clean. After a year, the battery does not hold a recharge anymore, and you cannot used the trimmer connected to the power cord. I would not recommend this trimmer just because of the battery issue.
