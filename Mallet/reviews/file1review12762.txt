review/text: Used it on a patient that broke both wrists. I wish I had 2. The outside coating is not quite as heavy duty as Sam- splints but well worth the price, especially if you may not get it back. I plan on ordering a lot more. If you are a volunteer like me, they really do the job without breaking the bank. A true ski patrollers buddy.
