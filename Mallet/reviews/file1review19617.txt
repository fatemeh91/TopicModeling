review/text: From reading the reviews here, we had to try this seat out. Last night, my son picked out the red and white model. After getting it home, we had it set up in less than 10 seconds - he sat on it and peed in the potty!! He loves it and is so proud. It is well made, easy to fit and looks nice in our washroom. Thank you so much Baby Bjorn for a product that WORKS! We tried other seats and well, let's just not go there. This is the only seat you will need. LOVE IT!
