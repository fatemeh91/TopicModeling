review/text: I have used this for several years now and I'm very happy with the results as well as the flavor (Vanilla Ice Cream). Within 30 minutes of waking, I shake it with some water, 2 oz raw egg whites (in a carton) and 1 raw egg. It ends up reminding me of eggnog only better and not as thick. This is one of the things I do that I feel helps keep me muscular and lean. Great product.
