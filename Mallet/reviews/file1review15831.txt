review/text: I bought this product because Nature Made is rated in the top 3 manufactures of supplements. I think it has had some benefits to my problem with Osteoarthritis but OA is something that only gets worst with time. I think the Triple Flex product has help to relieve some of the pain. And I am hoping that it may restore some of the cartilidge. But there is no direct proof that anything can do that.
