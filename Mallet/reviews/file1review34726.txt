review/text: I bought this deodorant hoping natural, non-stick, non-aluminum, spray deodorant would be just the trick to take care of armpit smell for 24 hours. Nope.I walked out of the bathroom after using it feeling embarrassed by the strong floral scent. One other guy reviewing this product felt the scent was "masculine." I just had to laugh. Stinking like a blossom ready to burst isn't my idea of anything masculine. However, he did say, and I agree with him totally, this deodorant isn't an anti-perspirant. It isn't. It doesn't last even 24 hours when it comes to odor.I was disappointed with the product, but that's only because my body can really stink from sweat and I really couldn't handle the nostril-curdling stench of that calendula blossom. You know those people who wear too much patrouli oil and you feel you've just entered a medical marijuana shop? Well, think of medicinal calendula in the same way. No way.For men who want a strong, long-lasting natural deodorant and anti-perspirant (with a faint calendula scent), buy Tom's of Maine Long Lasting Soothing Calendula. It works and is completely reliable and you won't fear being asked about why you smell as you do.
