review/text: After about 4 years I need to order a new set of these pill organizers - they still work but I think I'll replace them before they fall apart. I carry one of these daily in my shirt pocket and the only problem that has arisen is that the script on the pill boxes has worn off on every one except Thursday - don't ask me why? When I bought my first set of these I had no idea that, for this price, they would last so long. I'm quite please with this product.
