review/text: I love this product and would reccomend it to anyone with vertigo and want to take a natural product.I had a rare type of vertigo and had been on prescriptin medicine for ten years.I wanted to get off that medicine and take a natural product.I had tried other types of natural stuff to no avail.I saw this product on Dr.OZ show last year 2011.He had talked about it for memory boost.I decided to research it and I found out it was also good for vertigo an I have been taking it ever since.
