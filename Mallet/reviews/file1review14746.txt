review/text: I was prescribed some therapy putty for my RSD after significantly improving my hand strength and motor skills in physical therapy. My insurance sent me the Cando Theraputty Hand Exercise Putty, 4oz, Green, from amazon and I was shocked when I opened the package to find a decent sized plastic container with only a tiny bit of putty.The putty itself weighs 2oz, with the container close to 3oz-- still NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 4oz stated in the product description.Therapy putty is great for restoring function to your hands, but buy from a different manufacturer that won't cheat you.
