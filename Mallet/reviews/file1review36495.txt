review/text: This deodorant is fantastic. I have tried many different kinds of all-natural deodorants in an effort to be healthier and avoid the chemicals in the mainstream antiperspirants. A few years ago, I started trying to find all-natural deodorants, buying them at Whole Foods and my local organic markets. Here's what I found out the hard way: most of them flat-out don't work. The ones that do work have other challenges problems; they make you smell like a hippie (e.g., patchouli, tee tree oil), they leave grease stains under your arms and on your clothes (e.g., Tom's of Maine), and/or they are difficult to apply (e.g., crystal deodorant).I had been using Kiss My Face "Scented" roll-on deodorant (orange package), which my husband still uses, but I was longing for the mess-free ease of a spray deodorant, as the roll-ons do take a moment to dry. I finally found it in this one.With a manual pump, it operates easily and produces a fine mist but without aerosols. The scent is clean and crisp, and though it smells like roses at first, the smell fades into the background quickly, which I like because I don't like to smell like my deodorant and want to still be able to use perfume without it clashing. It also works instantly -- meaning, you can use it to freshen up after a long day or before you go out for the evening and it instantly removes any body odor. I think this works extremely well for most everyday uses.Finally, it lasts a very long time -- I have about 20% of the bottle still left and I have used it at least once daily (2-4 sprays per arm) for about 4 months now. I just came here to buy another one and saw it had no feedback yet so wanted to give a hearty thumbs-up!
