review/text: I started taking this on Friday and had some watery bowel movements the next day. I thought I drank enough water but I think I was wrong. So on Saturday night, I took 5 instead of the recommended 6. I had stomach pains before I went to bed and I woke up with the feeling of having to go but nothing came out. The next day I felt sick. I had body aches, a head ache and stomach pains. I felt like I had the flu. I drank tons of water but still felt dehydrated. I took off work the next day because I still felt sick.I guess that some people react differently but mine was a little extreme. I would not recommend to anyone. I never write reviews but I felt that this needed to be out there.
