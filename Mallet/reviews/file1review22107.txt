review/text: I've worked 3rd for many years now and 6 months ago I began to loose sleep caused by tossing and turning and unable to stay asleep for more than 2 - 3 hours. I tried everything I could think of and even resorted to alcohol and Nyquil mixed ... yeah, really. Well, not too long after that I discovered this and it turns out I made a wise choice and it has helped me get my needed 8 hours once again. I don't wake up with a hangover from a sleeping pill and it's a natural product. I take it 20 - 30 minutes prior to going to bed and I fall asleep fast and get a great sleep. When nothing else worked ... and when I say worked I mean getting 8 hours of good sleep followed by waking up feeling like a had a good night sleep! I hated waking up feeling as tired as I did prior to sleeping. This helped. Try it. You have nothing to loose!
