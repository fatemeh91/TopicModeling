review/text: No bad taste. Good aroma. No trouble &#34;marketing&#34; it to the end client.Mine is 2 years old. We gave him Nordic-Natural DHA, Since 4 months of age (at first the Baby's DHA).Can't attribute any merits of his to this product, but altogether we are satisfied and confident in our belief that it helps.
