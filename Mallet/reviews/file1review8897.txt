review/text: Green vibrance has been a major factor in my recovering from pneumonia. About a year ago I came out of the Hospital and was treated with antibiotic for 8 days and nights. My immune system was bad and I needed to recover. I started taking the green vibrance and I did start to feel better quickly. The Doctor said to keep drinking it if I am feeling good on it. I have been on it for eight months now. Tip: I use Kefir milk and mix it with that for the extra pro-biotic in it. I call green vibrance swamp thing but it works!!! P.S it lowered my high bllod pressure from about 160/100 to a stable 120/75 :)
