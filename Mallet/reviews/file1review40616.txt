review/text: This stuff is great for the environment and it smells great. BUT...even though I rinse my dishes before I put them in the dishwasher, this stuff just doesn't do the job getting them clean. My glasses are all cloudy. Overall, I want to do my part for the environment but I REALLY want clean dishes too. I have to get through this case and then I'll be looking for something that works better.
