review/text: The old Dr. Flosser sold at Brookstone (not the new one from Flightek Ltd.) was the best. But this one massages your gums and is a pleasurable adjunct to normal flossing. The picks are great too. Excellent for massing between teeth and tones and invigorates while dislodging the gook. And it is so well made, like all of the Oral B / Braun products. I'm planning to keep one of these in my pocket for all occasions. And to keep one in my wife's pocket too!
