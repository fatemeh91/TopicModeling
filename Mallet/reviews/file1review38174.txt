review/text: I was very impressed by the absorbency and comfort of this product! These pads are supposed to be used for overnights, but they were so comfortable that I wore them during the day and didn't worry about leaks, They're super-absorbent and the wings help stop leaks on the sides. I'd definitely use this product again!!
