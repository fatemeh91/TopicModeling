review/text: If you want to believe all the hype go ahead and order this product. I did and have been using it since around February of this year after experiencing a bad reaction from Lescol XL (80 mg.). My total cholesterol was around 226 and LDL (bad) about 142 when I first started on it. I recently had my blood work up and the numbers were very discouraging:Total cholesterol now 246 (almost 9% increase!) and LDL now 173 (nearly 22% increase!. My HDL (good) has increased, but that my be due to a Niacin tablet (500 mg) I take each day. Ironically, I also used a Home Access cholesterol kit within an hour of my lab work to compare the results. The kit's results showed around 135-140! Talk about being off! I'll give that product a review elsewhere.I've been taking it for approximately 9 months now. I plan to utilize their money back policy (limit to only 3 bottles worth). Only I tossed out every box (need UPC label) except for the present box(who would save all those boxes?)Therefore, save your money and try a lower dose doctor recommended statin drug if you must. I would rather not go back on them, but it looks like I may have no other choice.
