review/text: I first tried Dermal Therapy Lotion at a yarn store (avid knitters often suffer dry hands from handling all that yarn) and was immediately surprised and impressed that a lotion could have such immediate effect. My hands felt noticeably softer right away and not at all sticky. I searched and found the product on Amazon and am now using it as my daily body moisturizer. I'll soon be ordering more. I highly recommend this product.
