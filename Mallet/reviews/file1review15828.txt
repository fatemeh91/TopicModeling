review/text: I am 62 years old and recently retired. About 6 weeks ago I started walking between 2 and 5 miles each morning and taking daily doses of Triple Flex, Fish Oil and multi vitamin for men over 50. They seem to be working, have reduced pain in ankles and knees but the 1500mg caplets are awfully hard to swallow. I am now looking for caplets either half the size or slippery gel caps.
