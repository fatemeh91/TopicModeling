review/text: My toddler loves the flintstone multivitamin GUMMIES. The Paediatrician recommended something with iron for her and I got this without realizing these are "chewable tablets" (and not gummies which are more like candies for kids!). My toddler does not like tablet looking vitamins as she thinks it is "medicine"It is a poor cousin to the Gummies. I wish they had flintstone with iron gummies. Not sure if I would buy this again.
