review/text: I read the books that suggested getting a cover for the changing pad, and I put it on when I was putting our room together. It gives a finishing look to our Changing table -- however once we brought our son home, we ended up changing it everytime we changed him. Granted it's our first child, so maybe you will be much neater when changing your baby, but we are pretty good at it now, and I still wouldn't put it on. It's just another thing to wash -- and he loves lying on the Changing pad with no cover. It's nice to look at, but not necessary.
