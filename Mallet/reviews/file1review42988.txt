review/text: I've been using this thing for the kitchen since forever. It seems to do the job: sink, countertop, all kids of surfaces, oven, what have you: it cleans them up very well. The first spray bottle I bought in a drugstore and now only buy refills reusing the bottle. Nothing much to say about this product; it works and that all that matters: recommended.
