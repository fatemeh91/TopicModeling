review/text: This product does exactly what it is supposed to do. There will be some pain at first when using this product, but its gets easier after the first time. The key to using a epilator is to exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate. If not, you will have some serious ingrown hairs. Don't expect your legs to be in anyway as smooth as shaving with a razor though. The epilator works really well for your underarms as well as legs.
