review/text: As another reviewer explained, the head on the brush is too large to fit comfortably in your mouth and the bristles are way too hard. I could not even finish brushing my teeth when I tried to use it because it was so uncomfortable. Plus it comes in a plastic container (not marked as recyclable) which is not helpful if you are buying this product to reduce your plastic consumption. I would instead recommend the Brooks Pearwood Boar Bristle, a very similar product in the same price range that has a smaller head and much softer bristles.
