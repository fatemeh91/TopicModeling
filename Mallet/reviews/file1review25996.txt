review/text: I keep trying to find a better sleep mask than this (look at my reviews for others I've tried) but I keep coming back to Mindfold.The Mindfold does an absolutely perfect job of blocking out all light, and is very comfortable (might not be when you sleep on your side, however.)Minuses: this is a cheaply made product, made from cheap materials. It cannot be cleaned. So if you like this, you will buy it over and over again.
