review/text: Other than getting a defective unit, I don't understand why anyone would rate this less than 5 stars. The heater works fast even if the water is room temperature; the jets are as powerful as the unit can contain and it is easy to fill and drain (I just remove the splash guard and dump it into the bathtub.)I spent the extra money in hopes of getting a quality unit that will last a long time. I showed the Amazon listing to a coworker, and she says she has had the same unit (different branding, but identical) for more than ten years and uses it frequently. I lamented the inability to add stuff to the bath (after having done so)and she said she has added stuff from day one. The trick is to keep the spa clean - don't let it sit with dirty water or salts. Rinse it right away or just add small amounts of oils instead of salts. I am very happy with every aspect of this purchase and definitely recommend this unit to anyone interested in a foot spa. I love it...
