review/text: After doing a good deal of research on assisted supplements, I decided to choose this based on the good things I heard about this in forums. Now of course, one must use common sense, it does have caffeine in it but that is not its foundation. Best time to take this is in the morning (or when you wake up) then the next pack 4-5 hours later. Of course you do not want to take it late at night.More importantly, the product works. I previously used mri black powder with my workouts but took a break from it as I didn't want to over supplement myself. With this product, you will want to drink plenty of water, and don't expect it to be a magic pill. I used this with my normal workouts, and even on non-workout days, the results are showing and my body fat level has decreased 2% from previous level leaving me at about 8% body fat (considered very lean), regardless I am still on my last week of it, so I have not finished. It is 9 pills per pack, which is only the slighest hassle, no big deal. It gives good energy and no crashes. It does contain caffeine, but the more important ingredients are in the thyroid complex as well as the green tea extract.Animal cuts tackles the problem from all angles, not just a few. Read about it, and especially the label, and learn for yourself!
