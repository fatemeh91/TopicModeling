review/text: I had struggled with the aching pain of varicose veins for many years. Most women don't get them until either pregnant or elderly (or so I'd been told), but for me they started as a teenager. Doctors were not able to help.CircuLegs have helped; they have significantly reduced the aching pain from varicose veins. Not a complete cure, but helpful.Several years ago, I read in a mainstream magazine (I forget which), that for varicose veins, there was some actual scientific studies that showed some benefit from two herbs -- Horse Chestnut and Butcher's Broom. I thought it worth a try, and looked for those two herbs.These capsules contain the herbs Horse Chestnut, and Butcher's Broom, blended with other herbs, including Centella Asiatica.My previous experience with other types of herbs -- for remedying other problems -- had left me skeptical of exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims for the benefits of herbs. However, CircuLegs capsules have improved my quality of life.Please note recommendations that these herbs not be taken for a few days immediately before surgery, because there might be potentially more bleeding or less clotting. I am not a doctor nor a nurse; just passing on what they had told me. And of course I discuss with my physician all herbs taken.Addendum, April 2011: I recently learned that Potassium is an important nutrient for leg comfort. Many people don't get enough -- maybe not eating enough foods with potassium (e.g. bananas) on a daily basis. Higher dose potassium supplement pills can be prescribed by a doctor if a blood test shows extra-low levels of potassium.
