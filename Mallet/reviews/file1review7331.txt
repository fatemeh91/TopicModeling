review/text: Bought this foot bath for my father's Christmas present. He loved it UNTIL it started to leak. You have to take the stopper out to dump out the water. When we put the stopper back in it started to leak. So we tried to tighten it and that didn't work. So my father said that we should go and get some more O rings for the stopper. Tried that. Only to have the whole stopper crack in half. It had been cracked and we didn't even know it. I have called Brookstone twice so that we can send it back. First time talked to rep and said that they would send an email with the shipping label to send it back. Four days later called again. Different rep-said that they had never even sent the email. And oh by the way we are not going to sell that foot bath anymore. She said she would send email so that I could return it-guess what four days have gone by again and not one word from Brookstone. Going to have to call again. And all this time my father is without his Christmas gift. This whole situation has been a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
