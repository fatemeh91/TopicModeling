review/text: I had read that the herb chasteberry can help with ovulation. When I started taking FertilAid, I saw immediate results. I had regular cycles for the first time ever. I became pregnant after only taking FertilAid for 3 months. With my last pregnancy, I had to take Clomid to get pregnant. The pill is easy to swallow and did not upset my stomach at all. The only thing I didn't like is you have to take FertilAid 3 times a day.
