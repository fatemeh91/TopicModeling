review/text: Following a search and in-depth review on-line of similar products, I purchased theBody Back Buddy(+ the DVD) as a gift for my daughter, who suffered neck/shoulder/back injuries in an auto accident several years ago. Periodically, she goes for trigger-point injections, which seem to provide some pain relief, albeit for a limited duration. (In between times, she can often be seen attempting to reach around & press with her fingers on certain points in her shoulder/neck area.) Anyway, I was hoping and praying this would prove to be beneficial on a more regular basis, based on user reports. Well... virtually from within a few minutes of taking the item out of the box, she was able to use it to reach those same points & exert deep pressure which provided some immediate pain relief. She's raving about the gift, & wondering why neither her Dr.--nor other professionals from whom she's received treatment, e.g., therapists--recommended same. Surmising they might not be aware of the product, she told me she plans on informing all of them about it--perhaps even doing a "show and tell." So, based on my daughter's reaction & experience--who, by the way, is a highly educated, working professional despite her disability--I'd have to give this product the highest rating possible--5 stars!! (And thanks to the inventor/manufacturer for such a wonderful product.)
