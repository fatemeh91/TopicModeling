review/text: First let me say that I've owned a number of highly rated step on scales that were all disappointingly inaccurate and inconsistent. This scale agrees with the one in my doctor's office, so seems to be accurate. If you get off to re-weigh yourself, it will give you the same result again. You won't gain or lose 3-5 pounds in a few seconds by getting off and on the scale, or by leaning a certain way or placing your feet in a certain spot, so it is consistent. It could be a little sturdier, but it's fine for home use. We've had it for at least a year or two with no problems. I give it 5 stars for home use.
