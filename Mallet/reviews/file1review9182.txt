review/text: If you're taking a lot of pills like me, then these large Amex Medi Chest pill containers are the way to go. The compartments are large and easy to work with. And I love that each day's worth of pills can be removed so you only have just the 1 day's compartment to deal with, instead of having to handle the entire week's container all at once. Everything is clearly marked in nice bold black ink and is easy to read, even without glasses. I bought 5 of these and prep a whole month in advance at a time. The price was right, so I'd rather do that tedious chore monthly instead of weekly. They appear to be durable too, so I expect them to last me a good while. Would definitely buy again. Good Luck!!
