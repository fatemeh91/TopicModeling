review/text: I purchased this because it stated a long lasting shine. What a HUGE mistake. The only time I saw a shine was when it was wet and then it dried to a matte finish. Now I have to strip my floor because it is actual wax and now won't take any other product. Thank goodness I noticed the dull finish before I did more than my hallway. Down the drain with this junk.
