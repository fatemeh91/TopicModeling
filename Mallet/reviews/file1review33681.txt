review/text: Ok, I'm an idiot. My 3rd (or 4th?) Water Pik has given up the ghost after 2 months. The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle. The latest one leaks water and so it's obviously an electrical hazard. Every one has only lasted 2-3 months. Amazingly shoddy quality control.
