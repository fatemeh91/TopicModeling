review/text: I've tried a few different brands/varieties of whey protein (my personal preference over soy or other forms) and the pricing plus performance benefits from Optimum (the pricing when buying on Amazon, that is) is outstanding.I bought the 5.15 pound size, double-rich chocolate. I do weight-training workouts 3-4 times per week and have 1-scoop with milk about 1 hour before my workout and then 1-2 scoops in a fruit/protein smoothie after my workout. Even with that regimen, I feel like I have not made a dent in the amount of protein powder I have left.More importantly, I feel very good and energized when using this in conjunction with my workouts, and have noticed significant lean muscle mass gains - a testament to this formula packing on the protein without the calories (in addition to obviously maintaining a reasonably healthy diet, etc.)With the 5.15-pound container, you'll be getting (per scoop):- 120 calories (10 from fat)- 1g fat (saturated, 0.5 g) [2% of daily serving]- 30mg cholesterol [10%]- 60mg sodium [3%]- 3g Total carbs (sugars 1g) [1%]- 24g ProteinThe mix tastes good, blends "relatively" easily with milk (even after some vigorous stirring, you will still find little "globs" of gooey protein powder that never completely dissolved), blends very well if you use a blender, and is overall a great product that I'd recommend to anyone wanting to get more from their workouts or who simply want a good protein isolate/essential amino acids supplement).
