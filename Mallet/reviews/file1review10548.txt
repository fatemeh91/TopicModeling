review/text: This cane has a plastic adjustment ring around the bottom of the upper metal piece; said ring has a screw adjustment knob attached, apparently to tighten the upper metal shaft against the lower metal piece for stability. The very first time I tried to do this, the plastic ring broke apart - just not strong enough to tighten a metal shaft. Thus, the cane is a little more wobbly than desired.
