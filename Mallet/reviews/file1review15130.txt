review/text: I'm 61 years old, but I have EAGLE EYE Vision, and I'm sick to death and very disappointed that the fine print on the ingredients of the BALANCE BARS "ALMOND BROWNIE," are FISH GELATIN. IF I wanted FISH products in my protein bar I'd buy a FISH BAR, but the fact that Balance Bars use Fish Gelatin in their ALMOND BROWNIE wishes I could SHOVE THE ENTIRE 6 box order up their noses.It's so sad the ingredients and the junk that almost any company will put in your food. I will NOT BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN, and I doubt that although I've been a huge balance bar customer, that I'll EVER ORDER BALANCE BARS again, as they are FISH GELATIN bars in truth. SEE LABEL.I'm done.
