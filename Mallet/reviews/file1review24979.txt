review/text: After going off the pill, my first cycle was about 50 days...the next one 45, and then 45 again. It was making it very hard to estimate ovulation, and also my luteal phase was only about 6 or 7 days. After one month of taking Fertilaid my cycle went to 33 days and my luteal phase to 8 days. The next month I was pregnant. I really have to credit this stuff with my success!
