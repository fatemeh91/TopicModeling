review/text: This sweeper is basically worthless. The brush that is supposed to pick up items is too far away from the sides of the dustbin, so that you must bend over and use your hands to move debris away from walls and furniture for the sweeper to catch it. Same goes for debris in the grout grooves... the brush doesn't reach 1/8 of an inch below the level of our tile. As long as I'm bent over to move the debris to a position that this sweeper can catch, I might just as well pick it up myself.As noted by other reviewers, the handle falls apart frequently, even though we followed instructions for assembly, and "banged" it as recommended by other reviewers. The only good thing is that the dustbin opens easily for emptying what little debris is collected.
