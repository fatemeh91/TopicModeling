review/text: What's bad:1. It has a single wide-blade that is supposed to be used for both the beard and the moustache. Without a narrow-blade it is very difficult to define the line of moustache because the wide blade cuts at un-intended places too.2. The blade is so weak that it can't be used to form the outline of the beard cleanly. Hairs outside the outline of the beard can't get a close cut.Why 1 star--For an important thing like this, one can be either completely satisfied or completely un-satisfied, there can't be anything between the two; nobody likes to spend money and time to settle for something mediocre.Within a week I switched to another trimmer and I like it very much. Its Wahl Groomsman XL2, I bought it at Walmart. It has dual blades; and it works great in trimming and removing unwanted hairs (the only bad thing about this is it is a bit noisy compared to Norelco T765).
