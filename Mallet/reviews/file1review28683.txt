review/text: Great protein supplement. In the past I have gotten the chocolate flavor, which also tastes good, but cookies and cream tastes great too. There are a lot of other people who can tell you why this is good protein so I won't bother with repeating anything. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is looking for protein, especially for use with work outs.
