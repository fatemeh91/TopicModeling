review/text: My mdse was listed incorrected. Nowhere in the discription did it say anything about a peekaboo toe. These stockings are for people who can't walk and need their feet checked. I on the other hand need the stocking for walking, so the hole in the bottom of the stocking makes them unuseable for me. The mdse did not come with an order form or a return slip. So when I went back to Amazon online, to see what i had to do to return the hose, I found a phone number where you could reach the company. After many attempts and messages, no one ever contacted me from this company. I have since put a claim into my credit card, and maybe someday I'll be able to get the hose I need.
