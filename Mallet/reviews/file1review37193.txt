review/text: The gloves, once I finally got a pair that fit, keep my hands a little warm. But as far as helping with R.A. pain and stiffness, I am finding very little difference. In fact, I almost think my left hand is worse off for wearing them, but I'm still not totally decided on that.The sizing chart, at least for me, wasn't anywhere near accurate. According to it, I should have ordered a small pair. I didn't see how that could possibly be right, so I initially ordered a medium pair. They were so tight they cut off circulation to my fingers altogether and I could barely get them off. Luckily I ordered them through the Amazon fulfillment program, so sending them back and getting a large pair wasn't too big of a pain. The large pair still seem a little tighter than I'd like, they're more than "snug", but I've got to think the next size up would be way too big.All in all, I'm still wearing them for a few hours a day to give them a fair trial, but I think in the end they're going to end up being a waste of money.
