review/text: with water, soap and bits of food. We use it for glasses, the blender, other deep items - does an OK job, and it's the only tool we have right now to clean such things.But as soon as you pull the brush out of whatever you're washing, even a little bit, the bristles spray water, suds and food in all directions. It sprays my clothes, clean dishes in the dish drainer, the countertops, even the cabinet doors. That's at normal washing speed - I mean, you're trying to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time, right? So you're kind of moving right along, and spatterspatterspatter. It doesn't help to slow down - it still gets you. At the moment I have a few dozen spatter marks on my shirt, which means there are even more deposited in an arc around the sink.I've never had a bottle brush do this kind of thing, not so easily. OXO, this ain't rocket science! OXO's made me a pizza wheel that fell apart, another pizza wheel that collects water in the handle while in the dishwasher, so when you take it out you have to pull the handle off and put it and the blade to dry in the dish-drainer. OXO made me another scrub brush - the kind where you put soap in the handle and push on the rubber top to make the soap come out, but the entire brush tends to fall off quite easily. Again, not rocket science. I think maybe OXO "engineers" don't actually try to use the tools they design.
