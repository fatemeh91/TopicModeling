review/text: Some times I feel I have some of the most sensitive skin in the world and discovering Vitec Vitamin E Cream has been the answer to a long and expensive search for a moisturizer my skin could tolerate. As a light, soothing moisturizer, I use it mornings before I put on my makeup and at night after I shower. I use it when ever I feel the effects winter heat or outdoor sun and wind. I highly recommend Vitec Vitamin E Cream to others with sensitive skin.
