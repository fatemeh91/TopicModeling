review/text: This was my first DE safety razor. I have fallen in love with it. The grip is steady, even with damp hands and the weight of the razor does all the work for you.There is a slight learning curve. And I nicked myself a couple of times the first time. But each time was drastically easier than the last. Now, I get near perfect shaves every time.What once was my most hated and dreaded of chores is now one of my favorite hobbies. And my girlfriend likes kissing me again.But remember, the actual blades are just as-if not more-important to make sure you get the smooth, steady shave you are looking for.
