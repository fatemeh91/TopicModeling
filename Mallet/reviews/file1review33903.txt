review/text: My husband is a Medical Student and I'm a Nurse...I was given this at my nursing school and loved it and my hubby paid lots of money for his Littmann Classic II SE. We tried hearing the difference between the 2 and could not find any! For the quality and price the ADC is truly an excellent stethoscope!
