review/text: It does the job, so I shouldn't complain. I just wish the bristles were a little bit stiffer to help really scrub the bottles and such. Overall I like it, but it's not the end-all be-all of bottle brushes.And the reviews indicating that it is not for smaller openings... that's a load of garbage. It can basically fit into an inch opening... not sure what on earth they were doing.
