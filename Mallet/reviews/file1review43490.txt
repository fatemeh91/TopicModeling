review/text: I bought it a year ago for my parents. The one part I like about it is the ease of use. Anyone who can operate a simple electronic device should be able to operate this. My parents are the least tech savvy people but still manage to use it. the BP cuff fits most people and easy to donn and doff, but may not fit those who are overweight. Overall good product at great price.
