review/text: I had the same problem that Gregory had for a long time I always though it was the condom with the problem I would break them or they would roll up so I would have to keep adjusting the condom in the middle of doing it. now who would want to go though that? you know so I was frustrated and I was too scared of trying a magnum because magnums are for the big boys and I didn't want to get my feelings hurt. I was thinking me putting a magnum on would be like putting a tooth pick though a hula hoop. but I one day finally tried it and it work no ripping not sliding or rolling so thank god trojen came out with this brand but I just have one problem as many types of condoms trojen has they don't have different type for the xl like where's the ribbed or spermiside xls? That's something they need to work on.
