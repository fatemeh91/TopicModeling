review/text: I own this item more than a month now, and I can say that this Blood Pressure Monitor is great!It will measure your blood pressure in few seconds and give your heartbeat rate.It works on the wrist, so there is no need to roll-up sleeves in order to measure your blood pressure.Display is large, so my parents can see the results without putting their reading glasses on.Whole family is using it daily.
