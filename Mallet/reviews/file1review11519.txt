review/text: I bought these batteries about 2 years ago along with the "Duracell Rechargeable ACCU 15 Minute Charger" that the batteries came with. They claim to last hundreds of charges before being depleted. Within 6 months, one by one each battery either A) would die in a few hours (I'm using them for my Xbox 360 controllers) or B) Won't recharge at all anymore on the docking station. Now I'm down to my final 2 that will even recharge and I basically have to recharge them once every 3-4 days. And I don't even play my video games that much! I'd say about 5-6 hours a week.I'm shocked Duracell, such a long lasting, reliable company, would make such a shoddy product.
