review/text: I have tried many electric razors in my life time and this one is one of the best. You would think for the price that it can'tbe as good as those much higher priced shavers but be leave me it is. Beleave me in my life time i have tried all the big namebrands. The close and super close sreens are the two you should get. The Whal 7367-500 comes with all the heads you'll need.
