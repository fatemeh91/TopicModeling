review/text: ::: U P D A T E :::I have basically stopped taking this supplement. I log my food in a food journal and realize that by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables (especially orange ones!) I was getting plenty of natural vitamin A. Taking this supplement did not seem to harm or aid my skin. It may be worth a try for some. It isn't a 'bad' product, so I wont detract from the rating, but it didn't do what I was looking for.::: O R I G I N A L R E V I E W :::23 year old female with cystic acne...I have been trying lots of vitamin supplements to help with my acne. Right now I am taking one of these every morning and every night along with optizinc at night and fish oil omega-3s. I'm also using a sulfur based soap. Since I am using so many products it is difficult to say which are helping but I would say that this is worth a shot. It is inexpensive and if taken as directed will last a long time.Beware of vitamin A toxicity. Right now I am taking 2 a day but only until my skin clears up a bit more. Maybe 2-3 weeks total and then I'll knock it down to 1 a day.When my skin is clear(er), I plan to remove one product at a time to see if I no longer need them. I will update my final thoughts on vitamin A when I do so.
