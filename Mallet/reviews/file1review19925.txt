review/text: Our 2 1/2 yr old likes this seat. She is on the way to being trained, but for now it is just for fun. The seat holds firmly into place & is easy to clean (plus no cleaning out potty seat bowls...yuck). We learned that BabiesRUs in Plano does not carry them any longer b/c of complaints that children find them uncomfortable, we did not have that problem and purchased another one from Amazon for upstairs. **Tip, use an over the door towel hook on the side of the potty (on tank, under lid) to hang this seat from, keeps it off of the floor and easy to reach for the toddler.** Use with Bjorn step stool for added safety, comfort and independence for child.
