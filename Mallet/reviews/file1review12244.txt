review/text: I just tried my Just Once prenatal vitamins and am happy to say that unlike the prenatal vitamins I've had in the past, these do not make me sick. Perhaps its that these are a natural, food based supplement or perhaps they don't contain such high doses of many vitamins but these are easy to take (yes, a tad big but I've had bigger) and they smell kinda green and earthy, not pungent like other prenatals. Most importantly, they do not make me feel queezy so big plus there. Happy I found these and they are available in most drug stores.
