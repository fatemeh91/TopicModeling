review/text: The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they're spread out. That's ok IF you use this brush to remove food from utensils prior to placing in dishwasher.If you're trying to clean pans though, this brush won't be perfect. In that case, consider a brush just meant for that purpose such as this one:Cuisinart Round Head Brush, Black.I recently discovered the advantage of using both kinds of brushes depending on what I'm doing. This way, the kitchen brush isn't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items. The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one, but I found it better this way.
