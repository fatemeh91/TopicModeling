review/text: I have about 12 of these. lemme tell you something first off. If you plan to use batteries very frequently, they will do. but i left for a week on vacation and i come back only to find ALL my batteries are dead. Now i have to wait 16+ hours just to do a few things that i should've been able to do immediately. i recommend to have a few backup packs of alkaline handy before buying these.
