review/text: Just spent $60 on a repair call to figure out why my dishwasher is not cleaning my dishes anymore. Coffee stains on my cups, food on plates and silverware, film on glasses... Dishwasher is fine. When I asked if it was at all possible that the problem was the new dishwashing gel, the repairman mentioned exactly what other reviewers have said, that this gel was not good, created ineffective suds and was prone to suds overflowing. He recommended the Cascade balls which are also recommended by Consumer Reports. http://www.amazon.com/Cascade-Complete-Phosphate-48-Count-Container/dp/B002SB95ZK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1288293195&sr=8-1
