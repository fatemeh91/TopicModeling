review/text: I received a free one of these in the mail. Since I was going on vacation, I took it with me. I didn't even realize that I didn't need to use shaving cream until I examined it more.I love this razor - here are some reasons pro/conPros:1) You do not need to bring small versions of shave cream for travel as this is all in one.2) The razor gives a nice, close shave3) The way it is built makes it easy to hold onto (rubber grips to prevent slipping)4) The plastic cap prevents the soap on the cartridge from wearing away too fast (mine has lasted almost two months and I use it 5 - 7 times a week)5) The plastic cap also keeps the blade from rusting (a problem in my oceanic area)Cons:1) A bit expensive for the cartridge refills, but then I guess you save money not buying shave cream2) once the soap surrounding the blade wears away, it seems like you can adjust the blade so it is still surrounded by soap, but it's difficult3) not having shave cream can make it confusing as to where you've already shaved/not shavedOverall, I love this thing - but I do wish the replacement cartridges were a tad cheaper.
