review/text: We have had a medium sized Thermophore heating pad for over 50 years and it has worked perfectly all that time. I thought it would be a good idea to get another one for travel and for back-up. We purchased the medium size (14"x14"), and have been most happy with it. The new pad is virtually the same as the original and works just as well. Also it is still manufactured in the USA at the same address as our original. Before buying the new Thermophore pad, we tried several other widely advertised pads, but none of them were satisfactory: some didn't get warm enough; a few didn't last more than a couple of uses before the switch malfunctioned, and some were obviously cheaply made overseas. It is prudent to pay a few bucks more to get the absolute best and save yourself the trouble of returning the inferior pads for a refund!
