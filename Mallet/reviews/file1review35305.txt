review/text: Since beginning my low-carb way of life nearly 6 months ago - and having lost close to 50 pounds - I was thrilled to see that Atkins (and Keto brand also) have come out with cold cereals! Excellent as a snack or for breakfast, these cereals taste great! They're also nice and crunchy, feature the right amount of sweetness and leave no aftertaste. I eat mine with 0-carb-per-serving whipping cream - yum! My favorite flavor is Almond Crisp but Blueberry is also good. Haven't tried the Banana yet. Go get some and enjoy your cereal again - the healthy, low-carb way!
