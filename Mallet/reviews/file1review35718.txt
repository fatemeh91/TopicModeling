review/text: I got the Dry Eye Relief, anticipating relief. Unfortunately the liquid only dribbled from the applicator in very small amounts. I checked the hole in the applicator and attempted to enlarge it but to no avail. What little of the product that actually got in my eyes seemed harmless enough - I did not get enough to tell if it would have provided any significant relief.
