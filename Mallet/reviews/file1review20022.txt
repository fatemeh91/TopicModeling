review/text: We love this tub. We had the same one for our older children and after purchasing a different tub for our newest addition, I searched the internet to find this one. It is great because it fits perfectly on the kitchen sink and it fold up to store. The other tub we bougth leaked and did not fold, but this one is great for space saving with no leaks!
