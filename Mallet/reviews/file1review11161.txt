review/text: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She is a big Hannah Montana fan, and loves the brush. Too bad there is no way to change the head - or even the batteries! It is less than 2 months old, the batteries are dead. Now it is just more junk for the landfill.The idea of 2 minute brushing and music combined is a great idea. Too bad the company couldn't have made it to last. I won't be buying another one.
