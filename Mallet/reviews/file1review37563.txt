review/text: -Powerful odor protection that lasts all day-Clean masculine scentI have sensitive skin and have experimented with many different deodorants to find those that offer good odor protection without inflaming my skin. In my search, there are 3 types that I can use regularly without a problem and out of those, Speed Stick Musk is my #1 CHOICE!! To me it smells great. If you've never smelled this, I think it closely resembles the scent of some kind of canned shaving foam. If you've never thought about trying this because you've smelled musk after-shave....don't worry, it's NOT LIKE THAT STUFF. The scent is VERY clean without being overly strong like some others. Recently, it seems that some deodorants try to concentrate more on smelling like cologne than being a product to rub on your pits.Speed Stick Musk is a clear solid so there is none of that white gunk that can grab onto your hairs and discolor your shirts. For me, I have observed that the odor protection is BETTER than any other I have tried which proves to me that expensive doesn't mean better. This has EVERTHING I'm looking for...First and most importantly, it's EFFECTIVE and GENTLE on my skin.Secondly, it has a fresh, clean scent.Lastly, it's a GREAT value.This contains only six ingredients with stearyl alcohol being listed last and is thankfully ALUMINUM FREE!. Maybe that's why I have found it to be refreshingly gentle yet completely powerful. Whatever it is....I LOVE IT. For a guy that has never been completely brand-loyal, this is one of those brands where I make an exception.
