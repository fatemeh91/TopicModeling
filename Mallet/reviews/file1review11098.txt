review/text: This product is simple to use. Just pour a pack into a cup add water and you are done. With only 20 calories, 5 grams of sugar, and approx 28 cents per cup before freight cost (with FRT approx 42 cents), it is a great liquid alternative. I have noticed that it is an energy booster for a very busy lifestyle.
