review/text: The Pro Stretch PT200 Heel Stretch Device for two feet makes my legs and whole body feel energized when I use it. The Pro Stretch for one foot does just as good a job, but it is quicker to use the Pro Stretch for two feet. A reminder: If you are out of shape, start slowly to prevent cramps.
