review/text: Now I know the title is hardly a ringing endorsement, but its true. I noticed that a common theme with this product seemed to be the nasty taste. I was intregued by the idea that a bunch of health food nuts could be so turned off by the flavor of a superfood that it would dissuade them from buying it. Some of this was from the Athletic Greens site, however, a competitor for this category who sells the same basic product for almost 3x the money. So I want to see how this stuff tastes, and to supplement my diet with it for a breakfast item. I decided to maximize the gross out taste element by mixing it with filtered water, not fresh juice. To my surprise it is not disgusting. It's no party in my mouth, as the kids say, but it is far from offensive. Additionally, it does pack a ton of food based nutrients into a small dose. Vitamins, "nutrient dense plant concentrates" by the barrel full, antioxidants, probiotics, and a lot more food based things that should prove to be very good for me. I am impressed with the product, and amazed that anyone would refuse to endorse it on the basis of taste.
