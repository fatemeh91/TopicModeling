review/text: I did not realize until after I ordered them and had just started using them that this formula contains raspberry leaf. I am not a medical professional but from what I've read and been advised, raspberry leaf must be avoided during most of your pregnancy because it can cause uterine contractions or some other uterine problems. In the very end of the pregnancy around your due date it's ok because it helps tone the uterus. But before that, you don't want raspberry leaf's effects on your uterus until you are getting ready to deliver. By the way, same issue applies to Mom To Be Tea by a different company that makes herbal teas (edit: thanks to Rebecca's comment, I've edited this to say controversial instead of dangerous).
