review/text: I LOVE this stuff for 3 reasons:1. Taste--- blend it with ice and you've got a slushie that tastes great! It goes down easy and keeps you full. Low in fat and carbs, too!2. Quality--- tried lots of big name companies and this one is hands down the best. This truly gave me GREAT results. I'm in the best physical shape of my life. I put on more than 5 pounds of muscle in the past 1 1/2 months! And helped me get shredded at the same time.3. Price--- hard to beat the price for what you're getting. This company doesn't blow its dollars on lots of advertising and instead uses it more wisely on R&D.;I was drinking the strawberry flavored one but recently tried vanilla ice cream and wow!... things just got better! I love the taste and found me something new. As expected the results haven't changed (which works for me). I recommend this to all my friends. If you gave it a try you won't be disappointed.
