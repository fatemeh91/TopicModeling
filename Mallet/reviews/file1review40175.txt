review/text: I am glad that I found this toothpaste. I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but all the gels and things make them sensitive. My husband and I use it and I can tell a difference in the color of our teeth. They are much whiter. I can purchase this at my local Wal-Mart for 97 cents a tube. As far as freshening breath, I do believe it could do a little better in that area...that is why I only gave 4 stars. But, as long as I use mouthwash after I brush it's really not a problem!
