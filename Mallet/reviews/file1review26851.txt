review/text: I first bought the vanillia version, However, the taste of isn't really that great and small protein bits can be annoying. However, I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate, and is something you can really enjoy. But in the end I guess it's all about personal taste, it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n' cream but not the chocolate. I first bought the Cookies N' Creavanilla version of the Optimum whey. It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time, and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it.
