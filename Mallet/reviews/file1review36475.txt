review/text: I've worn this a few times and I'm still not sure if I like it. Most important thing to remind folks is that it's a very strong rose smell. Now I don't usually buy a lot of items with strong perfume, so it may not smell as strong with other people. But the first spray was definitely a tad overpowering. It doesn't smell bad. It's just strong. As far as its effectiveness, I've worn it to work and the only thing that bothered me is that I could still smell the strong rosy odor even after a few hours. I don't like that. I wish it was a bit more subtle. That's the reason why I haven't tried this while going to the gym. I'm a little hesitant because I'm afraid that the rosy odor would bother me (and other people). So I give it 4 stars, because I'm a fan of Weleda, but take one star away because of the overpowering odor.
