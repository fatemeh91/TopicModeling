review/text: I didnt think that paying for a good shaver would ever be worth it after using a super cheap one for a couple years. I thought it did a good job.I was wrong. This thing is super easy to use, sleek, and literally gets my gotee touched up within about 20 seconds. I've had it for about 6 months and dont think I've plugged it in since its' initial charge.
