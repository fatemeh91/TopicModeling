review/text: The first one came and worked for 2 weeks in the car. It was so good for my back I ordered 2 more. The next day, that first one went flat from a hole in the seam. Of the next two, one went flat immediately and never held air, even without use. The third is still holding air OK. But to lose two out of three is not good. I e-mailed the company but never got a response. I am disappointed in a product with great potential and use and in a group that never responds.
