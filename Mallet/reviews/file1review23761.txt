review/text: As I have gotten older, I've found that I'm beginning to over-pronate, leading to pain on the inside of my knee, especially during lateral movements during workouts. Before spending the money on custom orthotics, I decided to try these. They have been immensely helpful; the pain in my left knee is gone and the right has improved considerably. They fit into my athletic shoes easily, without removing the lining, and don't make my shoes overly tight. I have only used them in my gym shoes so I don't know if they would fit as well in street shoes. I have a high arch and these inserts give me the support I need.
