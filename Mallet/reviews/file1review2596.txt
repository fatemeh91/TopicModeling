review/text: When my friend was getting married, I spent hours researching the world's best condoms and lube etc. (Best condom: Okamoto Crown, just fyi) This is definitely a fantastic lube. My friend suffers from dryness, and this lube is totally effective. That friend actually texted me recently saying that SHE wanted to buy this for her friend who was getting married (my friends are a bunch of Christian virgins with no experience with lubes) and asked me how to find it.I find that the runner ups when you need a quick drugstore fix are: Wet Platinum and Astroglide X (not the normal Astroglide! This one is all silicones, and much better.) But Pjur is the best.
