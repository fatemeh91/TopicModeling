review/text: When I was contemplating whether or not to buy this, one of my main concerns was the quality of the material. I also wasn't sure whether to buy this or the TheraCane.After receiving this in the mail, I am very pleased with the quality of the product. It is somewhat heavy and the plastic feels very strong and solid to me. It is not cheap toy plastic for sure. I talked to one of my friends who has tried TheraCane as well as this one. He said the TheraCane is too short and due to the bigger curve, it was more wobbly/flexible than back buddy. So I am very happy that I went with this.It is very easy to use and can be held in any way you like to reach hard to reach places on the back by myself.
