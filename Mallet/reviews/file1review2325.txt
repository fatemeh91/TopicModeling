review/text: As I often do, I read the users reviews prior to purchasing a product and was convinced this was a wonderful product. I've suffered for years from chronic dry eyes due to Sjogren's Syndrome and even though I take prescription Restassis, nothing much seemed to help me. I stopped wearing eye make-up and even some concealers I applied near my eyes bothered them and yet they STILL were very dry!Then along came news of THERA TEARS and I decided to give them a try. At first I was skeptical. Even my Opthamologist was but I decided not to give up and give them a try anyway. I WAS VERY GLAD I DID!!! I even wrote my doctor and told him to suggest them to his chronic dry eye patients.Recommended dosage is 3 capsules a day but I take 2 and they really help to make my eyes less bothersome. I noticed a difference after only 2 weeks and even notice my eyes being drier when I haven't taken them. They haven't cured my dry eyes but they sure have made my daily life more bearable, especially while driving when my eyes seem to be the driest.I highly recommend them!.
