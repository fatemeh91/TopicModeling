review/text: I take these with a multivitamin. After three weeks of following the directions.... I stopped. I would get headaches... I didn't know what it was. I would be away from home and get headaches. When I would be home and have access to my supply I would be just fine, but again if I couldn't have them I would get headaches. I made the correlation when I took ed them and after an hour or so my ridiculous hangover would go away. Then I dropped them like a bad habit.Don't know if they did any good. Waste of money.
