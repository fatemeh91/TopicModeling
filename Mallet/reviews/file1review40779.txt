review/text: Considering the price, this shaver's operation is satisfactory. It gives a reasonably close shave, but not as close as I would prefer. As an everyday utility shaver it functions fairly well. I would not use it if I were to go out to a formal function where I would need to be closely shaven. In thse instances I would use a Gillette razor.
