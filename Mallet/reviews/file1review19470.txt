review/text: We have used this for our son for 2 years now and all we had to do was to tell him to point his "pee pee" down and he does it each time he uses it, now just to go "poo poo" though.It is easy for him to be able to pick up and put onto the toilet himself because of the handle as well. We bought the stool with it when we purchased this.
