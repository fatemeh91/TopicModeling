review/text: I'm not sure what the negative buzz about this product is about - related to these replacement parts not working very well - they work great for me! I ignored the negative reviews and went ahead and ordered this product.After replacing the foil and blades this weekend and shaving, my shave was MUCH MUCH closer and smoother than with my 2 year old blades and foil.Yes - this replacement foil is different from the original foil that comes with the Activator 8595 (or 8500 series, I guess), but it still works great for me.I kept my old foil, just in case- I don't think the foil needs replacing half as much as the blades do.
