review/text: I am using the pull-on and it really helps helps my ankle. I had one before and when I went to get another I couldn't find one any place in town, so I was very glad to find it on the internet!! The ads were a little confusing...some places it said Two and some places it said One. I thought I was getting two for 19.98 so it was more expensive than I expected...esp with shipping
