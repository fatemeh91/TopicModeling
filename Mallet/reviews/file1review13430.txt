review/text: We bought this to try and make our 30 year old cabinets look a little better before putting our home on the market. It worked wonders. Friends coming into our house after using mentioned how good the cabinets looked! I would recommend it. On areas of heavy kitchen grease, we did have to preclean a bit with cleaner specifically for grease, but then this made the cabinet look nice and shiny.
