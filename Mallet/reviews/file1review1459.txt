review/text: This stuff is amazing! I apply it a bit more liberally than they recommend and I always use Sassy disposal bags for the dirty diapers, but this spray is a lifesaver...especially if you are out & about. It can save you much embarrassment. Our baby has a partial intestinal blockage, which makes her diapers smell like something caustic and this spray even masks that!! We keep a small bottle in the diaper bag and a large one at both changing tables.
