review/text: All the other reviewers mentioned many good things about this vitamin. So you can read their reviews. The vitamin has lots of great features! But what is really great is that this vitamin does not contribute to constipation. Everyone's body is different, of course, but for me this was a lifesaver. I have tried nature made vitamins and a couple of generic multivitamins--always with the result of becoming constipated. During pregnancy and also afterward, this became especially crucial.
