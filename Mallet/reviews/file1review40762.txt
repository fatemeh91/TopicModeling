review/text: My daughter and I have started using the new Intuition razors. I am forty years old and she is fourteen. We thought the razor shaves well but have two problems we feel will cause us to discontinue using them. The first is the razor becomes to slippery when it is being used in the shower. The second is we only get six shaves total on one cartridge.The concept is perfact but, the reality of it is flawed in our opinion.Terri Pittman
