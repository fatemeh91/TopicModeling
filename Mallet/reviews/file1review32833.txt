review/text: I love SlimFast and most of their products. If you have the time making the shakes yourself it is much cheaper than buying them already made in the cans. And this flavor, the Milk Chocolate is my absolute favorite. I make it in a blender and add half a banana and it is a delicioius shake. I find these shakes definitely keep me full for 4 hours but I need to be prepared with something healthy to eat when that 4 hours is up for miraculously if I let too much time pass I will crave things that are not good for me.This product does its job very well. It provides all the nutrients, vitamins and protein necessary for a healthy diet. It is not SlimFasts fault whether we loose weight or not. We need to be healthy with our diet the rest of the time as well as exercise. It is a difficult journey to loose weight and SlimFast has some great products to help. Also meant to add that I have one of these shakes for breakfast and lunch daily and that way I am able to go through the day healthy and with energy each day. It is up to me to provide the healthy dinner.Good luck on the weight loss journey.
