review/text: This is perfect for the kayaking, hiking, and mountain biking that I do with friends and family. It is light weight, pliable, and a good addition to the outdoor/adventurer first aid kit. It arrived flat, which I thought was nice for packing in a kit. Packaged size is 9" x 4.25". I hope I never have to use it. ;-)
