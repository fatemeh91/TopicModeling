review/text: So I have been having major pelvic pain (SPD) since around 16 weeks. I really like this. When I wear it really helps relieve the pain. I don't wear to work because it can be bulky under my clothes (it is summer so my shirts and skirts are of thinner material)... but I wear around the house and running errands. I miss it when I take it off.I do wear my belly band underneath it or a long tank because it can rub. And if you sit for long periods of time, it is not the most comfortable.My baby does get skirmmy when I wear it, but I like feeling him move about, so it doesn't bother me, and I seriously don't think it bothers him.
