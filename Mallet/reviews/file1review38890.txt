review/text: The Gillette Daisy Plus razors come ten to a pack. The razors gave a smooth shave without any nicks or cuts. When I dropped it by accident, the razor part didn't fall off of the handle, which has happened to me with other razors. The razor head doesn't pivot. I will buy these razors in the future.
