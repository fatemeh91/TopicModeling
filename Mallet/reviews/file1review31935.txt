review/text: This is an amazing product. I thought the taste was bad at first but it's actually grown on me over the weeks. I mix about a 3/4 liter of room temperature water with a heaping scoopful. The smell is bad but the taste isn't bad (and I have never liked the taste of vegetable juices) and I've noticed it leaves a pleasant aftertaste & it's filling. I do not recommend mixing with protein powder, I tried doing that once with vanilla Jay Robb in a blender and it was disgusting. I feel a lot more energetic and an overall sense of lightness since I started this product. I paid $75 for a big container at my local health food store, have since found it online much cheaper.
