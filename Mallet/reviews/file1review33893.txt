review/text: I'm an EMT and needed a decent stethoscope, I bought a cheap one at a supply store but getting breath sounds were off and on. For the price I was very happy with the results with this ADC I could hear breath sounds very well served its purpose I feel very confident with it. Now it's not a cardiac stethoscope but it'll do for someone like me.
