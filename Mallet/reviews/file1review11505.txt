review/text: Purchased eight 2650 mah Duracells and none of them hold a charge for more than a few days.I use a high-quality recharger and even using the discharge cycle has not improved the functionality of these batteries.I own five year-old Powerex batteries that work far better, even though they have been through hundreds of charge-deplete cycles.These Duracells are appropriate for no device as they simply do not work.Purchasers should be offered refunds by Duracell.
