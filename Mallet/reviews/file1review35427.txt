review/text: I moved into an apartment and the dishwasher was extremely dirty. The apartment has hard water so the entire interior of the dishwasher was a dark beige color. I was looking for a product to use to clean the dishwasher. I saw this product and expected this to not do anything. I was shocked when I checked the dishwasher and it was clean. Absolutely shocked. I am going to continue buying this product to keep my dishwasher clean. I highly recommend this product if you have hard water or haven't cleaned your dishwasher in a long time.
