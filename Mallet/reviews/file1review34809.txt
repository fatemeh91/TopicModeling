review/text: I'm always trying to give environmentally-safe products a chance and sometimes they disappoint me. Not this time - I love this product! It smells wonderful - like true lavender essential oil and not the overpowering, chemically-based lavender scent of some of the newer, more mainstream products. The detergent is environmentally friendly, and it's safe for my septic system. I especially love using this detergent on my sheets so that I have a nice lavender haven to lull me to sleep each night. What more could I ask for? I'm sold on this product.
