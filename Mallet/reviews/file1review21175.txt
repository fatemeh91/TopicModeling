review/text: We've tried all the heating pads available in all the local stores.Each one worked for a day or so and then never got hot again.The Thermophore Heating Pad always gets hot and I love the safetyfeature of button so you cannot fall asleep and get burned.By far, this the best heating pad and ours gets used every day,several times a day.
