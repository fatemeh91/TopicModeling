review/text: I have tried different types/brands of flossers with mixed success. other flossers shred or are difficult to hold/operate.With the twinline, it pushes right through the gaps between my teeth with ease and does not shred. my mouth feels healthier, especially together with the morning crest rinse and evening act fluoride rinse.buy a few bags for the car, bathroom, nightstand or briefcase. wonderful.
