review/text: I'm used to waxing, but can't do it since I moved to the US and don't know where there would be a good place to do so. It has a lot of features, isn't that painful and enables me to remove my hairs whenever I want as I have a busy schedule. The razor part is good too, although I don't use it that much.In summary, it's a good product to use, easy to carry around.
