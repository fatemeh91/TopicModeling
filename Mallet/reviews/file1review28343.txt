review/text: Pros:Delicious (I've only tried extreme milk chocolate)Easy to mixDoesn't cause stomach crampsOver the past couple of years I have tried many types of protein powders from EAS, Muscle Milk, and other ones that I don't even remember the name that were on sale. This by far is the best tasting, less filling, and easiest to mix out of every other protein I've tried. I hate when other proteins give me stomach cramps because it feels like I just ate 5 plate at a super buffet and they don't even have nearly as many grams of protein in them. Other proteins are hard to mix and get chunky and lumpy at the bottom but this powder is so fine that it is as smooth as milk.As I said I've tried many protein brands in the past couple of years and usually I am open to try something new and I get bored with my current protein. I used to not stay with the same protein for more than a few months but I've been on this protein for about 6 months and I don't plan on changing for a long time. I did recently switch to the natural version of this protein because it is only a couple of dollars more. I am going to start using other proteins in my diet like casein and hydrobuilder; I am not going with any other brand than ON!
