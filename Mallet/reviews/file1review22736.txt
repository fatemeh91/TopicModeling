review/text: Its pretty decent product. i took it faithfully ill admit some days i worked harder then other days. but im not sure i had rollercoaster results. some days i tried taking out the blue pills(Diuretic complex) and i wouldnt see any results. you know? so not sure if its just a fancy water pill. because they couple pounds i did lose its stayed off so thats pretty good. but that i thought was kinda weird. the size and quantity isn't bad.
