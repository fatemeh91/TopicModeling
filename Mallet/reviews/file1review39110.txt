review/text: This Wahl clipper set has already paid for itself. I was spending $60 every 5 weeks taking my 3 sons to the barber. What the barber was doing with clippers seemed pretty simple so I asked him what number guards he was using and decided to try it myself. I bought the #12 guard directly from Wahl's website to use on my eldest son because he likes to comb his hair to the side. The 3 boys have very different headshapes, texture and thickness of hair, but I've been able to customize their haircuts with the different sized guards provided. I had to buy another cape since the one included in the kit was basically like a trashbag. Other than that, it's wonderful and I've gained a lot of confidence with each month that passes along. Will probably be doing my husband's hair next and saving enough money so I can treat myself to a fancy salon.
