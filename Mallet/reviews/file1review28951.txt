review/text: this product has so many wrongs, that is so difficult to start to review it.do not take this if you want to keep living....I got so sick and swollen from taking it for 3 days only.I did some research on it and found out that it has ingredients that produce cancer... yess cancer!!!!and I also found out that the immediate effects of muscle growth is nothing more than the extreme excess amount of glutamine that just makes your body retain water.it is poor in taste (looks and tastes like dirty water)to put it in simple terms.......it is junk.don't waste your money here.
