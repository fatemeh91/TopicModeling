review/text: I have two sets of the NH-AA-DA rechargeable batteries that I use with my Sony DSC-W1 digital camera. I love these rechargeable batteries. I don't have to spend lots of money on constantly buying new batteries. I have two pair so I always have a set ready to go. These have lasted me well over two years. I can still charge them but they just don't last as long. I just purchased the NH-AA-2DB and am wondering the difference between the two. All the numbers on the batteries seem the same except this DA and DB. Curious.
