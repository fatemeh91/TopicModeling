review/text: I have been using these blades for years and by far one of the best shaves ever. The only major problem is that they are a bit pricey. While I do use the extra single blade, if that knocked the price down considerably I could do with the 5 on the other side. The single side is great for edging your side burns and those tricky hairs in-between you eye brows (not a full on unibrow).The shave is close, comfortable and smooth. I also wished they held up a little better for a little longer. The shaves after the first few are great, but nothing like the first one with the clean fresh blades.If you have the money and are looking for a better shave, get this product.
