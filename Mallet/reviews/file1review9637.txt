review/text: This stuff really does work wonders. When you tried every lotion on the market & nothing helps, give this stuff a try. You think i'm crazy now... It's has a strong herbal scent & it's not even a cream (as the name suggests) but I have twice seen it clear up chronic cracked, chapped & peeling skin in a matter of days. I recommend it highly. It's not expensive & one bottle lasts a long time. & yes, it is nearly impossible to find in stores.
