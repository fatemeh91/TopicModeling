review/text: I am a long term IBSC sufferer(saying sufferer is NOT an understatement). I get a lot of bloat among other symptoms. I had started developing a new symptom for about 3 months of a gnawing empty stomach feeling even after eating. I broke down and call the gastro dr for an appointment with low expectations. In the mean time I started reading the IBS blogs ... Again. I found a reference to this product and decided to try it. I take 3/4 caps before eating (when I cut back I started feeling poor again). It has made a great difference for me. I would urge anyone with IBSC to try it!!,
