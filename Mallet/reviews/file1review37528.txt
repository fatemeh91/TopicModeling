review/text: Great product and very easy to use. The red grip handle makes it easy to hold and gives you the grip you need to pull the buttons through and to help with the zippers. This would have made my life so much easier and will help me with continuing to be living independently. I need to order more so I have one for work and at home. I highly recomment this product to those that struggle with buttons and getting dressed.
