review/text: My splint came folded flat as apposed to rolled as shown in the picture. It is made of study aluminum that could support a fracture of the ulna or radius (formarm bones) reasonably well. The arm of course would have to be immobalized to avoid the arm from swinging. Although a thin layer of foam covers the aluminum, you can not mold the splint directly over a sensitive limb since the aluminum needs to be study enough to support & stabalize the fracture. Additional padding may or may not be necessary. The splint should be molded prior to actual application, then applied with some minor tweaking and finally secured to the limb. Overall, a good compact splint to carry in your emergency kit.
