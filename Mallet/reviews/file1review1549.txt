review/text: Way better than most other over the counter products. 40% rather than the typical 17% salicylic acid. And in a semi-dry form which can be used later if needed unlike the liquid products that become useless after opening the container a few times. Very effective even on the stubborn issues. "I didn't really want to write a review on this, but we all have problems from time to time, so I hope this helps."
