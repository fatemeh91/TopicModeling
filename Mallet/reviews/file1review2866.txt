review/text: After countless bouts with the dentist (not myself but an important member of my tribe) I have come to fear the effects of sugar in the human body, specially in the mouth. Teeth decay at an alarming rate when proper hygiene is not maintained and for those type of people that like a candy more than toothpaste, well, the results end up being disastrous. Enter GoLightly Sugar-Free Cough Suppressant, Honey Lemon, 30-Count (Pack of 24). Maybe a bit expensive but for what they do and the fact that they are sugar free I wholeheartedly endorse this product. This one person in my flock has an addiction to candy to the point of no return, would even go to bed with a couple of pieces already in the mouth and consequently wake up coughing something fierce. Claimed that she needed cough suppressants to be able to exist. I concluded this statement was not necessarily accurate because I seen her get along, happy as a clam in a choppy sea, with a bag of regular candy and no signs of the famous cough. Anywhoo, since It was up to me I decided to cut drastically her consumption of real sugar. A very good dentist once said to me: "It is better for a person to eat one pound of candy in 1 hour and then brush their teeth than to eat lesser amount throughout the day" He said that acids would attack the mouth 24/7 and this was no good. So Sugar Free it is, for my sugar addicted loved one, and if in the process it also helps her throat (which I am sure they do help for I have tried a couple myself), the merrier. 4 Stars and I think I went a little too long this time?
