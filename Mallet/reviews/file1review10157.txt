review/text: didnt read reviews carefully enough. the taste is fake & brutal. never could stand nasty aftertaste. i'd rather it had no sweetner & i could have used some agave & the taste would've been much better. i actually had 2 pour my smoothie down th sink disposal. it's a gigantic container and very expensive.i was relying on company 2 produce a product tht tasted great and would want to keep me returning. apparently, there r enough people who like this taste. i cant even tolerate it. it stays on your palate. i wish good tasting foods would stay on my palate but they dont. they'r gone in mins. cause they dont hav this crazy aftertaste. $30 bucks down th drain. oh boy, i gotta get more careful abt what i buy. i'v always hated diet drinks & diet foods but didnt realize this would taste so awful but it does.if u'r doing THAT much exercise tht u need 2 instantly replace muscle tissue i suggest some regular food (lean meat, yellow, green & red fruits & veggies & some dark beans & whole grain bread. it will taste way better than this nastypowder. eeh..yuck - if u like it u can hav my share
