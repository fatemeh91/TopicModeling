review/text: No doubt about it, these strips work. I've gotten countless compliments on how white and beautiful my smile is. I haven't used them in about a year, but today I decided to resume my whitening again with a new box of premium whitestrips. After about 4 minutes of wearing the strips, I experienced the WORST PAIN I EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. It felt as it the pain was coming from inside my bottom teeth, and I actually was nauseated from the pain, that's how severe it was. I immediately ripped off the strips and rinsed out my mouth, and now I'm PETRIFIED to attempt using them again. Does anyone know if this is normal? Please email me and let me know why this happened!!
