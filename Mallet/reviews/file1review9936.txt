review/text: I have very thick curly facial hairs and I often try to pick out ingrown hairs. My first concern prior to ordering was that these tweezers would not be strong enough to grasp the hairs because they are so fine. I was immediately impressed on my first try. All the way to the tip I was able to grasp and pull with precision. Not even having to apply huge pressure like I did with normal tweezers. THAT was a SHOCK and a gratifying appreciation for someone with my thick course hair.Do be careful as they are sharp. Also fragile since I recently dropped my pair in the plastic sheath. It deflected the tips a little when I need to get repaired or buy a new one but that's my fault.Update: My sister came buy and saw these (she's a stylist) and took them from my bathroom leaving cash in its place. Now need to reorder.
