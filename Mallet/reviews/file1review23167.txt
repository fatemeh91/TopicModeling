review/text: I just put together my new sweeper. Everything screws together. You screw the 4 pole sections together, screw on the handle, and screw the bottom pole into the sweeper. It all screws together tightly, I don't see how anything would give you trouble as long as you tighten everything well.Other than that, it picks up quite well on both carpet and floors. I seem to track in little pebbles and it picked those right up off the floor, even one big enough to see without bending down. Looks like a great product, I'm glad I bought it.
