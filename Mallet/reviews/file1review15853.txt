review/text: A daily serving of this supplement consists of three caplets, which together contain 110 mg of sodium. For those on a sodium-restricted diet, this is 1/5th of your RDA of sodium. Also, if you have allergies to shellfish, this product contains shellfish.That said, the combination of sodium chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, and MSM really does alleviate pain. After 30 days I noticed remarkable relief in both feet, which are almost bruised at the end of the day from standing and walking on concrete floors. I did not notice any relief in my neck, which suffers from herniated discs resulting from years of coaching wrestling.I will continue to take glucosamine and chondroitin for the pain relief in my feet, but I will search for a product with less sodium if that is possible.
