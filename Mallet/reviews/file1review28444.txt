review/text: Some reviews out there about this product contain some pretty inaccurate information... The study done on its carcinogenicity was a dose depended study on multiple rodents, all of which received dosages which would FAR exceed ANY human intake from using this protein or any artificial sweetener... and no increased rate of tumor incidence was detected even at these astronomical dosages (up to 3% of the rats diet was based on Acesulfame potassium. In addition, while the studies done did prove in rodents increased insulin production (minute levels, again dose dependent), no hypoglycemia was recorded.Are you planning on consuming 2 pounds of this product a day? Is that the reason for your concern? IMO great product...My two sources (or just search on PubMed...)
