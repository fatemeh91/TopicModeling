review/text: The charger comes with four 2500mAh "Digipower" NiMH AA batteries, an AC adapter (120V AC input, 12V 500mA DC output), and a car cigarette lighter cord to provide 12V. The charger has 2 LED's, a red and a green, to indicating charging and ready. There's also a switch to select 2 or 4 batteries.It can also apparently charge AAA batteries. The label on the back of the charger indicates output (charge) current for each combination: 4xAA: 700mA, 2xAA: 1000mA, and 2xAAA: 350mA given 12V input.The manufacture date is 4 months ago.Update: clarification on the rating. It can only charge 2 or 4 batteries at a time. This suggests that it is not capable of providing each battery with the amount of charge required for the battery, but that it groups the batteries and charges until the average charge level of the group reaches a certain level. This may mean that some of the batteries aren't fully charged and other batteries are overcharged, resulting in shorter life. If it could charge any number of batteries individually (like my other AA battery charger), I would have given it 5 stars.
