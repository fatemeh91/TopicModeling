review/text: My husband and I were introduced to Sonne's No 7 from a friend who had digestive problems. The results were fantastic. I do longer have the digestive and gas problems I had in the past. My husband had terrible heart burn and was taking Prilosec like it was candy. He found that bentonite also cured his heartburn and hasn't had to take a Prilosec for about five months now. We couldn't believe it! He started taking a tablespoon every time he had heartburn and it soothed it right away. Eventually, his heartburn is gone completely. Bentonite has no taste or smell really. The white consistency looks a little gross, but we usually mix it each day with some juice and you can't taste it. Grape, apple any juice with the least amount of acid. I like it with a little Odwalla Superfood juice.
