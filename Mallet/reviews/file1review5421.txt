review/text: If I wanted to get inaccurate readings that are consistently 3 to 5 degrees wrong, then I made a good purchase. I thought that I was purchasing a valuable household item, but all I really got was a lot of "Hyper-reaction" from a family believing they were all really sick!Thanks for the memory!
