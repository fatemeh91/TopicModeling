review/text: I bought my Emjoi epilator two years ago, and I hardly use it. I was really thrilled about getting one at the time, but I didn't find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis. Other reviewers have commented on it's poor ergonomics, and they are right. I can never grip it comfortably. I do not have problems with the tweezing being too painful, but I do have to go over the same area multiple times for it to pluck all of the hairs. Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer. This isn't a product that I'd recommend to anyone.
