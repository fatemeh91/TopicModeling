review/text: I owned this Panasonic shaver for one and half year. Since I'm very blessed to not have as much hair in my legs, I've been very seldom using this shaver. Nevertheless, I've always annoyed with its charger because it takes more than 8-hours of charging. Finally, after one and half year, this shaver has to retired. I don't really know what went wrong with it, but then it won't hold any charge anymore. I only took it on a trip once and it hasn't been charging properly ever since.
