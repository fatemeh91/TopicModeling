review/text: I ordered this after getting some abnormal lab results. I immediately went to the pharmacy and bought around 6 different pills that my doctor said I needed, I thought that there had to be an easier way. The multi vitamins would always have something missing. I looked into this liquid vitamin and it has everything in it I need. The color is a little off putting at first but the taste is not bad at all, and within 2 days I could already feel a difference in energy level. Highly recommended if you are looking for an easy way to get all of your vitamins in one place. I am much more compliant with taking a shot of this than I was swallowing multiple pills.
