review/text: This is a very luxuriant cream that makes for a very thick shaving foam. While the price may be off-putting for first-timers, this product is a great choice for people who hate to shave because of discomfort. I can't bring myself to use anything else anymore, and I find that it lasts a very long time. When the price is divided the number of uses, it isn't very expensive.
