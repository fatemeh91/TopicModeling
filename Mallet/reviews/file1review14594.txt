review/text: Being In the hellish situation I Am In I can Not get It together to buy fresh Fruits and Vegetables so I buy this, I was drinking Ensure but Its even more fatting and Ensure has bacteria In It that makes Me smell like a Chicken house or a sewer plant. There Is Nature's Way Alive but It only came In Vanilla which I did Not like the taste of and one can I did Not even open for 2 years or so and like the Apple Cinnamon even less, Nature's Way Alive now comes In Chocolate I have Not tried It yet plus It cost like $10.00 less than Natures Plus. I like all the flavors of Nature's Plus except Chocolate this has more of a Banana taste than Strawberry I like It.
