review/text: My first electric razor, 30 years ago, was a Norelco. It always left my neck red and irritated. So I used a blade all these years. However recently blades have been hard on my face as I've gotten older. So I decided to give this razor a try after reading so many good reviews of it. I have to say I was a bit concerned that in the literature it says your face may have to "Get used to the razor". Meaning a little discomfort at first. Well I remembered the discomfort of my Norelco and thought what could be worse than that. Anyway, I have had no discomfort at all using this razor. I'v been using it since Christmas day 2004. Every day. My face loves it and it's every bit as close as any blade razor I've used. And no facial discomfort of any kind. The cleaning base is great as it keeps the blades and foil nice and clean. It came with a brush and carrying case for when I travel and the cord can plug directly into the razor when on travel so the razor can be charged without the cleaning base.I completely recommend this razor.Update 12/8/05: Still using this razor nearly a year later. Still cutting as close as it did a year ago. I've travelled with it and it's nice the cord can plug directly into the shaver to charge the shaver. Braun recommends changing the cutter head and foil every 18 months so it will be interesting to see how this is shaving in June. Stand by.Update: 3/20/06. Well I finally replaced the cutter head and foil this month. So I got about 15 months out of mine. Not too bad I think. Not the 18 months suggested, but close enough. That will really depend on frequency of use, coarseness of beard, how often cleaning cycles are used, etc....
