review/text: Taste: It is fairly sweet with a majority of caramel flavor and a hint of chocolate. Water tends to have a weird taste to it at first but then you get used to it after a while and enjoy it. Milk makes this flavor taste like a dessert. Its delicious! Use only 8oz per scoop or less of any drink to make it nice and sweetWater- 3/5Milk- 5/5
