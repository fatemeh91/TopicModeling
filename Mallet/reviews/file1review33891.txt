review/text: This product is crystal clear, VERY comparable to my 3M Littmann steth. Actually I find myself using this steth more than my Littmann that costed about 4 times the price of this model. Add a ADC Diagnostics 703 Series Palm Blood Pressure Cuff to your cart with this stethoscope and you won't be disappointed in either product! Try this one out before spending big $$ on the Littmann models unless you KNOW you'll be dealing with alot of cardiac patients.
