review/text: I've been using this toothbrush for several months now and I'm really glad we got them. Before I had the unit, I would have tartar accumulate between my teeth primarily because I drink coffee everyday. So every time I have my dental check up, the cement like buildup has to be removed.Since then, I have seen my dentist twice for regular checkups and I should say that she's trying to figure out how she can charge me more with other dental works or try to look like she's breaking a sweat cleaning my teeth (hahaha). With regular use, your teeth is tartar free guaranteed.One good thing also is that the unit has a 2 minute timer that informs you when you should be done with cleaning. It also has 4 brushing modes CLEAN, SOFT, MASSAGE, POLISH.Great great product!!!
