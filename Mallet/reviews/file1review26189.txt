review/text: While i found this over all a good product, two flaws make me use it much less than i otherwise would. Its rather large, and while sometimes that's a plus, it just makes it unrealistic for frequent use. And, i also noticed a smell, it reminds me of blueberry scented rubber bracelets i wore as a kid, and i have owned this for several years and washed it often and this smell is just as strong as when i got it, its a little unnerving. But all and all, for the price, it does the job, and its nice every once in a while when I'm feeling a little more adventurous.
