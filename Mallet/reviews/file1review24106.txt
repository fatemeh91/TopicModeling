review/text: I purchased this because I have fair, oily, acne-prone skin. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.I use it every day, once a day in the shower. The instructions say to use it twice a day, however.The few blackheads I had, on my nose are gone and my face is nice, smooth and acne free.It does smell like sulfur though. It's not too overpowering, but even after I get out of the shower I can smell it. The smell does go away though. I usually use my body wash after I use the soap, that way I can cancel out the sulfur scent.The smell, notwithstanding, it's a great acne soap and I will repurchase.
