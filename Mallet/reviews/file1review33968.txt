review/text: I have been using Twinlab liquid protein for years and highly recommend it. The plain, non flavored protein is pretty nasty, but the cherry flavored liquid is not that bad, it's is something you can get used to.With the liquid protein, I get the protein I need without having to drink several protein drinks a day - and having that bloated feeling afterward. This is by far the easiest and fastest way for me to get my protein fix - no blender, no mixing, no hassle, just grab a tablespoon out of the drawer and start pouring. Another plus is if I am a little hungry, but I want to wait a couple of hours before eating, I just take a few tablespoons, and it curbs my appetite until I'm ready to eat.As far as prices go, Amazon has been the cheapest place I have found for this product. I uaually buy 6 or more bottles at a time, and most sites charge a lot of money for shipping because of the weight. You can't beat Amazon's price with the free shipping!
