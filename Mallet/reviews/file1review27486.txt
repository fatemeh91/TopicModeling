review/text: I just bought this for before and after my workouts. This was my first protein powder i ever bought. The taste was terrible i mean ok. I tried it with milk btw. With water taste pretty bad. It doesn't taste anything like cookies and creams. It smell like coffee. Overall i'll give the taste a 6/10. Next time i'm going to try the chocolate :]
