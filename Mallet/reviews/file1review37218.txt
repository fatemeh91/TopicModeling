review/text: I bought several types of arthritis gloves, and these are my favorites for use outside the house. They're warm, they stay dry in the rain, they're flexible enough to use for writing, and the fingers and thumb are long enough to cover all your joints. They're comfortably compressive, but it makes it a bit tricky to get them off, you have to tug on the finger ends. The only thing I don't like about them is the bright red lining combined with the black fishnet outer pattern, 'cause it makes them look like bordello wear. I'll definitely buy another pair, there's nothing else as good on the market for stiff hands, and they look good enough to use for most occasions.
