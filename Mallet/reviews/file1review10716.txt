review/text: I have to separate out some of my medicine as it needs to be taken on an empty stomach and other supplements I take can interfere with it. This organizer allows me to separate out my pills and supplements into all the times of the day that I take my pills. I've owned several of the Borinhalbich pill organizers and all of them have been fantastic. The are very sturdy and the lids always latch securely. I take my daily pills along with me in my purse and I never have to worry about my pills accidentally spilling out. These boxes do A LOT of travelling with me, banging around in my purse or overnight bag, and they hold up beautifully. Because the individual cases are nicely sized, I can leave it on my kitchen table or work desk, it is never in the way, and then I will not forget to take my pills when I need to because out of sight = out of mind for me.
