review/text: This trimmer does the job great. I use it to keep my goatee well-groomed and it does the job very well. I wish the lower number settings had finer adjustments between them, but this is a problem I have with any trimmers. Other than that, this trimmer is a great bargain. It does the job just as well as much more pricey trimmers. It is easy to clean and maintain, seems to keep cutting well over time, and gives a nice even trim. I use this to even out my facial hair and then use my razor and grooming scissors to touch up all the finer details, and it's working great.
