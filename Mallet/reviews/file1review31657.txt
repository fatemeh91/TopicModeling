review/text: This is now the second at home product I have tried and it's horrendous. I am on the hunt for a cheap, good way to wax my bikini area and legs and everyone raved about the hard wax. Unfortunately, I didn't read the review of the sugar wax before I bought it. Such a waste of money and I can't even return it. Absolutely NO hair comes off and I pulled several times in the same area even though it advises you not to. Additionally, there were no instructions noted in English -- at all. I had to go on online to try to see how and if I was doing it right. Overall, I'm pretty disappointed and now trying to figure out how I can get rid of this entire kit. Such a waste of money.
