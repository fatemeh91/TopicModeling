review/text: These things were SOOOOO painful! The arches in my feet are high, but not that damn high, good lord! I took the blue middle section out, and they STILL hurt like hell. They're just not for me...at. all. I've gone back to wearing my old pair. I'd hoped these would work as an economical option, seeing as I no longer have health insurance, but no sir! I'll just have to live with my old ones until I'm properly covered again in the future.I'm now trying to decide what to do with these new ones...I guess throwing them away is my only option. Oh well.
