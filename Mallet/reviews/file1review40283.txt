review/text: From novice to intermediate, this is an excellent set of lifting straps. You don't need something like this from the beginning. But the weight you're handling starts to exceed your grip strength, this is invaluable.Use is simple. You just wrap the strap around the bar. There is no real technique to it. As you lift the weight, the weight itself will pull the strap tight and transfer some of the load to the straps around your wrists. I don't recommend wrapping the straps too tight, as that will transfer almost all weight to your wrists and your forearms won't get the usual amount of workout. The point is to complete the lift without your grip failing, not avoiding using your grip altogether. If you do it right, your grip will be supporting most of the weight in the beginning, and as you complete more reps and your grips start to fail, more and more weight can be transfered to the straps.This is a simple, no frills strap. It works and it's priced very reasonably. Padding is a little light, but it's adequate unless you are handling some Herculean weight.
