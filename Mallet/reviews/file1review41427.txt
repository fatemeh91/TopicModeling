review/text: I added pink mini string pearls to reflect rain with glue gun and invisible thread to the middle for the umbrella effect to hang from the ceiling at various lengths everyone loved this idea. If it had a loop hole at the top it would have been easier however, the glue gun did not melt the thread so it worked for me.
