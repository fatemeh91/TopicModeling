review/text: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO USE FOR WORK. I USED IT ON A FEW PATIENTS AND FOUND IT SLIPPERY AND AWKWARD FOR PATIENT USE. I LIKED THE "NO COVER" FEATURE FOR SANITIZING AND LARGE NUMBERS WITH THE LIGHT TO SEE IT AT NIGHT. IT TAKES GETTING USED TO FOR READINGS. IT HAS A ONE BUTTON FEATURE THAT TURNS ON THE LIGHT FOR NIGHTTIME USE AND FOR TEMP READING. THE "BEEP" IS LOW.YOU CAN SEE IT AT WALMART. I DIDNT COMPARE PRICE.I ONLY USED IT ONCE BECAUSE I FOUND OUR FLOOR THERMOMETERS TO BE INACCURATE AND ITS ONLY A BACK UP. ITS OK. TEMP APPEARS ACCURATE. ITS SLIM SO YOU CAN STORE IT ANYWHERE.
