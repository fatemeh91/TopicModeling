review/text: I put off buying a pair of sneakers for these insoles. Bad choice. They really hurt the back of my foot. My heels are cracked and on fire every time I walk with these. A shame because I do feel the burn in my legs as they're working. I just can't take the pain they produce. I think they really don't stay in place at the back of the shoe and they seems to slide forward. My foot is always stepping at the edge of the insole which is the hardest upward part. I need to return them!
