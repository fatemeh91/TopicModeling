review/text: Our occupational therapist had this putty, so I went to find some of our own. It's perfect for the fidgets and it builds hand strength; my son's handwriting has improved visibly. I'd recommend for anyone of any age who wants to strengthen hand muscles, work out fidgets, or just wants to create.
