review/text: I liked this brush a lot when I first ordered it but, after using it for about a month, the bristles were completely flattened like a pancake and the brush was useless for scrubbing - and it is not as if I was cleaning anything super aggressively either, just pre-washing stuff for the dishwasher. I generally like OXO products and it was a comparatively expensive dish brush. I expected it to hold up way, WAY better. I feel kind of ripped off.I know there are a lot of positive reviews - that's why I ordered this particular brush in the first place. Maybe the product is being manufactured differently now or maybe a lot of people are reviewing the brush right when they first get it which is really misleading? In any case, for me, it was a total waste of money.
