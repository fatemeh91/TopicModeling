review/text: I had lost my Mach 3 Turbo, so I decided upgrading to new Gillette Fusion Power with 5 blades. I got thick and hard hairs. These five blades are too close to each other creating a very rough experience like ripping out my hairs and shaving my skin. Tried few times, but kept regretting. Finally, ended by buy Mach 3 Turbo.
