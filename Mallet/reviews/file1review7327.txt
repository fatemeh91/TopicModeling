review/text: Used it for the first time today. Durably made, jets are strong, put cold water in and it heated in about 4 minutes. Remote control is indeed useful. Jets in the front and are variable-direction - would pay for a more expensive one with jets in the rear too. Will keep you posted on durability. Overall, a great first-time experience.
