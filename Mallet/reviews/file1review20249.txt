review/text: Buying diapers again after 27 years, as a grandmother, I was disappointed. I expected a soft cloth. These are not what I was expecting. I recall the large single ply diapers that were excellent for everythin and also the prefilded ones that were as soft as a cloud. These are rather flimsy but I guess for a lap pad they will work.
