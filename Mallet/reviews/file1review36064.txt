review/text: L-Arginine is a great supplement and has multiple uses whether your looking for a pre-workout supplement or something to help with ED since this product is great for opening up the blood vessels. To get the full benefits of Arginine you should take between 4-8 grams daily which can be expensive if you are taking the capsules as they range from 500mg to 1g each pill, meaning you would have to take between 8-16 pills a day depending on the dosage. That's why buying Arginine bulk powder is much better than buying the capsules. The only issue with the powder is it tastes horribly bitter. I can hardly stand the taste of the stuff, and I can usually tolerate the taste of supplements others seem to have problems with. My solution was to buy empty capsules and a do-it-yourself capsule filler and made my own capsules. I can make a couple hundred capsules in less than 20 minutes (including clean-up) and I never have to taste the Arginine again. So I highly recommend this product, but I would definitely buy a capsule filler with it.
