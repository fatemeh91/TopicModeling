review/text: I'm a daily coffee drinker, so I had no expectations from this stuff, my wife gave me a sample pack of the Lemon Cola to try. First taste was BAM, tasted great with no chemical aftertaste, probably because its just herbs. I'm reading the ingredients, and it looks like it contains some Corn Syrup solids, and Sucralose. So maybe thats the only drawback if you're afraid of artificial sweetner. But overall energy level feels really good, cleaner than coffee if that makes sense. A little pricey 10 pack for 18.9
