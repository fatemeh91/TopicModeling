review/text: Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Whey is a great product for those looking to get/maintain lean muscle. It contains only 1 gram of fat and 2 grams of carbohydrates while packing 24 grams of quality whey protein in just 110 calories per serving. However this product is probably not what you are looking for if you are searching for a product to gain a high amount of muscle mass. ON's Gold Standard along with a healthy diet and adequate exercise will help you to lose more fat while developing more lean muscles than diet & exercise alone. The only thing I would suggest is that you chose a flavor other than strawberry as I have found it to be the least appetizing.
