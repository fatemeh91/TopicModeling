review/text: My Grandmother has alot of problems with her hands. I checked on the arthritis foundation website and they suggested a moist heat. I found this heating pad and I read that is has helped out alot of people so I ordered it for her. She says that this saved her life. She uses it every morning and every evening and now can use her hands again. She says its the best gift she has ever gotten. I also recommended this to a friends mother who was having problems and about a month later she sent me a thank you note for suggesting it to her daughter, she says it has made such an improvement with her pain. I guess is really matters what kind of heat you use and this one is perfect! Works like a dream!
