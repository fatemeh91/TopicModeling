review/text: These are the perfect gloves for arthritic hands and knuckles. Had a hard time finding gloves that went up my fingers far enough to make a difference until I found Thermoskin Gloves. Now when my hands and fingers ache and throb, I just slip on my Thermoskin gloves and after a while the aches and pains are much less. I recommend these gloves highly!!!! Thanks Thermoskin Arthitic Gloves.
