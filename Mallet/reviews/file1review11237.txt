review/text: This thermometer SUCKS!! It takes approximately 5 minutes to give a reading and if your baby moves just a bit, the timer starts over so you're waiting 5 more minutes, a total of 10!! And with an infant or newborn you don't have time to waist on this silly thermometer. My baby hates it under his arms, he squirms and cries, in the meantime I'm still waiting to get a reading from it!! I would advise parents to purchase a digital thermometer for the ear or simply choose another name brand, this Vicks model needs to be chunked in the river!!!!
