review/text: I just received this product and have to say I'm disappointed. It smells like bug spray :( Definitely not what I had in mind. I was hoping it smelled like this chamomile/calendula diaper ointment I have that smells awesome. Unfortunately, the patchouli, calamine(like that pink crap you put on chicken pox), and the wood oils are winning this war. My husband told me I should wash it off. He was joking (kinda)we both agree the smell is not good. I normally don't wear deodorant because I don't have offensive body odor. I was just looking for something flowery to wear because natural perfume is really hard to find and outrageously expensive. Essential oil it is...
