review/text: I have to admit that most of the accessories in this package, I'll never use. However, I do use the clipper for my goatee and sideburns almost every other day. It's a sturdy hard driven cutting blade that doesn't pull and is quiet (you do need to keep the blade oiled with the enclosed oil). Occasionally I will have my partner trim the back of my neck, but to be honest, I trust a barber or salon for my hair. However, if you are good at cutting hair, a family would do very well with this. I only use one guide comb for my goatee, moustache and sideburns, but there are nine others. For the price, it is a money saver, especially if you are a mom who cuts your kids hair. Everything you could possibly need is here. Great guarantee too.
