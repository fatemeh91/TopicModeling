review/text: 2 WORDS, THEY WORK!I AM NOT SURE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT THE SIZE AND SMELL.IF YOU KNOW HOW TO TAKE A PILL ( WITH A LARGE GULP OF WATER, JUICE ) AND A QUICK " DOWN THE HATCH" TECHNIQUE, THERE'S NO PROBLEM.IF YOU PROCRASTINATE, TAKE A LITTLE SIP, TAKE A FEW WHIFFS, SURE , THEN YOU HAVE AN UNPLEASANT ODOR AND A POSSIBLE CHOKING HAZARD....BUT PEOPLE, WORK ON YOUR PILL TAKING TECHNIQUE...FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! AND THERE'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL!
