review/text: I have used many ON products over the last five or six years, but I have to say that this is probably the best all around product that they have. I would recommend that you use milk, you will be much happier with the taste that way. I take a hit of this mixed with ON's micronized creatine powder before and after a workout, and that has been doing the job for me. Overall it is a very good product.
