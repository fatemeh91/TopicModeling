review/text: This stand was not worth buying. It does not screw from the middle properly, so the top part of the stand continuously falls without support. Also the screws given were not adequate and the stand was always shaky and wobbly. The hairdryer fit fine in the upper clamp part, however, the stand is very cheaply designed and did not do the job at all. Would NOT recommend.
