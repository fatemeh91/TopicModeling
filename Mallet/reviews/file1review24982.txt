review/text: I was skeptical about this product at first, because I have a normal menstrual cycle and read the other reviews saying that it messed up their cycle. Im very glad I decided to still give it a try. I got pregnant after using this product for 3 months. I ordered FertilAid for women and FertilAid for men for my husband. We had been ttc for 9 months and was on Clomid for the first few months. I decided to stop Clomid and try something more natural and it worked.
