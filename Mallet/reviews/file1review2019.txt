review/text: These regulators do more than just ease bunion pain. I have the left and the right foot ones. If you haven't let them get out of hand yet, get these IMMEDIATELY!!!!! My feet are aligned again, and without surgery - which is what I had been told I would need! I'm wearing shoes that used to hurt, but without complaint now. and I walk straighter because of it. The first two times or so that you wear it, it does make the joint a bit sore, but that's to be expected. After all it is stretching cramped muscle and tissue and realigning bones. But after a while you can pull it a bit tighter as the bunion responds to treatment.. I can wiggle my big toe which wouldn't move much before. All around excellent invention!!
