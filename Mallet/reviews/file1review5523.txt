review/text: Very tasty and strong flavor (cinnamon/tea tree oil, but predominately tastes like cinnamon). Some people will find the taste too strong and feel weird about chewing a stick to freshen their breath. Other's (like me) will like the flavor and think the sticks are cool! Give em a try and see what you think.
