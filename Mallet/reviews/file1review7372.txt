review/text: Spenco comes out on top, after trying numerous insoles, including custom! I find them excellent for everyday wear and a couple weeks hiking in Denali Nat. Park was much easier too. Be sure to take the "issue" insole out of your shoe unless you need it for a spacer. These inserts will make the shoe fit nice and snug. I've about recovered from plantar fasciitis, but when it was its worst, these insoles saved the day. Highly recommended.
