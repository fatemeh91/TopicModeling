review/text: I've used this laundry detergent for years. Even if it weren't a "green" product I would use it. For one thing, I detest the perfume in most laundry detergents. People have been convinced that artificial scent makes the clothes smell clean, but to me they small bad. The lavender scent in this detergent is far less obnoxious.Seventh Generation detergent gets my clothes clean in cold water on the washing machine's delicate cycle unless they are very soiled. It can be used full-strength to treat stains before washing. Recently I washed a quilted white cotton bandage that had been wrapped around my horse's injured leg. Even though the bandage was heavily stained with dirt and had been lying around unwashed for a month, the detergent got it clean with warm water on the regular cycle.
