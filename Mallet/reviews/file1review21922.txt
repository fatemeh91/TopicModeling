review/text: Pinauds Moustache wax is the only product I use for my husbands handlebar moustache. It's easy to work into the hair and allows for shaping before it dries. I have entered him in three moustache and beard contest and he has won two out of three. I just wish it came in a bigger container because I use a lot of it.
