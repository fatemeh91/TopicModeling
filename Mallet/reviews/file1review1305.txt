review/text: Twinlab Twinsorb CoQ10 may well be the most expensive CoQ10 product on the market. The capsules are huge. They are supposed to provide enhanced absorption.I tried a bottle and, after a month, I didn't "feel" any difference. So, I went back to ordering Twinlab's less expensive, 100mg capsules.
