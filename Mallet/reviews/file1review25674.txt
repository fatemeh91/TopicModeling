review/text: Like most of the other reviewers, I'm very happy with mine too. I just wanted to add that it is almost impossible to screw up with this model. The blade is well positioned and protected enough that, excuse my French, you pretty much can just stick it in your ear or nose, twirl a bit, and presto! The only exception to this IMHO is cutting nose hairs so short that my nose feels 'raw' for a bit....so just don't...stick...it...in....so....far. :-)
