review/text: I have a tens unit for Doctor Ho's Company and they charge a small bundle of cash just for four of the jell pads so I did some searching on Amazon and took a gamble and wha la I only payed $14.95 for a whole bag of the 2x2 electrodes ! I order a package of four and you really get 16 ! they work just as well as the doc's and they save me a lot of moo la:) :)
