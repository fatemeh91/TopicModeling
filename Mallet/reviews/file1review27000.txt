review/text: My friends at work told me about Optimum Nutrition Double-Rich Chocolate when I asked them for their recommendation of the best protein powder. They drink it all the time and told me about this Amazon deal. It is a big bag so you will want to try a smaller container first, just to see if you like it. I tried it and liked it so I got the big bag. This stuff is delicious. I used to mix it with skim milk, then a combo of skim milk and water, now just water and ice. It reminds me of the drink YooHoo but it's good for ya.
