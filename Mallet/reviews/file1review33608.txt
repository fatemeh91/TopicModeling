review/text: I purchased one of these in June 2004. First one arrived and didn't work out of the box. Amazon was great and replaced it very quickly. Replacement item is now about three months old and has failed. Only used by one adult in the household. I would not recommend this unit. In all fairness I bought a WaterPik unit almost 15 years ago and it lasted until this year, in spite of the fact that it was used by two teen-agers and an adult!The WP-65 seems to be basically JUNK, I cannot recommend it to anyone.
