review/text: This is my third pregnancy and I'm glad I finally found a prenatal vitamin that is not full of chemicals and its nice to know what they put in their vitamins as well. I'm 8 weeks pregnant and I've been taking these prenatal vitamins for about 6 weeks now. I haven noticed my morning sickness lesson at all, but as long as my baby is getting all the right nutrition I can live with the morning sickness. Just to warn you, you have to take six a day and the pills aren't small either. I'm sure that has to do with all the nutrition they are packing in the pills, but I have to take 2 three times a day and they hit my gag reflex every time. Any pill would do that during my first trimester though, which is why I'm rating this as 5 stars.
