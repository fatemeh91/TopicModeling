review/text: I purchased this product after having tried Crest Whitestrips without much success. Needless to say, I was not expecting miracles! The product is SO EASY to apply. Just open and press onto your teeth. It has a cover on the outside to prevent you from having to taste any of the application. It actually stays in place and you can talk and go on about your day. They only have to stay on for 30 minutes - perfect for the commute to work! And these ACTUALLY WORK!!! Its not the same as a dentist professional whitening - but then again that costs $500! For around $25 I was thrilled and it only takes a week! I will definately purchase again in a few months!
