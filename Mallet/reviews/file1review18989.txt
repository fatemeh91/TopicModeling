review/text: Bought 5 ovualtion tests. Tested on three days- used 3 of the tests. On the second day the control mark was present but nothing regarding the test window. Indicating marks did appear on days 1 & 3. Not sure how accurate these ovulation sticks are. We have been trying to conceive for 19 months- I have used several different brands.
