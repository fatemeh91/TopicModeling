review/text: I suffer from optic neuritis (due to MS), migraines and sinus issues. I have lots of reason to love a product like this. I was using theCervical Collar by Elasto-Gelover my eyes and forehead for headaches and such and was so pleased to find this version of the Elasto-Gel. The products are great ... meaning they are very comfortable and well constructed.I use them for their cooling not for heat. The unit can be heated in a microwave or conventional oven or placed in the freezer. Super versatile and when used for cooling, it is not cold enough to cause ice burn / frostbite and merely is extra cool. Super soothing. The cooling factor lasts for about 20 minutes. I can switch off between both of mine but may consider buying another mask in the future.Great for hot flashes too :)5 Stars!
