review/text: I have always had depression and even lethargy. For years I was just resigned to live with the depression and make the best of it. I had taken anti-depressants in the past and I knew I didn't want to take them indefinitely. I stopped taking them years ago and just "dealt" w/depression the best I could using my own will and determination. I started taking these vitamins two months ago and I no longer have the depression and I have twice the energy! Now I look forward to my work outs! I don't wake up tired or depressed. Its really been remarkable the change I feel with these supplements. I have bought other supplements in the past and they did NOTHING for me, so naturally I wasn't expecting these to really work. Perhaps my depression was a vitamin or mineral deficiency all along as I suspected, doctors always told me it was chemical. These are great quality, I can take them on an empty stomach with no problem. And to think I just bought these vitamins on a whim and now I am a customer for life.
