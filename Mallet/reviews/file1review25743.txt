review/text: I bought this a couple months ago and have been using it regularly.When using this for my nose it always tickles and occasionally hurts. Before I bash it more let me say it works fast and gloriously for the ear. But the tickling/yanking when it comes to the nose makes it unpleasant and slow.Try this: Get a pair of those small grooming scissors and simply be careful with them. If you're careful they'll be quicker and much more pleasant for the nose and nearly as quick for the ear.One more thing: That first review ('glorious') with so many 'helpful' checks seems way planted.
