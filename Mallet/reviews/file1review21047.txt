review/text: These earplugs are pretty good if you're looking for something to block out minor distractions such as a tv show or a conversation going on in the next room. When it comes to blocking out noise from ppl. talking next to you on a bus or in a cafe, however, they don't do such a great job. another problem i had with these earplugs is that they are a bit too big for my ears; i'm petite, so when i insert them into my ear they are too snug and get quite uncomfortable after a while. also they make my ears itch too much. If you're looking for good earplugs, i'd recommend mack's safesound original soft foam earplugs, which block sound much better, fit your ear canal no matter how big/small it is (they are moldable), and don't make your ears so itchy. i've seen them at duane reade, cvs, and walgreens, so they're easy to come by.
