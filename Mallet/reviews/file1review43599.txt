review/text: I have had 3 blood pressure cuffs. This one is the best. It stores measurements including pulse. Wrist cuffs are a waste of money and can give you inaccurate information. Bicep cuffs are the best. Omron has a very good reputation among health professionals.A word of caution, you need to use the cuff properly and to always use it the same way. It is also important to take several measurements (2 a day) when you are measuring trends. And you need to average the results for 4-5 days.If you do this you can manage your blood pressure through a combination of drugs, exercise and diet. A good set of records will allow you to measure your progress. For example, if you want to know the benefit of an exercise program (benefit in reducing BP) you can measure this. The same is true of low sodium diet.This cuff is very good and with the AC adapter you can make many meausrements and depend on the consistency of the measurement if not the accuracy. Consistency is important.Good luck.
