review/text: I wish I would have bought this 6 months ago! I have a 15 month-old who loves leaving Cheerios on the floor, tracking in leaves and mulch, and torn pieces of tissues and paper. This sweeper has gotten ALL of the above off my carpet. It even picked up pieces of pretzels today too. I would only caution folks against buying it for tiled floors. It has picked up MOST of what's on the kitchen floor, but it takes 2 or 3 times the passovers to get it up. On carpet, the only thing that it won't pick up is lint. It seems to think the lint is part of the carpet and just smooshes it around. I'd say that it gets 95% up off the carpet, and about 75% up off the tiled/hardwood floor. If you want spotless carpets, use a vacuum. If you need frequent pick-ups throughout the day, this is the thing for you! It's quiet, small, lightweight, easy to assemble, easy to empty, and safe since there's no cord to attract my baby's attention. I finally feel like I'm able to keep things in order throughout the day!
