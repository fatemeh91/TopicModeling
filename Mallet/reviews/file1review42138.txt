review/text: I use this product at each diaper change-works great to get "stuck on" stuff off of there, if you know what I'm saying.Discovered it when we noticed an irritated patch on baby's bottom. She had been tensing up when I was wiping, but when I sprayed this on she relaxed. So I have been using it as regular diaper maintenance ever since.Additionally, I have used it on myself with heat rashes and cuts and scrapes. It really cools and calms angry skin. The label says this is a "great boo boo spray" and I wholeheartedly agree!I would HIGHLY recommend, my family is a huge fan of this product.
