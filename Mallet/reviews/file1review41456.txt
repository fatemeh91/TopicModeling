review/text: If you are aiming for purple hair, you will need to bleach your hair... unlike what the color scale leads you to believe.I was hoping for a darkish purple on my Chestnut hair color; which Herbatints color scale said it could cover, but there is a lightener in the activater which made the resulting hair color come out a reddish black cherry (at least for my hair type); looks pretty, but not what I had intended. If you buy this product, make sure to bleach out any existing hair color to achieve purple.
