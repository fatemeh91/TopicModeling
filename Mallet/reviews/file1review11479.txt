review/text: I've had one these trimmers (a T860) for more years than I can remember, well 3 or 4. I finally had to replace it after it had lost too much power loss which I think is due more to the battery than the motor. I've had other Norelcos and had the same problem. I tried a new Norelco T980 trimmer to replace it. Well it has neat features but it wouldn't stay locked on the setting so I ended up having to trim at the lowest setting. Not cool. After 3 weeks of that I returned it & got a Panasonic All In One trimmer. I set it to one of it's 14 settings, applied normal pressure to the comb and same problem. LUCKILY I found a replacement for my old reliable and getting another one. I might buy 2! Word to the wise, if it ain't broke don't fix it!!!!!
