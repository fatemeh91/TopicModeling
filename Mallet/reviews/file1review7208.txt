review/text: Have been looking for a real nice foot massager and did a lot of research in trying to find one. Came across this unit and It had a lot of good reviews and also some bad ones that made me a little gun shy on buying this machine. I took a chance and ordered it and I am so glad I bought one. The two jets on this thing are so nice on my aching feet after a long shift at work. The main reason I purchased the unit was because of the water heater. It really does WORK! If your looking for the best then order this unit. It is a little more expensive but trust me, It is worth every penny.
