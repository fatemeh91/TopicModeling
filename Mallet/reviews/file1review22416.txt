review/text: My surgeon recommended this product when he noticed that I'd developed a keloid scar after knee surgery. After just a month of use, the scar has completely flattened, and some of the disoloration has gone. My husband and I are both amazed at how well this product has worked. Regarding their stickiness, they have fallen off when sleeping or exercising. Otherwise, they stay on just fine for me throughout the day.
