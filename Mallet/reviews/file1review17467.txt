review/text: I have owned several trimmers. This might be my last one. The unit still holds a charge for a very long time. The blades are staying really sharp. No cases of hairs being pulled out instead of cut. The depth gauge is pretty basic, but it has worked perfectly.It is easy to take the depth gauge off and use it like a clipper.This is a good unit and a good price. After two years of use I can definitely recommend this item.
