review/text: I purchased the Merkur 180 Safety Razor and without giving it much thought I also ordered the Merkur DE Razor Blades. I've shaved with these blades 5 times and they have been by far the WORST shaving experience I've ever had in my life. I have a very coarse beard and sensitive skin and these blades have given me the most painful and unsightly razor burn ever. My shaving regimen consists of applying pre-shave oil and shaving cream via a silvertip badger brush yet the Merkur blades consistently pulled uncomfortably on my beard. After 2-3 shaving passes I still found myself with patches of beard all over my face. Due to all the patches I started resorting to shaving while holding the safety razor at odd angles which wrecked further havoc on my face. And last but not least after shaving I would experience an uncomfortable burning sensation that would last almost all day. I was this close to quitting shaving with a safety razor until I started looking through wet shaving forums and just about every post I ran into on blades was filled with users complaining about uncomfortable shaves and razor burn coming from the Merkur blades. I was skeptical that switching blades could make that much of a difference but after shaving with the Astra Superior Platinum Blade this morning I can tell you from first hand experience that blades make a ton of difference. With the Astra SP I had no pulling and after only 1 pass I was 90% done. If you have a coarse beard and/or sensitive skin I highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from the Merkur DE blades!
