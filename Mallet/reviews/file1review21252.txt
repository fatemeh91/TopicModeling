review/text: We owned an older model Braun power brush but it wasn't sonic. This is smaller and ligher--takes up way less counter space. The cleaning is wonderful and makes your mouth feel fresh and wonderful. It does however, make quite a 'singing' noise while using. My son actually LOVES how it sounds and wants his own...I think for some kids it would be a great way for them to brush-- you can open/close your mouth to change the pitch! Great price as well, it has come down in recent years. A pleasure to use.
