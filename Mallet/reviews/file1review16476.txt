review/text: I wanted a hair dryer stand that would hold my hair dryer up level with my head and leave both my hands free for styling. Unfortunately, this stand was not the right choice. If you want to sit down while you are drying your hair and you have a hair dryer that weighs next to nothing, you may be able to work with this.I use a Conair dryer that is not that heavy, but the flexible neck on this stand is weak and won't hold the dryer up. The stand itself has to sit on a chair or table if you want the hair dryer level with your head. The pole keeps coming out of the base anytime you move it. I'm sure there is something better out there. Just keep looking.
