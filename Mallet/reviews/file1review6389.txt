review/text: This thing works on trigger points I didn't even know I had! My right buttocks was bothering me and thought it might be sciatica. I started first in the buttock area then pressing near my hip and it felt really tender and my lower back popped! Don't know what happened all I know my buttock pain is relieved. This device comes with a nice info pamphlet. It is the perfect tool for self treatment. I have bought other devices similar to this in the past but this is the best!
