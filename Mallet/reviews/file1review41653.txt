review/text: We just replaced our old power toothbrush. My husband and I both think the 9400 is fabulous. Our teeth feel so much cleaner. Hard to believe they are still able to improve on this type of product. The holder also protects four of the brush heads and has a nice appearance. The brush heads with the flossing nubs on them are great! The automatic timer is excellant and even gives you a smiley face when you've reached 2 minutes duration. We don't think you should consider any other product.
