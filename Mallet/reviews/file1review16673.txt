review/text: I don't smoke (true!) at all, but buying this was really handy since friends do, and also its pretty cool to practice the many tricks out there for these little guys.I have two other 'fancier' Zippos, but this is my everyday, go to, lighter since it has the 'roughed' up look already, and is simple enough to warrant engraving to make it look even better.The price is also amazing. Got this guy for $7 even, and didn't look back.
