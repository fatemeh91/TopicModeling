review/text: This was a purchase for my Son. We had been putting the Dr Scholls brush on wart remover on for over a year with NO results. This has worked so well that we're both shocked buy the success! I put it on the warts and then cover them with a band aid when he goes to bed. He takes the band aid off if the morning. So they are untreated all day and this process has worked very well. If I was doing it on me I'd reapply in the morning and put another band aid on. They'd be gone even faster!
