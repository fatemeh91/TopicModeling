review/text: If you love coffee this is the perfect whey protein. When you mix it with milk it tastes like an iced latte. But if you're looking for chocolate flavor this is not for you. I can barely taste any chocolate at all. If you're going for a true cafe mocha flavor I'd suggest adding a little cocoa powder and a packet of stevia.
