review/text: The double rich chocolates flavor tastes and mixes much better then GNC's chocolate flavored protein. It also contains a mix of whey proteins (Isolate, Whey Concentrate, and Peptides) which is good. The only bad things I noticed is that is does not have all the vitamins and minerals that GNC's whey protein has and that it contains artificial sweeteners.
