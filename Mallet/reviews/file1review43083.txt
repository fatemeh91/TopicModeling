review/text: After reading the reviews saying it runs on the small side, I bought a size large. I am (gasp) 223 lbs now at 25 weeks pregnant with twins. It fits OK, I would even say a bit loose. I am still using the middle set of hooks at the bottom - there is definitely room to grow for me, so it should work for me all the way through the end.I wear the cradle every time I know I will be on my feet a lot (when I go for a walk to exercise, for example). It does help a lot as it alleviates the strain on the round ligaments.The top straps do show from under every V-neck and even under some crew necks but I am OK with it if it means there is no pain for me.Great item overall!
