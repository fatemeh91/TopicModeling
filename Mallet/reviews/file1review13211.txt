review/text: I ordered this sheet protector to protect the bed my 4-yr old grandson uses when he visits. As soon as I took the package out of the Amazon box, I noticed a large label affixed to the BACK of the package that says "Warning: Not suitable for use by children under the age of 12." There is no explanation of why this cannot be used for children, so I have NO idea why it is unsafe - perhaps it's not fire retardant, or a suffocation risk?I am glad the warning is on the package, but to avoid inconvenience, I feel that Amazon should have placed this warning in the description on it's website, so customers will know the product is intended for adults (incontinence, etc.)Amazon sent me a free return postage label and promised to refund my money when the product arrives there, so they did the right thing. I just want to advise others that this product is not for children.Thank you.
