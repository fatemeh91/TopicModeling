review/text: Wow. Did I say wow? WOW. I am a 48-year old hard core bachelor. Which means I do not always make my bed and usually only brush my teeth once a day, in a hurried fashion.Out of curiousity I recently purchased a $5 agitating toothbrush at the local supermarket....A noticeable improvement from a regular brush.So, I sprung for this version as the price was 50% off retail (and, I noticed the price just went down again...).I can hardly wait to brush my teeth (3x a day). In just two days I can tell my gums are in much better shape and my teeth look like just after a $350 dentist cleaning. Hence the title to my review. I feel empowered that I do not have to subsidize those art deco dental offices with their over-charging for basic services. This should keep me out of the dentist office for a long time. :) Hip, hip, hooray!
