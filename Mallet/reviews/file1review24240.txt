review/text: My personal experience has been that these inexpensive shoe inserts saved me hundreds of dollars, possible surgery, and a great deal of pain.The foot pain came on very suddenly. Intense pain in the arch in front of the heal. Much worse in the morning when rising from bed. I did not visit a doctor, instead I researched on-line. My diagnosis, plantar fasciitis.I tried soft shoe inserts from the drug store. No help. I visited a local store called Good Feet and found that their thin plastic shoe inserts cost $300 and up. I would have bought them on the spot if I could have been absolutely certain they would stop the pain. Then I saw the infomercials on TV. Basically the same product Good Feed sold, but for $30. Why not try a pair? They worked for me, the stabbing pain went away. At first the inserts were not comfortable, but the intense pain was gone, the discomfort was bearable. After several weeks, the discomfort went away too.My conclusion: if you have researched the problem and plantar fasciitis seems the likely cause of your pain, spend $30 and try a pair. If your problem is not Plantar fasciitis, they probably won't help you and you will have wasted the money.There have been several bad reviews on this product causing me to reach another conclusions: Buy them thru Amazon (not off the TV ad). You can trust Amazon to help you if you pay for the product and it does not arrive or it is damaged. (Amazon can't help you if your self diagnosis is wrong and the product doesn't relieve your pain. In that case see your doctor.)My order was placed on Wednesday, the product arrived the following Tuesday. This was my second pair. Switching them from shoe to shoe was getting tiresome so I opted for two sets.
