review/text: I purchased the Omrob HEM-711AC to replace a defective unit of another brand. I did a consistency check of this unit by giving myself multiple tests which all compared favorably (that was how I discovered the problem with the previous monitor). Although this unit is a little larger than the previous monitor, it's not so much so to be a problem and I do like the larger display which makes it easier for me to read.
