review/text: I'm always on the go, and I have tried many types of bars. If you like the ones that have a lot of sugar (it isn't always obvious--you have to read the labels carefully), you may not like this one. This is not a very sweet bar nor does it taste like a candy bar. But if you are looking for a really healthy bar with less sugar that will fill you up, this bar is perfect. The taste is very fresh and natural.
