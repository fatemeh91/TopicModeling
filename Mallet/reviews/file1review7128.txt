review/text: The Wahl shaver is a good product and performs well. The multi-head option is what made me purchase this over some of the similarly rated shavers. This Wahl holds its charge and I can go a full week without recharging, while using it daily for about 5 minutes. As was stated by previous customers, this thing is LOUD! It sounds like a mini chainsaw, but the comfort level of the shave is not comparable to the loud sound.Ultimately, I would recommend this shaver; it is versatile and does a good job of shaving your hair to various lengths depending on which shaving head you use.
