review/text: Great stuff! we use this with our children who need to increase hand strength, their OT recommended it and they enjoy it so much. Its like silly putty but in different thicknesses. We like to hide marbles or beads inside the putty and have the kids find them. A great way to have fun, increase fine motor skills, and strengthen little fingers all at the same time :)
