review/text: I bought Yogurt-Honey-Peanut bars from DAB. What I received was not fresh, even though the expiration date was almost 8 months ahead. Compared to the taste of the fresh ones you can buy in your local stores, the taste of this one was really bad and it was really painful eating it. The appearance of the bar also suggested having some problems, before even tasting it.I don't think the food is preserved in conditions that would guarantee freshness, and I don't think I am going to buy from the same seller again.Note: 2 Star is just for quick delivery, nothing else.
