review/text: We're still working on nighttime training for our toddler, and this mattress cover has been so helpful! Now when there's an accident, we can just peel off the sheets and do a quick wipe up, then put down new sheets and get our little one back to bed before he's really fully awake. Plus, we're not ruining the mattress any more. Wonderful!
