review/text: I've been a blade man since my very first shave over 25 years ago. I tried an electric shaver once and hated the results, so I stuck with blades despite their rising costs.I saw a couple deals come and go on the Braun 8585 at a "hot deals" site I frequent, and I finally bit on the third one. Wow! Very impressive.The razor burned my skin after the first use, but I used it straight out of the box, instead of running it through a cleaning cycle first. Since the first shave it has been very comfortable.There are those who say it shaves as close as a blade and those who say it doesn't. I suppose that depends on many factors.I have a tough beard, but I also don't mind spending the extra time with the Braun to get my face smooth. For me it shaves as close as a blade.I can only reiterate some excellent tips that have already been given:1. To save cleaning fluid, always remove the cleaning cartridge from the unit and recap it tightly. Also the cleaning fluid is most denatured alcohol, so if you wanted to buy a bottle of that to refill the cartridge it would probably work fine.2. Pop the head of the razor off and shake it over your garbage can before you stick it into the cleaner. This will "trick" the cleaner into Eco mode 99% of the time. Saves fluid and noise.3. The noise is only for a couple of seconds two or three times per 30 minute cleaning cycle, and only in the beginning. Most of the cleaning cycle seems to be drying time, so the unit is quiet.4. A long time electric razor user warned me to be careful with these ultra-thin foil razors. The foil head can crack sooner than you'd expect and you end up cutting your face, so inspect your foil head regularly.5. Enjoy the Braun 8585, or 8595!!!
