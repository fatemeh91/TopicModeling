review/text: High quality protein with the right mixture of BCAAs, includes enzymes to make for easier absorption. Mixes very easily with just a shaker (hate having to use a mixer). Best tasting whey protein I've tried (out of ten or so), especially the double-rich chocolate flavor. Highly recommended.
