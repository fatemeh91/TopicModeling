review/text: I bought this thing to blast the plaque from under my gums, and it works perfectly. Yes, I had to have root planing, which is unpleasant.......and I don't want to have to do that again.........so I bought this tool. I had used a water pik years ago, and it must have died, and I foolishly did not replace it. My dentist says my problem gap areas are free of plaque, and should stay that way........I do not want to lose any teeth......but the best reason to use the water pik, is that it makes your teeth feel wonderful. I fill the little tank up all the way, and blast the bacteria away for about three minutes..............not sure I need to do it that long, but I am determined to get my gum line spotless. I use this every single evening before sleep, and haven't missed a day.
