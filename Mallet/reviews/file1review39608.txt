review/text: My wife and I just bought another mega-pack of shaving gel at our local warehouse store. This time it's Gillette Satin Care for sensitive skin and I've been using it for the past week. It's an excellent product. It gives a nice smooth shave and I haven't had any problems at all. We have a can that gives a 20% bonus, but otherwise it's the same as listed here. We both use the same product for our shaving needs.All shaving gels are so much alike that it means little difference to us what the brand is or what secret ingredients it has to solve one's particular needs. It also makes little difference as to whether it's billed for a man or a woman. We buy the mega-packs and go through them over the period of about a year, with me using the great bulk. As such, our costs are rock bottom. Perhaps you do the same thing in that this is also a mega-pack. It's an excellent product, just as good as any other we've used.Gary Peterson
