review/text: I've been using o.b. Tampons for seven years and wouldn't change a thing. o.b. Tampons are very discreet during that embarrassing week, because they have no applicator. The entire tampon can fit in your pocket and be discarded down the toilet when you're through with it. The price is comparable to other brands and the quality is just as high. o.b. tampons are great for those who hate doing the walk to the bathroom with the purse thing. For those of you who feel funny using a tampon without an applicator, try the new o.b. Tampons with applicator to get the same superior quality from o.b. I'd suggest these tampons to anyone -- they're the only brand I use.
