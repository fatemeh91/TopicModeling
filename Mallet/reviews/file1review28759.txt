review/text: This product came highly recommended for value and quality. Recommendations did not disappoint. It has all the good stuff which other people have gone into detail about and best of all it does not taste terrible! That is a big thing for me other products similar I have tried didn't taste very good but this wasn't bad. If you have ever drank nutritional shakes before you know that none of them taste great but this one wasn't too bad just had a bit of a chalky aftertaste.
