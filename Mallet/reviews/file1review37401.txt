review/text: Let yourself swear - because it's going to hurt. I used every 4-letter word I know and even made up a few new ones while using this sadistic little gadget. The good news is, hair doesn't grow back for at least 2 weeks. I didn't find epilation on the legs to be particularly painful except for my ankles. Using this product on the bikini area or underarms is so painful that I don't recommend trying it. Also, make sure you exfoliate often to prevent ingrown hairs - they can get very irritated. With all these complaints, it may seem strange that I give this product a 4-star rating. It does do what's promised, and I can't really ask for anything more.
