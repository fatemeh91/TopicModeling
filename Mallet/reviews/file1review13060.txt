review/text: I had 2 surgeries on my spine. I used something similar to ease the pain in my neck when recovering. My brother was having the same symtoms of neck and back problems that I had before my surgery. I wanted to help, but I could not give up my product. So, I started to look around on the web for what I used. I came across the cervical collar by Elasto-Gel and the same product I was using. I sent both to him. The cervical collar by Elasto-Gel came before the other product. He was in sooo much pain he could not move. He said that this product was a lifesaver. He said that he doesn't know what he did with out it. He travels a lot so he can bring it along. He said that with out this product, he would be in the hospital right now. That is the same way I felt with my product. He uses it alllll the time and takes it with him where ever he goes.I talked to my neurosurgeon, who I see on a monthly basis. I told him he should suggest to his patients to get these because I really think they are a godsend for people with neck problems.
