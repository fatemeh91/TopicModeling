review/text: I loved the 1st generation scrubber with the stationary head. It was the perfect size, the bristles get into every nook and cranny, and it's much more effective than the cheaper brands. The only negative? When the bristles wore down due to constant use, I had to get a whole new scrubber. Not very sustainable, I thought. Then I discovered the scrubber with the replacement heads. Thought I'd found the perfect scrubber. Until the head started falling off. It doesn't actually screw on, it's more like an itty bitty twist, and it doesn't lock in. Therefore, anytime I scrub in a circular motion (about 95% of the time) the head slips off. Come on, OXO, your products are great. Surely you've had this happen to your design engineers, right? My sisters mentioned they'd had the same problem and I see other reviewers have too. A slight design tweak would make this the perfect scrubber!
