review/text: There was a minor mix up with shipping that the VERY friendly and expedient staff took care of. The item was bought for my wife as she had surgery and was suffering intense back pain. She LOVES this mat and raves about it everyday. It helped her back muscles relax with just enough heat and vibration. I highly recommend it and etronics, the seller.
