review/text: My husband sweats a bunch and has sensitive skin to boot. It's been difficult to find a detergent that cleans clothes and sheets thoroughly enough and doesn't cause a breakout of eczema. The all free clear alone manages this after trying nearly every brand of unscented detergent that we could find.Since this is a powder and we have an older stackable washer/dryer we have to make sure that the detergent goes in early by itself to make sure that it dissolves. The fact that it's a powder also means that loads that I would normally wash in cold water must be washed in warm water (this is why I don't give the product 5 stars).
