review/text: We love this tub. It lets my daughter play in the tub without me having to hang on to her. Before we got this, she was likely to slip and seemed to feel unsecure in the big tub. Now she plays and seems comfortable. I like that it saves water also. It took some air to blow up but we leave it blown up and hang it on the wall of the tub when we are not using it. Definitely worth the money, it solved all our problems.
