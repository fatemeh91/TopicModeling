review/text: I have had laser treatment on my legs and my hairs haven't fallen off yet. I'm very frustrated so I decided to get this tweezer in hopes of plucking out the un-fallen hairs. So far so good, but I just need to be able to learn hold it and properly use it. The tips are very sharp. It can go through your skin and pull out the hair. I tried it on an ingrown hair but I'm not sure what was wrong. Either my hair was too deep to pluck or the tweezer isn't sharp enough to get it.At any rate, I recommend this Tweezer. You can use it to untangle things too ;P
