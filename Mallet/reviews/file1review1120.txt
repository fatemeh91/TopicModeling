review/text: This is a delightful toy and very powerful. The downside is that it is very loud, looks like a child's toy, and it is a lint/hair magnet. However I would still recommend this product. It is a great product for misdirection or concealment if you at all concerned about getting flack for having a vibrator because the average Joe isn't gonna realize what it is unless you tell them. Great for travel since I personally think that it would be less embarrassing for some airport attendant to pull this out of your bag at checkout/check in then a different style vibrator.
