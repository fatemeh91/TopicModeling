review/text: The first time I got the chance to use Silk Epil was about 4 years ago in Europe. I had to order it form Italy and it cost me about 100 Euros, which lets face it, is a lot of money. I have been looking for this product for the longest time, since the one I have in Europe doesnt work in here. I finally found it here at Amazon and I am VERY happy. It is a little bit painful the first one or two times, but as you use it more and more the hair gets thinner and less painful. I think every girl should own one because it is really a life saver. The redness goes away in a matter of hours. And the best time to use this product is night because when you wake up in the morning and look at your legs they look GREAT...
