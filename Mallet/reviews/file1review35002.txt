review/text: Before you buy this product be aware that it is non returnable even if it was only removed from the boxto see this it was too small . Poor customer service since it tooks days to reach somebody byemail or phone. Told absolutely" no" to all their products for returns. The item was xxlarge andwouldn't fit a child. Once I filed a complaint, then I received an email that there was possibly a wayto return the item if I was willing to jump through the following hoops. To be honest, the poor customerservice was worse than buying a useless item that was money thrown away.
