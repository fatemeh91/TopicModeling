review/text: I have ordered this product for years and this is the first time the product was rotten. I don't know if the natural lavender botanicals were spoiled, but the shower gel smelled only of chemicals - and a disgusting combination of those. I couldn't use the product and threw away large quantities of it. I will never order it again.
