review/text: I've found that in the absence or even instead of pain meds, one thing counteracts a migraine: brain freeze. I have been known to rinse my hair in icy water, down smoothies or frozen coffee, hold home made ice packs to my head--you name it. This a more convenient alternative for when I'm at home. I just wear this mask over my forehead.I love the soft, almost silky material surrounding the cold gel--much more soothing than the hard edged plastic on my last gel mask. I disagree that this mask does not get cold enough or stay cold long enough. Sometimes the shock of how cold it is at first hurts to the point that I have to take breaks and place it over my hair. And you should be using it after it's been in the freezer two hours minimum. Now the human body is a hundred degrees; so yes, the thing's gonna cool off. Just flip it over. I've found that the print side is the cooler side, so I place that side next to my skin first. And as everyone else has figured out, I'm going to purchase a second one. Actually, just a single use has killed my migraines each time so far, but I'd like to keep the compress on it to ensure the headache stays dead, lol.In case you're wondering, the mask size is adjustable, and the gel remains soft in the freezer. I think I'll be purchasing the neck compress, as well.Five stars!
