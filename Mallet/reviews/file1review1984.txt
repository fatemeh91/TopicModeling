review/text: i was tired of always buying bibs expensive or not when ever they got dirty it would be something else i would have to wash. finally i tried the pampers bibsters, i cant even begin to say how much i love them, after every meal i just throw it away, quick and easy. no more washing by hand. i recomend these bibsters to everyone.
