review/text: Anyone that can package dirt in a tablet and convince people to buy it for $40 is a genius.His products are over-hyped marketing at it's best.This product didn't do anything for me and it doesn't say on the label how many live cultures there are in this product.He also ads ingredients to it that actually do harm like Magnesium Stearate.None of his products have ever done anything for me & I won't waste my time with his junk ever again.When I first took his junk I was sick and vulnerable but now that my head is clear I can see how he spins hismarketing campaign with fancy words that sound great but don't mean a darn thing. "homeostatic"? ha-haThat's a good one. Am I really supposed to believe this guy that bought some online degrees is telling me the truth?The "credentials" he has are from schools with no campuses.He is a business man that wants to make money and he does do that.Everything about this product is BS.Now go take your "dirt pill", I'm sorry, "homeostatic soil organism pill", give me a break!Once I blindly followed some nutritional advice, I drank Kombucha tea, it gave me Crohns.I'll never do it again and you will be much better off to stick with proven science instead of high pressure, high powered marketing.Try Mercola or one of the other probiotics that state how many live cultures are in it and don't try and confuse you with made up words.
