review/text: I can't say enough good things about it. I love that it adjusts to fit your toilet seat - round or oval. Many of the other seats only fit round toilets so this one is great. And you can easily take it with you wherever you go. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I bought another one to keep at Granny's house too!
