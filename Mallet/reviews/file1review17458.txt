review/text: A dry cell trimmer I once had for travel was a joke, so I needed convincing. After much research, I chose the Remington for a two week trip in Japan. It may well replace my hardwired, motor-driven home clipper. My current persona is hair and beard at about 1/8 inch (Remington setting #3), and the stability and solidness of the adjustment are superb. I trim about every four days, but I have touched-up after two days and was amazed at how much infinitesimally short hair it gets: Really reliable adjustment. I run it, plugged in, for about ten minutes at a time, and the only oddity is fluctuation of speed toward the end: Probably the charging cycle, but it doesn't seem to affect performance. It is easy to clean, and lubrication-free is a real plus. This was a very sound purchase.
