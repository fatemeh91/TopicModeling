review/text: After my Gucci sunglasses lost the part that holds the screw I could not find a tool kit that coantain the part and I didn't want to throw my glasses away. I am so glad I found this kit in Amazon. Not only did it have the part I need it, it also has a small screw that attaches to your keychain so you can have with you at all times just in case your sunglasses get loose.
