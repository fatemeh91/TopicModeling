review/text: I've had this trimmer for about a month, and using it once a week to keep the beard trimmed. No complaints so far. It was charged right out of the box and I haven't had to charge it yet. The banana-shape took a bit of getting used to (as opposed to previous trimmers I owned that had a more "candy bar" shape) but I find that it allows for a more solid grip on the trimmer and doesn't affect its use. I really like the dial to adjust the trim length (I thought this was going to be gimmicky, but it's actually quite practical). The length guard comes off quite easily, for using the trimmer "without a net". Having been using various trimmers for the past 15 years and this one ranks as one of the best.
