review/text: I have been wanting this for years. I am a licensed massage therapist, so who massages the therapist? She works on herself! This is really nice. I've been working with it since Christmas day and I really like it. It is very light weight but not flimsy at all, it's very strong and sturdy. It's big enough to maneuver around the body for the hard-to-reach-all-by-yourself-places, but not at all cumbersome. I can also instruct my husband where and how to use it on me. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
