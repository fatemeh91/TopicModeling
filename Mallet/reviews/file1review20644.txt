review/text: I am not sure what type of werewolf hairy faces that some of these reviewers have but I have used this replacement block and foil for a week now and have no complaints at all! No, it is not the same replacement parts that I have recieved previously from Amazon for my Braun razor but these work much better than the ones I am replacing. Not to mention the alternative of buying a new Braun razor!! I dont have a very hairy face, but I don't see where there would be a problem for those with more facial hair than I. Buy this with confidence... and the satisfaction that you just saved an awful lot of money not having to replace your very expensive Braun!
