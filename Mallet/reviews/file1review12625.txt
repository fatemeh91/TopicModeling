review/text: This product was okay, I don't know that I would recommend it. For a while it worked and kind of got me regular, I didn't even finish a bottle so I don't know how accurate I can review it. I managed to get myself regular just by watching my diet and so I have no need for a colon cleanse product. However of all the colon cleansers out there if you want to use one this would be the one I would actually recommend you try. But I would make sure you try it over a long weekend because you will spend a lot of time in the restroom at first.
