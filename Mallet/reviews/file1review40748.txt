review/text: We purchased this for grandparents but the sound of the alarm is so muted and so short, they can't use it! The alarm is very short, 3 beeps once every minute for only 3 minutes, and so muted, imagine a cellphone on lowest sound setting, that it's impossible to hear even in the same room with TV or radio on. Please read the reviews carefully, (we didn't), this problem was already mentioned before.
