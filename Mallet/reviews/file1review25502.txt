review/text: The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer does a great job at cutting close -- but it feels like it's pulling the hair as much as it's cutting! By the time I am finished, my eyes are truly teared up. I had another trimmer that just got old. It didn't cut quite as close, but there was no pulling sensation at all. I will be trying another brand, as the discomfort level just isn't worth it.
