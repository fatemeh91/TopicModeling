review/text: The Scunci Steamer is a scaled down, cheaper, and less powerful version of the Shark Steamer cleaner, a model that has its own problems with reliability and customer support. The Scunci Steamer tosses out 1,000 watts of steam, considerably less than the 1,600 generated by the Shark. Both models are flimsy, but the Scunci is especially prone to mishap. I was fortunate enough not to waste my money on it. I had a friend who was not quite that lucky. I observed him use it several times before it ceased working. While it did work, the emerging steam was pitifully weak. Only the must superficial of grime and gunk was removed. Further, the steam leaked out, forcing my friend to wear gloves. The Scunci is not a serious cleaner and neither is the Shark. A vapor cleaner, on the other hand, is more powerful since vapor molecules are smaller and can more easily penetrate entrenched dirt. I have not found any reliable vapor cleaners for less than $500. When I do, I'll add an addendum to this review.
