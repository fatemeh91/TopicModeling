review/text: I used this product a couple years back when losing 60lbs. I used to make a serving of this in a water bottle at night before going to bed and then stick it in the fridge. When I got up in the morning, I'd drink it as my pre-workout fuel. I found that mixing it and letting it sit overnight in the fridge made it thick. I know there's a lot of complaints that it's thin, and that's true if you mix it and drink it right away. The trick is to have it mixed and refrigerated for at least a couple hours. Doing it this way made it extremely filling and provided lots of energy (and made it more tasty to boot!).Good use as a supplement, I recommend it (though, I wouldn't use it more than once a day but that's just my own personal preference).
