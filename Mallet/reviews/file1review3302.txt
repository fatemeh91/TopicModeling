review/text: Note that the colored coating isn't merely some plasticized dip: it's baked-on enamel.I had been using a pair of jewelers' tweezers for splinter removal (I'm a cactus gardener) and they just never really worked. They couldn't grip with enough strength and accuracy right at the tip.These do. Nails it. Great tweezers indeed.
