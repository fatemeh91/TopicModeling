review/text: I've recently stopped by the store that sells these shakes because I've heard good and bad things about the shakes. I know that they actually do help you lose weight but they are MEAL REPLACERS MEANING THAT THEY WANT YOU TO STOP EATING NORMAL FOOD AND HAVE A SHAKE INSTEAD. People say you get energy and feel so great and lose a lot but at the same time they taste terrible.The flavors are disgusting and since all it is is powder and aloe I could feel the powder in my mouth and throat for a while and also ended up feeling sick. The woman who lost so much weight for these said the only meal she has is dinner.They work but have a terrible taste.
