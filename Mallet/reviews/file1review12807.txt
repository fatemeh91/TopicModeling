review/text: I bought many face masks for my migraines over the years, this is by far the best. It stays cold for about 20 minutes and cool for a while (just as they say). It is comfortable and pretty thick. I'm very glad I bought this.In case you have doubts this CAN go in the freezer and it does stay flexible and comfortable.
