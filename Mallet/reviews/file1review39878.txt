review/text: Nite White works extremely well for sensitive teeth. After leaving the product on overnight, my teeth were noticeably whiter and I experienced no sensitivity problems. The "Do it Yourself" trays did present a challenge to get properly fitted. The first tray turned into the test tray and the other two became the finished products. If you closely examined the trays you could tell they were not molded by a dental office, but they did the job. My son using the product for the first time was impressed with the whitening results. He now has a bright white smile.
