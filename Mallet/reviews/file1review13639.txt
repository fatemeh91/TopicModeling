review/text: I have been using Oral-B's Hummingbird daily for a few years now, and it has greatly helped with the all-necessary but dreaded flossing (using any other kind of floss just seems ridiculous after using the Hummngbird). Regular use means that I haven't had to visit my dentist for anything more serious than my semiannual check-up and cleaning for the past years, so I know it works greatly. Also, it's very small and easy to carry around, so I never leave for vacation without one. I used to have a waterpick flosser, but obviously couldn't carry it around with me; so nowadays, I only use the Hummingbird.The only problem I've had with it is that I seem to go through one flosser per year or two, as they are somewhat fragile: one just stopped working (due to calcium concentrations on the mechanism that were the result of the rubber water-tightening coating leaking), and one had the head snap off as I was removing a flosser. Still, for that price replacing them is not really an issue, so I highly recommend this to anyone caring about their dental hygiene!
