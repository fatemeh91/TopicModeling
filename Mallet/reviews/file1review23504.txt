review/text: I used it to treat a post infection IBS along with mint capsules and I feel great now. I however do not require as much fiber as mentioned in the label. Maybe cause I get a lot of the fber I need from the fruits, veggies and whole wheat breads I usually eat. A lower sporadic dose works best for me. Yet it is great that it is tasteless, I do recommend it.
