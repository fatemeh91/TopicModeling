review/text: The most common flavors of protein: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, all seem to be designed for consumption with milk. This is fine if you need the calories, but if you're trying to dump bodyfat and gain lean mass, drinking a lot of milk is counterproductive. Unfortunately, these common flavors taste nasty in water. I tried the tangy orange flavor of 4Ever Fit Whey Protein to see if it worked better in water, and it absolutely does. It actually tastes pretty good, and I've seen good results on a heavy lifting program. I'd recommend this product to anyone who is tired of trying to choke down the more common flavors of whey mixed with water.
