review/text: If you want a strong tool this is NOT for you. The folding joint broke within 3 or 4 weeks under normal household use. The rubber cups easily pull off metal studs. There is no place to get repairs. While the Gopher is really cheap, I now need to buy another one because it only lasted a month! I found the original version of this product called the ArcMate EZ Reacher and it's guaranteed forever! The price is twice the Gopher but the durability and guarantee make it a better bargain. The Gopher product seems to be a cheap knock-off of the more durable ArcMate reachers.
