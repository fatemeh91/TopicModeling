review/text: Since having my eyes mangled by an incompetent Lasik surgeon, I have tried every eye cover and sleep mask on the market. This is hands-down the best. I get severe eye strain due to double vision and visual impairment caused by the Lasik - 15 minutes with Mindfold is very rejuvenating. Some reviewers say that they have a hard time sleeping with this, but in my opinion it is also the best nighttime mask on the market, and I've tried them all. I keep four of them - one by the bedside, one at my office, one in my home office, and one in my travel kit. And I've given one to each of the eye care professionals who are helping me cope with the damage inflicted by Lasik.
