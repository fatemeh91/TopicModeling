review/text: I've used the Bona hardwood cleaner successfully so I decided to try this product on our Pergo kitchen floor. It works as well as anything else I've tried, acceptably but doesn't make the floor sparkle. I think this is a Pergo characteristic and not a problem with the Bona.In the bathrooms Bona makes the tile floors sparkle. I even tried it on the toilet tank and Bona makes the porcelain as reflective as glass. I'll certainly buy this product again once the bottle is empty.
