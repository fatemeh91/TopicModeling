review/text: I initially bought it to add some wow factor to an no2 supplement i was taking, but when i used them both i was overwhelmed and jittery. I thought maybe the arginine made the no2 supplement work better, but not at all. The arginine was doing most of the work and giving me a mega pump. The no2 supplement was that cost a bout 4 times as much....Tsk tsk tsk.
