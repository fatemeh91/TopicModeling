review/text: My husband received a recommendation from his podiatrist to try the Spenco inserts. He purchased a pair of the full size inserts and they were great in his golf shoes. When he checked Amazon, he liked the idea of a 3/4 insert because that gave him more room in the toe box as well as the support for his feet. Now he has a pair for dress shoes and casual shoes as well as those very important golf shoes. This product is excellent for diabetics who really need to take special care of their feet.
