review/text: I have owned this tooth brush for over six months and love it.I had a sonic care tooth brush before and this one is much better. It is strong but does not cause your gums to bleed (especially after a few weeks of use).I have had no problem with the battery. I only charge one the led read tells me to, about every two weeks. The unit takes hours to charge but seems as strong today as when it is new.The brush head are expensive and do need replace after three to six months but it does a great job and therefore worth the cost.In my opinion it's the only electric tooth brush to get.
