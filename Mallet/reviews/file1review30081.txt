review/text: The best thing I've noticed about this formula is the slight citrus flavor the pills have now. Most of the supplements like this have a terrible taste/odor, and letting it hit your tongue or remain in your mouth for too long can bring you close to gagging. This version of hydroxycut has a slight citrus flavor which reminds me a lot of a vitamin.I rotate going on and off this supplement for additional energy and have not been disappointed. I have recently switched to the hardcore version for an extra boost.
