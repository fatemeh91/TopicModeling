review/text: The toothpaste itself was great, with a light minty flavor that wasn't overly strong. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I wasn't impressed with the Neat Squeeze aspect of the packaging. My 15-year-old managed to get the nozzle plugged up with dried, crusty toothpaste after only three days of use. I liked the idea of this type of packaging allowing you to keep the tube in a standing position, as it keeps the sinktop from getting overly cluttered.
