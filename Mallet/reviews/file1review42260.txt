review/text: This is like liquid gold. Really. I don't usually write reviews. But being a mom of an 8 month old, you never get a chance to stop. This is a lifesaver. Please try it! Plus boosting the immune system is key with young children around. It gives me energy but not like those chemical filled caffeine drinks that make you jittery. It gives you even energy through the day. The taste isn't too bad. Stock up for the winter.
