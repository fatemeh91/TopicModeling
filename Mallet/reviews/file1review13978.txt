review/text: Shipped from China - didn't mention that in the "detailed seller info". No instructions or any other material in the package. Thank you to you who have bought these as I will use your instructions. I will post with an update once they've been through the molding process. So far the only possitive is the packaging was the most adequate size I've ever seen...abut 5 x 5 inches!*Why is it I've lived for almost 50 years and still have to be reminded that "you get what you pay for"* (rhetorical question)
