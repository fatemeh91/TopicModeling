review/text: I work nights, sleep days. The problem is, I cannot sleep if there's too much light. Blackout curtains help somewhat, but have never been completely satisfactory. This mask, however, completely solves the problem for me.The fit is good, with (in my case) no light leaking in. If your face is shaped differently than mine, your mileage may vary.For me, the adjustable velcro strap is comfortable. I never really notice it, which I suppose is the best thing you can say about any such strap.I'll be buying at least one more as a spare.
