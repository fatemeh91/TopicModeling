review/text: The handle broke about ten minutes after opening it. I read the instructions and used the hammer for the assembly. The handle snapped in two. It was made out of cheap metal. The sweeper head worked well from what I saw with limited use. It was light weight and looked nice. After the handle broke Amazon took it back and I purchased another kind of sweeper. Too bad this one wasn't very durable!
