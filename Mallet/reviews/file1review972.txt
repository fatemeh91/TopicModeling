review/text: I take to improve insulin sensitivity for my type 2 diabetics and dispose of excess glucose, allowing me to maintain healthier blood sugar levels. My A1C and daily readings "seem" better and my personal data collection supports same. Scientific evidence is still in question by many but I find it helpful for me.
