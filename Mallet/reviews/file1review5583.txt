review/text: I use this product for several years and I am very satisfied with it.In the last year the manufacturer has launched a similar product which is disposable and needs no refill, but it is more expensive...As the new product catches in, the traditional golden handle with the proxabrush refills is not available in pharmacies any more, therefore I liked the opportunity to purchase it through Amazon at the old pharmacies price.
