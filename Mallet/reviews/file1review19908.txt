review/text: Like this needs another great review. But really, the seat is awesome and it has been the only seat we have been able to find that fit out toilet and didn't scare my son from moving around. Important when you have a child learning to potty train. He has been potty trained for about 6 months now and he still uses it to go #2. We have never had problems with pee issues....I remember reading something about how the seat didnt work well for boys because urine would leak from the front of the seat... back when I was reading reviews before buying this seat. We have always had him point his weenis downward, so maybe this is why we never had leak issues. Gotta teach them the lay of the land. money worth spent!
