review/text: I have had at least 4 other jump ropes - one beaded fell apart, the others were too light and difficult to adjust. I didn't want a speed rope so if that is what you are looking for - this won't be it. It is not heavy either. It's just perfect - it doesn't get tangled at all, I didn't have to adjust it (i got the 9 ft, i'm 5'6"), but if it hits - yowch!It's perfect, just perfect.
