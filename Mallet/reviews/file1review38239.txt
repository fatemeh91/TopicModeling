review/text: I bought this because Dr Oz said to and now I take it every day. Mix with your favorite juice, use a whisk type electric blender in a tall glass, mixes perfect and easy to drink, I put two heaping teaspoons in a tall glass with cranberry juice, mix about half a glass first and be sure to get it all mixed up good, especially the bottom, then add the rest of the juice, no clumping, easy and smooth to drink. The cranberry cleans the urinary track and the Psyllium cleans the intestines and colon, lowers your cholesterol, keeps you regular and on a daily high fiber diet! 12 lbs is about a 8 months supply for two people, drinking daily. Every friend I get to try it does it every day like I do. Once you lived on a high fiber diet you don't want to go back to how you use to!Dr :D
