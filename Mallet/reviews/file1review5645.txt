review/text: I have this product, it works great. I would recommend this product for anyone who has sore and tired feet or leg muscles. I put this cream on my feet and my knees and I feel great the next day. Without this cream, I can't even stand on my feet in the morning. I wish that Avon would get this product back and start selling it again. I need some more, mine is all gone.
