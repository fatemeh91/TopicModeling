review/text: I've never tried to wax my legs by myself before and it was a pleasant surprise when I used this product. All hair came out in just one pull and yes, it did hurt but not as bad as some other brand ready to use wax strips. I like the smell very much and the clean up is easy when done with a wet cloth. The hair took more than 4 weeks to grow back. I'll never use a razor again.
