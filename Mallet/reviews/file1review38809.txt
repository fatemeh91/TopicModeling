review/text: Before buying this shake mix powder, I had only ever purchased the liquid shakes in the can. This proved to be a costly habit, but I really liked the convenience of having the cans ready to go. In order to save money, I decided to try the powder. It really isn't much more of an inconvenience to make a quick shake on the go by just adding milk. Plus, this allows me to add the kind of milk I want. There's room for a lot of experimentation there.After going through my first can of powder, I realized I liked this so much that I decided to subscribed to this product. This is now what I have for breakfast most mornings and I feel good about it.
