review/text: I had high hopes for this after reading a number of good reviews on here. The other reviewers must have low expectations. Seriously. This does not stop odor. It is just a really strong smelling body spray. Even after discovering that it didn't work I might have used it as a body spray except for the fact that it smells like a 90 year old lady's perfume. Very strong floral/baby powderish smell. It gave me a headache. I suggest avalon organics grapefruit and geranium spray if you are looking for something effective (you may have to reapply it once or twice if it is warm weather or if you are a heavy sweater but at least it does work). That is what I will be going back to. I tried this because I just wanted to try something different and there were glowing reviews. Big old waste of money :(
