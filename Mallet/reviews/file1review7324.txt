review/text: This is an excellent foot bath. I called two Brookstone stores in the Houston area, and neither had this product, which bears their name; however, both had a lower-priced Conair brand in stock. It seems strange that this would be so. The local stores had no knowledge of their own brand, which I decided to purchase through Amazon. I received quick delivery and am pleased with the design and function of this soothing heat bath. I could have given it five stars, but it is too soon to declare it that perfect. A couple of months from now, I may very well give it the fifth star. I doubt that there is a better one to be found.
