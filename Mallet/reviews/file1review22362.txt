review/text: Great concept, love how they're terry cloth, and you couldn't ask for more color choices... but, after washing them, they don't fit! The corners of my changing pad (and yes, it is the once that's made to go with these covers) are all smashed from forcing it into these covers. Mine are also covered with little lint balls after repeated washings, and obviously a changing pad cover necessitates repeated washings!
