review/text: I bought this in hopes of getting nicely DIY shaped eyebrows and avoiding the hassle of spending $20 every 3 weeks to get my eyebrows painfully waxed. I followed the instructions and had an oil/dirt free face when I tested this product. Everything was going great until I pulled the strips off. They didn't work. The strip pulled my hair but did not remove it. I don't think that they were sticky enough or I didn't press down on them hard enough to stick completely. On the bright side, this was cheap when I purchased it.
