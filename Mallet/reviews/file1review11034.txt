review/text: This product made little or no difference in the odor produced by passed gas and solid wastes. I tried various dosages from two pills a day to four pills a day, no difference. It did turn my stool an ugly green, which was somewhat disconcerting. Note: I do have a liver condition which may be affecting how well this product normally works.Edit: I am increasing my rating from two to three stars. A few days after discontinuing this product I noticed a definite worsening of the odors. So perhaps it was doing some good after all. I will give it another try.2nd Edit: I made a startling discovery. After taking this product for a while (with only partial improvement), I was put on a 10 day oral course of antibiotics for treatment of diverticulitis. While on the antibiotics, the bad stool smell disappeared! I had discontinued the Chlorofresh several days before starting the antibiotics. After completing the antibiotics treatment, I took probiotics in order to repopulate the colon with 'good' bacteria. A normal amount of stool odor has returned, but nothing like it was before the antibiotics. I no longer use the Chlorofresh.
