review/text: Item arrived in a very timely manner. (today, 12/20/12) Unfortunately I use one strip per day and the pack of 100 expire the end of February, 2013. New glucose meters do not allow usage of strips after their expiration date. Will end up discarding about 40 strips, almost 1/2 of the order.
