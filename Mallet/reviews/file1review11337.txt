review/text: When I first got the kit, I thought it was very small and couldn't possibly have all that would be needed for a weekend adventure trail. It is amazing ... compact and well stocked. If you get this great item, don't let the size bother you. Once you check it out, you'll be amazed too. PLUS they are about $20 cheaper than the famous LL place ... check it out! GREAT item, fast shipping! A+++ vendor!
