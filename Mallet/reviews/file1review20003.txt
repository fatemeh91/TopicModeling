review/text: I used this tub for both of my girls and loved it. My sister even bought one and loves it. I do use a bear bath foam pillow for the comfort of the baby and this might help with the problems stated in other reviews. I just put it over my kitchen sink and leave the plug out and use the kitchen spray nozzel to wash the baby. It is nice because you can use clean water. The fact that I can store it neatly in the cabinet is just a bonus.
