review/text: Maybe my facial hair is thick/plentiful but i find this shaver really struggles to get the job done. With some effort it can be done however. After a couple months of usage I wanted to throw it away because it started to pull on my hair instead of cutting it, and this was even on areas where hair wasn't thick. I'll chalk it up to a bad egg because everyone else here seems to love this shaver. Certainly not me, it's the worst I ever had.
