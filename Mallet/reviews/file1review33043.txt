review/text: I trust the quality of a purchase that comes direct from Amazon. I have bought the "Source Naturals Wellness Formula" before through localhealth food stores. I had a compromised immune system this winter due to a long standing bacterial infection. My granddaughter (16 yrs old) caught a very miserable virus covering the full spectrum of symptoms. She coughed and sneezed and blew her nose for over a week and felt very sick during this time. I used the Wellness Formula at maxamine dose. I did eventually catch it, but to such a lesser degree, it hardly bothered me at all. I did not even feel sick. I am taking the maintenance dose now...I have become a believer in this product and buying through Amazon with the purchase of the 240 capsules, it cost about half as much as from the local health stores. So you get half the bottle free you might say. Plus you do not run out every week with a smaller bottle. This was a great purchase. I definately will buy again if Amazon carries...I Recommend!
