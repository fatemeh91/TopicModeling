review/text: I developed serious heel pain in one foot and tried different insert products that were too soft to offer any support. Went to the podiatrist...plantar fasciatis...and he gave me the green superfoot (?) insert. I have a high high arch and those did nothing. I had seen these in the store, but they looked really uncomfortable, but I finally caved in and bought them. When I first put them on,,OWWWW,, no way could I walk around in them..but I did. After a few days I loved them, it has been almost a year and I won't go anywhere without them. My podiatrist was unfamiliar with them and didn't like that I preferred them over his product. He thought these might cause other foot problems in the long run, but all they have done for me is relieve my arch and heel pain.Yes, they will hurt and seem uncomfortable at first, sort of like some new shoes may hurt your feet until you get used to them. Still, the relief they will provide is worth the wear in period. Actually, it is kind of a good pain, like a deep massage on the bottom of your foot. Hurts so good. But that will go away and it will just be a great support for your feet.
