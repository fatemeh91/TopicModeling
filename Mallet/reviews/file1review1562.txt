review/text: I have had numerous amounts of flat warts on both of my hands for many years and I have used both medicated band-aids and the salycic liquid with neither of them working. I decided to try the wart stick just for the heck of it and, within a week, I noticed a HUGE difference. I have always been embarrassed by my hands and I can finally wave my hands without covering them up with my sleeves! I am extremely happy with this product. Your warts will peel, but that just means that it's working! I can't believe how incredible this stuff works. I would recommend it to anyone!!
