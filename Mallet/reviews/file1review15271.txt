review/text: I'm a college student and I found this bar to be extremely convenient. The day after I received them I woke up ten minutes before class began. I jumped out of bed, grabbed a bar, and raced towards class. The bar was incredible -- it had a sweet peanut flavor that wasn't too sweet. It had a pleasant aftertaste, unlike other bars. The bar was light but satisfying. Usually I end up eating too much and falling asleep in class. Whether it was the nutrition or the ginseng, this product was great for energy. I'd use it again and again.
