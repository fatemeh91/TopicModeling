review/text: I purchased this item when it was available from Amazon prime not from the retailer currently listed. The packaging appears slightly different than what is pictured but the test itself looks the same and matches the Amazon description.I found that the dropper style was easy to use and that the results were clearer to read than the Wondfo strip style tests that I compared them to. I did not test it against an FRER but the results window reminded me of one. I cannot comment as to how early these will give a positive result as I am using them to trace my HCG back down to &lt;25 following a miscarriage and they seem to be doing a good job of that.I gave the product 5 stars because for the price it does a pretty good job and is easy to use.
