review/text: I tried swithing to this product as an experiment but it backfired. I have used enough probioics products to know that it should calm my IBS symptoms and I should have less cramping and gas.HOWEVER, this product has almost zero effect on me. I dont think it is very good quality. They refused to refund my money also. I am very disappointed and going back to my old brand since it works.
