review/text: I had tried a couple of products and normally do not bother to write reviews. After taking this product as described, I had to come and write a review for this one. I works wonders. Let me put it this way: It works the way it says it will. I did feel the difference and would higly recommend this to anyone who wants to reclaim their health and vitality. I followed this with the Cayce apple diet a couple of weeks later(http://www.areclinic.org/articles.asp?articleid=62) and the results were amazing in my case. I am (was) healthy and do exercise atleast 3to4 days a week, 5' 10" and 165lb before doing this. After this and the apple diet, my weight dropped to 153lb. For a person who was not even thinking/planning on losing weight, that is awesome results and a super bonus :-). As I said I was healthy before I undertook this and after this, I feel a lot lighter and cleaner and even more healthier.....
