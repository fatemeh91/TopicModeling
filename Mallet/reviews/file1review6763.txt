review/text: i have a lot of back pain and this definitely helps reach those problem spots that i never could before. its great. theres not a spot that i couldnt reach. my only complaint is that the round knot should have gone on the end of the large curve instead of the smaller curve end. its a lot more comfortable than the pointier knob.
