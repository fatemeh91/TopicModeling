review/text: I picked this up from Whole Foods 2 weeks ago after trying many green formulas and it is by far the best. For the people complaining about taste what do they expect from a product like this? You and not drinking it for taste but for what it does and my energy is way up and it tastes fine. Also for a container 1/2 the size offered here I paid $36.99 and it was on sale, it is reg $46.99! So Amazon has a great price as well.
