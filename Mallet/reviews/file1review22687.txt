review/text: This is a wonderful product! I bought it wondering if it could really reduce stress and it REALLY DOES! It works immediately too. When I add it in my dog and cats water dish they love the flavor and become relaxed and mellow immediately. It is great during a thunderstorm at relaxing them. My husband and I use it to immediately calm down if we feel stressed or overwhelmed. Just spraying it in the air or applying it to your face works too if you don't like the slight taste similar to alcohol. I don't plan to ever run out of this stuff.
