review/text: Close shave and the handle has a nice grip to it. It has a little weight to it which keeps your hand steady and slow. Especially good for younger shaver since it's harder to slip and knick yourself with so many blades. Just be gentle while shaving and don't apply to much pressure, it very easily can cause razor burn.
