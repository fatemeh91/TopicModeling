review/text: I've been taking them daily, dual dose (4 pills, instead of 2), for the past 2 months...Truth is, I don't know if they're working or not.They do seem to make the genitals more sensitive, almost like they have a bit of viagra mixed in them; though the effect only becomes somewhat noticeable after taking the pills for 2 weeks or something (unlike viagra which usually works within a few minutes to an hour).Wife is still not pregnant; though there could be a million and one reasons as to why.Often you only read about the positive comments, and nothing about the environment. If the only thing these pills do, is make a man more sensitive, and make him want more sex, it's only natural that the chances increase for conception.So, no results for me yet!
