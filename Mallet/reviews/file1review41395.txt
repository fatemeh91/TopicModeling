review/text: I love the product. I ordered them because my daughter loves them and i was unable to find them in the store. My only issue was that i ordered 2 paks of size 2 and received 1 pak size 2 and 1pak of size 1. I didnt really have the time it took to straighten things out so i just let it go. If i had more time I would have dealt with it but i dont have but a few mintues to myself each day and Im not gonna spend them on the computer dealing with looking up numbers and scanning receipts just to they can do some research. What shoudl have happened was that they snet me a postage to return item and they made it right. as it turns out shortly after i made the order i found them in the store so i gave the size 1 to a friend and just bought another pak at the store. Yeah i lost money but it doesnt mean i wont order from here again.
