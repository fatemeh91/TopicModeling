review/text: The bag has a complete instruction inside. We did all suggested by the instruction, and we had impressive results: temperature was below 10C even after 24hours (even we opened the bag to check the temperature inside, there is a thermometer going with the bag).So I recommend this thing to everybody who needs to transport an insulin or another medication at 2C - 8C temperature regime.I've looked for many bags to select the best that will fit our needs. This one is the thing I looked for.The bag is a very good quality!The one sad thing that the CoolMarker had been already activated when we received the bag (I suppose because of low temperature during transportation).I'm VERY satisfied!
