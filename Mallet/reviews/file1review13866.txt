review/text: I bought these last year because the idea of a warm slipper really appealed to me. I am very happy with them. I don't use them to walk around. Rather, I warm them up in the microwave, and wear them to bed with socks (regular sport socks). They keep my feet nice and toasty for about an hour, after which time I am happily asleep. They are *not* for walking, but they do help with icy toes at night. I would highly recommend them to anyone who is cursed with cold toes. Also, the slipper material is nice and soft, and I found the aroma (strongly clove) to be quite pleasing and conducive to relaxation.
