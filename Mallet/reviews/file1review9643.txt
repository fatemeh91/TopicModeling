review/text: I have been unable to find the liquid Zim's crack creme anywhere in my area on a regular basis in years - this product is the best for all kinds of dry skin on hands, feet, elbows or even problem patches on legs or arms. My husband works with floor chemicals and his hands have had deep cracks that turn black and cannot heal without this product. My skin in the winter becomes dry and cracks so painfully on my finger-tips and knuckles and this product heals them. I heard about it on AM radio years ago and swear by it. I am now ordering several at a time because stores around here just don't have it. Great product!
