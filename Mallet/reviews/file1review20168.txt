review/text: I decided to try this as less expensive alternative to Knudsen Just Black Cherry Juice.I will be trying a different Black Cherry Juice concentrate, because this concentrate does have a bit of a cough syrup flavor. I can stand it, but I do not look forward to drinking it like the Knudsen juices, both regular and concentrate.
