review/text: This protein has the absolute best nutritional values on the market, plus great flavor and it mixes better than anything else I've used. It's by far my favorite protein powder. Unfortunately, it costs an arm and a leg, so I only buy it when it's on sale or I can find a great deal on it. Up until about a year ago, it was half the price it is today, but Optimum jacked it up when they introduced their "starter" line of protein powder to make this stuff seem more premium. The lower costing stuff still tastes good, but it includes a lot of extra fat and carbs. Highly recommended if you can find it for a good price.
