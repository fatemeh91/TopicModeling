review/text: At first I wasn't sure if the color of the metal was going to match my white vanity table, but it does, and with the white seat cover, it all blends together very well. VERY easy to put together! I had it done in 15-20 minutes - just needed a screwdriver. LOVE the little drawer; I keep the extras that didn't fit in my vanity there.
