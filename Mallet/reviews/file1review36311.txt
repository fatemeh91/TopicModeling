review/text: I have been missing the "#2 Purple Guide Comb" from my Wahl clipper set for well over a year now. I decided that I would break down and look on Wahl's web site. Wahl wanted $5.99 for a replacement!I thought I would look on Amazon as a lark. Well, to my surprise, Amazon not only had it, but it was priced much less that Wahl's web store.My hair will look better (without the gap between the #1 and #2 combs).
