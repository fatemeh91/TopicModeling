review/text: Despite the fashion issues, the comfort this provides is well-worth defying the trends. I have come to rely on the support and relief this provides on a daily basis through the end of my pregnancy. It is an all-elastic support, so a light tank underneath is definitely the way to go to not irritate the skin (think: bra strap material criss-crossing your body). The other brands of support bands with padding tend to get very hot and don't support as well.Seems to run a bit large in sizing. I tried the larger size first - according to sizing chart - and returned and quickly bought the medium instead. Was pleasantly surprised with how quickly my return was processed.
