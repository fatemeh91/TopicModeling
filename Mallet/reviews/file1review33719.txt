review/text: I liked this chapstick. I liked the smooth feel going on and it stayed on pretty much all day. however..this is NOT A TINT. I was a little surprised to see how much color it actully had. it is more of a lipstick the a tinted chapstick. all in all I would recommed it as long as you understand your getting something heaver then tint
