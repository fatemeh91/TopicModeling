review/text: I bought this at my local Vitamin Shoppe. Saved a little money and 15mg of cholesterol, but wasn't sure the whole thing wasn't going to end up in the trash. I mix with milk to gain the extra protein from fat-free milk. This stuff has an aftertaste that is pretty awful. I still have it because I mixed with just enough fat-free, sugar-free chocolate syrup to cut that aftertaste and make it somewhat palatable. I am also averse to wasting $30 if I can help it, and thank goodness for FF, SF syrups! Just be warned that, if you only mix with water, the aftertaste may be more than you can bear.
