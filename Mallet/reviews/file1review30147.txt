review/text: I'm in total agreement with PJ Lutrell's opinion. These are the best. Don't know how long my husband and I have been using them. Used to find them at the drugstore and then they disappeared. I contacted the distributor and was able to order from them. Eventually they sold their distributorship to another company and I ordered from them. Eventually I couldn't find them at all. SO I contacted the manufacturer in (I think) Austria, where I was able to order a very large amount (year's supply) Obviously not cheap but worth it. I've ordered them from England and just about every where else I could find them. Luckily I am now able to get these through Amazon. Saving a lot on phone bills.Bottom line.... these ARE the best. If good hold is important to you, you owe it to yourself to at least try one box. I think you'll be sold.xoxMEF
