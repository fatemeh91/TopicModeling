review/text: I have been using this product for a while and although IMHO it is very good, it wasn't the magic bullet I had hoped for with and IBS cat. I still use this product with every feeding (and I just ordered more) along with pro and pre biotics. After pulling my hair out with this little guy for so long, with vomiting, and loose stools and not wanting to eat, I found a combination of things that are working. We're still on the journey, but he is eating, not vomiting and diarrhea seems to be gone. I've started a blog about this journey if anyone is interested.
