review/text: Very easy to use with excellent accuracy. Bought this to replace an older Omron unit that appeared to give unrelieable readings (much lower than actual). This new unit far surpasses the old unit in accuracy, comfort, and ease-of-use. Good investment and the usual great service from Amazon.
