review/text: its a nice product. leaves you feeling clean and fresh , but the price is a bit outrages for the amount you get. (over a dollar an oz). i might pay 7 or 8 bucks for 13 ounces but 15 ? no thanks. 30 dollars every month or so for soap doesn't fit my budget. i gave it 4 stars for the product alone , but it certainly isn't a good deal.
