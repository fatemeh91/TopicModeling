review/text: Carrying my second child, I had a lot of severe pain in my pelvis. My doctor recommended that I use a prenatal cradle, but did not specify which kind. I bought this one because I was skeptical. It costs less and had decent reviews. It worked! It alleviated my pain. Since it is small and compact, I could throw it in my purse when I wasn't wearing it and could excuse myself to put it on in the restroom. This ended up being a great purchase.
