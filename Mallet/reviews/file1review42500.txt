review/text: Dymatize Elite Whey is one of the best protein powders out there, trust me I've tried many of them..The powder mixes 10x better than it's competitors, insuring a clump free smoothie every time. Also it is worth mentioning that this stuff tastes great for having so little sugar and sweeteners, no fluff, just protein. Results with this product are equally impressive, it absorbs easily and without that 'heavy' feeling, results in good weight gain(lean mass, that is). I would have to say that this product and muscle milk are my favorite protein powders of all time, which is why I opt for the 10 lbs, it's definitely a better deal.
