review/text: I use a 5 pound in a month (3 scoops a day) and believe you me I have tried every GNC protein flavor. I can confidently say this is the BEST protein shake flavor I have tasted. It is subtle at the same satisfying. Out of all the flavors for some reason this one mixes the best in water and milk both. It tastes heavenly in milk (I sometimes add a dash of coffee). I like that it does not have the strong sugary taste like the strawberry at the same is perfect to the palate.
