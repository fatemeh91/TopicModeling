review/text: How do I review this type of product? I can't say it works or doesn't work without doing a clinical trial as there is just no way to know if I didn't get sick because I took the medicine, or I got sick with something the medicine couldn't help.So, I am reviewing it based on use and side effects. This medicine requires taking 20 pills over two days. You take 2 pills at a time 5 hours apart. This is next to impossible to remember or be able to do. I ended up doing 2 and a half days to work around work or sleep schedules and the times I forgot.I took immediately when my wife was showing symptoms of a cold and I was getting a soar throat. Immediately I noticed these pills gave me heartburn and an upset stomach. The correlation was strong, I took the pills and less than half an hour later I had heartburn. Every time.However, now two weeks later, I never caught what my wife had. It could be that these helped, but it also might be that I never caught it.The bottom line is that these pills will run you a substantial sum of money to use each time you might be getting sick. If you have an important event coming up and you really can't be sick for it, it might be worth using some. Otherwise, I am not the type to gamble on whether they will work or not. I will trust my immune system to do its job or flu vaccinations for the flu. These had a lot stronger side effects for me as well, so I was malaise for 2 days anyway, not a lot better than being sick.
