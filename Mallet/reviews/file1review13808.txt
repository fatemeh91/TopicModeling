review/text: [[ASIN:B000BKTB4U The Happy Company Microwaveable Therapeutic Cozy Chenille Happy Wrap,purple This product is all I had hoped it would be & helps to stave off the chill & the tensison that contribute to back pain & headaches. As I had hoped, it easily withstands 6 minutes in the microwave & retains a substantial amount of heat for an hour or 2. It was very accurately described in the ad & I am delighted I bought it.
