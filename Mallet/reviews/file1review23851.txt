review/text: I purchased this for my husband who is allergic to penicillin, the most important part of the bracelet, which is to inform medical personnel about his allergy, was not attached properly. I wrote to the seller to inform them of this problem and was told to contact the manufacturer, I do not see why I should contact the manufacturer when I did no business with the manufacturer. This part of the bracelet has since fallen off and there is now no point in him wearing the bracelet. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
