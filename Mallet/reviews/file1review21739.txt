review/text: The filter we ordered was quite a bit larger than the size it is marked as and didn't fit. We did get it installed but it had to be manipulated and bent into place with a mallet. The location requires an 8ft ladder to install it in the ceiling, so we we're not happy customers. We couldn't find this size anywhere, so we were happy to find it through Amazon. But disappointed in the sizing which should be standard.
