review/text: This is a great product. I have very sensitive hands, and these are power-free foodservice quality Nitrile gloves. So what's my beef? The seller basically wrapped tape around the box you see in the picture, slapped a shipping sticker on it and shipped it off. So the box comes crushed and full exposed. Would it kill the seller to at least wrap the box in shipping paper, or put it inside another box?
