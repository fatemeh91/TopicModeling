review/text: While I bought these given their nutritional superiority in comparison to other fish oil supplements, the odour that they emit makes them unbearable, both to the person taking the supplement as well as those unfortunate enough to be seated around the person taking the supplement for forty hours per week. After two days of taking the recommended daily dose of three pills, I smelled like what I imagine the seafood section of a grocery store would smell like if the refrigeration units were to lose power for a few days--and as my sense of smell is pretty terrible, the fact that I could smell myself says quite a lot. I tried reducing the dosage to two pills per day for a couple more days, but no luck in stopping the stench and no seal of approval from my work neighbours. Two days after stopping use, I'm back to my normal-smelling self, even after going back to taking Schiff MegaRed krill oil instead. While that product gives not even remotely as much bang for the buck in terms of nutrition per dose, it's also odour-free, so no more disgusted coworkers and no more Thera Tears. Yuck.
