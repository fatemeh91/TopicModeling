review/text: In the middle of the night some time last week I woke up in excruciating pain. The big bone/joint of my big toe hurt to the touch and I felt like crying. I attempted to get up to walk to my bathroom so I could pop a couple Ib profen. Well, that turned out to be WAY harder than it sounds. Could barely walk. Same goes for the next day, and the next day after that, and probably after that. I thought it was a bunion, upon research and finding out my dad has one too. These babies are mainly hereditary. It slowly got better within about a week, which is when I got my bunion regulator. It's still a little tender but I am wearing this to bed. It isn't too uncomfortable at all, it just takes some time getting used to this "thing" around your foot. But I definitely recommend this product, as I can see it clearly pushing my toe in the direction that I want it to be. If this is a bunion problem, hopefully this realigns me and stretches out all those tendons like I want it to!
