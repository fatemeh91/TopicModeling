review/text: I have been cutting my familily's hair for 16 years and this is the best clipper I have found. It is a sharp cutting machine! The clippers appear to be well constructed, they are quiet, and they are not heavy or bulky to handle while using them. The price is reasonable. I had a Oster for 15 years and was going to replace with the similar item until I searched this one. I liked the warranty it came with also. As for the accessories ---- there is alot there, many heads to have fun with all the different gadgets! The length of the cord is just the right distance to sit by the plug in and still have room to walk all around the head of the person. There is also a picture diagrams with directions on which tool to use for various hair styles. This pamphlet is displayed in a colorful easy to understand layout for the haircuts. I find this all fits in quite well in a plastic shoe box. I am looking forward to using this clippers. In a years time I could give a more thorough review, since I have only used these clippers 3 times. I hope they last for many years.
