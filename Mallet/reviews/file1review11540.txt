review/text: I am adding to my supply of these batteries. I currently use the Duracell 15 minute charger. I use these for my wireless keyboard and mouse with great success. I also use them in my Fuji digital camera that has a micro drive. They offer great life and they hold a charge when stored.I also use them in remotes and other items. My experience with these have been nothing but positive. Great price and great product.UPDATE: 12/12/2012.Still using the batteries.
