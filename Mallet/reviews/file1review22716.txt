review/text: My male keeshond had absolute meltdowns during thunderstorms, and there seemed to be no help for him. This product was recommended to me -- by my dog's groomer, by friends -- and I was skeptical.5 or 6 drops do the trick for my poor boy. Rescue Remedy seems to work better with each time I use it.
