review/text: I bought this pill box about 8 months ago. Previous to this pill box, I had an elongated weekly pill box. The problem with the large weekly pill boxes is that they are too large to easily carry and often have small compartments that don't hold all of your pills. I decided to buy this pill box based on all of the rave reviews. I can honestly say that you will not be disappointed, especially if you are required to take medication twice a day. I am extremely forgetful regarding medication. The transparent daily pill boxes allow me easily have a visible indication of whether or not my medication was taken without having to open it. The daily pill box is rather large and can easily hold several of your larger pills. I liked this design because I can grab the day's medication right before I head out to the office.
