review/text: I like it. It has a very light taste and doesn't weigh you down like other protein powders. Seems to digest fairly quickly, getting it out of the stomach. Anymore, with how many meals I eat everyday, this is a very important aspect of a protein powder for me. Also, does not leave me bloated and gassy.
