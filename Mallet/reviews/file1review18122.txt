review/text: I have the Bucky Shades (Bucky Eye Shades) and I just got these today. I wanted something not as thick as the Shades since it's summer and my face gets sweaty at night. I haven't slept in them yet but I tried them on just now. All I can really say is that if your body is of an average or tall proportion, you will probably love these. If you are if a short/small proportion (i.e. petite), order these as long as you accept they may be too big for you (because absolutely nothing seems to be made for us smaller bodied persons).The cut out for the nose is much too high for me and for it to fit reasonably well, I have to pull it much lower over my eyes than it is really meant to be in order to actually block most of the light. This causes me to adjust the back strap a bit more tightly than I would prefer but it is necessary to keep them from moving out of place.They are super soft and ALL of it super flexible. I highly approve of the materials and the color/design options. I would say this is rather close to perfect for me, save it being too large in general and the ridiculously high cut nose. I may have to cut off the straps and re-sew them a bit higher on the sides because they go right over my ears when I have it pulled down low enough to fit.I bought the kid version (Dream Essentials Hush Children's Travel and Sleep Mask, Frogs) of the Shades (NOT Bucky brand) thinking that like everything else I buy that is made for average proportioned people, the kid version would be just a bit smaller. Oh, no. FALSE. They were so tiny that I think only a 2 or 3 year old could use them. I sent them back feeling beyond disappointed.So for those of you in a similar small-person-boat, I recommend Bucky Shades (I rank the Shades higher) and these but I hope you are willing to do some adjustments of your own to make them work for you (and don't bother trying the children's version!).
