review/text: I love Glide Dental Tape. The tape is thin but wider than regular dental floss. It's easy to use and doesn't break. That's important for those of us with tight contacts between our teeth. It has a cool, minty taste. This product really left my teeth and gums feeling refreshed and clean. I'd highly recommend Glide Dental Tape. In fact, after reviewing this product, I have decided this is floss I'll be using from now on.
