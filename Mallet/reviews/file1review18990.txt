review/text: i would say these work but im not sure. i have an irregular cycle so i purchased this to see what day i would ovulate. i followed the instructions and on cycle day 14 the test said positive for a lh surge. so me and my BF ..you know.... and i did not become pregnant! (bummer) so i would rate this a three because im not sure if this test is innacurate for the LH surge or maybe i didnt ovulate that cycle. im gonna try first response ovulation predictor next time
