review/text: That was my question to friends who have this crazy-looking self-massage tool. After 10 minutes, I was "hooked". The best thing is that you can relax--as one should when trying to reduce pain--and even laugh while you tie yourself in a pretzel exploring the impact of each knob on each pain spot. And it's incredibly versatile. Neck pain? Got it! Cramp in the arch of your foot? Fixed. Muscle knot that you can't reach yourself? No worries. Besides, even if it doesn't work, what a great conversation starter on a cold rainy night in the Pacific Northwest: "Top 10 ways to use the Buddy Massage Cane that aren't found in the directions."
