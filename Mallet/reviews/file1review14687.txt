review/text: I began taking vinpocetine since my mother had vascular dementia. I took it for three weeks and in those 3 weeks I was hit with a severe and pervasive sense of sadness. I'm typically a joyful person but couldn't shake this depression and intense sense of sadness. I did additional research into vinpocetine and saw the link between depression and vinpocetine. I stopped taking the vinpocetine and now a week later, my sense of emotional well-being and joy has returned. Beware all of you that, like me take supplements to better their health and lifestyles. Do your research because supplements behave differently in different people. To your health!
