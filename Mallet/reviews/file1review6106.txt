review/text: These rags are more like really tough paper towels that come out of a box and i love them! They are great for cleaning anything around the house that you would use a rag for. The only negative is that they are pretty much just extremely strong paper towels, not cloth rags, so I would avoid using them for anything that requires vigorous cleaning, as they will probably rip.
