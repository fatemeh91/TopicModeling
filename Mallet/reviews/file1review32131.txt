review/text: This shave bowl is very sturdy, attractive and is just the right size. I wholeheartedly endorse this product for the new soap shaver. This will fit in your new routine as well as in your budget. Plus you get a big size soap instead of buying the smaller ones somewhere else.So I read reviews about soap not fitting in this bowl and ask "Why does it go in the bowl?" My opinion is that it doesn't. When you leave the soap in the same bowl that you lather in, your soap gets used up WAY too quickly and your suds are not as good of quality (IMHO).This is how I build my lather:I run hot water in the tap and fill this very attractive bowl, letting is sit on the counter for a few minutes. I then take a little bit of the same hot tap water, just enough to cover the surface of the soap; yes still in the plastic container.Rinse the brush in hot water and check for debris in sink, then let it sit in the bowl of water while I warm a hot towel to soften my beard.After about 3 minutes, I empty the bowl and then tip the water out of the soap too. Shake out the brush a couple times and grab some soap in the tip. This takes about 5-15 seconds of stirring. Move the brush to the bowl and start to whip, and the foam starts to explode! If you need more foam while stirring, add about a teaspoon of water and keep going.This process gets me enough lather to manage the 3 pass technique with my razor and still have about a hand full of suds when done.I used to HATE shaving...
