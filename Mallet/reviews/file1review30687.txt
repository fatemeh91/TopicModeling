review/text: This was my first safety razor, and while it gets the job done, there are much better razors out there. TheEdwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chromefor example, is of much higher quality and it's actually cheaper than the Merkur 178/HD. The fit and finish on the Merkur 178 is very poor. It almost looks like a factory second or third, and there are lots of nicks and the head of the razor looks warped and the blade exposure is uneven. The Edwin Jagger does not suffer from these flaws.That being said, the Merkur 178 is a decent shaver on which I learned to shave with a safety razor. I like the short handle which makes it very easy to maneuver with, and the thick knurled handle provides excellent grip. Changing blades is easy because it's a two piece razor, and you just have to unscrew the head by turning the knob on the bottom of the handle. However, it is not the smoothest shaver, and the Edwin Jagger beats the Merkur 178 in that aspect as well. And you might as well just throw out the Merkur blade it comes with, as they're known to be dull and just plain bad.
