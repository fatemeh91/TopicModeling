review/text: I shouldn't have waited. These are essential for thoroughly cleaning out your Nalgenes and Kleen Kanteens. The Kleen Kanteens are tough without a solution like this. I just couldn't get the tea and coffee stains out. I should have bought this sooner just like the other reviewers said. Oh well - have one now - I'm pleased and highly recommend.
