review/text: I have used several very good aftershave products but I think I have found the clear winner with this product. It applies very smoothly, has a very clean scent and conditions my skin immediately. It is a cream, which I prefer over liquids. A little goes a long way and provides a bit of a cooling, but very soothing effect. I like the scent - it reminds me of some kind of herb - very clean and not too noticeable.Great product, highly recommended.
