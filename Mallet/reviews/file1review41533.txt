review/text: I am not inclined to write product reviews but this toothbrush is really great. I've used electric toothbrushes for decades. My last Braun ebrush died and I search for a replacement. This one was more expensive but having used it I have to say it was well worth the extra money.The one thing I really dislike about the product is the electrical plug's "wall wart" - it juts out much more than any I've ever seen.
