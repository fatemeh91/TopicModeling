review/text: For a latex condom, these are very thin and match or exceed the quality and pleasure of any latex condom I have tried (Durex, Trojan, Lifestyle, etc.). Though, I don't like the pink tinting. Unlike some other condoms I've tried, these condoms stretch well at the base where I have found some condoms to be too constricting. The tipping point, however, is the price. These are extremely cheap and yet well made, comfortable, condoms. You can't go wrong with that!That said, personally I still prefer Lifestyle SKYN condoms because they are just as thin, do not contain latex, and don't have that nasty smell common to all latex condoms. Unfortunately, they're also a lot more expensive! Maybe I am allergic to latex, I don't know, but I have found latex condoms to be numbing and I have never been able to climax with one on. Crown condoms have proven to be no exception. The only condom I can climax with are the SKYN condoms because they don't numb sensitivity.Nevertheless, I gave the Crown condoms a 5 star rating because they are great latex condoms. If you don't mind wearing latex, these are your best bet.
