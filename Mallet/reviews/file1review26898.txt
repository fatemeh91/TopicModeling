review/text: This product is great! I bought the strawberry flavor, and it tastes great! Amazon delivered it really quick. This brand of whey protein is a lot better than any other brands out there. In my opinion, this product works the best for me, but I think some people may prefer others. This product is affordable, it's not very cheap or very expensive. If you are a serious weight lifter, I would recommend buying a bigger package, and save more money.
