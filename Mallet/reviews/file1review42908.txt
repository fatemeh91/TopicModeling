review/text: My husband is a letter carrier so he has to carry a 40# bag of mail. He gets really bad back spasms and walks bent forward. I take Hyland leg cramp pills so I thought I'd look to see if they had anything for backpain. They did and wow what a difference it has made for him. The doctor won't help, but these pills are the best. I will definatley order again.
