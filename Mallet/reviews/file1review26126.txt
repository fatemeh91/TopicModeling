review/text: One of the side effects of my new medication was dry, sensitive hands and feet, and my doctor recommended I use a moisturizing lotion two or three times a day. I tried several different products from the local drug store, but all proved to be either greasy, smelly, expensive, or just plain didn't work. Finally, I called the drug manufacturer of my medication, and one of their recommendations was Dermal Therapy lotion. I ordered from Amazon.com as the product was unavailable locally and the price was reasonable. To make a long story short, the Dermal Therapy lotion made all the difference. The dry skin on my hands and feet has been relieved and is no longer a concern. Yes, I recommend Dermal Therapy lotion, and have reordered a supply from Amazon.
