review/text: I have received this item as a stocking stuffer and have purchased several myself- they are very useful in helping to avoid staining but you have to apply the product right away. Also, you have to try and blot the clothing so that you don't end up with a ring around where the stain was. I find it very helpful in cleaning stains (I stain a lot of clothing) and the tube is small and portable. Just make sure your expectations for its use are reasonable.
