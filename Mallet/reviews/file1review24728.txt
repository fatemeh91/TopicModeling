review/text: Flimsy, easily broken, but great coverage. I go through about one per season. I could buy a more expensive, sturdier version, but I suspect it would still get broken by kids stepping on it or the lawn service accidentally mowing over it (as has happened in past years). This sprinkler works very well on low pressure as well as high, which is key if you want to water a small area of the yard. When turned on high, it covers an area of about 30 feet.
