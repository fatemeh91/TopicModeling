review/text: I knew that I would need a backup battery for my Olympus E500. This is identical to the battery supplied with the camera. I wanted to use an Olympus battery after reading some BAD reviews of knockoff replacements. The battery seems to have plenty of reserve power even though the E500 has a full color display that does all functions instead of the 2 displays that most dSLR have (one usually is a low power LCD display for exposure settings). I only have long term experience with NiMH batteries with a point-n-shoot so I really can't make a final review of the longevity of Lithium-Ion batteries. Laptops seem to lose holding power over time. So far I'm happy, but if something goes bad, I'll update my reviewHere is an update (10/05/08), I upgraded to a Olympus E3 which uses the same battery. No problems! I'm very happy with the longevity of the battery. It may be my imagination but it seems that the E3 is a bit more efficient on battery power which is confusing because it has both the color and a monochrome LCD display.
