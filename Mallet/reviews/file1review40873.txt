review/text: I've used a similarly shaped little round plastic clamshell pill box for years. A couple of them lasted forever, but when the last one got crunched, I looked for something similar. This LOOKS right, but don't be fooled. It's useless. Here's the problem: though the clamshell fits together very tightly, it is FLEXIBLE. That means no matter how tight it fits when you close it, if it twists slightly, as it will almost immediately, it will open and dump its contents wherever. It is completely useless and should be withdrawn from the market. The manufacturers should be ashamed marketing this garbage, and please, anyone who sells it: don't. It's too cheap to return, but hopefully it can be recycled with a low carbon footprint. BUYERS BEWARE. Instead, buyIndestructo Pill Box - 6 Per Package. These are great.
