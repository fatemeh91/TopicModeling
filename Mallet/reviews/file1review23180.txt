review/text: The handle will not stay together. I have "hit" it so many times trying to get the pieces to stay together. It lasts for about two minutes then the handle comes apart while I'm sweeping my kitchen floor. It picks up most stuff but not all. If the handle would stay together long enough to do my kitchen and foyer, I'd give it three stars... But having the handle come apart repeatedly: one star. It's going back. Not recommended!
