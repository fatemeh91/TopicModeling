review/text: I won't comment on the quality of the items but the service is sloooow. i ordered 3 sets which they charged $20 for shipping alone. Estimated delivery was 3-5 days. already 6 business days have passed and still nothing in sight. I had ordered them on the basis that they will fulfill the order on time so I can take them overseas w/ me, but now I guess I won't be able to take them w/ me. what lousy service. On a different order previously for the body back buddy, they were supposed to include manual and the order came w/ no manual. They tried to play it off as if the customer is ignorant by not mentioning anything. Contacted them and they offered to give back a few dollars for the missing manual. Just bear in mind extra delays when ordering this, and the extra shipping costs even if you have amazon prime.
