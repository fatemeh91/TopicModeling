review/text: I took this for 6 months and my period stop for six months. I cannot wait for another month because its abnormal. I took Norethindrone prescribed by my OB-GYN and my period came back. This product is not for real it will do you harm than good. I thought it will normalize my menstruation but its the opposite. If a woman doesn't menstruate for long months it would lead to endometriosis or ovarian cancer. I don't want this to happen to anyone buying this pill that is not approved by FDA. If it is effective, why until now it hasn't been approved by FDA?!!!!! I wasted my money of this and it endangers my life.
