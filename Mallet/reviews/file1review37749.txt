review/text: Normally, I wouldn't do a writeup for this sort of product but there aren't a ton of reviews for it yet and I feel a very effective health supplement could be being overlooked. I'm someone who's had his fair share of heartburn issues as of late. To the point where it was basically there round the clock regardless of what I ate or didn't eat. Took one of these things yesterday (orange peel extract in a capsule) and within a MUCH shorter time than expected, it relieved or eliminated my major symptoms. So now I feel compelled to put in a good word and hopefully spread the message to others.Wanted an alternative to antacids, Prilosec OTC or any of that other nonsense doctors continually recommend whenever your esophagus or stomach has somehow gotten screwed up. Someone mentioned this at the grocery store as a "cure" (since she HAD reflux also) and I decided to give it a shot. Within about 10 minutes of taking my first pill, I thought I noticed less acid reflux. After 24 hours, it felt like my heartburn had literally vanished along with every accompanying symptom. No burping, no bloatedness, less chest pain, less "chest movement" (synced with the heartbeat probably from some sort of strain on it). I'm sitting here a day later wondering if this is real or just wishful thinking. It's early and placebo's always possible but I think this product is the real deal that many heartburn sufferers probably aren't all-together familiar with.In closing, if you're looking for a quote-unquote "natural solution" that won't shut down your stomach acid production, give this a shot first. Will update this review again in a few weeks and let you know how I made out,
