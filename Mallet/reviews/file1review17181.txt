review/text: I bought this trimmer after dropping my previous one from a different brand. The cheap plastic height modulator shattered and the only way to control the depth was to tape it in one place. Not very versatile, I must say. So, I decided to purchase a sturdier-looking one, i.e. more klutz-proof. I have been very happy with this product so far. The height wheel makes it exceedingly easy to switch how close you want to trim, and it's all very solid. Others have mentioned that there is no charging stand, but that is a plus for me as those things can topple over anyway. Or at least they seem to if I get within a yard of them. I much prefer to lie it down where it can't fall. It's also very, very easy to clean. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product. For the money, you really can't go wrong. Here's to happy trimming and looking good!
