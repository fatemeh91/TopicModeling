review/text: Our year old dishwasher was showing white scale and the top rack was sticking when pulling it out. Used this product and now top rack slides smoothly and white scale is gone. I will definitely use this product regularly, but, will buy it at Walmart for $3.98 for same size bottle - $2.98 less! Even with added .065 tax and the gas to get there, Amazon does not compete. I love Amazon, but, unfortunately, this time it's not practical. The one star rating is only because of Amazon's price.
