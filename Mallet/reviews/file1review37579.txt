review/text: I love speed stick musk and like other reviewers, the deodorant (NOT antiperspirant) is easy on my skin. I break out into a rash with the anti's. The smell is great and I'm so pleased I can buy a 2 year supply on Amazon. When they stop making this smell, I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself. It really is perfect.
