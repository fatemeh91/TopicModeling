review/text: After practicing pharmacy for 35 years, I can safely state that some of the other reviewers do not understand the use, and hence the cost, of this product.This product was never intended to be used as a home-rememdy salt tablet; it was designed to aid in the extemporaneous preparation of salt solutions, such as Normal Saline, to be used in human medicine. The fact that these tablets meet U.S.P. (United States Pharmacopoeia) standards makes them more expensive than the usual consumer grade product. Much more time is spent in making certain that they are of extablished purity, strength, and freedom from bacterial contamination.
