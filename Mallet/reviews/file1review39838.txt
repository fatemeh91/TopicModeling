review/text: I am interested in purchasing the Deluxe Gopher, so I'll give it five stars for the idea- but I am wondering why your photo of the product doesn't match the ones in the &quot;demo&quot; photos with people using them for different purposes?I tried to offer my &quot;helpful suggestion&quot; in checking the box which you graciously made available in order to get this helpful feedback, but then entering the box to give the description of the problem, I noticed that there is absolutely NO WAY anyone can respond, as the cursor only allows TEN spaces in which to enter a response! Now what does this convey? Either the web page needs a fix, or the real desire for feedback is just for show.Just wondered. I figure if I write this, someone will at least read it and perhaps it will be helpful. As soon as I see that the photos in the demos are of the same product as the ones shown for sale, then I will purchase the Deluxe Gopher.I'll check back.Thanks for giving me a voice here, as I see no other contact information anywhere else.myfield@webtv.net
