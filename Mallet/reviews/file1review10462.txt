review/text: I was so disappointed to receive this package and see it was the normal shelf size I buy at home at way over the normal selling price. Item was a discontinued item in our store but I didn't realize I was getting one bottle. I normally pay $5 and this shipment was $28. Total disappointment and guess I will learn to read the finer print better.
