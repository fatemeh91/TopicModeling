review/text: First of all, I had no idea it was going to be so small and cheaply made. After trying it once, it broke, poof, just like that. No one can figure out how in the world it's not working, the metal inside looks in perfect condition, the batteries are new. Oh well, we've trashed it and will definitely not get the same thing again.
