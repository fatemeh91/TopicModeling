review/text: So glad I read the other good reviews of this brush and bought it - it's a great dish brush. It gets my plates and silverware nice & clean. But what puts it over the top of other dish brushes for me is that it works great cleaning my little Fancy Feast cat food cans - it fits in the cans and the insides & lids are clean in no time (I have to keep them in my house for a week until recycling day comes). It also does an amazing job on those little storage containers lids where the manufacturer stamps words. Before, I could never really get into those crevices. This does it with ease. The size of the brush and the spacing of the bristles is just great. I bought this a few months ago and it's holding great, too. Nice and sturdy. Its handle is great, too. Who ever thought I'd be a fan of a dish brush? But here I am! :) Highly recommended.
