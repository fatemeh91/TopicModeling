review/text: I bought this for a knot under my right shoulder blade that burned and ached almost constantly for three weeks. I had been asking my 8- and 5-year olds to elbow my back, but they weren't around half the time and also I didn't want to keep bugging them. This device is easy to use without help. You can easily apply a lot of pressure to a specific point and even move it up and down. So far I've used the knobs on either end for my back. I must have grabbed it 20 times in the first two days. After about 10 days, I noticed a significant difference in the pain level, and now it's gone. Of course, I've done stretching and sat in the jacuzzi a few times, too. Anyhow, I was so miserable that I thought about going to a masseuse, which is great to do but pricey and provides temporary relief (with only one appt.). Ideally, you could see a masseuse a couple times and use this as a supplement. Even alone, though, this device did the trick for me. Regarding the documentation, it comes with a short pamphlet that simply describes where to use each knob. I don't think more extensive documentation for the device itself is needed. If you want to learn about pressure points, then you can buy a book and use this device as the tool.
