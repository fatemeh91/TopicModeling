review/text: I drink a glass of these super green powders every day, and they really work. I have more energy, and I don't even get a cold anymore. I have tried different powders. None of them taste very good, but it is still OK to drink them mixed in water. I like to use water so I do not add calories every day just for these green drinks. I am sure this green powder is of similar quality as the others, but the taste is so bad, that I gaged when I drank it the first time. I did not give up right away though. I tried for a few more days, but eveytime I swallowed this, I got nauseated from the taste, and felt sick for about one hour. I gave up. This is so vile, it is just not worth it. There are many other good products out there which taste a lot better.
