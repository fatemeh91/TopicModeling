review/text: Sounds like a commercial, but it is true. This toothpaste has a very refreshing flavor, and my teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing. I would have given it 5 stars, but during my last dental appointment I was told that I had more plaque build up than usual. I'm not sure it was a result of the toothpaste (hygenist said it could've been a result of illness.) All in all, I recommend this natural toothpaste as a nice change from the mainstream brands.
