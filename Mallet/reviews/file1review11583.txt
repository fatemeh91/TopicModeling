review/text: I'm a semi-pro photographer with experience in the field and when it comes to trust, these batteries don't have mine.I've always liked regular Duracell batteries better than any other but after a few months of regular use, my 2650mAh with 15min quick charger haven't held up. After a full charge, I can expect to get a solid run out of them (250 photos, 1/4 of them with flash) from my Canon A710IS, but leave those batteries sitting in the camera for a few days??? I fully expect them to be dead. I agree with the other 1 star reviewers. Too bad. I won't give up on Duracell though. I'll just be patient, though I have heard good things about Sanyo's Eneloop batteries.
