review/text: I like this mask for meditation, which I do sitting up in a chair. It's very cleverly designed and you really can easily open your eyes while wearing it, and yet be in complete darkness. Very cool.However, it's pretty much useless for sleeping, unless you sleep sitting up or you always and only lie on your back. The front of the mask is a flexible but thick black plastic, and the edges are not comfortable in any position other than "upright".So, if you want an excellent mask for meditation, positive visualisation, light sensitivity relief, or similar, and you don't intend to lie down on your side at all (i.e. lie only on your back or sit up), this is a very worthwhile product. Otherwise, don't bother, because you're not likely to be able to sleep in it comfortably.
