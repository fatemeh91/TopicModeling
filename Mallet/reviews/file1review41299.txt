review/text: I used this product for the first time. I cleaned three floor rugs today with this product. Two of the rugs had no pet smell lingering, but the last rug, which was the most smelly, still had a strong pet smell after cleaning it. I will probably have to re-do this last rug because of the high use it receives and since the dogs tend to like to sit on it. The deoderant in the formula needs to be stronger since pet smells are so strong. Also the formula could use more brighteners in it since I don't see much of a difference after cleaning the rugs.
