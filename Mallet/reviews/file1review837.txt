review/text: I am a writer and have to work 8 hours straight at a keyboard for clients when on tight deadlines. It was suggested by a specialist that I ice my wrists every night. I thought this would be a neat way to do it. The concept is good but the beads never get cold enough to accomplish the therapy and subsequent relief needed.
