review/text: I purchased this for my cat when he suffered a traumatic leg injury and had to be taken to a specialty Vet 30 minutes away once a week or more for over a month. I also read about this product inThe Natural Cat: The Comprehensive Guide to Optimum CareHe's a rescue and skittish to begin with (runs when there's a knock, hides when new people visit etc) and I was very worried and upset at the amount of stress he was going to be under with the frequent trips to the vet, medicines, surgeries and daily care. I was hoping this would work but I saw absolutely no difference in his demeanor after administering this per the directions. I even dropped some of the liquid in his carrier in the corner he liked to huddle in and still nothing. In fact, my cat started to associate the Rescue Remedy with going in the carrier/to the vet so then it became impossible to give this to him.I also tried this on my female cat who freaks out in the car and the carrier and again, no change.I tried one last time to see if this Rescue Remedy would work by trying it out on myself and it did nothing. My job is mentally stressful so I am open to using holistic means of relieving stress and was disappointed this didn't work.I'm glad it has worked for others but this did not work in any way, shape or form for me or my cats.
