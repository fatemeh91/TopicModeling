review/text: Sigh...I have very sensitive skin and lots of allergies. For this reason I am only able to use Ban Unscented deodorant. I switched to another brand of unscented deodorant and promptly developed atopic dermatitis. I can't say the other deodorant caused this problem, as I am not a medical professional, but I suspect it's very likely.I've switched to Ban unscented roll on as that's all that's available here. If I can find the Ban Unscented solid deodorant I will stock up as it works to keep body odor at bay without causing me any problems. I love this stuff and highly recommend purchasing and using it unless you have medical problems from its use.
