review/text: ...but it's disgusting. It's taste equivalent would be what I imagine stuffing your face full of dandelions and old socks would be. It says not to drink but 1-2 ounces of liquid after you take it but it's a nearly impossible task, unless you like suffering. I would recommend it only to those who don't gag very easily. But if you are desperate for help with milk, hold your nose and droppers up!
