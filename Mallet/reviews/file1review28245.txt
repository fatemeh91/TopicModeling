review/text: On an otherwise pleasant day in the English countryside where I spent my childhood, I sat atop a tuffet to enjoy my 100% Whey Protein Gold Standard in the fashion that I found most pleasing, which is to say, along with warm milk curds. But just as I had sat down to enjoy this lovely afternoon snack, I was startled most unexpectedly by a predatory arachnid, who was so bold as to sit directly alongside me! I was so started, in fact, by this spider that I nearly forgot my curds and whey, which I had hastily lain on the tuffet in my surprise! Suffice it to say that I had subsequently lost my appetite!
