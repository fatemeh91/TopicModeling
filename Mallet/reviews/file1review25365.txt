review/text: I have one of these scales and find it very useful, both for myself, as an athlete, and for my fiance. I use it to see the progress I make in working out, since I maintain a steady weight. My fiance' however diets and tries to work out regularly. This scale helps her to see which types of diets are most effective, even if they don't promote as much weightloss as other methods. W/o this scale, you wouldn't be able to accurately measure those kinds of results. Overall, it's reliable, consistent, and easy to use. Definitely go with a model like this one that saves personal info for 2 people. That way you don't have to input your age/sex/height every time.
