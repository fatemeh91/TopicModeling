review/text: I use this everywhere.My granite countertops, old wooden furniture...I am never afraid to clean any hard surface any more, no matter how soiled or how fragile. It can foam a little if sprayed directly onto surfaces, so I always spray it onto a rag instead.It smells great, like rolling around on the lawn in high summer. If you hate the sickly chemical smells of "modern" cleaning products your lungs will thank you for cleaning with such a gentle product!
