review/text: When I was in Ecuador, I was slathering myself with these every morning before I left the house. I had to compete with weird mites and other critters flying out of dry dirt, tropical insects and, of course, potentially more-than-irritating mosquitoes.I received one bite over the course of a few weeks. It was early in the morning, while I was in bed. A spider decided that the palm of my hand (free from any blocker) looked darn tasty.I continue to use bite blocker wipes (carry-on friendly) and really cannot remember the last time I did get a bug bite. It's pretty cool, especially given how awesome these wipes smell compared to the toxic alternatives.
