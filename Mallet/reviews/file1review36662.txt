review/text: I was pleased with this product. The soap produces a rich lather and doesn't leave a filmy, oily feeling on your skin. Although I enjoyed the smell, it could be overpowering to some. I thought the scent enhanced the feeling of being clean and fresh. The contour of the underside of the bar makes it easy to hold, too.
