review/text: I have some fairly serious neck issues ("You got a lot going on in there," as my doctor says) and have used one of these for about seven years with zero product problems of any kind. I have tried a variety of other highly-touted cervical pillows, and they simply don't compare. Some interfered with sleep or actually seemed to make my neck worse, and I have always swiftly returned to the Mediflow. I bought the set of two when I married my Belarusian wife three years ago. She has no neck problems whatsoever but thinks the Mediflow is the best thing about life in America next to peanut butter. I'm in the process of ordering yet another for her daughter in Minsk. The only maintenance is to occasionally change the water (perhaps once a year), a five-minute project at most.
