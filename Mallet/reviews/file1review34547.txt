review/text: I purchased this product because of its active ingredient Geraniol. One of my supervisors told me that my colleagues elsewhere were having really good luck with another brand with this ingredient. If you've ever been to south Florida and experienced the no-see-ums, you will understand the maddening effect they can have and how quickly they can drive you indoors.Because I work outside (and need to stay there for 4-5 hours per shift) I needed something effective. I tried just spraying a light mist over my exposed skin, but the no-see-ums kept biting. I sprayed the (they call it lotion because it's a white liquid-- when you spray close to your arm it will bead up on your arm hair) BugBand close to my arms and legs (so that it left patches of white) and rubbed it in. I used A LOT of product in two hours and still walked away with quite a few bites.I was hoping for a miracle product and ended up with a mediocre one that requires more time and effort than I am willing to spend. I'll be looking for something else.
