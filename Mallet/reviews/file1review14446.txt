review/text: For your Rollator reference, I just put together the very similar Medline Elite Rolling Walker also 250# rated (from that big box store, cc, at a somewhat higher price). Unfortunately, during assembly, I had to drill out the set of adjustment holes in one of the front legs that allow the triangular screw tightener to slip through. Why the holes were a fraction of an inch smaller on this one leg than the others is crazy, and I wanted to forewarn on this one quality slip up. Hope that does not happen to this Medline Rollator that is so similar. The Elite has two nylon bags, one under the seat and one strap-able to the front; both can be removed if not needed. The Elite does not have the metal basket like this one, nor the extra brace under that basket. The Elite seat seems thicker than this one; additionally, it comes with a cane holder and cup holder to attach to the side frames, but positioning them to avoid difficulty in collapsing the walker is to be considered. To fully collapse the walker the bag under the seat has to be partially unclipped. It is interesting that the width to sit down between the legs is only 15" at the plastic brake wrist supports (I cannot tell if the Rollator has the same shape) and 17" at the seat area...that might be a bit tight for some with wider hips. I am a fairly skinny 155#, 6ft tall guy, and noticed the fairly narrow seating area. But my 80+ mother is only 5ft tall and 120#, so hopefully she will fit OK. Overall, the Medline Elite seems like a good unit for the price, and the Rollator is very similar. Lightweight yet fairly sturdy, lots of storage options. Hope this review is helpful during your consideration of the product.
