review/text: I actually use this for my cats' hairballs. I have three very long hair cats, and hairballs can be an issue during shedding season. A couple of my cats actually had hairball blockages that got pretty complicated.The vet wanted me to give them a petrolatum based remedy, but not only it didn&#8217;t agree with my IBD cat, I just didn&#8217;t want to give them such an artificial product long term.In researching what raw feeders use, I saw this is what is often recommended (my cats eat a raw diet). It works by emulsifying the fat that ties the hairball together, losing it up and making it easier to pass.It has helped a great deal! The recommended dosage is capsule 2x a week, but I have worked (slowly to avoid loose stools issues) the dose to capsule every other day, and my problem boy 1 capsule every other day.On more extreme cases, it is recommended to add Slippery Elm Bark, Tsp twice a week &#8211; mixed with 2TSP of boiling water &#8211; mix, let it gel up, let it cool off before giving to the kitty &#8211; I mix it with the liquid that comes out of the meat during defrost, but you can make it from tuna juice as well.When it comes to taste, my cats LOVE this! The texture is very much like egg yolks, so it is kind of hard to take it off the capsules - you kind of need to scrape it off with a little spoon or another small tool.
