review/text: I have used Source of Life vitamins for about 10 years. I know they work well, and you won't be disappointed. The smaller size of the Mini-Tabs is easier to swallow for most people, like my wife. The Vitamin Shoppe via Amazon makes it easy to purchase. I live in a remote rural area, and there is no place I could even order these within two hours drive. With Amazon, I point, click, and they show up at my front door. With magic like that, 300 years ago I'd have been burned as a witch!
