review/text: I have tried everything and this really is the best I've found so far. Mine lasted around 4 months and I bought another one. It is too expensive for what it is, I think the company that makes this could sell it for $20 and still make a profit. But it still beats what the dentist would charge. It's available at Target stores which makes it easy to obtain.
