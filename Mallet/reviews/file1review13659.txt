review/text: Wet the terry cloth with slightly soapy water, wring it out, microwave it for a few seconds, snap the elastic edge of the terry cloth onto your mop* and PRESTO--your kitchen floor will be clean in seconds. When you're done, just throw the terry cloth in the washing machine. No more buckets, no more dirty water, no more buying the throw-away products that don't really get the job done. Works great with Murphy's Oil Soap on hardwoods, too.*Use a plastic mop tool with a flat swivel head.
