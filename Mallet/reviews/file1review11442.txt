review/text: Kama Sutra Treasures of the Sea is an intriguing bath salt with a warm sensuous room enveloping fragrance. One scoop of the salts in a tub of water and you transform everyday bathing into bubbles and water the color of the ocean. The color reminded me of the turquoise waters near the Aiya Napa white caves in Cyprus. The texture of the water turns silky and you may notice your skin is more moisturized from the natural oils, especially the Wheat Germ Oil.While many may see the color as "Azure" there is a definite green vs. purple color mingling in the depths of blue and this does contain Algae. The texture of the salt is more like a sand than a salt and the shimmering finely ground blue salt crystals mingle with what looks like tiny pieces of broken marble. Of course, this all dissolves quickly and the bubbles last through the entire bath. In fact, the more you move around, the more bubbles appear.The warm scent soothes the soul and the color is dreamy and the bubbles look like clouds floating across an open sky. A shell of salts is all you need and a beautiful shell is included. A natural sponge is in the tin and works well for exfoliating the body.I had so much fun taking a bath with these salts, that I ran my husband a bath too. These salts seem to inspire sharing.~The Rebecca Review
