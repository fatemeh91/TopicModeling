review/text: I read the negative reviews for this waterproof pad and maybe they did get a defective item, I don't know. I do know we bought 2 pads (OK, actually 3 but one is still new in package until needed) and both pads have worked out very well...no leaking through at all.These pads are so large that they overlap the side of a twin bed by approximately 6 inches on each side.The description says it has a non-slip backing but we found this doesn't seem to be the case. Maybe if you don't toss & turn but if you/child do toss & turn, the pad does move about some. But even with the slight movement, it still stays in place enough to do its job.Even with that slight slippage problem, I still gave 5 stars because the pad is wonderful and does a great job. If I could give it 4 1/2 stars, maybe I would but 4 stars would be too low, so 5 it is. :-)
