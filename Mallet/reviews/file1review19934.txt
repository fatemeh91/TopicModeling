review/text: I bought this seat for my son because of the built in "shield". I have found it's a bit short and also that somehow his wetness deflects up under the seat and gets the toilet seat and underneath the seat all wet. I have to always wipe the actual toilet seat and under the potty seat afterwards. Definitely a big mess. Not what I expected from such an expensive seat. Would not recommend
