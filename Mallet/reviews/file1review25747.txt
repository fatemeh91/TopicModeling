review/text: This product served me well for about 9 months and then I dropped it on the bathroom floor. It still works but is very, very loud. For something people will use in the bathroom it is too fragile. If you buy it I would consider it a disposible item. As others pointed out it really does the job well trimming nose and ear hair. You really can rinse it under water without it breaking. Just don't drop it.
