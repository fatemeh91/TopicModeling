review/text: This product requires you to take 3 pills a day (3000mg). The recommended daily intake for coconut oil is 3.5 tablespoons a day. 1 tablespoon is equal to 14 grams. 1000mg is equal to 1 gram. So if you do the math, you'd have to take a LOT of these capsules to get the daily recommended amount. So I'm switching to regular coconut oil that is not in a capsule form.Also, Amazon is screwing Amazon prime members out of purchases unless we buy $25.00 worth of crap with these stupid 'add-on deals.' I used to be able to purchase the product without having to get $25.00 of additional merchandise. In fact, I JUST bought this product less than a month ago and suddenly Amazon decides to have it as an 'add-on' product. So much for purchasing the prime membership.
