review/text: This is the best tasting protein shake I have tasted in a long time. I've been off the protein shakes for about 5 years. Getting back you have to accuire a taste for it again. I've tried other shakes and this was easy to drink - no squirming or gagging :) I took a chance with it since I couldn't find samples. This is very good, all of the whey gourmet flavors!!
