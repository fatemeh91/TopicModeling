review/text: I have had the pleasure of using this product for some 20 years of diabetes.Far more advantagious than the product is the service (if needed) you get from the manufacturer.I had that need a few weeks ago whan my wife had procedure questions after I was hospitalized for other reasons.She had no idea how to use the Glucose meter nor the calibration of the test strips. The manufacturer made the whole thing simple for her (over the phone). As she is not a person that understands these things as quickly as sometimes needed, I was truly happy that all went AAAA1 and the manufacturer was there when they were needed. THEY EVEN SENT A NEW METER / STRIPS ETC. to make sure all went well. (This new equipment was not necessary in my opinion.....but they just wanted to make sure all was OK)THANK YOUYou cannot go wrong with any product from this manufacturer.John GriffithsSpringfield, OR
