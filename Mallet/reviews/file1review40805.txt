review/text: In the winter months I usually avoid shaving my legs, but it's hard to avoid in summer. Shaving is usually a big production for me, as even in summer I only shave when I need to (for wearing a bathing suit etc), and the hair on my legs is quite coarse and long.The Intuition was half-off in my local supermarket, so I decided to give it a try. I doubt I would have bought it in the first place if it had not been on sale, as it is expensive compared to other razorsPros- For women who don't like shaving because of the time and mess, the convenience is great. With the Intutition it's easy to do quick touch ups.- I found the shave just as close as any shave I've ever had using a regular razor and foam.- I have sensitive skin, but the skin conditioning solid didn't give me any problems, and the shave was mostly nick-free.- Reduces mess in the bathroom.Cons- Expensive. You won't save money despite the fact that you don't have to buy shaving foam. In fact you'll probably spend more.- It's difficult to rinse the hairs out of the blade without melting away the skin conditioning solid. Because of this it's not a good choice for longer hair.- The solid melts away long before the blade has become too blunt to use, which adds a lot to the cost.- Can be hard to see where you've shaved.- Can be a little awkward to use if you don't have a large shower stall.- Not great for underams/bikini because of the large surface area of the skin conditioning solid.Despite the fact that the cons appear to outweigh the pros, I would recommend the Intutition, but only as a backup to your regular shaving routine. Hanging it in the shower means you can grab it and spend five minutes giving your legs a quick going-over as you need.
