review/text: I actually ordered the NATURAL version of this, not the ARTIFICIALLY flavored one but AMAZON.com sent me the wrong one! I've actually tried most of the ARTIFICIAL flavors by ON before and they are pretty tasty but I have gone NATURAL since and steering away from all those artificial sweeteners now.Anyways, on to the review for the ARTIFICAL strawberry. It tastes nothing like strawberry and it smells like chemicals if you ask me. The only thing I like about it is the color it gives my shakes. The taste is very weird but tolerable since I only bought the 2lb jug. If you're going artificial, stick to vanilla or chocolate!
