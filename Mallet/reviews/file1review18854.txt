review/text: Used to be the best brand name product for cleaning windows. Now, maybe due to environmental laws or cost reducing, this product leaves streaks and makes glass appear foggy and dingy. Try for yourself by cleaning a glass table when it's daylight out. You can see streaks in the glass even with a lint free cloth. Not sure if this is something specific to CA environmental laws but worth looking into.
