review/text: If you have the thick scaly skin and have tried scrubs and all sorts of products you may want to give this a try. Your skin will peel but it does remove the bumps and the appearance of them. The only thing that I can say that has worked better for me is being in the sun after spending the day at the beach with the salt water and sun. However, this is a good product - I took it to my dermatologist and she said she couldn't prescribe anything stronger so I continue to use it to reduce the appearance of the bumps.
