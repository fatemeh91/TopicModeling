review/text: It smells like semen. Tastes like dirty bath water. I've tried everything mentioned here to mix with it. Best thing i've found is Orange Juice and just shoot it down and chase it. DO NOT SMELL IT BEFORE TAKING IT. Seriously. I'm not joking. Smells terrible. Overpowers my protien shakes when I tried to mix it with it. I love the value here but when i'm done with it (I refuse to waste it) i'll probably pay more to get a flavored L-Arginine
