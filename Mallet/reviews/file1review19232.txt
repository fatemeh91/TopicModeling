review/text: As the other reviewer wrote, these pills made me sick to my stomach, almost immediately after taking. I wish I could just throw up (sorry) so I would feel better. My husband has experienced the same effect. Also my stomach felt very jittery, jittery to the point where I was starting to get concerned about it. I wish I could give this product ZERO stars. Carmen Electra you should be ashamed of yourself for promoting such a horrible product. I only hope that this horrible feeling of nausea subsides soon.
