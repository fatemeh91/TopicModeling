review/text: I've had sprains in my front shoulder areas for several months now. It's been taking forever to heal and the pain has just been lingering. I used the Vitamin Shoppe Triple Strength pills for a few months, but they did nothing. This product not only has a higher dosage of all three active ingredients, it absorbs better in liquid form. I noticed a difference after the second day! It definitely helped diminish my pain significantly. Most days, there is no pain. This product is keeping me comfortable as my shoulder injuries slowly heal.
