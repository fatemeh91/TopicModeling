review/text: I searched for a long time for a seat that would fit on my elongated toilet. This one fits perfectly, without any movement once attached; it is very secure. If I hadn't read another review that said it worked well on theirs, I wouldn't have bought this, as the product itself only says it is for any "standard" toilet. If you're wondering HOW IT WORKS: there is a hidden adjustment wheel on the backside of the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer, that adjusts two "paddles" on the underside of the Toilet Trainer to snuggly fit it to any size toilet seat. It takes only seconds to attach and detach as needed; very good idea.
