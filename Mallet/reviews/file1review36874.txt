review/text: I've used this after two knee surgeries that were 6 weeks apart (can't bend my knee enough to put on socks the "regular" way yet). For regular socks, it works like a charm. I had less luck with very long or support hose (as someone else here said, with strong compression socks, it squeezes the opening so much you can't fit your foot in). My other reservation is that the terrycloth that covers the aid unravels after a not-so-long period. Mine is coming apart about 3 months after purchase (I use it everyday, once a day). On the other hand, this thing is under 10 bucks, so ordering a replacement wasn't too painful. A good value overall, as long as you know what to expect.
