review/text: This product did not meet my expectations. It does cut thick hair easily, but it gets hot pretty fast ( Andis cool care did nothing!) and its pretty heavy. This is not a good clipper if your cutting your own hair. I've messed up many hair cuts using this clipper. i wouldn't recommend this clipper, especially at the price it sells at.
