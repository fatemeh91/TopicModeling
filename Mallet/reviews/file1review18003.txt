review/text: I have never used or had anything like these before but I love them. They are not perfect and sometimes let in a little light around the nose area. Also if you make them bigger by adjusting the velcro, it exposes velcro on the back and could catch on your sheets if you have sheets that catch. Mine don't and are fine. All in all I like them, helps me stay in bed in the morning when the sun is up.
