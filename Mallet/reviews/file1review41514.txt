review/text: Suave Soft Solid was the best deodorant I have ever had and when I found it at Family Dollar I bought all they had and went to several other Family Dollar in my surrounding area and did the same. It has last up til now, I have one left and I use it for travel only..What am I suppose to do!! no other soft solid has come close to keeping me fresh all day long.SC
