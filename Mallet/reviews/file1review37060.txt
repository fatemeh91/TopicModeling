review/text: I've been using the Hummingbird since it came out, and am only on my second unit. I LOVE this! I was someone who detested flossing (my teeth are very tightly packed) and I would avoid it like the plague. I am fairly religious about using my Hummingbird--I only use the pick attachment--and it is easy and quick to use as well as portable. My checkups are a breeze! I also re-use the picks for several days, just rinse them off. I panicked when I was unable to find refills in the stores; I hope this product is never discontinued. For under six dollars I think the value is great!
