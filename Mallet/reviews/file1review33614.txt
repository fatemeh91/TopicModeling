review/text: My family had a waterpik at least 30 years ago. The machine worked great and for a long time--5 kids in the family; still works for all I know. So, now I bought my children their own waterpik and sent one to son in college along with getting myself one. I wish that I had thought of it a long time ago!! So now we are following Dr. Prices research to save out teeth from the inside out and using waterpik to work from the outside in, including our gums.Waterpiks are great to have. If you buy extra tools, be sure to include the Orthodontic tip. It isn't just for braces--though it's great for that, too. **Be sure that the tip you are looking for is for the model you choose, as not all waterpiks tools are interchangeable--Which is the one thing I would change with this company.
