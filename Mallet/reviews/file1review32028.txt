review/text: As an endurance athlete (triathlons and marathons), I find it very difficult to digest the recommended 5 cups of veggies a day. With this powder, I've found the solution. I have energy galore and have frankly become habituated to it. Every morning I mix a scoop of Perfect Food Super Greens with a scoop of whey protein and 2 teaspoons of flaxseed oil. And I'm ready for my morning.
