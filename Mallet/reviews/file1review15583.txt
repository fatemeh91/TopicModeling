review/text: After using this deodorant for about a month now I am amazed at the longevity of Lavilin in stopping odor. One particular application lasted for over 5 days and could probably have lasted longer. I am a person who used regular deodorant and had to apply maybe two to three times per day. Another one of my concerns was not getting yet another synthetically chemical infested deodorant. I have terrible allergic reactions to the dyes and what not in normal products. This was really a lifesaver for me. The only real qualm I have with the product is the price per ounce. It comes in at over $20 per ounce (that is more than the price of silver) and you only get 0.44 ounces. Mine only lasted a month without any real strenuous physical activity. And even if it lasts 2 months it would still be double the price of a stick of regular deodorant. My real problem with the deodorant is you can't find it at regular stores. I'm not going to buy a month's worth of deodorant and pay $5 in shipping costs everytime I run out of the miniscule amount that is given.
