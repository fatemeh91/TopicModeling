review/text: First of all, I usually love Now Foods products, and there are not too many foods or supplements that I will not eat if they are good for you, but this stuff taste like pure dirt - actually worse! It works very well, so I took it for about two weeks, but finally got tired of trying to choke it down.For me, there are better sources of fiber that don't taste so bad.
