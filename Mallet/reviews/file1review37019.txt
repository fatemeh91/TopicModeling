review/text: These condoms are thin and easy to put on, a great combination for your sexual times.But when it comes to sling shot material, my son says they are second to none!The latex is really elastic and he has been able to hit even the furthest window of the neighbor!He also uses them for water balloons, winter hat, backpack, and even for lunch boxes!Simply amazing!
