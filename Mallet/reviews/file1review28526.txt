review/text: You can do your own research into quality of ingredients, nutrition values, etc. But just for taste, this whey protein is undoubtedly the best tasting whey I've ever used. It mixes great, and tastes straight-up like a glass of chocolate milk. This is my favorite brand of protein. It's good stuff, too.
