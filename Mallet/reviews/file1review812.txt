review/text: I recently uncovered my 5-6 year old pair of Oakley 'Why 8' wire-framed sunglasses that I had not seen since I lost a screw holding the earpiece to the lens. I bought another pair of glasses and sent these to the scrap pile thinking that would be the last that I would see of them. I misplaced my newer glasses one day and did not have a backup, only finding my broken pair. I took my old pair of glasses to the Oakley store and they were no help. They told me they could not fix it in store and would have to send it away...sounds like a way to make some more money to me. The guy at the store did advise me that I could probably go to a regular eyeglass store and get them fixed. When he told me this, I realized I should have just fixed them myself from the beginning and looked to Amazon for an eyeglass repair kit with an assortment of screws. I was able to narrow down a few candidates for a replacement screw and simply replaced the missing screw and fixed my $200+ pair of sunglasses. The head of the screw I chose is a bit smaller than the original, but as far as I am concerned it makes no difference.One minor issue: Although I feel like I already got my moneys worth out of this kit and am very happy with it all of the screws arrived mixed up in the container in contrast to the picture depicting well organized screws. It would also help if the screwdriver came magnetized.
