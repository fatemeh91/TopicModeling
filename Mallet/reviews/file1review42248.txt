review/text: Love this product. I just wish the label let you know that with such high amounts of B12, that it can cause nasuea and dizzyness. I was taking a full cap full as the label says to do so and by the second day I noticed I was feeling nasuea and dizzy. I cut back the amount to half to get my body use to the vitamins and its perfect. I think I can work my body to the full cap full, but the first few days and figuring out what was wrong sucked. You can definately feel the energy boost!
