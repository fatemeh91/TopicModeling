review/text: This progesterone cream is a bargain compared to other brands, so I thought I'd give it a try. It is definitely working on balancing my hormones, after 2 weeks of use. The cream soaks into the skin, and does not leave a greasy residue like some creams do. I was sold on the natural ingredients and the very large 3 ounce size.The only downside to the cream is the lavender scent. I don't care for that and wish I could find it without, but I'll use it regardless because it is helping me.
