review/text: I've been taking melatonin for 10+ years as a sleep aid, and have recently discovered that chamomile and other nighttime teas greatly aid the sleep process. However, Yogi is the first tea I've tried that has eliminated the need for additional sleep aid. The flavor is much fuller and rich, making it very enjoyable. The price is cheaper at my local grocer, but it's worth a higher price!
