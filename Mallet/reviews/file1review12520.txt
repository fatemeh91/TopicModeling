review/text: I've been taking this product for a couple years and must say that it get's the job done! I was literally 10lbs lighter after taking the recommended dosage of pills. I like the fact that there are no side effects (other than mild cramping due to compact fecal matter moving out). It made my stomach flatter which was evidence that my intestines were being emptied of waste! The saying that healing starts with the colon is very true. Constipation, headaches, nausea, and skin break outs can be due to dormant fecal matter. I just wish the price would go down a little or regular customers could get a discount. It can become an expense for those who purchase regularly.
