review/text: These teeth trays work great. I just use them to brighten my smile every now and again when I feel like my theeth are looking dull because of all the coffee I drink at the office. I tried to do the heat molding (when you dip them in hot water and shape them to your teeth by biting down in them). It doesn't really work, but for what I'm using them for they fine either way. They were so cheap too! I totally recommend this product if your looking for a simple whitening tray.
