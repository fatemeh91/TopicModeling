review/text: In this price range you would be hard pressed to find a pen costing hundreds more that writes better. It's a beautiful pen and as with all Waterman pens I have yet to own one that had to be returned due to scratching. I own both the black and Ivory and have to tell you everyone falls in love with the Ivory, it's different, it's color is unique and the gold appointments puts it in a class of its own. I still long for the day I can bring myself to purchase the Montblanc Le Grand 149 for $700. LOL, that's a lot of money for a pen.As with any fountain pen it's important to note the longer you write with it the better it performs as the point conforms to your writing technique and remember it's not a good idea to let another use your pen. I've always believed nothing writes as well as a fountain pen and it's a shame we're not permitted at work to use them for legal signatures. Dohhh! If the cartridge that draws the ink should go, simply wrap the threads with plumbers silicone tape and fill the entire barrel up with ink. That worked great with an older Japanese fountain pen, refilling is rare, LOL.Ricky
