review/text: I researched HSOs and became concerned when I read that they are effective at killing candida etc BUT they colonize your digestive system and then stay there forever! There are safer ways to address candida, I believe, with non-colonizing organisms or the kinds of organisms that are normally found in balance in our bodies.
