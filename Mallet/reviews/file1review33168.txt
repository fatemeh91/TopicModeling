review/text: I've taken this product for about three months and have really felt the difference. My sinuses are clearer, my pain less, and overall bodily function appears to be more balanced. Considering I have Fibromyalgia, these changes are a huge help - allowing me to be more active. Be sure to take the full dosage as noted on the bottle. It may seem like a lot of pills to take, but it's worth the effort.
