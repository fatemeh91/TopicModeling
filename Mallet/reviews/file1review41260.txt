review/text: Saw the commercial on TV and decided to buy it. I am amazed how well this works. I have a very bad knee and my doctor advised me to wait awhile for knee surgery; the pain isn't completely gone, but I am much more mobile than I've been for quite some time. I also have several areas of arthritis and that pain goes away completely,almost for a full day. I will never be without it. It is well worth the price!
