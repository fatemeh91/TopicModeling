review/text: Ok, as a woman that has never waxed nor used an epilator before, the first time I used this was one of the most excruciating experiences ever. I bought this to use mainly on my underarms and legs. After using it for the first time, it took soooo long to do and hurt SOOO bad that I seriously considered returning the machine.However, after about a month and half of continued use, I can happily say that I am absolutely in love with this thing. For me, the more I used it the less it hurt and (because I wasn't in such agonizing pain) the faster the process became. I am so pleased with the results that I'm seriously kicking myself for not buying one of these sooner.Other reviewers have complained about the size and shape of the machine, but I actually really like that it's small and compact. I can maneuver it into every nook and cranny and I find it easy enough to handle. I would like a battery/rechargeable option though as working with the chord can be a little annoying - especially if there's no outlet handy.I also LOVE the shaver attachment. It's like getting two products in one, as cheesy as that sounds. I use both at least once every other week, though I can really go 3 weeks or so without needing any major touch ups (which is a small miracle in itself because I couldn't go 3 days without shaving).If you've never used an epilator and you are interested in trying one - just go for it. Word of advice: If you have a very low pain tolerance (i.e. waxing is too much for you), either take aspirin an hour before you use it or stick to shaving. If you're a bit of wimp (like me) this machine requires perseverance and sheer iron will to do it's magic - but it's worth it!!
