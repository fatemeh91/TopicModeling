review/text: My (quite active) son had injured his heel, and for more than a month had great difficulty walking for extended periods, and was not able to particiapate in sports at all. After getting an MRI to confirm there was no fracture or other problem that could be exacerbated by activity, a physical therapist suggested these heel cups. The night he got them, he was able to return to soccer with minimal discomfort.
