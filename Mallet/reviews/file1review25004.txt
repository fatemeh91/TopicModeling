review/text: I was taking ibuprofen daily for knee pain. The MDs have no solution for pain as a result of meniscus tears. They say they no longer do surgery for pain as your only symptom. I tried tons of different things but finally found that usingInflameAway - Celadrin Advanced Joint Health, 150ct Softgelsand this D-Flame in place of the ibuprofen I was taking daily just to cope with pain made life tolerable again. I could take my kids to the park and do the grocery shopping without crying by the time I got home. Controlling inflammation by avoiding too much sugar & bad fats was another piece of the puzzle for me. I'm so glad I found this product and some other solutions. The MDs were no help at all and my quality of life was horrible with that pain. They just blamed it on my weight but sure was difficult for me to lose weight when the pain kept me on the couch for 3 years.
