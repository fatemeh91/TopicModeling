review/text: Tiger's Milk Bars bring back happy childhood memories. Instead of chocolate, they have carob. It's a delicious mix of carob, peanut butter, etc. Tiger's Milk Bars are an all-natural boost. They're richer than the average candy bar. They're a great pick-me-up. And,of course,they're sweet,nutritious and delicious! Tastes good... and good for you too!
