review/text: I bought this because Dr. Oz said that it really works . I was very shocked because it has 27% alcohol. It really tastes like alcohol, my husband can not use it for he is a recovering alcoholic. I have had thought of getting it tested up at my police station wondering if I would pass a breathalyzer test. Like I said I am really shocked. I plan on writing to Dr. Oz for I have believed in every product he has promoted.
