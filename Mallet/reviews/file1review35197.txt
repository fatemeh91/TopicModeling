review/text: After having hip replacement surgery, I had to wear anti-embollism hose for 1 month, and I got tired of hand laundering 1 pair every night and then sometimes not having a dry pair if I needed it. I purchased these to have an extra pair but they were completely different from the hospital issued hose; heavier material and uncomfortable, so I have never used them.
