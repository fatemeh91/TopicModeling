review/text: I never owned deoderant before. Then, I started seeing pictures of this new Speed Stick and started feeling incredibly frustrated with my cologne.It literally took longer for me to pour out my cologne, than it did for me to get my new deoderant out of its box and smeared in my armpits! The delivery/packaging system is slick! The use of the plastic container to apply a gelatinous substance is the simplest anti-body-odor-system I have ever encountered. I'm sweating and farting without any lingering odors.It's a small package, so I (finally) have room on my vanity. The graphic designers produced a sharp packinging scheme and since the directions are in large print, I'm never straining my eyes. Best of all, dousing my entire upper body in Stetson used to give me headaches (like migraines) about once a week. Now, I've spent many (probably too many) hours enjoying my new, more discrete scent and I haven't had a headache since buying it!I won't deny that it's pricy, and moving over to another ABOS (anti-body-odor system) can be scary, but Mennen is truly easy, powerful, and stylish. And if you don't want deoderant because of its less manly smell, then you can still use the Mennen to keep the stains out of your shirts but still pour cologne over yourself to let the chicks know your the manliest man in town.
