review/text: I purchased this product based on the overwhelming positive reviews. Maybe my stick was a dud, I don't know but it didn't do anything. My skin had no reaction to this. I read many of the reviews and based on their instructions, I applied it in two different forms. One was direct contact with the stick (though this is kinda hard because it's so big to the area being applied on, creating a smear on healthy skin) and the second was to use a Qtip and break off one of the soft tips and use the stick portion to gather and carefully cover the wart for a more precise application. I then covered it with a band-aid to ensure it didn't smear off or spread to healthy skin. After 24 hours of having it on, I decided to take off the band-aid and see if any reaction had taken place. I was very skeptical because I didn't feel any sting or burning sensation as with the other products which contain far less acid than this stick advertises to contain. I peeled off the band-aid and it was the same. It was like I had applied chapstick to myself and that's it. I'm very disappointed in this product because of the rating here and the advertised higher concentration of acid. I'll go back to the other known brand that contains far less acid but at least it appears to do something than just lubricate my skin.Save yourself the money and get something else.
