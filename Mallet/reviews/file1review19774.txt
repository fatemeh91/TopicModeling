review/text: In a move of overzealous anticipation which has become common for me, I bought both this toilet trainer seat and the Bjorn stand alone potty for my daughter when she was 18 months old. Obviously she didn't do much with either, but she liked to sit on the stand alone potty and pretend she was going, or put her stuffed animals on it to make them pee. Fast forward to about a week ago, she just turned 2 in August, and she uses this toilet trainer all the time. For some reason she will not use the stand alone at all. As others have mentioned, she can place it on the toilet herself, which she really enjoys, and even helps me wipe it off after using. Even with a girl, she has managed to pee over the splash guard twice so far, but it is really a small price to pay for how clean and convenient this seat is. Partially it is because she is so fascinated with seeing what is going on that she leans back and the pee goes out, so it is not actually a flaw in design. I love that it fits in my (formerly) diaper bag, so she always has a clean toilet seat, even while travelling. I was skeptical of this seat initially, but bought it anyway based on the reviews, and boy am I glad I had this on hand and ready to go, because when the timing is right, it's right!
