review/text: After using a standard 7 day pill container with the days all in a row, I prefer this one for it's compact shape. The Turtle fits my palm while I access a compartment with the other. The two end compartments are larger than standard and the side ones only slightly smaller than standard ones. It seems well made with positive latching on the covers.
