review/text: I had never heard of melatonin or its uses until my daughter's doctor recommended it. She is mentally disabled and has always been unable to put herself to sleep. She is now 13 and he recommended this, saying it is the only sleep aid that has been studied extensively and shown to work. We give it to her 30 minutes ahead of putting her to bed and she falls asleep within 20 minutes with no complaint!! It does not keep her asleep - she will still wake up in the early morning hours, but at least she is abe to fall asleep. No side effects or lasting grogginess. I gave to my husband after travelling across the country through time zones as my reading said that it also helps with jetlag. He said it did wonders and he will use for travel regularly.
