review/text: I use wellness formula (in combination with Mebdeverine, a prescribed anti-spasmodic for pain relief) when I have a bout of diverticulitis which I get quite acutely maybe once or twice a year. It gets me through the bout in 3 or 4 days without recourse to the heavy antibiotics which the GP was prescribing, and which sometimes even needed a second prescription.I think its wonderful. I now use it to help get over any small illness.
