review/text: Bought a high flyer ekec sgaver, based on CR's recommendations. Not so good. Still have my "original" Norelco and replaced the heads with these. Somehow, I think that the quality might be as good as before? (Must be me?) Though an older model shaver, these were the heads for it? Hmmmm!
