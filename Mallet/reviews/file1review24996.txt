review/text: I started Fertilaid on Oct 4, my period came on exactly Oct 7 which was 26 days, my normal cycle runs 27 days but before my surgery was running from 22-27 days a very big gap, so I thought this was perfect. I had no pain or discomfort with this cycle. In fact my cycle has been very medium/light and I am normally heavy/clotty so I know it's working. I also have to add that I had a laparoscopy performed on Sept 29 and the Dr. said that my first cycle would be very heavy due to all the stage two endo and scar tissue/cyst removed. The Dr. also left a small fibroid, so even with a small fibroid my cycle is the best I have had in years!!! This stuff is amazing, I haven't gotten pregnant yet but will update when I do.
