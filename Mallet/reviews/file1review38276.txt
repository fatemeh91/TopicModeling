review/text: I've taken different vitamins throughout my life, but never really understood why some might be better than others. When a friend's nutritionist recommended the Source Naturals brand to him, I thought I'd give these a try. I noticed a big difference in my energy level and overall well-being right from day 1. It appears that these nutrients are derived from natural sources, which is much better than a synthetic vitamin. I will keep taking these and report back with an update down the road (this is only my first week on them). Note: the instructions say you can take 3-6 vitamins per day. I only take 3.
