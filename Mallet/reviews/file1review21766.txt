review/text: I'm a huge fan of New Chapter multi's, but no multi has the calcium a woman needs, so I picked up their calcium to supplement my multivit.I've had all kinds of calcium - chewable, jarrow-dophilus which taste seriously like cows (you think I'm kidding!), cheapies, and these. With most calcium, I felt some difference and had faith that my calcium was being absorbed, but I've definitely experienced a boost since taking these.For one - no PMS! The only sign I have that my period's coming is a slightly tired-muscle sensation in the spot where I used to get nasty cramps. It's hard to believe that it is so much better than my other calcium pills, but it is for PMS symptoms. With other calcium pills I took, I definitely experienced worse PMS if I skipped them, but with these, it's like there just hasn't been any PMS or cramps.Seriously, I don't know if I'm experiencing something unusual with these pills, but if you have awful cramps, I'd really recommend giving this brand a try. I've been taking mine daily for about four months now with great results.Only bad thing is you have to take three every day, and they aren't all that small either. The texture is a bit rough too, so they're harder to swallow than many pills which have a coating to make them go down easier. But I take a lot of supplements so it's not a problem for me.
