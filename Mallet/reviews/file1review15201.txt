review/text: I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, "unnatural," or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.Given all the chemicals listed below, it came as a great surprise that this is a DELICIOUS snack, certainly one of the best of the many I've tried. No strange aftertaste, and real hints of honey (the peanut is a little harder to discern). The texture is soft but with some heft, and, on entry one senses honey, sugar, a hint of peanut and oil, and a vague spicy background. IT's excellent, and not as sweet as the similar but too-sugary (for my taste) yoghurt honey peanut flavor.My only complaints (and this comes from the head, not the taste, Bud) are the plethora of vitamin and mineral additives (just a personal preference there), and the 3.5 grams of saturated fat, and 17 grams of sugar. However, this is within the range, I believe, of most of these products.On the positive side, you get 14 grams of sugar, and high percentage of the recommended daily values of a range of vitamins and minerals. Have one of these with a 2-3 lasses of water and you will feel full. Also great as a post work-out pick-me-up. Of course, please consult your health care provider for specific recommendations for your personal use.I'm not sure how they did it, but Balance has set a new bar (pun intended) for taste!INGREDIENTS:Protein Blend - Soy Protein Isolate, Calcium Caseinate, Whey Protein Concentrate, Whey.ADDED VITAMINS and MINERALSAscorbic Acid, Calcium Phosphate, Alpha-Tocopherol Acetate, Magnesium Oxide, Beta Carotene, Niacinamide, Ferric Orthophosphate, Zinc Oxide, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Gluconate, Calcium Pantothenate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Biotin, Potassium Iodide, Chromium Chloride, Sodium Selenite, Sodium Molybdate, Vitamin D and Vitamin B12.NUTRITIONAL INFORMATIONServing size, 1 Bar (50 g); servings per container, 15 Calories: 200 Calories from Fat: 50 Total Fat: 6g, 9% Saturated Fat: 3.5g, 18% Cholesterol: &lt;5mg, 1% Sodium: 220mg, 9% Potassium: 115mg, 3% Total Carbohydrate: 22g, 7% Dietary fiber: 1g, 4% Sugars: 17g Protein: 14g, 28% Vitamin A : 50% Vitamin C : 100% Vitamin D : 20% Vitamin E : 100% Thiamin (B1) : 40% Riboflavin (B2) : 30% Niacin (B3) : 45% Vitamin B6 : 30% Folate,Folic Acid,Folacin : 20% Vitamin B12 : 20% Biotin : 20% Pantothenic acid : 20% Calcium : 10% Iron : 20% Phosphorus : 10% Iodine : 30% Magnesium : 10% Zinc : 20% Selenium : 15% Copper : 30% Manganese : 50% Chromium : 10% Molybdenum : 10%
