review/text: These covers are OK, but they're a pretty snug fig for my toothbrush. That means I have to shove the brush in, and I worry about that. I wish they still made the covers that had a hinged top. They fit much better.However, this is better than having the toothbrush exposed to my cat, who likes to sniff it and rub up against it. Ugh!
