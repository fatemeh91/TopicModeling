review/text: YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM! Ingredients read like a virtual pharmacy of good for you stuff. Great company too! I heard Tori speak about it and was very very impressed. Chocolate is my favorite. Very chocolatey, nice texture, not overly sweet. Tastes like real chocolate, not that waxy mass market stuff.
