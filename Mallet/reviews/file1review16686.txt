review/text: Genuin zippo lighters are great and last really well along with being easy to use and constructed well.Zippo lighters come with a wick and flint already installed no matter what type you buy but no zippo will ever be pre filled as it is unsafe.The refill flints, wicks and fuel are readily available from many sources and using genuine zippo products help to ensure the lighter last and keep clean.The price of genuine zippo lighters vairys depending on the outside shell but basic silver plain types like this are an average price though they can be found cheaper.Genuin zippo lighters are stamped on the base and ther are many generic products out there but if you use genuine zippo products you shouldnt be dissapointed with the quantity.The working parts as in the pull out insert part are lfetime gauranteed along with at times the hinges however the case say if it is scratched up is not covered at all.
