review/text: Your results my differ, of course. I have used the original flavor Ricola cough drops for several years, and the sugar-free version seems to do just as well. I am allergic to a variety of pollens, molds, and house dust. One of my most annoying symptoms is an itching at the back of my soft palate. I was surprised to find that these Ricola drops stop that itch, which antihistamine pills seem not to touch. So I use the Ricola for this allergy symptom far more often that for cough.
