review/text: This prenatal vitamin gives me energy and it doesn't upset my stomach at all! I would recommend it to anyone that has trouble with nausea after taking a vitamin. I am not even trying to get pregnant yet but wanted to build up all my reserves beforehand and I plan to take this vitamin long after I get pregnant and deliver.
