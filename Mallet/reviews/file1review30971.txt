review/text: I have been using this product for about a month now, and can honestly say it works. I was having very bad pain in my right knee, some thing that would occur from time to time, but this time it got really bad. I was told by my doctor to try this, I figured it was just another waste of money, but it was not. After about a week I could really tell a difference and could not believe how much better my knee felt. I golf a lot and that was what started the pain, know I have been golfing pain free. It's not often I find some thing like this that actually works, but for me it really helped. I think it is worth trying for sure if you suffer from joint pain.
