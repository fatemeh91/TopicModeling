review/text: My Eyesight Background Info: For the first 2/3 of my life my eyesight was better than 20/20 and in the last 5 years that I have been constantly in front of computer screens (related or not) I have had a Highly notable degradation in my eyesight. Reading the ticker-tape on a high def tv from 15' away is now not possible.My Experience With the Product: I have been consistently using this product (a 60 day supply) for about 15 days. I have also been eating a whole, organic carrot per day. In addition, I have been more conscious of doing small, short eye exercises. My Long range vision has not yet improved, but the short range focusing exercise is becoming easier to complete.My Theory: there is no magic pill, but it certainly seems the natural ingredients in this product are designed to give my eyes the best chance they can have. I HIGHLY value my eyesight and therefore this seems like a very small price to pay if it helps either maintain my eye health (which i believe it does) or in a best cast scenario, actually improve it.Personal Tip: the instructions say to dissolve 1 pill under your tongue, every other day (30 pills = 60 days) unless you're over a certain age (i think 65) then you do half of that. Although I'm not claiming to know more than the designers of this supplement, instead of taking a whole pill every other day, I feel there is value in consistency and take a half pill Every day (still makes 30 pills last 60 days).
