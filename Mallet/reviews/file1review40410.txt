review/text: I'm lactose intolerant and was resigned to drinking only the fruit soy flavors of the Slim Fast shakes. I found these chocolate soy shake, and I love them!! They're great!! I haven't tried the regular chocolate ones, so I can't compare them, but these are the best soy shakes that I've ever had!!
