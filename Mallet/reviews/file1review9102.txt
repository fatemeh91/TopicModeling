review/text: After reading reviews of this product, I decided to purchase it - although I ended up buying it at the grocery store. I definitely notice a boost in my energy level a short while after drinking it. I mix it with 8 oz. of cold water and I admit the appearance is alarming - it's dark green and looks thick. Also it smells very...green. However, I don't find the flavor as off-putting as, say, wheatgrass juice. I just chug it down and make sure I have some water nearby to chase it - although like I said, I don't mind the taste. This morning I mixed it with a tsp. of Maca powder and it seemed it made the taste more mild. Could be my imagination, maybe I'm just used to it now. Anyway, I know this stuff is expensive but it has so much going for it as far as healthy ingredients and nutrients that I will definitely order more through Amazon in the future. I keep mine in my freezer because that's what it recommends as being the optimal storage area due to the probiotics.
