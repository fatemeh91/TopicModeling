review/text: Epilators are designed almost exclusively for the person with dark coarse haired. The effects are useless on fine hair because they break the hair in half rather than pull our the shaft below the surface.This one works, does take 2-3 times for the complete job. Now am feeling for hair and finding none. I do not need the shaver afterwards because it is excellent!
