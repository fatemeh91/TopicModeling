review/text: It seems Optimum Nutrition (ON) has fixed its prices across all vendors at $52.99 for 5 lbs. So now you can't even shop around for it. I know all protein has gone up in price do the fact that big food companies are now in the market to add this protein to their products. I must concede ON, probably has the best pure protein on the market. However, their higher prices has forced me into shopping other brands. ON is 79% protein per serving, the highest of any I have calculated. But others come in at 74% and 73%. That's only about 7% more protein for about 20% more in price. It's just not worth it to me. I wish they would at least get back into the subscription program. That would get me back on board 100%.
