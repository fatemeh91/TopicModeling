review/text: ok, so I'm not going to bash, these are my first protein bars, ever, so I have nothing to compare it to. I was expecting the worse and I was pleasantly surprised. I will say that are are filling, and give me the protein I'd want from a health food bar. The chocolate taste: haven't quite put my finger on it. initially I thought raspberry or even acai...but now I'm thinking it's probably the flax seeds? it's not bad, it's just not a milk chocolate taste, that some of these other reviewers are claiming could rival candy bars. I didn't encounter an aftertaste others have described. It is dense, but is that bad or good for health bars? beats me. I just couldn't imagine having coffee or tea with these. Way too rich to be accompanied with anything other than water, maybe milk. I will definitely finish this box as I find at 3pm they are really helpful.
