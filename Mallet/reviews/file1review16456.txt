review/text: The lavender scent is very mild and actually probably does a better job with my skin and natural body essence than the Apricot scent. I actually don't get the white residue like I did after taking a shower using the Apricot product. I never get skin peeling with either brand. Enjoy knowing this is aluminum free. I must say though, the scent is very mild - I can hardly smell it on me which is a good thing (would mean more chemicals and that defeats the purpose of this product). With the Apricot I think looking back I smelled the natural body odor much quicker in the day than in using the Lavender. Keep in mind I'm a stay at home mom. My day is at home keeping house, changing diapers, dishes, laundry, taking kids to and from school, grocery shopping, homework, breakfast, lunch, dinner. I'm active but not doing marathons. Hope my review helps you.
