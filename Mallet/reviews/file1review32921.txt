review/text: I'm normally the type of person who visits the bathroom for a bowel movement once per day, regularly, every single day. When I suddenly developed constipation (for the first time in my entire life), I was only going once every three to four days, for about three weeks. It seriously worried me. I tried a few things that only kind-of worked. Finally, I threw my hands up and decided that I'd take care of it with a laxative... my first time ever using one. After ruling out several other laxatives, I finally decided on this tea.The taste is... interesting. When you first take the teabag out, you may notice that it smells strongly of licorice. It definitely tastes like licorice, but if you sweeten it up, it tastes more like a nice Christmassy tea. It's tolerable for sure. The box says to steep for 10-15 minutes, but I let mine sit for about 7-8, having read that some people experienced cramps the longer they steeped theirs. (I experienced not even the faintest hint of a cramp, so the next time I use this, I may let it steep longer.)The shorter steeping time still works, although it may not work quite as quickly as the longer steeping times. I drank it around 3:30pm and it began working around 8:30am the next morning, with its largest effect arriving at 2:45pm that day. I feel a MILLION percent better right now. No word yet on if it helps keep the constipation from occurring again -- I've only just tried it a day or two ago.All in all, I'm super pleased with its effect. This is a great first laxative for someone who's never had to use one before, and it's certainly more pleasant (in my opinion) than pills or powdery drink additives. My stomach feels so much better, and this tea was gentle enough that I can see myself using it again should a similar situation arise.
