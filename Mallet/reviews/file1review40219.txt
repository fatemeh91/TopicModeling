review/text: The flavor of the toothpaste was refreshing and not too overpowering. I haven't noticed any difference in my teeth as far as the whitening goes. Maybe it takes more than a week to notice the difference. Overall, I preferred this toothpaste to the brand that I currently use, regardless of its whitening ability. It has a better flavor and it leaves my mouth feeling clean all day long.
