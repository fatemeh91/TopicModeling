review/text: I have gotten lots of compliments on this pacifier holder, but in the beginning it shed fuzz all over my baby's hands, which of course ended up in her mouth. It has since ceased shedding, which is good because it ends up in her mouth as often as the pacifier. It is very easy to clip onto anything and to change out pacifiers without unclipping it.
