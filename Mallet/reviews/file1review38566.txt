review/text: I've had one of the 'single' food stretchers for many years and always regretted not getting the double. Recently I've had trouble with plantar fasciitis and decided to get the double to make treating the condition easier and more efficient, so that I would actually do it. This stretcher doesn't look like much, but it's actually very smart and effective. As soon as I started using it every day, along with a few other therapeutic techniques to stimulate blood flow, I felt a distinct lessening of pain. Very slowly and incrementally there has been a continued improvement in my condition. Hope I can get it to heal entirely eventually.
