review/text: For the people who have gotten Whey Protein before, this flavor (Cookies and Cream) is pretty good. Two friends of mine got Vanilla and Strawberry and they both taste pretty bad but they both said they'd rather have my flavor.Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein does the job- I take some with milk a few hours before my workout, a proportioned amount with water afterwards, and a little more before I sleep every night (to prevent long-term catabolism) and I've been steadily gaining weight/muscle mass.This is a great buy and investment. Just be sure to get a good flavor or you'll hate drinking this.
