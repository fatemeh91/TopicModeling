review/text: I love this product! I was so sick of shaving that I decided to give this a try. I have a low pain tolorance and I have to say that it did hurt ALOT the first 2 times. (I admit I had a glass or two of wine before doing it the second time lol) but after that the hair is much finer and since it grows back at different speeds its not as concetraited in one area...which is why it hurts. I use this all the time now. My legs are soooo smooth. I usually do this once a week while watching tv. It actually lasts for 3/4 weeks or so however since hair grows back at different speeds and depending upon how much of the hair was taken out by the root or if it just broke off I like to use it weekly. It doesnt hurt at all now...although I read someone used this on their underarms. I tried it and will NEVER do that again...that was painful!!! the bikini line is less painful than that. This product works great and I'll never go back to shaving!!!
