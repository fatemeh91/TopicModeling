review/text: Oh man, this stuff just doesn't work for personal lubrication. I get like 2 minutes into my personal lubrication and this turns into a sticky nasty mess. I mean, my guy gets to hurtin', my fingers and palm stick to him and he's just not happy like that. Well maybe you like that, and this would be good glue for you, but for my big buddy - he doesn't like stuff stickin' to him.Aww its just thick gooey mess. I mean it might work OK for, well, two person lubrication. But even then, if it's sahara desert already - dang you could get your big guy stuck up in there. It might never come out, well unless you come. But self lubrication, nope. Oh unless you're really quick - then it works great. Me I like a long stroll in the park, check out the scenery, take my time.
