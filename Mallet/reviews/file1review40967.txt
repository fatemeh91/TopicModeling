review/text: For the record, A) I'm a consumer and not paid to write this crap and B) Patches are a LOW DOSE mechanism for drug therapy. 14mg sounds about right for LOW DOSE patch delivery. I would be suspicious of a 500mg patch! If you are 300lbs, perhaps you should consider that your body mass needs a 20:1 tincture or 1000 mg oral dose. Oral meds are not completely absorbed into the bloodstream, the stomach breaks down quite a bit. You may be lucky to receive 14 mg through the stomach after a 500mg dose. Fact is, weight loss has more to do with your mental state and determination to lose than ANYTHING you take. You can take 1000mg of pure Hoodia and still find your way to the bottom of a pint of Ben and Jerry's! It's all mental people. These patches are meant for a person under 200lbs trying to lose that pesky extra 10-20 lbs. It's not a cure for clinical obesity and psychological depression linked to overeating! That's my two cents. If you're a person needing to lose 10-20lbs and are relatively "drug sensitive", this product should work for you--as it has for me. It helped me lose the weight, but it wasn't the only thing that helped!!!!! It just took off the edge of missing that delightful apple fritter every morning. Ya know? (FYI: I gave this product a 5 star rating to try to bring some balance to its unfair 3 star average--not because it's 5 star--nothing's going to be absolutely 5 star)
