review/text: This Zippo is not the most flashy or creative, yes. However it is a great Zippo for someone who has never had one before. It looks great and the "already scratched" look means it wont look bad if you manage to scratch it. I actually dropped it trying to do "Zippo tricks" and the case bent a little bit (dropped on a tile floor) but I sent it in and within 2 weeks my Zippo was back fixed up and it didn't cost me a dime.I highly recommend this!
