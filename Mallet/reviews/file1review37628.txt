review/text: This product was wonderful. I was pleased that the fragrance wasn't overpowering. After using this product for a week, I've decided to switch deodorants. This Secret kept me feeling clean. I didn't smell sweaty and didn't have the awful white messes under my arms. This deodorant went on easy, not messy, and didn't seem to rub off on my clothes. I'd recommend this product to others.
