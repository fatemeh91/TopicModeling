review/text: I'm reviewing this for the product but have not purchased from Amazon. I get this at the department store. I'm a male, have combination, olive tone skin that isn't sensitive or acne prone.This is a very good, basic cleanser that can be used by anyone. I like the packaging and feel that this is appropriate for male or females. However, this is not worth the money. You'd be better off with Purpose Gentle Cleansing for like $5.
