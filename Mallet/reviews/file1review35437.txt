review/text: I have the top of the line Whirlpool dishwasher. It says on the (Summit) instructions to put the Dishwasher Magic upside down in the cutlery rack. Apparently it has a wax plug that melts that dumps magic into your machine. It might work fine if you can get it to stand up upside down in your machine. I just propped it up the best I could on the top rack. The seal did melt and the Magic poured out into my dishwasher. Besides being awkward, I noticed no difference in cleanliness.
