review/text: I bought this stuff to deal with ingrown hair from bikini waxing and I love it. I use it on ingrowns wherever they come up, on zits that need to be dried out (little on a q-tip and dab it on before bed, dries out zits in a snap!). My boyfriend uses it on his razor burn on his neck and head from shaving. Worth the $$ for sure.
