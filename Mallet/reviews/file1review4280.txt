review/text: I would like to say that I have tried them all including electric and about every blade system available and this is by far the best shave in my experience. The Fusion does not irritate my skin nor do I get a razor burn with it as I do other brands since I have very sensitive skin. This blade system is so precise I can even dry shave if it is the first use of the blade when I am in a hurry and that would not be possible with any other razor I have ever used, after the first use the blades do dull a bit and I have to use shaving cream or I can get shave burn. The only con I can think of is that they can be a bit pricey if you buy the singles so I would suggest that you either buy the biggest multi pack available to save the most.Update- still the best but I have found an electric shaver that finally gets close to the smoothness, Norelco 3D 1290.
