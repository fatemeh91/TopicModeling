review/text: I couldn't tell a difference in her pain. It seemed to me that she just calmed down because of the taste, but maybe it was the herbal content. Either way, she was much calmer and actually took a bottle for about a half hour. That's GOLD in my book. Its a major pain in the butt to get the little pellets dissolved. I lived with a roommate from India and all her medicines looked exactly the same, so maybe its marketed to a more global market. Either way, it did a decent job compared to that stupid nasty gel crap. :) Would recommend.
