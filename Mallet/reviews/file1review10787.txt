review/text: I bought this to go with the Wolf window washer mop - it really makes light work of the windows, and with the Wolf extender pole, made doing the second floor a breeze as well. I used no cleaner, just this microfibre mop head and it did a superb job - I finished up with the Wolf squeegee. Highly recommended. I own a lot of Wolf garden tools that I bought when living in Germany - you cannot beat the quality.
