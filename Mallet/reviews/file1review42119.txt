review/text: I love that California Baby is all natural and the smell is great. My main complaint is that it is super pricey for just bubble bath/wash and you have to use a TON just to get any sort of bubbles going in the tub (and this is a modest amount I am talking about). Before I knew it, the bottle was gone in a week and at this price, I just can't afford to use it. If it were just a little bit cheaper or even if you only had to use 1/2 of what you normally would to get some bubbles in the bath, I would most definitely continue to purchase this because I do love that the ingredients are less harmful to my girls.
