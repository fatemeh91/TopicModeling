review/text: I have never gotten morning sickness. But this stuff made me gag the first time I opened the bottle. I took it every day for about 9 weeks, but one day I took it and about an hour later, I felt sick to my stomach. I vomited the stuff up and felt so much better. These pills are large, a weird greenish color and smell bad. Don't get these. Again, this is coming from a pregnant woman who doesn't even get morning sickness! Imagine what it could do to someone who does.
