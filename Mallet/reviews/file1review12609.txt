review/text: This product definitely works. Expect loosed and watery stool, but the results are great. My husband and me both love it. We have used is three times and we love the results. This product is well worth the money and gets results. If you want the REAL CLEANSE, go with this. IT WORKS.I used Earth's Bounty Oxy Colon Cleanse and it is a WASTE OF MONEY. It's cheap and you get what you pay for in that is doesn't work well.
