review/text: This review is for the Sunglass Eyeglass Repair Kit 77pc DELUXE Sold by: JcKringlesI needed some small screws to fix some glasses. I did not expect much to about $8, but I did not think I would get such Cr*P. most of the screws had NO SLOT on the end. this means that there is no way to tighten them. they had inserted a note in the kit"screws w/out slots fit into round end of screwdriver and tighten with friction".NO! NO! NO! it just does not work. first of all, there is NO round end of the screwdriver. 2nd, even if there was, there is just NO WAY you could hope to hold down a completely smooth and rounded end of a very little screw, so it could be tightened. to be fair, some of the screws did have slots, but the longer ones DID NOT. the long ones were the only ones that I needed, so this purchase was a complete waste of time & $. I would never order anything else from this store. if they would sell this, then you can not trust them. they obviously got an order of screws that were defective & are trying to get rid of them. just think about it. NO ONE wants little screws ( or orders them that way) with NO slots.Eyeglass Repair Kit - 1 kit
