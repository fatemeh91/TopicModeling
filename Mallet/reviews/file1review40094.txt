review/text: When I compared prices both locally and on-line, it became clear that this was the most bang for my buck. While a mat can be had for less, the added value of the blocks, the belt and the carrying bag (which if purchased by themselves would be another $20) make this a great combination price. All items were of excellent quality. Now if I can only get my body to achieve the positons.
