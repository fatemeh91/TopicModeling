review/text: Everyone else here is right. This is a crazy good price but tastes totally awful... I was trying to think of the most potent flavor I could think of to mask the taste of this... Cranberry juice. I'm not talking about some watered down, sugarized, cranberry-flavored juice drink. I'm talking 100% pure, unadulterated cranberry juice. You know... The stuff that's so strong you usually can't drink it straight. I put just enough in the glass so that I can swirl the arginine around without it clumping. Then down the hatch. Works great! I recommend Lakewood Cranberry juice. Then you get the additional health benefits of 100% organic, fresh pressed juice...Lakewood PURE Cranberry Juice, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)
