review/text: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PM9EE6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgSince I had weight loss surgery in February, almost anything I try to eat I barf. I'm living on nuts, salad, and "frozen milkshakes" made of powdered whey, powdered milk, Torani sugar-free Syrup, and occasionally lemon juice and sugar-free Tang. Optimum Nutrition 100% whey protein, in double rich chocolate flavor and vanilla flavor, is the whey I use. Without it I fear I would starve. Fortunately it is delicious.
