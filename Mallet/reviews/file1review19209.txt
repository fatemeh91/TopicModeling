review/text: I actually purchaced this product at walgreens by mistake, i meant to buy hydroxycut and since it was right next to it, I thought it was another variety of hydroxycut, "loose weight fast" who can argue with that. I occationally run 3 miles and my weight just goes up and down, I am 5'3 and started at 141 lbs, I am 22...I want to be at 115, I was starting a calorie counting diet and it was so hard to maintain, in 3 days I lost 1 pound...so I purchaced this, and in just 2 days of using it I lost 5 lbs! It's not hat it makes u loose weight, it his gives you so much energy!, the first day of taking it, I ran 6 miles instead of 3 and today is my second day and I ran 9 miles, this is the first time in my life I have ever ran 9 miles and I did cross country in high school, anyway this Deff gives me the push I need to work out and I am in love with it so far! I now weigh 135 and hoping to keep dropping, :) good luck!
