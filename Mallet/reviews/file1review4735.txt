review/text: I was introduced to this product by signing up for the HerbaLife Ultimate Shapeworks plan. Although I am mostly pleased with the other products in this kit, I was shocked when I carefully read the ingredient list (of course, after getting home). The second ingredient listed is sugar in the form of fructose. The protein source is from Soy which the most recent research indicates that soy is not only detrimental to your hormone/endocrine system but mostly importantly that 95% of the worlds Soy is genetically modified. You can purpose non-GM Soy products in health food stores but there is nothing to indicate that the Soy used in this product is not genetically modified. The third ingredient is Corn Bran (another highly genetically modified product). The ingredient list continues to list other fillers and additives. I was prompted to look more closely at the ingredient list after my first shake b/c the shake was WAY TOO SWEET. I am not a hater of carbohydrates but I would prefer to incorporate more complex carbs into my diet vs. simple sugars that affect insulin and blood sugar levels. After much research on internet, I was able to replace this product with a much more heathful alternative (Jay Robb Whey Protein) that uses Whey protein and contains no sugars or fillers. And the taste is much better. Now I can trade off the 26 grams of simple carbs in the Herbalife product with more satisfying complex carbs. Simplly speaking, this company (HerbaLife) started in the 80's and seems to be stuck with the 80's research that Soy is beneficial. Anyone up on current nutrition will know that Soy should be avoided.
