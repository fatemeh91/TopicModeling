review/text: This has been my favorite bathroom aerosol for many years, but Glade appears to have discontinued it in preference for the "new mist" version (I abhor),Glade Aerosol Air Freshener, Hawaiian Breeze, 8 Ounce; ASIN: B0088UY8ES.This product deserves one star deduction because it can produce heavy drops and spurts infrequently. Some cans are worse than others. However, the strong floral notes produced and volume of mist released are very effective in masking odors. I find the fragrance appealing.I give Amazon 2 stars, because some reviews assigned under this product appear to not be about this product and need to be moved to the correct product. If reviewers intended to make comparisons to other products, links are available to tie the two together.
