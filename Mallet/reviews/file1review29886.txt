review/text: I use SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream before bedtime on my IPN prickly pain ridden hands since the RX pain medicines diminish before morning and it extends pain relief to the time I take my AM RX medications. It helps me get to sleep and stay asleep except for bathroom breaks.There hasn't been much significant medical research (even to help control the pain)to help the millions of americans who have IPN. The use of SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream is only the result of my own efforts to find something to reduce the pain and help me sleep.I also used it when I had similar IPN pain in my lower legs and feet until the pain disappeared and my lower legs and feet went numb.
