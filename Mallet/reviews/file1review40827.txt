review/text: Once I saw the commercials for it I was determined to try it and man was I loving it. I hate shaving! When I use to shave with my Venus and shaving cream I always come out missing a certain spots (mostly the knee area) or sometimes I just get in my lazy mode and decide not to shave my legs for the next day which means no skirt for me. But, the intuition let's me save time because it's easy to shave all you need is a bit of water and your set it totally beats dry shaving! Now on when I wake up and decide last minute I want to wear a skirt I don't have to worry about having to shave my legs the night before because now it takes me less than 5 minutes to do it in the morning and I love it! Trust me I have timed myself with five people in my house and one bathroom I have to limit my time!
