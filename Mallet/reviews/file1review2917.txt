review/text: We have used this Celadrin product for quite some time and do notice a difference when we run out. We use it to ease disc, knee and arthritis problems. We find many Natural Factors products to be effective and since it's made in Canada, with their much higher nutritional manufacturing standards, we feel safer using it. We like the softgel form and find it easy to swallow. We will continue to use this Celadrin product.
