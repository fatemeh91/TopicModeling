review/text: This is one of the few nutrition bars that my whole family likes, including my 13 year old son. We don't let him have 'real' candy bars often, but he eats one of these Cookie Dough bars daily and is quite happy, while we know that he's getting lots of nutrition from it. Probably the best flavor from Balance Bars.
