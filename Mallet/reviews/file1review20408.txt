review/text: They sent me their "soft" version first and I gave it a one star rating because there was absolutely no support for my 165 lbs weight. Well actually less because my legs are being supported by the chair and the floor. Their soft version just collapses.BUT! BUT! They sent me the correct one and what a world of difference this makes. First of all, their FIRM cushion is much better in construction quality and material. I can take this firm version and sit on a hard surface (not an office chair) and the support is there. I have 2 different types of office chairs - a 25 year old soft cushioned seat and a new one with a fairly hard seat - both were killing my lower back and tailbone and they are not cheap office chairs. This does NOT solve my lower back problems - a proper posture and exercise will do that, but this firmer cushion DOES lift my tailbone off my seat. I can see this lasting for a couple of years and I will buy this item again. It's worth it for my tailbone.Oh, and btw - kudos on their support and RMA process. Excellent customer support.
