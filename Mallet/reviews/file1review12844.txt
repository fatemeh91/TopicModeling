review/text: This mask is marketed for sinus pain but I've found it works great as a sleep mask too. I like the weight and cool feeling on my eyes. It helps with sinus pressure/pain, headaches, and eye puffiness. From others' reviews, it is true, the cold does wear off after about 30 minutes but it does stay relatively cool. Anyway, I'm usually asleep by the time it wears off. I have owned sleep masks that contained plastic that made my face sweat or made annoying "crunchy" sound when I roll over, but this one doesn't do that. Even when I forget to put it in the freezer, it has a nice cool feel on my face. I like the fabric of the mask too, it is soft and smooth. This mask is a little bit smaller than the picture depicts. The strap is okay, it is stretchy with a velcro closure. Sometimes it slips off during the night. I would prefer it have two straps like the sleep masks I've owned before. But it is not marketed as a sleep mask, so I understand it not having double straps. I bought two as recommended to keep one handy in the freezer. I haven't tried it in the microwave yet. I plan to buy more as gifts!
