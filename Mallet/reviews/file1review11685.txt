review/text: I have been taking this product for years for regularity issues. This works with no cramping. I take 1/2tsp at night before bed with a little warm water. It works better on an empty stomach. You must adjust to your own needs. I take it three or four times a week. Senna and some of the other herbs can have a somewhat bitter taste so, if you're a "ninny", buy it in capsules.
