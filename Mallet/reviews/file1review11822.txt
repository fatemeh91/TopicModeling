review/text: Great protein powder. Like all protein powders, the flavor takes a day or two to get used to, but after that, it's terrific. It's not oversweet and it makes milk (or, I presume, water) thick and creamy. The flavor is pretty good as well, so I'd recommend this to anyone without reservations.
