review/text: These are great! I hadn't held out hope before I got them. I had ordered the larger pair of Tweezerman Tweezers and they literally wouldn't connect at the tip to even pull a single hair, so I figured these wouldn't be any better. However, when these arrived, they are GREAT. I must have gotten a bad pair with the other ones.
