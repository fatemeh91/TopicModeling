review/text: Natures Way is a great company and cordyceps is the one of the best supplements I've found. It changed my typing speed and accuracy noticeably. It makes your brain more fluid. Everything you do from typing to trying to remember the name of something, comes much more easily. Not many supplements are so noticeably effective, rhodiola being another.
