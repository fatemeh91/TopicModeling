review/text: First off I am not a fan of Wahl products. I find them cheaply made. Apparently they have different grades of products. This one seems to be of better quality. I live very close to Wahl headquarters. I hope they can improve the quality of some items and compete with cheaper China made products. Our politicians have created a bad situation in the name of redistributing wealth. Taking for those that produce and give it to those that don't. It doesn't make us competitive in a gloabal economy.
