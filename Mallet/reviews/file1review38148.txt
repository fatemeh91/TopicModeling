review/text: I really like these; they work a lot better than I had expected. They don't leave any streaks or lint, and they do a great job of cleaning my lenses. They are in individual foil pouches, so they're very convenient to carry. The only thing I would change about them would be to make them just a little bit bigger. They are a little bit too small in my opinion. Other than that, I think they're great, and I would highly recommend them to anyone who wears glasses.
