review/text: We owned a heating pad just like this one for over 15 years. After it broke, I tried to replace it, but no other heating pad has come close to being as good.I was thrilled to find this product on line, after trying several others I'd found in various stores. It is exactly the same one I had before! I love the soft flannel cover, I love that it is large enough to heat my entire back, and I love the moist heat it creates.I will never buy any other type of heating pad, and if this one lasts as long as the other did, I probably won't need to buy one for a very long time!
