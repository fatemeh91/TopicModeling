review/text: I NEEDED SOMETHING TO SOOTHE MY PLANTAR FASCIITIS. I WANTED THE WATER TO STAY HOT AND PERHAPS MASSAGE THE TENDONS & LIGAMENTS BETWEEN THE BALL AND THE HEEL OF MY FOOT. THE WATER STAYS HOT AND THE JETS ARE SOOTHING BUT THE ROLLERS (MASSAGE NODES) SIT TOO LOW. I WOULD NEED ESPECIALLY FLAT FEET TO BENEFIT FROM THE ROLLERS. IF THE ROLLERS WERE HIGHER I WOULD RATE THE UNIT AS 5 STARS. I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL BE PLEASED WITH THIS UNIT.
