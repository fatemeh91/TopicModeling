review/text: BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo, Camelbak, Thermos to name a few). Some are BPA free plastic, some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands). The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles, but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried). The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis. I donated our other ones after receiving this.
