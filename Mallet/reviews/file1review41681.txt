review/text: good speed, but the brush head is oval shaped and larger than the usual oral b (i've been an oral b user for the last several yrs) i'd been using so it was a bit harder to manipulate around the teeth and mouth. plus, the bristles wore down a lot faster too. however, still a good purchase b/c i like that it does clean a bit better than the older models.
