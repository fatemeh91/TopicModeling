review/text: We tried a great many other brands and formulas, and no other brand compares to Pujr Eros. The Origunal Body Glide, a little thicker, and Woman's Bodyglide, a little thinner, are without a doubt the class of this slippery business. These two feel wonderful from both sides, and while you might say they are oily, they neither has a tacky feel. The Original formula, which as I mentioned is the heavier of the two, but feels light and very smooth. Very long lasting. Very satisfying for not being the real thing!I really cannot say enough good things about these lubes. They work great in all environments, and even wet, as long as used before the water.Yes, this stuff is generally considered expensive, but I can only say I wish that we had not wasted our time on all the many other offerings out there. We found none to come close to the lastng comfort and excellent feel of this the black bottle and white bottle Bodyglide formulas.
