review/text: I bought the double box of these and my desire to eat them increased as I went through the box. I quite like the bars now, but I probably would have scored it only 2 stars for the first one I ate. I kept them in the fridge and they made a perfect breakfast or snack before the gym or if I didn't want to sit down to a "real" meal. I like the fact that they are chewy and not too sweet and I feel like I ate something substantial when I am done.
