review/text: I'm a fan of Mrs. Meyer's products and like the fact that you can buy lots of different cleaners in the same scent so you don't have competing fragrances throughout the house. Lemon Verbena is my favorite, and I especially love cleaning my kitchen sink with this Surface Scrub. My whole kitchen smells so fresh and clean when I use it. Of course it's great for the bathroom too.The ingredients are safe, simple, and natural: Calcium carbonate, oxygen bleach, plant-derived surfactants, fragrance, and esential oils of lemongrass, peppermint, clover, geranium, and fir needle. I use this scrub on a daily basis since it's easy on the porcelain sink and then occasionally use a clorox-based scrub for heavy duty stains. People who have septic systems are encouraged to limit their use of chlorine products that kill the necessary bacteria in their systems, so I would have to guess this is a good alternative.These products are sometimes hard to find in the stores, so I'm glad to see that Amazon is carrying them.
