review/text: I am constantly surprised at the differences in the reviews, not as to how many stars the product deserves, but on the objective facts. How, for example, can people differ on something like size, which can be measured. Well, without wasting more words on this, I can only say that I wear a size 13 shoe, and the foot spa was big enough for me. In other words, I didn't have to squeeze my feet in, and my feet didn't touch the sides, or the back or front, when I was using it. What else can I say?Water heating capability is another thing people disagree about. Personally, I was disappointed, even though I gave the unit a head start by filling it with warm to hot water before using it. Even so, it took so long to get the water hot that I thought the heater wasn't working. Finally, though, after fifteen or twenty minutes, I began to notice a rise in temperature. My advice for using this product, then, is to either fill it with hot water or let it work for, say, twenty minutes before climbing in. The first alternative is obviously the better of the two.I just got the unit today, so I haven't completely explored its usage, so I'll just say that it only got three stars from me because of my disappointment with its heating ability.Foot Baths - Heated foot bath
