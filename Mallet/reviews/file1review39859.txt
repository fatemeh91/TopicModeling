review/text: I guess I must have 4 of these around the house, 1 in the car, and they all get used a lot. Not only are they great when you need to pick something up off the floor or reach something up high, but they really make it easier to get dressed if you can't bend your knees or reach your feet. On the negative side, the centers of the rubber cups are pretty fragile plastic and after a few months the cups fall off and can't be screwed on again because of the stripped holes. I did go online and contact the manufacturer and ordered a dozen new rubber cups, which came with extra screws, and now I just put new cups on when that happens. It's cheaper and greener than buying new picker-uppers. I also like being able to fold it and lay it on a surface and not have to worry about knocking it on the floor.
