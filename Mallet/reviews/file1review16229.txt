review/text: Yeey! today I received my package.I received exactly 100 condoms, packaging was nice, I didn't check every single condom, but the expiraton year of those that I checked was 2015.The only disadvantage is I didn't get any Okamoto condoms, most of them are Durex of four types (intense sensation, performax, enhanced pleasure lub and regular one) and about 20% are LifeStyles of two types (extra lubricated and pleasure tipped), but it's OK, I like Durex, never had any accidents with them :).I'm giving four stars, as it is an amazing value - 100 condoms for $20 (shipping was free as there was an option to choose super saver delivery). I'm not giving the fifth star, because the variety is not as large as the description says. Personally I don't care much, but if it says that Okamoto condoms will be in the pack, I think they should be there
