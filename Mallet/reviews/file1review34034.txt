review/text: I have five long hair cats. I have used many products to try and control the hair issue and everything else is just so-so. This product is FANTASTIC at getting pet hair off clothing and furniture. It grabs the lint and hair deep in the fibers and really does a good job. I recommend this to anyone who has an issue with pet hair. I carry one with me all the time now.
