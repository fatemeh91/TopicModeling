review/text: Since i moved to Texas I have had the worst allergies. The doctor prescribed me singulair and veramyst to cure it. Unfortunately, during peak allergy season, these meds aren't enough and I don't want to get on a steroid regimen. I went to an auto show and was sold on putting a teaspoon of this in my juice once a day to cure my allergies.At first i thought i got ripped off. It kinda helped my allergies but cost to effect? It didnt seem to do what i needed. Then it dawned on me. This isn't prescribed meds and my allergies are worse than most. I upped the Dose From 1TSPN to 1TBSN. Now we're cooking with gas... By day 3 it relieved my allergy symptoms by 85% during peak season. 100% during off peak. I get allergies year round in Tx. But peak for me is May to Sept. Now i take Veramyst/Singulair/Elderberry May-thru sept. Oct-thru april just Elderberry. Instead of taking Vera-Sing Daily. I take it every two days. Less prescribed meds and reduced pharma side effects througgh supplementing with a natural remedy. I believe for people with less severe allergies. Take a 1tbspn everyday once a day for 3 to 5 days. Then a tspn daily thereafter. That should keep you in check for normal level allergies. If symptoms start coming back? Add an extra tspn a daytill you find the dose for you. If you need more than a tbsn a day? Maybe you're one of the few this won't work on... Love this product though. TRY IT
