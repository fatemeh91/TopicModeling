review/text: I've yet to find something the Un Skru job opener won't open! Yes, it will put a dent in a cap if you twist really hard, but you get *controlled* openings--no contents going flying as the top screws off. The dent doesn't interfere with closing the lid while you're using up the contents. It's not as though I'll be saving the jars and lids once the jars are empty. I've had no trouble with plastic caps, but you have to remember how strong the device is and gently apply no more pressure than needed.
