review/text: I'm finishing my second bottle. The brain fog and forgetfulness that I had been experiencing has lifted. My memory for smaller things that I used to forget, like where I left my keys, has improved. I don't have a sudden miraculous memory, but just enough improvement to reduce my frustration.
