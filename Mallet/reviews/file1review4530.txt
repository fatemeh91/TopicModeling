review/text: Pros:Handle is weighted well.Very close shave.Less irritation than previous generations, even against grain.Extra blade on back=worth it.Cons:5 blades get gunked up quickly, requiring more passes.Long surface area (of blade) takes some getting used to.Expensive; not compatible with Mach3 system.Update:Down to 2-3 Stars.Used the razor for about two weeks and found that it did not function as well as the Mach3. If you are not an everyday shaver (sometimes I don't shave on the weekends or holiday breaks) you will suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth of growth. Also, I found that I simply wasn't getting as close a shave as I did with the Mach3, even when shaving every day. I agree that there was less irritation, but only slightly so. I do miss the sideburn blade and the heft of the handle, but I'm happy that I returned it and purchased more blades from my Mach 3 Power instead--for me, at least, this wasn't an improvement.
