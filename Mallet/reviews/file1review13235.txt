review/text: These are used on my 12 year old grandsons twin sized bed...I've now had them for well over a year. They are washed every 2 to 4 days (not sure exactly since I purchased 4 of them, and all four are used.I just now measured them and they measure 47and 3/4 inch by 32 and 1/4 inch.So that's how much shrinkage can be expected with a fair amount of washings.* They have only been washed in cold water, I have the hot water valve to my washer turned off.
