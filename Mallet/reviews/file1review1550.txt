review/text: My children have all had issues with warts. We have tried many over the counter wart removers, freezing them off at the doctor, and treatments by a dermatologist. Our dermatologist told us about this product and it is fabulous! I had to search high and low for another tube since we finally went through our original tube. Ifinally found it on Amazon. This is a great product, you won't be disappointed. For best results at bedtime soak affected area in warm water for about 5 minutes, file wart with a nail file, then apply the Wart Stick.
