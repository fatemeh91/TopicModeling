review/text: My 6 year son has frequent nose bleeds. As soon as he starts bleeding, I drop 2 drops in the affected nostril. The bleeding stops within seconds. He will start bleeding after about fifteen minutes in the sun without fail. To prevent that I put one drop in each nostril before heading outside and he does not get a bleed on the days I remember to do that. I have been using this for the last three years. It was the only option after 4 failed cordorizations and I am very satisfied.
