review/text: I have had this razor for a couple of months, not my favorite but gets the job done.I do like that the head is adjustable so I don't have to constantly switched heads when trimming my hair.I mainly use this for my beard, I have used better but for the price I paid I would buy it again.Other Thoughts: It kind of hurts my face because of he hard plastic on the tips of the razor, this defiantly makes me go slower, I like to shave and get it over with.
