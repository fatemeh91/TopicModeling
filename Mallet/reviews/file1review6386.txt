review/text: I have some neuro issues and this tool allows me to handle the issues as soon as they arise instead of simply taking medicine and hoping that the medicine alone is going to help me.I had a slightly more simplistic device, and this one is worlds apart from the old one. I can't say enough positive things about the design and the fact that if I wake up at night, have a spasm attack in the day or some other scenario - it's this tool that I turn to first.Simply put - It's EPIC
