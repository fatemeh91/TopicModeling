review/text: This product has been one of the best 'energy drinks' i've had. It doesn't make you crash like other products out there, and long lasting. I am still not 100% sure about the '7.5% faster reaction time' but I did not buy the product for that 'feature' more on the energy aspect of it. I specially like the fact that each bottle is two servings, so its 48 serving per purchase. Compare that to 5hr energy drink which is approx. $2 per bottle and one serving which is approx. $96, if you take that route.I've talked to some of my friends about this product they didn't like much cause they claim it makes them very jittery, hyper, and, one of them, scared cause their heart were beating fast and they weren't doing anything physical. After asking them a few questions, I realized that they drink the whole bottle i.e. they drank two servings. This goes to show you that you need to be completely aware of what you are ingesting and reading the label may help with that. :P
