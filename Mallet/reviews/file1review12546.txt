review/text: Oxy-Clean is the best colon cleanse product I have ever taken, not that I have taken a ton of them. I have used about 4 other cleansers in the past and none worked as well as this one. For me it did not kick in the first day after trying it was the 2nd day and I ended up staying on it for a week. Nothing over the top or uncontrollable but when you had to go your body knew it.
