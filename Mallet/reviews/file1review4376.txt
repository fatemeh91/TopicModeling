review/text: I love these razors. Glad I can have them shipped to me in timed intervals from Amazon! They work great, no burn, cut great, last a long time, etc, etc, etc. I have no real complaints other than they are pricey. I can make do, because I shave about 2-3 times a week. I am not super harry but I am not exactly a peach either. At this point I can't see any reason to go to another razor. Buy these with Amazon's ship program (where they ship them every so often) and get a discount. Even if you don't plan on getting them all the time, take the discount and then cancel!
