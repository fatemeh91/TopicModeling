review/text: I used the ovulation prediction kit from this company, which worked great. Very clear control and test lines. It was very easy to see when the LH surge occurred. Since the pregnancy tests were so cheap, I tested early (10 DPO), and it seemed like I always got a negative result. On 14 DPO (28 day cycle), when I officially became late I seemed to get another negative result; however, when I came back about 10 min later, there was a very faint positive line. I was not sure what to make of the result, so I figured I will test a couple days later.On day 30, I tried again. After 10 min extremely faint line. I decided to take the same urine sample and buy a First Response test. Within 10 seconds I got a clear distinct positive result.In summary, these tests are a great value and much better to the environment (as no plastic casing). I just wish they were as clear as the ovulation tests or some of the brand name tests. Maybe I was not patient enough to wait for the line.
