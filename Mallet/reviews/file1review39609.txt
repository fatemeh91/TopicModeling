review/text: I have been using Satin Care Shave Gel for years because after using other brands like Skintimate, Aveeno, etc nothing compares. I have VERY sensitive skin. I tend to break out from random dyes and detergents. Typically after using other brands I get red, itchy, break out in hives, and am more prone to nicks. This shaving gel actually seems to hydrate my skin for a more after lotion, smooth feel. Satin Care comes out as a gel but quickly becomes a creamy, thick foam as you spread it. Many other brands I have tried become very thin and run off before you have a chance to shave. Not with Satin Care! It stays on until you shave and really helps act as a buffer to your skin. I use this along with Venus Divine and Embrace Razors and get the best shave I've ever had.
