review/text: I just received these a week ago and I've been eating them ever since. I thought this was suppose to help curb my appetite, but it doesn't! I don't know if it's just me, but once I'm done eating a lollipop I'm hungry for food. I figured maybe it was just the first time, but every other time I ate a lollipop, I would get extremely hungry right after. I will admit it tastes good but it doesn't do what it's claiming. I haven't lost any weight, at all.
