review/text: I was just looking for a lighter to go with the hand warmer I purchased recently from Sundance Catalog and came across this lighter that seemed to fit the bill. It's actually a pretty nice lighter (for the cost). It lights reliably and has a nice double flame. Nice feature that I wasn't aware of: you can remove the odd looking plastic grips to make the lighter look like a nice gun metal zippo (don't get too excited, it's no zippo). Delivery was prompt and it came in a nice little. Overall, very pleased.
