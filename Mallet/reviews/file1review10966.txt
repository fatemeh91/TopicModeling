review/text: My chiropractor first introduced me to this product. There is not one day that I do not suffer from muscular pain. CryoDerm is wonderful. I love this stuff! I buy the spray so I can apply it without having to get it all over my hands. It is also easier to apply than having to rub it in, which requires more use of your muscles than spraying. The relief lasts for a while. There is a smell to the product; but, it's minty so it's not bad to me and well worth the relief. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone!
