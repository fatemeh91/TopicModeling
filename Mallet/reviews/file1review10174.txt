review/text: So I first was given this product by my wife who is a solider along with I and I had always found it very hard to find a product that worked well for my dry chappet lips and also looked well on men. I've tried alot of things and was always picked on by the other soliders at work because the stuff might work but it looks like im wearing a 16 year-old girls lip gloss or it looks like lipstick, but this is not only smooth and light and adds some gloss but works wonders and Best part noone picks on me and I dont have to suffer with dry chappet lips
