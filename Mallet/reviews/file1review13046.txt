review/text: I got this as a replacement for another microwavable neck wrap, one full of beans. The problem with the older product was that it worked really well on the back of the neck but did nothing for the sides unless you held it there. I have a problem with tight muscles in my neck, but the sides are big problem areas for me. I don't feel much pain there, but when the SCM muscles spasm they refer pain, causing headaches. This product fits tightly around the neck and delivers heat to the sides as well as the back, but it cools off quickly. Another reviewer said it only lasted 15 minutes before needing to be reheated; I'd say it is closer to 10.
