review/text: Saw some good and bad reviews on these clippers. I'm 26 and bought my 1set set of Wahl clippers in 2003, they wernt this kind but still a good set of clippers that lasted me until 2010 before they started acting up. Researched these and was caught by the stainless housing and strength of the motor. As soon as I got them I wanted to try them out and i could not be more pleased. some complain about the wieght but i saw no problem with it. Very durable and the cut was excellent and even. One thin i do have to warn is that fresh out the box they come very sharp so be careful with your first couple cuts around the ears. I look forward to using these clippers until they cant go anymore. Best clippers i've owned.
