review/text: I can tell no difference in my foot pain from wearing these insoles. It could just be that they don't work for me. My feet don't hurt less and they don't hurt more. I have tried them while walking on the street, on the treadmill, and on the eliptical. Normally I wouldn't even bother to write a review, I would just chalk it up to another junky product like so much other garbage on the market out there.My main beef is with their customer service people. Of course they barely speak intelligible english but that's par for the course. I have called twice and they have been extremely rude both times. They charged me more than I expected and had calculated for the product and could not give me a decent explanation. They were so rude and spoke right over me and never gave me an opportunity to get a word in edge wise. Honestly, even if the product had worked well, they'd never get business from me again.One piece of advice - "Expedited Shipping" to these people means about two weeks. I don't recommend it.
