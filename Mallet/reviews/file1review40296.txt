review/text: What I was hoping for was something quick, simple, filling, and with a reasonably decent taste. This is not five-star restaurant eating, people, but I don't care. These meals are just what I hoped they would be.The shells-and-cheese meals suit me just fine, and I intend to try other products in this &quot;Hot Meal Options&quot; series. The thing I like about the Slim-Fast plan is its simplicity. I keep several of the shakes in my car and just get a cup of ice at fast food restaurants or a convenience store and then pour my shake over that.The thing I dislike about most snack bars and most diet shakes (including those made by Slim-Fast) is that they are NAUSEATINGLY sweet. Two Slim-Fast shake flavors that I actually like, however, are the orange-pineapple and the apple-cranberry; the rest of them are like drinking liquid candy, and the meal bars/snack bars are even worse.Now with these Hot Meal Options (which can substitute for a shake), I have basically replaced two meals a day with a shake for breakfast and a shake or a meal for lunch. This, combined with a moderate dinner and regular simple exercise (again--nothing too elaborate--just some situps, pushups, etc., maybe three times a week), is actually working for me. I've been losing ca. 1-2 pounds per week steadily over the past two months--even with an occasional small &quot;splurge&quot; or two from time to time. I've gone from 190 lb. to ca. 180 lb over the last 6 to 8 weeks--and it hasn't been torture! The most amazing thing to me is that my appetite has *decreased* over these two months. It's just a matter of getting used to eating less.The problem with most diet plans is that they're too darned complicated or preparation-intensive. The Slim-Fast plan is simple and easy, and it is working well for me. I only wish these hot meals were a little healthier (less sodium, fewer additives, etc.).
