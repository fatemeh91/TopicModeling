review/text: I enjoy Optimum Nutrition products, but I think I'll need to pass on Chocolate Coconut. I enjoyed this flavor the first 10 or so times I drank it. After a while though, it gets pretty gross and you get over the novelty. Extreme Milk Chocolate is definitely the best whey protein flavor, and it's also the most simple tasting -- which is the best way to go in my opinion! I still have about a 1/2 tub of this stuff, so I'll chug it down for now! Will be opting for Milk Chocolate the next go-around.
