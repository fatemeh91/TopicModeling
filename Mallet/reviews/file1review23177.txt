review/text: Got this product to replace our Swiffer carpet thing, for which they no longer make the inserts.I had read in the reviews that people had problems with the handle coming apart, and that to make sure this didn't happen to hammer or bang the handle parts in place. I did just that, except the small plastic cap at the top of the handle split. I wrote Bissell for a replacement, and instead, they sent me an entirely new handle, with a much more robust cap (even has a grip.)Anyway, I am a very happy customer, and the sweeper works well.
