review/text: This is a good toothbrush! It's much better than a manual toothbrush. My Sonicare broke and while I was replacing it I went back to using the Crest spinbrush. It brushed my teeth well. It did not hurt my gums or my sensitive teeth. It stimulates and cleans my gums and gets my whole mouth clean. I make sure and use a good sensitive toothpaste and it works well. My last dental cleaning went well and all I had been using was the spinbrush. I use my rinses and floss daily but I think the spinbrush did most of the work. I wish it had a little timer on it. I have to guess how long to brush. You do have to replace the batteries kind of often and changing the brush heads is kind of difficult.
