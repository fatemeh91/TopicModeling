review/text: Oscillococcinum is the reason I don't get sick. Anytime I feel under the weather or before taking a plane (where getting sick is common), I take a dose right away (I always have some in my purse) and it goes away quite quickly. If I don't take it right away, I need to take a dose every couple of hours and it works too. I LOVE this 100% natural product from France.
