review/text: These are only useful on a Jeanie Rub with posts. The metal on these attachments is flimsy and I worry about them bending, especially the extremity attachment. The trigger point massager is the one I use the most with good results but can be very painful with minimal pressure over unpadded areas. It is especially useful in targeting the piriformis muscle.
