review/text: This is the only Whey product I've used. I purchased it based on the amazon ratings and review comments.It's got a great flavor and mixes well. I usually mix mine with a banana and chocolate (yup, I'm a chocoholic, he he) soy milk. It is creamy which is good. It's not watery, nor like a thick shake, so I say 'creamy'. As I said the whey mixes well, does clump or anything. And, the flavor is good, but not perfect. There is a slight, very slight, after taste which is just a tad bitter. But, as I said, this is the first whey I've ever tried, so all of them may have an after taste.I would buy this again. But, may try vanilla. I tried mixing blueberries and strawberries with the whey and regular lite milk and I could not taste the berries. I can taste the banana with the double chocolate though, so it works for me. I have heard about adding orange juice to it, and that it is great like that, but have yet to try it.
