review/text: Don't recall instructions specifying ( uniformed layman) the yellow tab at end of stick was the primary sensor- but, it became more obvious as the side of bottle gave examples of urine reactions, or, lack of reactions, on a yellow backgkround.There are two ways to get a sample of urine onto the small test strip, per instructions. For men, the easiest way is a ground to air shot ( hopefully,with accuracy).I believe theTest strip produced accurate results. One hour after my use of a test strip the result was confirmed by another test at the Doctor's office.
