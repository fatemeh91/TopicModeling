review/text: My 8 year old Daughter had 2 colds back to back in September, right after she started School. At that time she wasn't on any supplements at all. She's an extremely picky eater and I knew for a fact she was missing a lot of nutrients from her diet, especially Vitamin C. I did some research on various supplements and saw the good reviews with these, so I started her on them around the beginning of October.The verdict-she hasn't had ONE cold since! She started a few times with the sniffles here and there, and I thought, oh no, here comes a cold, but it never turned into anything more than that, and I attribute her better immunity partly to these wonderful vitamins.I also give her supplemental D, Fish Oil, and Multivitamins, so obviously this combination is working well for her. With the flu and cold season in full swing now, I will be continuing with this for the rest of the school year for sure.Worth the money and then some!!
