review/text: This thing pinches what you pinch and tells you how thick it is. it'll work as consistently as you are able to consistently pinch the same amount of skin from yourself in the same area's.your probably not going to use this for day to day measurements as the differences are going to be ridiculously minute and more prone to typical discrepancies between your pinches of skin. whereas a good scale you might track 1/2 a pound here and be more encouraged.i gave it a good review as it does exactly what its suppose to and pretty effectively but i'm not sure about the results. i come up with 5% body fat and maybe i'm just self conscious but that seems a little too good. i would assume i'd be more around 7-10%it really seems a decent well made product but unless you are hardcore fitness junkie i'd just go with one of the scales with the body fat electric current thing and check it in the mornings before food/water. it's more apt to be consistent for you.
