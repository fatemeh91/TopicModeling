review/text: Great drinks for kids. No argument. But Amazon's stocking and pricing of them are horrible! I was able to get them at a fair price... but within a week they went to double that! AWFUL. For an expensive product I really love the idea of being able to do S&S and get them shipped right to my doorstep for at least only as much as the grocery charges, but preferrable less. Who would pay MORE?!
