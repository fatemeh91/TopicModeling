review/text: 1. Eliminates that looping the string around your fingers stuff2. Causes less damage to the gum, because (once you get the hang of it) one can control it better than the floss3. Gets out more gunk than I did with the flossI am not a fan of flossing, but I can do it properly, but it has always been stressful. If you have tight teeth, this gadget takes a bit of experimenting to get it down (seems to work better without wibrating), but it really feels better and seems to clean better. Try it, and take the time to learn to "drive" it. (It is cheap to try.)I rinse the string after every tooth (you will want to), and it is reusable until it breaks or you feel like replacing it.
