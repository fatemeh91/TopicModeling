review/text: I am a grad student with little income and not big on cooking. I do work out regularly but my diet is not the best (I definitely don't get the right amount of fruits and vegetables every day from what I eat). I started taking this product a few months ago (in combination with a protein/vitamin B complex orange flavored syrup and fruit juices -non citrus, plus 3oz of Aloe vera gel)... I've been feeling great, rarely get a cold (if I do it lasts shorter, and my heartburn is gone, that is thanks to the nasty-tasting Aloe I get separately). I do feel you have to take it everyday to feel the benefits (once a day is enough for me). This is definitely NOT a meal replacement for those trying to loose weight. I have tasted other green powder products and this is undoubtedly the best according to my taste buds. (Flavor tip: Adding Juicy Juice Apple/Banana 100% flavored juice complements the powder best.)
