review/text: Many people will probably think this product is magic. It isn't, but it does help. I use it during cutting phases, but I do not take it over a 3 week period. I use it when I want to cut my appetite. What this product does for me is:-Cuts appetite-Increased focus-Increases motivation to work outThis product makes you feel a lot like an adderall would, and I've actually used it to help me complete school work, as well as dieting. Good product, worth the money. Its a lot of pills, but its not even that bad. I recommend this product, but you still have to work out and eat healthy to lose weight. It just makes the diet and exercise process easier.
