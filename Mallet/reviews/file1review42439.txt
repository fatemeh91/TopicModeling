review/text: We have one cat with a very sensitive digestive system. It seems he may have some sort of allergy to poultry. This makes it very tough to buy food that he can tolerate as almost every food out there has chicken of some sort in it. In any event, we finally have him on some foods that his system can handle although he is still prone to loose stools. After doing some research this product seemed to be the logically choice. I am very glad that I gave it a try. It is very easy to add to wet cat food, although the scoop that comes with it is a bit too large. I usually add one teaspoon to one can of food and mix it up. Since using this product, our sensitive cat has had a significant improvement with digestion and rarely suffers from loose stool anymore. I highly recommend this product.
