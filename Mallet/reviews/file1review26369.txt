review/text: Elastikon is a trademark from Johnson & Johnson company and it can only be used to call their specific product. However, what I got from this seller is a box of "Elastiant" from VetOne. This wierd product looks kinda similar to Elastikon but has a very strong, distinctive odor that is very bothering (unlike the real Elastikon).Elastikon from J&J; should receive 5 stars. But in this review I give only one start because what you get is something called Elastiant from VetOne.Don't buy this product. You will be frustrated for sure. I am seeing if I can return my items to the seller for refund.
