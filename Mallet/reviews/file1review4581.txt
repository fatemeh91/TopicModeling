review/text: I have been using the SensorExcel for several years and thought I was happy. I received the Gillette Fusion as a free promo and decided to try it. The initial sensation of having 5 blades scrape across my face was a bit unsettling (I imagined a layer of skin being shaved off) but the results were startling. Very close and comfortable shave -- only the beard was removed, not the skin. Single blade on the reverse side works fine for trimming sideburns and under the nose. I used the first blade for 22 shaves and did not nick myself once. I could only get 6-7 shaves out of a Sensor blade so, for me, the high price for Fusion blades is justified.
