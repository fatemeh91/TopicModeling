review/text: I don't have the biochemistry background to say weather or not this is a superior product. I feel stronger, with a better recovery time, but I am taking several different supplements and vitamins so it would be impossible to isolate the effects of one over the other.What I can tell you is that this is a great tasting supplement. I can't speak for every one of them, but I have the ON Milk Chocolate whey in a two pound canister at home and I have bought the five pound Chocolate Mint flavor off of Amazon here. The milk chocolate is better than average, but the chocolate mint is tasty to the point that I worry about over-indulging in it. I've been mixing it with two percent milk, and it is a creamy and delicious drink that -- and this is important -- blends nicely even in the milk. TheSundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Bluehelps, but I've even spoon-mixed it at home and it worked well.You can find whey at the five pound size for maybe fifteen bucks less, but this is a good price for a good product, as long as you stay away from GNC. They'll try to sell you this for retail.
