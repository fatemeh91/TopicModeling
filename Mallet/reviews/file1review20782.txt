review/text: Of all the electric shaver I have used over the last 20 years or so this is by far the best one. The way the head pivots gets all of the hair usually on the first pass, hard to reach spots on the second. No annoying stubble bits that have been shaved falling out of the head or left on your face. The cleaning system is amazing and works like a champ. Do the math, look at all the razors you would buy if you wanted a great close shave, add up the cost and then you will see that this thing is a steal. Without a doubt the best!
