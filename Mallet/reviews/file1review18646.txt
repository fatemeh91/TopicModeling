review/text: This stuff is like a miracle in a bottle! My son gets chest colds constantly really bad ones. Cause he has asthma and is allergic to everything so mucus always builds up in his chest and he gets severely sick at least 1 or 2 times a month. He started to get a fever again and get sick so i ordered this. it got here right away and he started taking it with high doses of vitamin c and the same day his fever was gone and the mucus started coming up. By the next day he was back to himself. He has started to get sick a couple more times since and i have done the same thing with the same results. I am going to start giving it to him every day whether he's sick or not so he just stays well. I love this stuff! I recommend it highly to any body that has problems fighting off illnesses. it has been a God sent to us and not to mention the money we saved from not having to buy all the over the counter musinex and benedryl and and going to the doctors and antibiotics! Can't say enough good things about this product!!!!!!!!!!!! Love it!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
