review/text: The tips of these things are like SHARP needles, and they are perfect for "isolating ingrown hairs" beneath the skin. Like the other reviewer, I found it difficult at times to pluck hairs using the needle-like tip of the tool.The trick is to use the flat area of the tweezer, located just "before" the tips are tapered into points; from there you can grip the hair well enough to pluck it. It's enough of a hassle that I ordered a pair of Tweezerman's slanted-cut tweezers to do the "heavy lifting" plucking, and will use these for the precision work (that is, isolating the hair or splinter or bullet fragment.)Make certain you keep the clear-plastic tube that covers the tips in the packaging. You will need something to keep from poking things as you retreive or sanitize them. I skewered the tube the first time I tried to use it to cover the tips, so I need to find some kind of alternative sheath for travel.Anyway, I've had them almost a month and I'm very impressed at how well they hold their edge. The packaging material promises Tweezerman will gladly grind (re-sharpen) the tips for free -- you only pay postage. They're replace a broken or "soiled" tool for a flat $5 + postage, FWIW.
