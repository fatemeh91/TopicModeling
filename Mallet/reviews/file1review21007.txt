review/text: I have mild Cerebral Palsy and my muscles just ache most of the time. Just as advertised, 10 minutes on this pad and you are relaxed. The 4 zones are very good for when you lie on your stomach and want to get at your legs, but not your upper body.Very low noise with this product, unlike a foot spa which sounds like you are doing construction in your room.Even though the heat is not adjustable, the temperature is not too hot. It doesn't cause me to sweat.Received product 3 days ahead of shipping estimate. Note, it comes in a large box with lots of packing material to protect the product.
