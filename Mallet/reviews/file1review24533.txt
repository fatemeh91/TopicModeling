review/text: I have conductive hearing loss in both ears. The right ear was corrected through surgery, but the left one was not. I needed something to help me with listening in certain places where sound is intentionally kept subdued - like small discussion groups. This device allows me to hone in on weaker sounds. However, ambient noises can be distracting and confusing.
