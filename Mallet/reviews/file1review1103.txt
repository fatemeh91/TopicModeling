review/text: I have had several different kinds of tendonitis supports, and have settled on this one (so far) as being the best of the group. I like it because it is easy to put on, comfortable to wear, and best of all, it works. The "pressure spot" built into the band must be placed over the affected tendon just in front of the painful spot. The pressure spot creates a new fulcrum for the tendon and allows the damaged portion to rest and heal. I have severe "tennis elbow" and this allows me to function and do things (even play limited tennis) as the tendon heals. It must be tight to be effective, for it must place adequate pressure on the tendon in order to work. I wear an ace bandage beneath the support so that I can cinch the support tighter and not pinch the skin.One universal rule in healing any injury is to stop doing anything that hurts the injured area. Do not try to go through the pain, it will just make the injury worse and set back the healing time. Therefore, if an activity is causing pain, even while wearing the support, stop doing that activity and let time pass to allow for healing. Tendonitis injuries heal very slowly, some taking as long as a year to heal. Be patient, do something else to stay active, but above all, don't irritate the tendon!Thisis a good effective product at an affordable price.kone
