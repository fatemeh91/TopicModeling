review/text: The first time I washed my delicates in the bag, the zipper broke. I found two of my favorite bras (that I hand-washed before I tried this bag) wrapped around the agitator. This bag ruined $80 worth of my clothing.I did not read the one review posted on Amazon and I should have. The one other person that had reviewed this product had the same problem as I did.Do not buy this wash bag!
