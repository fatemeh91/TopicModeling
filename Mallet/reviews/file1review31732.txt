review/text: Doug Ritter knows what he talks about. As a Marine and avid outdoorsman, this is a great, basic kit that should be carried at all times -- and in your vehicle when you are driving. Included are basic items that will help keep you alive and get found. Yes, there are better kits out there, but for the price, conveinence and novice -- this is it.WolfUSMC 85-89
