review/text: I have used this product for several years. I found the old product in the black container to be working very well. When the company changed its packaging, they also must have changed the formula, because ever since I started using the product from the white container, it does not work at all. It spreads easier, but so what? I find it to be useless, ineffective, and a waste of money.
