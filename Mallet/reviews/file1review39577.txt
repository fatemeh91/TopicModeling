review/text: I'd definitely recommend this product. My skin felt so soft and silky after using it. It's much better than plain old soap and water. I ended up with no nicks and my skin didn't dry out. The only problem I had with this product was that too much sprayed out when I first hit the button on top. It took awhile to figure out how to control the amount dispensed.
