review/text: I love these. I actually take a couple when I have heartburn and they taste SO much better than chalky tums. My daughter also loves these. I personally like the fruit flavor better than the chocolate flavor, but they are both good. They are cheap on iherb.com and you can $5 off using the coupon code MOS036.
