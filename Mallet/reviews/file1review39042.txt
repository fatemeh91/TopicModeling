review/text: I was sort of reading mixed reviews on this clipper, so I was nervous about ordering but i'm real glad I did. Some of the poor reviewers were saying that it pulled hair and it hurt and this and that. Well thats a bunch of garbage. I have REALLY thick hair (I'm russian). I didn't have any problem whatsoever with any pain or pulling. It cut very nicely and easily. I only cut my hair once so far so i'll update this after more cuts... but as of now I am VERY satisfied with this clipper!
