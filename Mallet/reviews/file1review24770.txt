review/text: I am a regular user of Speick after shave and shaving cream. I dare say an addict. For a new fix, I ordered and tried the men's shaving stick. As the name implies, it is a stick with a soap-like texture on a plastic base. The shaving stick is wrapped in a very thin and flimsy foil. You wet your shave brush and then brush it over the tip of the shave stick. This creates a lather - a very nice and rich lather that is then applied to the face. I think the lather created from the shaving stick is superior to that of Speick's shaving cream.Being relatively new to this older type of shaving, perhaps I am missing something. It almost seem that this shaving stick is almost like a refill cartridge to a shaving stick dispenser. The foil wrap that it comes with is about worthless. Otherwise, this is a great product.
