review/text: I will only provide facts. My husband and I have been TTC for about 1 1/2 years I am 31 and he is 33. I have PCOS and he has low motility. I had him start taking this product for our IUI since the 1st IUI we had done the doc was able to get about 800k good sperm after the washing. About 3 weeks on this product taking 4 a day as directed on label for a quick start and we went in for our 2nd IUI. Turns out doc was able to get 5.8 million good sperm after washing. I did get my period after the 2nd IUI but as you can see his count went up dramatically from 800k to 5.8 mil. What is also different is he is more sexually active as he wants to constantly want to...you know. He says he feels like a teenager again even gets embarrasing erections while at work (lol so funny) but I can see where this is embarrassing. It's not that bad he just learns to try to control his other guy. This all I can say about this product so far and I have decided to take the womans version but too soon to comment on that one.
