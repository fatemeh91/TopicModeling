review/text: We found this item while on vacation and did not want to place our son in the hotel bathtub! It turned out to be one of the best purchases we've made! I don't think I'd use it for a small infant, but if your child is stable and can sit up on their own, it's the perfect solution when the child is too large for the traditional &quot;infant&quot; tub and not yet ready for the family bathtub. It saves a huge amount of water as well. Our son played in the tub for so long because he felt secure and all his toys stayed within his reach! When you're finished bathing your child, you just hang this tub up to dry out completely and it's ready for next time.Our son was able to use this tub for a very long time. I'd recommend it to anyone with an older child.
