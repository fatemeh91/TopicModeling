review/text: I haven't posted a lot of reviews on Amazon, but I thought this product deserved one. Since I was about 20, I've taken a multivitamin in addition to some prescribed medications, but it was always cumbersome and such a pain to carry them around during the day in bulky, awkward pill cases. A couple months ago, a doctor prescribed me some very large pills, and a single pill wouldn't even fit in my previous pill case. As a result, I searched around on here for a cheap but useful solution and found this product, the Apex Pocket Med Pack, to be the best--and I have not been proven wrong.The packs are large and deep enough to fit all of my pills (even the big ones), with a divider for morning and afternoon. And it's still thin and slender enough to toss in a backpack or bag, or even a front pants pocket, without anyone being able to tell.It's a fantastic product. Probably the only thing that could be improved in the future is to perhaps make the bottom of the individual cases heavier so they don't tilt when you are loading them, but I really haven't had any problems with that. If you need a daily pill case that's easy to use and will fit almost any size of pills, this is the product for you.
