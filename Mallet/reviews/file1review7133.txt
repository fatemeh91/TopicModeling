review/text: Wahl still has a wonderful razor and I prefer it above others. It shave close and comes with 3 different screens to use at your preference of closeness. It's convenient for us on the road as the size isn't bulky and it doesn't have any cumbersome attachments. This is my second Wahl replacing one I had for many years. Love it.
