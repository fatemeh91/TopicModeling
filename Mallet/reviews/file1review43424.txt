review/text: These floral waters actually come in the blue glass spritzer bottle that sometimes is shown on Amazon and sometimes not. I love the whole line! The Rosewater is a great toner and skin conditioner. I love to freshen my hair with the Chamomile floralwater, massage into scalp, and restyle for a fresh soft hairstyle that leaves no residue on my hair! Consistently a great line from a great company.
