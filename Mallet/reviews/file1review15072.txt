review/text: 6 months ago the eye doctor told me that the cataract in my left eye (first diagnosed about 20 years ago) was not operable for several reasons, the main being the high risk of retinal detachment because of my progressive myopia, even though it had begun to cause problems with my vision to the extent that I wanted to do something about it. At that time they refrected me and my vision in that eye was about 20/50 and 20/25 in my right eye (which has the start of a cateract). I started using these drops the same week, two drops twice a day in my left eye since i felt that the only thing I had to lose was money and if they worked (about which I was a bit skeptical) it was the only option I really had.I just returned from the eye doctor and my vision in my left eye has improved to 20/30. This is in 6 months time I was amazed and so was the doctor. His response was "Your eyes are getting younger." He had never heard of N-acetyl carnosine eye drops but said to continue them since the drops appeard to be working. He said that the cataract had not gotten any worse since the last visit.I though that my vision had improved but did not want to review the drops until I had some type of confirmation from the doctor.They really do work! I don't know just how much more improvement I will get (I still have problems with glare and ghost images in my left eye but not as bad) but I will continue to use themas long as I continue to see improvement in my vision!I am also starting them in my right eye to see if that new cateract can be stopped in it's tracks before it gets as bad as the one in my other eye.I do notice that the Brite Eyes III drops do cause occasional stinging but I think that is because I keep them in the refrigerator. If I let then stand and warm up to room temperature they do not sting.
