review/text: I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet, they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower, sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find, but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time, your hands and wrist will feel the difference.
