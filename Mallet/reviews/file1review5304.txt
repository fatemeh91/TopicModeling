review/text: I bought the ginger chews at the market a few months before trying these hard candies, and I was expecting the same potency. The chews really have a burn to them when you eat them. These hard candies are much more mild. I like both, but for something you can actually enjoy for a few minutes, these are great. Wish they were perhaps a LITTLE more potent though.
