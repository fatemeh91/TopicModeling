review/text: One of my screw-on nose pads broke off of my glasses & I couldnt find a kit in any store that had the screw-on nose pads included so I took to Amazon -- and found this great kit.It an awesome little kit that has 4 screw-on nose pads, a screw driver w/both straight & phillips heads on either end, plastic washers, metal nuts, several different types & sizes of screws (with at least 4 of each type/size), & some plastic end caps.Mine is different from the pic as I did not get a carrying cloth with mine & my case is clear with a black tray instead of white.The only things that would make this better would be a case where the cover is flush against the body so the screws, etc dont move around inside & a screw driver with a magnetic tip for dealing w/teeny-tiny screws -- but those 2 things didnt take away from the kit, imo, they just would have *added* to it.I'll post pics of mine.
