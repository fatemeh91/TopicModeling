review/text: All show and no go - that's the best description. It' s just a gimmick. I used it for quite some time to try different techniques and different style blades. Each time it left parts of my head with long stubble, even after repeated swipes. This made for an extra long, extra unproductive shaving session.Then the blood... When it cuts (which it does a lot, especially in the back), it cuts deep - which tends to reopen the next time you shave. I finally had to take time off to heal before retrying this thing - with the same results.I'm doing better with a medium quality dispoable blade, for a lot less money. If you still want one of these - I'll sell you mine . It's sitting in a drawer now....
