review/text: I was rather disappointed with this when I received it. It's not easy to find a red changing pad cover, so I was excited to find this on Amazon. Well, the material is not as soft as I had expected and is somewhat thin. Not that big of a deal. However, what I hate about it is there are two small holes in the center of it for those dumb changing pad straps to fit through. Who actually straps in their baby when changing them? So, now you can see the white changing pad through those two holes and to the average Joe it looks like I have an old ratty changing pad cover that I should replace. Oh well.
