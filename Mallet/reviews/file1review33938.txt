review/text: Acetaminophen is an FDA approved over-the-counter medication that treats mild to moderate pain, making it an acceptable headache reliever, or a medication that treats mild strains, sprains, toothaches, etc. It also acts to reduce fever (antipyretic). It has no anti-inflammatory effect.As with all medications, there are side-effects, although acetaminophen has very few. However, the major side-effect is associated liver damage. Don't take acetaminophen if you have liver disease, such as hepatitis, or have alcohol-related liver disease, or are a heavy drinker. And always (always!) never exceed the maximum daily amount (which is 4 grams/day, or 8 tablets of extra-strength). If you suffer from any sort of liver disorder or have any liver damage, do not use acetaminophen at all. Finally, don't take the maximum dose for days in a row, as you risk liver damage.Acetaminophen is considered safe for all three trimesters for pregnant women.Acetaminophen is packaged in different strengths: Extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet Member's Mark Acetaminophen 500mg/500ct, Standard (325 mg per tablet) (this product), and children's dose of 80 mg Tylenol Children's Acetaminophen (80 mg) for Ages 2-6, Grape Punch Flavor, 30-Count Meltaways (Pack of 6).All in all, acetaminophen is a good product for minor aches and pains.
