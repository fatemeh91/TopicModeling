review/text: I've been powerlifting for over 14 years & have literally tried it all. (well... most that is) Remember when Designer Protein was "In"? Anyway, I purchased this protein along with a handful of others @ a GNC (Yes, GNC... Retail price w/ no Gold Card) without first checking out the reviews. Basically a blind study using myself as the test subject. Out of all the proteins I tested, only ONE stood out from the rest. Being that I wasn't influenced in any way by a salesman, reviews, etc... my observations were not the result of a placebo effect. With ON, I not only maintained my weight but gained weight as well w/ consistent workouts. It did an excellent job of curbing my appetite as well as this has been my breakfast, every morning for close to a year. I recently decided to check out the reviews both online & on Amazon & low & behold, a 5 star average all the way. I'm not the least bit surprised. This is by far the best protein I have ever used.
