review/text: I ordered Garden of Life Omega Zyme for the first time a couple of years ago and since then I have been hooked on these fabulous enzymes. They bring all sorts of enzymes derived from plants which is better. I used to suffer from stomach acidity and all sorts of digestive problems and after taking omega zyme for around three weeks all my digestive problems were gone and I felt a lot better with a lot more energy. Thank You Omega Zyme. I cannot live without you buddy!
