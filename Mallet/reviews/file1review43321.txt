review/text: I have been slowing switching all of my families cleaning products over to Method products. They clean well, have nice, fresh scents instead of choke worthy chemical scents in most "toxic" cleaners, and come in very mod, clean line, eco friendly packaging. Method has made it easy being green.Love the minty fresh smell of the glass cleaner. I've used this product successfully on windows, but it's a great microwave cleaner, and all purpose cleaner as well. It cleaned my old formica table and countertops great. So try it out in other uses for yourself.5 stars.
