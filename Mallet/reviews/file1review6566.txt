review/text: It seems pretty good thus far, it can really get some knots but not others.I was so shocked to see it was shipped unwrapped/padded in a huge manilla envelope! yes a paper envelope! It was mostly out of the package when it came to my house- I was annoyed that it was scratched and dragged along who knows where!The 2nd disappointment is that it is plastic- seems fairly strong, but I expected better quality.
