review/text: I have never left a review on amazon, but I feel very pleased with this product that other people should know because I was skeptical, too, at first.I self-diagnosed my 3 year old male cat with a UTI. He was peeing a few drops in random places (mostly boxes, bags, and once on my covers) and i noticed there was no urine in his litter box.I was freaking out thinking about the hundreds of dollars towards the vet , scans, tests, and prescription medicine that would cause my cat to become more sick. Doing some research online and reading reviews about PetAlive UTI-Free I decided to give it a shot. I followed the instructions on the bottle for about a week and a half and my little boy is all better! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
