review/text: I have used this cleanser for 6 years and it the best i have ever used. I always tried different cleansers but everything always made the skin tight. This cleanser is gentle enough to take off eye makeup with out having to use a seperate eye makeup remover. It has no soap in it so it keeps the skin's PH balance in check and removes impurities w/o disturbing the skin's natural moisture balance. The cleanser also goes a long way, only a pea to dime size for every use. Use every morning and night. Toner and moisturize after every wash. Recommended toner is multi-active toner and active moist. And of course it can be expensive for some, but its worth it. Take care of your skin. You wont regret it.
