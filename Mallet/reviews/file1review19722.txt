review/text: My 20 month old Grandson was afraid to sit on the toilet with the Toilet Trainer. When he did urinate, the urine guard was not high enough & he urinated on the area directly in front of the toilet. I did try to position him right up close to the urine guard & he really didn't like that. He has been using a potty chair at home, so I ended up buying the BabyBjorn potty chair with the high back & he likes this. I think he can tilt forward a bit with the use of his legs on the floor, so this helps with him being able to urinate in the potty chair.
