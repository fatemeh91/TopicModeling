review/text: Love this product as well as their pumpkin peel. I have sensitive oily skin and wanted a toxic free product to help maintain a youthful look to my hormonally changing skin. I alternate depending on what yummy natural product I feel like pampering my skin with. It feels good to look so radiant and young with out all the harmful chemicals of phthalates, parabens, propylene glycol, ureas, EDTA and formulated fragrance and artificial colors!
