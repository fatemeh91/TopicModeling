review/text: I had one of the automatic air freshners for more than a year,had used refills , even replaced the batteries and loved the papaya-mango scent...when I could no longer find the refills in my favorite scent at my local store, I was very pleased to find not only refills in my scent at Amazon merchants but I also found new and improved freshner units that came with my scent...so I'm now set for quite sometime !
