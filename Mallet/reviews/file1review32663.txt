review/text: A previous reviewer comments that they need adult strength. Just read the label and adjust the dosage. A little research reveals an adult dose of Diphenhydramine HCL is 25 to 50 mg. This liquid is 12.5 mg per teaspoonful. I take a Tablespoon dose which equals 37.5 mg, the equivalent of 1-1/2 adult tablets.This product is what it says and it's really inexpensive. All liquid is labeled "Children's", even Benadryl brand.Think!
