review/text: I purchased this item about 4 days ago, and even though I have high standard, arm blood pressure monitor, I wanted something compact and small. From the first reading, this monitor was erroneous in its numbers. VERY HIGH 160/101I measured my blood pressure again , numerous times,compared it with the high quality arm monitor, and it read 135/82.This kind of reading can be alarming to someone who does not compare the faulty reading to another instrument. I AM RETURNING THIS PRODUCT ASAP> do not buy this item,
