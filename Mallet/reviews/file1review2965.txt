review/text: Well, I must agree with those who said (for the shaver that wasn't factory reconditioned) that this shaver is mediocre. I bought the refurbished one at $22 and it is worth that, but not a penny more. It does not give a close shave without going over your face several times. My Norelco worked this well when the blades were 8 years old!I admit, I usually had to shave twice with the Norelco, but the Remington is not nearly that good. To get a decent shave, I have to press pretty hard and go over each area several times. I end up with a bit of redness from the pressing that I have to do to get the shaver to work reasonably well.If you're buying a shaver for $40, save your money and find a Norelco that's on sale.
