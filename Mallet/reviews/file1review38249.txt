review/text: After trying the powder, I can say it certainly does it's job! However, I much prefer the same brand, but the whole husk much better. The whole husk disolves better and it easier to get down. It's almost like pulp in your orange juice, if you like that. I can drink this with just plain water, but have tried it in juice and even mixed in at night with some almond milk or soy milk. Not a bad way get this down and do the job. I strongly suggest trying this in the whole husk vs. the powder.
