review/text: These breast pads are merely okay. They have a very small diameter, and retain their shape very poorly after being washed. Because of their small diameter, they are extremely obvious under clothing. I only wear them at night for that reason. They do the job, but I can't use them during they day, so they are merely acceptable.
