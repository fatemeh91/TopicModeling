review/text: L-Arginine is your classic precursor of nitric oxide which helps maintain blood vessel tone in muscles, ALL muscles ; ) It has greatly enhanced my ability to function sexually and also have give credit to it for better pumps at the gym. I'll mix in some citrulline and beta alanine (Primaforce Citrulline Malate 200 Grams + FREE Beta Alanine 250 Grams Powder) prior to going to gym and as a result have been experiencing a more full and "pumped up" looking muscle during the day, not just while at the gym. It has also improved my overall level of health. I haven't had a cold/flu since I begun taking this mix. Prior to taking it I average 3-5 colds/flu a year. I've now been taking it over two years without getting sick once. My energy level has also greatly improved.
