review/text: This is simply the best slip-over potty seat out there. The adjusting dial underneath allows it to fit snugly over oblong or round toilet seats, so there's no slipping around on the potty. I recommend this especially for boys because it doesn't require a special flip-up piece in the front. Also, the hole is a little bigger than the cheaper models, so I would recommend this for average-sized 3+ kids. My son is over 5 now, and he still has to use this, so it defintely will last a long time as far as age of the child and sturdiness of the product. It cleans up easily, too.
