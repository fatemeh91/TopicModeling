review/text: Strong chemical smell from the mat causes my nose to run. I hope that wears off, or I can wash it away, otherwise it the mat will be useless. The bag is quite thin and will likely wear out quickly, the blocks and belt appear to be very durable and may be worth the money for the whole kit.Time will tell
