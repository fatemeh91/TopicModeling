review/text: Saw this great deal, purchased it. If the spine and the cutting edge were actually lined up so that you could sharpen the cutting edge you would be able to sharpen it. But because it's not, it's never going to happen. My advice is to spend a minimum of $80 on a razor and you'll actually be able to use it. Just remember it's an investment that you'll only have to make every few years, if you shave once in a while it should last you 10 to 15 years easy. I shave 5 days a week and I purchased mine from an antique store over 2 years ago and I strop it every use, and hone it once a week and you wouldn't even know I've had it for that long.
