review/text: The other night I turned the last page on a mammoth novel I'd been reading for months. To clarify, it wasn't a LONG novel, but one actually about wooly mammoths. Still craving a good read but fresh out of books and mags, I wandered to the kitchen and with a passion that would have given Dostoevsky goose pimples, started reading product labels... a ketchup bottle here, an applesauce jar there. Suddenly, my eyes caught sight of the Slim Fast Shells and Creamy Cheese Sauce box. For reasons only the Great Pumpkin could ever explain satisfactorily, autoharps and kalimbas began to play strange melodies and went I into a swoon. Reading as I fell, I plopped backwards into a chair in the kitchenette, and began devouring the words on the box in earnest! Time seemed to lose all meaning and before I knew what had happened to me, to rooster was crowing and the kids were bounding down the stairs, almost ready for school. Luckily I had just finished my delicious secret macaroni reading session. I dabbed a handy nearby kleenex at my tear-soaked eyes, and started some farm-fresh brown eggs a-scramblin', some vegetarian bacon a-fryin' and some course pumpernickel bread a-toastin'. Unfortunately, I was plum out of coffee and couldn't get any a-brewin'. As good luck would have it, no one in the house seemed wise to my night of bliss. Later, when the house got all quiet again, I opened up my precious box of Shells and greedily stuffed the entire contents into my mouth... room temperature crunchy and raw. Am I crazy? Maybe... but I never felt so alive!
