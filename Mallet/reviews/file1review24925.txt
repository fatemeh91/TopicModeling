review/text: We've been ttc for nearly 3 years with no luck. So after seeing this mentioned on a ttc fourm i decided to give it a shot. I have a VERY sensitive stomach, nearly everything upsets it. Vitamins, asprin etc...So needless to say i was weary that this to would make me nasuous, even food makes me sick :( Today was the first day taking it, took all three throughout the day(as well as fertileCM) and I am so happy to say these did NOT make me sick and in fact seemed to help curb the nausea problems i have been having lately! Today was the first day I was able to eat without feeling nausous afterwards, and I just feel good :)Maybe its all in my head but heres to hoping good things come in the future with this product! I will for sure post again with results in a couple months!
