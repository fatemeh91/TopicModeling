review/text: This has made bath time much easier and fun for me and my 8 month old. The suciton cup for hanging is ideal and the product is fantasic. My only "complaint" is that the plastic is a little slippery and it would be nice if it had grippers so baby doesn't slide so much - easily fixed, however, by placing the infant sponge tub we used to use inside of the bigger SnugTub.
