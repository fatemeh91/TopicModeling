review/text: I have tried numerous protein drinks, either owning or tasting from friends. I must say this is definitely one of the better tasting ones. However, I would not recommend it with water. It tastes more natural with milk and is more tolerable to even the most picky person. I would probably recommend this flavor over any of the other Gold Standard products. The only downside is that this product apparently uses artificial sweeteners, which have been known to cause health products in the long term. Hope this was helpful!
