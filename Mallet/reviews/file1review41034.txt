review/text: What can you really say about a laundry detergent?Well, the basics are there, Surf works fine, gets any stain that pretty much any other dry detergent gets out and does the job fine. There's nothing really special about Surf's actual function as a detergent.What attracted me to this particular box of Surf was the scent. Sparkling Ocean has quickly become the mental smell which is stamped to my idea of clean laundry. It's a nice refreshing scent which should appeal to most people who like neutral - not too flowery, not to chemical - type smells. Does it smell like the ocean? No, not at all... but then again, I'm not sure if I would want my sheets smelling like seaweed.If you are sensitive to strong smells and perfumes, stay away from the Surf line. They are very heavily scented and (I'm assuming) made to not only make your clothes smell clean, but also your entire closet.However if you like your laundry on the scented side, I would recommend giving this one a try - it also "blends" well with the scent from most of the Bounce dryer sheets.
