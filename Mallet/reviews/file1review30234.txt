review/text: It's an entirely decent little machine, and seems to work really well for pretty much everything else--I'm a little cranky with the hose, as it narrows at either end, ensuring that things can get vacuumed up and caught in the hose. But that's a common issue, so I can live with it. What I can not live with is the stupid filter cover. The vacuum this is replacing (a beloved shark which lived a long life and deserves to spend the rest of its years on a nice farm) had a mesh filter cover thingie. Cat hair would mat up around it, dust could get through, and everything else stayed where it belonged. This one has a filter cover like a colander. Solid plastic with holes in it. And the holes are *just* the right size for small particles of clumping kitty litter to jam in them. So the filter itself gets dusty WAY too fast, and then on top of that the filter cover is packed solid with litter pieces, and I have to take it apart after every time I use it to clean up kitty litter, and wash the whole setup. I've fixed the problem by putting a knee-hi over the outside of the filter cover. I dare say it violates every warranty there is, and will probably make it burst into flames some day while I'm using it, but for now, it keeps the litter where it belongs, and my sanity intact.
