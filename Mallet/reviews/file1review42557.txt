review/text: My husband and I love this protein powder! I wasn't so sure that I would enjoy the banana flavor, but it mixes so well with strawberries and other fresh fruits- its so delicious I have to keep reminding myself that there is protein in it! Also the protein blends effortlessly either in the blender, or in a shaker bottle. This is an excellent product.
