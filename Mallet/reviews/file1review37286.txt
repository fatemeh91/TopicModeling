review/text: Since I live in Honolulu, I can provide an effectiveness rating for this product any time of the year. I'd say that both as an antiperspirant and a deodorant it works just as well as other similar products I've tried. But, while it's ""unscented,"" I wouldn't say that it's odorless going on. It has a fragrance that resembles latex house paint (the closest comparison I can find), which isn't very strong but doesn't dissipate entirely either. I think in close contact situations, one might prefer a little added fragrance. For ordinary use for those who don't like perfume, this product could be recommended.
