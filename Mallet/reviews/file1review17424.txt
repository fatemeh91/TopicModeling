review/text: My first time using a Remington Product and I'm very impressed. I usually buy Norelco shavers and trimmers, but after a disappointing experience with the Norelco 4070 trimmer, I ended up getting this Remington for $14.77 at Amazon. Knowing what I know now, even if it were $50, I would still buy it.1) I'm not an ergonomics engineer or anything, but this trimmer feels very good in your hands. Sturdy, curved to fit your hand just right, and the shape makes it easy to get into the corners of your face that might be hard to reach with some trimmers.2) Charge last for a LONG LONG time. Longer than I remember my Norelco's lasting.3) Does not have a bin for the cut hairs, but makes as much mess as my Norelco's did, which is to say, not that much.4) Price at $14.77 is excellent. Seems as though the sale price has ended and it's now $28. I think $28 is still a bargain considering the newer Norelco's are selling for $50+.
