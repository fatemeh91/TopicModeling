review/text: There is really not much to say. If you are on this page you probably already know these drops. They are the best on the market. My doctor said so. I use them a lot, because I have dry eyes and wear contacts. They are pricey, but this dual pack was the best deal I found. Just a suggestion, if you do suffer from dry eyes, drink plenty of water during the day and take Fish Oil - it all helps
