review/text: I have had flat feet with low weak arches since I was in my teens or younger (30 YO male). I got these because I thought I needed arch support.These inserts eased much of pain in my feet, but made them feel weird. I developed callouses on the inside of my arch where the orthotic did not exactly match my foot. Walking barefoot was more uncomfortable, I found myself twisting my ankle more often.I used these for two or so years, first with the small insert, then medium. They soften up, or become deformed, so I replaced them whenever I got a new pair of shoes. I had a set in every pair of shoes or boots I owned.Two years ago I switched (very slowly) to Vibrams and this year went barefoot as much as possible. Doing this has strengthened my arch dramatically. I can see and feel the difference and I no longer need any orthotics. My mother, who would worry about my feet, noticed that when I was walking on the beach my arch was not even touching the sand. My feet honestly felt like rocks.These will provide you with temporary relief, but if you really want to solve the problem you need to strengthen the bones, muscles and tendons in your feet.
