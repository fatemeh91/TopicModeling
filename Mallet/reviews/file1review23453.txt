review/text: I really like this stethoscope. The sound quality is really good (really, REALLY good for a cheapie $30 stethoscope), and it's very easy to carry as it's very light and the tubing coils up nicely to go into a scrub pocket. I'm happy with the seller because I got it quicker than I thought I would, and happy with Prestige for making such a good product.
