review/text: The telescopic method used to assemble the handle pieces must have been designed by someone who really really hates Bissell. Hard as one tries to securely insert one piece into the other, unpredictably but inevitably the two separate while sweeping. This renders this sweeper essentially useless, unless you crouch down to use the small rod without the extension.That's too bad because it does a fairly decent job picking up crumbs and small particles. I use it on a Persian rug, on tile in the kitchen, and even does well with kitty litter on tile floor.A 4 or even 5 star product had they used a screw-in mechanism or a spring action secure lock to fasten the extension to the base rod. But they didn't. So it's a sucky 2 stars for this one.
