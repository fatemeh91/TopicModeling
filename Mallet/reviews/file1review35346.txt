review/text: I have now used this product for approximately 20 days in two different vehicles: 2013 Chevrolet Impala & 2008 Lexus RX350.Product works flawlessly with a 93 year old woman.After reading some of the negative reviews, I was prepared to have the handle slip when it was grabbed for support, but I did something to make that almost impossible. Here's the trick - take the strap and wrap it twice around the window frame (the illustration shows it hanging limply with no wrap which could lead to slipping). If you are familiar with knots, it would be a half-hitch around the window frame - BTW - half-hitch is how you secure a horse to a hitching post. After the double-wrap, then close the window. Between the half-hitch, friction against rubber door gasket, and window glass in the channel, the handle will NOT move.Bonus: The strap is so long you still have enough slack to make adjustments to the handle height.When unwrapped, the handle is quite odoriferous (uncured rubber smell - it is made in China, so be warned), but the odor dissipates about 90% after a few days.
