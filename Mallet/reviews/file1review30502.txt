review/text: I had to write a review because I was shocked that this cleanser had such a low rating. First, yes, Dermalogica is expensive. (Although it doesn't have to be.) Second of all, I use their products based on what was recommended to me by Dermalogical facialists at their store, rather than picking whatever I like. This is not a harsh cleanser that will make your face sting. It's pleasant smelling and I actually do find it to be effective. Dermalogica actually recommends washing your face twice in a row with this product. I know that might sound like hogwash to get you to use more... but supposedly the first time gets stickier makeup off and the second time gets the remainder. I take the middle ground and use it three times a day-- once at morning, night, and after the gym. Why am I willing to pay way more for Dermalogica rather than going to the local CVS when I'm an incredibly poor graduate student?? After I switched to Dermalogica I started getting tons of compliments on my skin. I mean very frequently, as in people coming up to me and asking what my skincare regimen is.
