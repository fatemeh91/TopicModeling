review/text: I have been in healthcare and Critical care for for almost 30 years. We need more of these in homes and cars. The software and protocols are excellent. Early defibrillation is the key to survival for most people. I use to be an EMT and have been a practicing critical care Respiratory Therapist in emergency rooms and currently work in a Regional Trauma Center. [...]S Riggs, M.S., RRT
