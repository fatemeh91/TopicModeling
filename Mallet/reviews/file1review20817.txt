review/text: Let me start out by saying the Braun 8585 EASILY provides the best shave I've ever gotten from an electric razor. Though it's the slogan of another company, honestly the 8585 is the only shaver that's ever truly been "as close as a blade".Now for the reason(s) I've given it 4 stars rather than 5:The razor is loud, and by that I mean LOUD. It's loud when it's self cleaning, it's louder when it's held up to your face. The second reason, and this might just be me being picky, is the blue led at the base of the razor. The led is as bright as the razor is loud. I realize that the blue led's are new and high tech seeming, but seriously ... when the razor is in the cleaner / charger unit it also functions as a nightlight... a nightlight that bathes half the room in erie blue light.All in all though, the 8585 is an excellent product, LOUD but excellent.
