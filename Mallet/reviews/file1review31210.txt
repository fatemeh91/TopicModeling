review/text: I have tried practically every product on the market, both precription and otc. Nothing has ever worked for an extended period of time. However, this cream has brought relief from itching where other products have not. I have moderate to severe psoriasis: plaque, inverse, and guttate. My psoriasis has not always itched, but has become worse over the last several years. I am initially very pleased with this cream and will continue to use it.
