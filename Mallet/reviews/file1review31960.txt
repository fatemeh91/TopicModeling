review/text: I have to say this product is making a difference for me. I have tried many different supplements/drinks over the years, and this is probably the first one where I can physically SEE a noticeable difference. The most obvious, and unexpected, is how my skin looks. I am 57, and do not suffer acne, but my skin looks very much clearer in the short time I am drinking this. I am excited to see how this continues to improve over time. As for the taste, it can be masked. I combine it with my whey shake from Mercola, add some organic milk, 1/2 banana, and some liquid aloe. I think it tastes quite good this way, and certainly acceptable. I shared it with my daughter, and though she didn't like the taste as much as me, she found it at least tolerable. I am at the point where I don't want to start my day without it! Try it!
