review/text: I've been using ON Gold Standard Whey for awhile. I'd previously used numerous brands including, EAS, Body Fortress, & Muscle Milk (ick). This is the best tasting and best quality of the proteins I've used. I usually go with Double Rich Chocolate or Vanilla. However, I decided to try a different route this order, and purchased the special edition Coffee flavor. Now, I thought ON double rich chocolate was the best whey I've ever tasted until I got the Coffee. The coffee is flat out delicious. It tastes just as good mixed with water as it does with milk. It has a slight coffee ice cream or frappacino like taste. The only issue I have with it is it does contain real coffee, so that means there's 40mg of caffeine per serving. I quit drinking caffeine a couple of years ago and really should have checked closer before buying it. That said it's still delicious, but I have to be careful with it in my post workout shakes if I work out at night.
