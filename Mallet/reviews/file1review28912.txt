review/text: You can't go wrong with any product from Optimum. This is a great middle class protein powder if you don't want to splurge on Isopure or Hydrowhey. This is also pretty good tasting. I just wish there wasn't any artificial sweetener (sucralose). That is the main reason why alternate this protein with NOW whey isolate and Dymatize all natural whey.
