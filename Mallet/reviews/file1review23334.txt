review/text: Breeze to put together, getting it to stay together is a different story. Yes, the handle does break apart! The size of the sweeper itself is that of a childs toy and picks up just as well, if not worse. For the price, I wish I had bought the less expensive Bissel at Walmart. Oh, and the mess I had with shipping was awful! Please, don't waste your money on this item.
