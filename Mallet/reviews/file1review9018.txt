review/text: that's what an associate at my local Sprout's told me when she recommended the product to me for the first time. I had read about green foods and was very confused and she was very helpful. I almost choked on the price I paid for the product once I checked on Amazon, but her help in selecting a product was well worth it based on the reviews. I'm on-again off-again about sticking with any vitamin program, so this seems to be working for me. The list of ingredients goes the whole way around the rather fat container. As for the taste, I started out mixing it with juice and it wasn't bad, but let's face it, it's not a drink you'll want to sip and savor. I don't even bother with the juice anymore, just half a glass of water, a heaping scoop of the powder, stir briskly, down the hatch and be done with it!! I'm old. I've been taking the stuff for about two months and I'm still old, but I have seen an improvement in the "crepey-ness" (not, creepy-ness) of my skin, less dry. That's a good thing. I'm still not able to leap tall buildings and the x-ray vision hasn't kicked in, but I'll have a wait and see attitude............2/2/2012---I'm a believer! Hey, my fingernails are growing and are stronger, Yay!! May be my imagination, but I do feel a little more "get-up and go". So, I'm going to continue with this drink and I even add a tablespoon of Chia seed to my daily "green cocktail".....
