review/text: Pros:-Low carb-low sugar-low calorie-24g of protein-dissolves completely in very little water-cooks wellCons:-taste isn't that great (for an ON protein powder). Definitely doesn't taste bad, just not as fantastic as their other flavors.-thickens a little when it sets (only have had this happen with this flavor. Possibly from the artificial caramel bits)Overall awesome product, but I'd just suggest the mocha or extreme chocolate milk flavors over this one.
