review/text: I have a lot of problems with my contacts, especially with them drying out in the evening after a long day. These drops did a nice job of rewetting them. There was no sting when I applied the drops, and the dropper was small enough that I didn't end up with drops streaming down my face. All in all, it's a very good product.
