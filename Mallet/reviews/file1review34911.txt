review/text: My husband and I have used Melatonin in the past, and were not happy with it completely. We found if we took it too late we had trouble waking up in the morning, and taking it early we would fall asleep,but wake up 3 or 4 hours later and not be able to fall back asleep. A friend recommended we try the timed release tablets he was using because he was getting a full night's sleep and had no trouble in the morning getting up. Unfortunately, my husband and I both felt that the timed release tablets were not helping us sleep through the night and I started getting leg cramps after 3 days use.
