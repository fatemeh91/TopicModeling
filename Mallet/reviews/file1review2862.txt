review/text: Shaver works good on my thick whiskers. I'm 56 and whiskers are grey and hair strands are getting thinner. This does not shave the thinest hairs. So I have to occasionally run the trimmer over my face to remove the finer hairs. Trimmer works great. Very precise. Battery charge only lasts 1 week. My old Panasonic which is now 3 years old held a charge for 1 month when new and is now down to 1 week. That's why I was replacing my panasonic was because of the poor battery charge life. So I'm using both. Panasonic for a better shave. Remington for trimming my beard.
