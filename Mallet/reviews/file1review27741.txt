review/text: This is a good protein at a relatively decent price. There are some cheaper options out there but Optimum seems to have a good reputation for quality. The powder mixes easily in milk and water. I use a Blender Bottle, without the wisk, and there is no clumping or mixability issues at all. Also, I've had no issues with digestibility, again in milk and water. I'm somewhat lactose intolerant so this was something of a concern for me (I only drink it in 8 ounces of milk once a day to avoid any GI issues). Also, the double rich chocolate tastes really good. Mixed with water it's okay but mixed with the Skim Plus milk that I use when I take it before bed, it tastes as good as any chocolate milk or milkshake. I wish I could say the same for the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, which tastes terrible. I bought a 5-gallon jug in an attempt to mix things up but the flavoring is terrible. I'm definitely not looking forward to choking down the rest of that jug. I started to mix one scoop of this flavor with the vanilla to make it more palatable but now I'm just looking to finish it off as quickly as possible.
