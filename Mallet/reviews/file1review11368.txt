review/text: This is the most uncomfortable ankle support I have ever worn. The hemmed places all around the heal makes it impossible to walk with it on.. And I have fat feet and they swell at times but the part closest to the toe is very loose making it hard to put a sock on so you can give up any chance of wearing this for a walk.. Going back to the hem around the heel, it was uncomfortable and I just had it on with my feet elevated.. So even with no pressure it needs to be fixed.. I would not recommend this product and I regret buying this product..
