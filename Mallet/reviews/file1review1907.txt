review/text: Beyond Awesome product. I can't begin to tell you I have had an itch on the heels of my feet forever. Sadly, I never thought it would go away so over the years I felt I just had to get used to it. I get my pedicures at home and the person who works on my feet always says a little bleach will do the trick. It didn't. Nothing ever did the trick. And then WOW! I found this inexpensive product on Amazon, read the reviews and took a chance. I rubbed them on my feet and toes. Not only did the itch go away but the fungus/funny looking toe nail has healed in maybe.... 2 weeks. I'm not joking. It's like OMG! Don't get the 6 oz, go straight for the bigger one. If my children have an itch I bring this to the bath. Another thing I do is pour some on my foot stone and work it in my feet. My feet feel amazing. I happen to love the smell. It's smells clean. Tea tree oil smells clean to me and more importantly, it smells like it's doing something - and it is!
