review/text: I wanted the exact item pictured, instead I was sent Braun's replacement for this item. The description matches but the part number and UPC's are different from the item listed. The new and improved pack does not work as good on my razor. I know this because I have already bought two of them this makes the third. It is not worth the hassle to send it back unless Buy It Now sends me a preaddressed package to send it back in.Picture, all product ID information needs to be updated.
