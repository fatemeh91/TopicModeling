review/text: These are the best Tums that I have tried. I would prefer a bottle of just vanilla without the cocoa, but I can just use all the vanilla and leave the cocoa for my husband. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find these in the past year. They had them at my local store, and then they were gone. It takes a lot for me to seek out a certain product, instead of adapting to what is available locally.
