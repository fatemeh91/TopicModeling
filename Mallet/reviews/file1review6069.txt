review/text: A friend got these for our wedding with the matching cake server, they looked beautiful in the photo's. We even took them on our honeymoon and they held up well. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because the decorations came off the glasses after using them only a couple times. Not a big deal, we can just glue them back on.
