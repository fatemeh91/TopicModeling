review/text: This product can have great results if used in the right way (e.g.: cardio, weight lifting, eating healthy, etc.) if you're looking to build muscle. I wouldn't recommend mixing this with water...doesn't have the best taste. Goes perfect with milk though, especially fat-free milk. It adds an extra 8g of protein and helps with weight loss. Amazon also has the cheapest price for this online as far as I could find. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to live healthy, get a more toned body, or build muscle.
