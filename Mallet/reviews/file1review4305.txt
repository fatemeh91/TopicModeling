review/text: Like others have said, the cartridges are way too expensive and wear out much faster than they should. But for the first time since I started shaving almost 20 years ago, I can finally say I've found a comfortable shave. I've been using Gillette products for several years now, always switching to the latest product. Each one improved on the comfort over the prior, with the possible exception of the "power" versions over their "manual" counterparts. But until now, I was never completely satisfied. Now I just have to wait for the next product so they'll hopefully lower the prices on the Fusion replacement cartridges.
