review/text: This heating pad has a nice weight to it and does get very warm. My complaint about the product is that it doesn't really maintain a consistant temperature, it seems to get really, really hot at first and right before it's timed cycle ends but in the middle it cools down quite a bit. I have a chronic back issue so I have a lot of experience with the heating pads, this is by far the closest thing I have found to what the professionals use during treatments.
