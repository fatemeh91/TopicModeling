review/text: I use this spray occasionally when I have bouts of sleeplessness. In my experience it works a little slower than some over the counter pills I've used in the past, but when I fall asleep I stay asleep. Plus I don't wake feeling groggy the next day. With it being a liquid I was concerned about the taste, but it doesn't have any taste or aftertaste. It is only 2 oz, but two or three sprays on my occasional use seemed to last two or three months. This is my 2nd order of this product and I will order again.
