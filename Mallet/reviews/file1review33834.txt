review/text: I bought this in addition to a littman cardiology III as a backup and all I can say wow what a night and day difference. The littman is much clearer and louder whereas with this particular stethoscope requires excellent hearing IMO to be used. I say why strain to hear something when all you have to do is take the extra few weeks worth of savings and buy a real stethoscope especially for those who considering a profession in the medical field.
