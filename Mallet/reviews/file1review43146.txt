review/text: I needed one of these because I live in a high-rise with tall windows on the balcony. I can't reach the upper part of the windows and I was always noticing streaks from using paper towels and windex. This product works just like a charm, with soap and water. You can clean your windows like a professional, and eliminate streaks from washing by hand. Highly receommend this product!
