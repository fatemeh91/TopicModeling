review/text: Out of the box one of the 3 led lights didn't work. With two it still does a fair job. Too bad there is not a way to replace the bulbs. But if the led's could be replaced and with a half dozen or so replacement extras with the package this would be an added benefit.Not worth the hassle to look for a refund or replacement.On the positive note the flex cord made of metal does a great job of staying in place in any position you put it.
