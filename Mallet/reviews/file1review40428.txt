review/text: Overall I really enjoy this little product. I floss much more often since I have gotten in. My main complaint is the design of the handle. Some of my teeth are very close together and the location of the hand grip (rather far back on the handle) combined with the springiness of the neck makes it difficult to floss in between tight teeth. It can be done, but if the grip was a little closer to the floss end and the neck not quite so flexible it would be much easier.The only other complaint I have is the price of replacement floss heads. They are almost $3 for 28 at my local store. That's $3 in floss a month. Much more than using normal dental floss. But this has got me in the habit of flossing daily, so for me it's well worth the extra cost.Bottom line though, great product!
