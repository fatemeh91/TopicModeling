review/text: I take only two caplets daily after my heaviest meal, especially when I know I've eaten what I did not suppose to eat. It prevents me from constipation, gas formation or the sensation of bad taste in my mouth. During winter time, it is difficult to find fresh pineapple, which contains the best enzymes, I take Omega-Zyme Digestive Blend to keep my digestive system in good health.Garden of Life is my favorite brand for the product.
