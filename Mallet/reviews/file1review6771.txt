review/text: For a do-it-yourself job, this instrument does a fine job. It greatly helps to relieve sore pressure points and tight spots. There are limitations when working on myself -- I'm using my own muscles to operate this tool, so I can't relax the same as if I was having a massage or physical therapist work on me. So after considering the limitations of a self-applied tension reducer, this works fine. I have one at home and another one at my office -- I use one or both of them almost daily.
