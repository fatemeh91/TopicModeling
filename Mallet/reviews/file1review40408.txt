review/text: I think it's fantastic that they finally added something to the Slim-Fast plan that actually resembles a meal. The calorie content is roughly the same as the shakes and meal bars, yet this is much more filling. Very quick and easy to make in the microwave at home or at work. I love this for when I get to dinner time and realize I am too close to my calorie limit for the day. I suggest adding a salad if it doesn't seem like enough food. The sodium content is a bit high, in my opinion, but not much worse than a lot of other foods. I've tried this and the fettucini alfredo, and this is the better of the two, in my opinion.
