review/text: Purchased one for the wife who has trouble holding books while reading. It works so well we purchased another for my use.This item does what it is supposed to do. Makes holding books, etc.comfortable while either setting in a chair or reclining in bed.The Adapt-A-Lap is well made and designed to do the job. A real credit to the inventor and distributer.
