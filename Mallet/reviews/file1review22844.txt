review/text: Aug. 28, 2012I've taken Universal Products before (Animal Rage)but so far Animal CUTS is just not doing anything for me. I don't really feel any energy throughout the day or while I'm working out. I take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and it doesn't seem to have any effect on me. I do however feel heartburn. I've heard people say they start sweating like crazy and I'm not getting that either. I'm drinking lots of water.I'm 1-1/2 weeks into it. I'll update later see if something changes but as of right now I would NOT buy this product again.(update)12-07-2012I didn't get to finish the product. Tried to return it but Amazon does not refund supplements yet Universal has a complete money back guarantee. Oh well.I would not recommend this product. I do like other Universal Product but would pass on this one.
