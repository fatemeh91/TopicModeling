review/text: A few years ago a friend of mine shipped a bottle of the Wellness Formula to me. I'm a full time student and single mother of two, I image she thought this product would be good for me in help with stress and its affect on the body. I used them and noticed just how quickly I would bounce back from a cold or build my immune system to prevent me from going through a cold.I noticed that people hate the smell of the herbal defense tablets, my kids do to. I, on the other hand, love the what seems like citrus and rose smell that I detect. I am ready to buy my own bottle now.
