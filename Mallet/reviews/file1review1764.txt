review/text: This is a good product. Our family is using it to discourage mites, scabies, etc as we are exposed to these things in the mountains with the friendly outdoor critters at our door to be fed daily. I researched and the products designed for this are expensive. This has many of the same ingredients, such as tea tree oil. I mix it with an antibacterial product. Even use it as shampoo and body wash for myself and on dogs too. I do not like these pesky little irritants! Nor do my little dogs, who had never had a flea before we moved here. It is not just for feet. I recommend it.
