review/text: I purchased the older model of this shaver 5 years ago and used it every 3 days or so in the summer to trim my neck in between haircuts to almost daily use in the winter when I attempt to grow what resembles a beard.Pros:-- Ease of use - With the flick of the thumb I can change guard lengths. The guard can also easily be removed to expose the blade for close trimming-- Convenience - There aren't any attachments to keep track of or store. It's relatively compact for having the power that it does and theres a simple power cord so you down have to worry about mounting a charger to your sink or wall-- Power - goes from trimming delicately around my neck to ripping through a thick February beard-- Reliability - never once has it pulled or nicked. The blades remain surprisingly sharp over time. The battery life is also very good (mine had charger connection problems, not battery issues). In it's prime it could go a week or more between charges-- Price - I picked this up on sale for under 15 bucks. If it lasts another 5 years I'll be extremely pleased at my $3 per year expenditureCons:NONEI highly recommend this shaver!
