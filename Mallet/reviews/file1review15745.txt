review/text: This is a solidly constructed Multi-Pen that is NOT plastic! Metal components, including the screw-on cap that hides the eraser (which I like since I don't use the 0.5mm pencil that much anyway).Turn it into a Needle-Point Gel Pen (See Customer Images for close-ups) by refilling it with Pilot Hi-Tech-C Gel Refills (0.3mm and 0.4mm points available in black, red, and blue from jetpens dot com). The refills work perfectly and do NOT obstruct each other nor the mechanical pencil when switching from one point to another. (SeeOne item to note for folks who like Fisher refills. This pen doesn't work well with Fisher Universal Multi-Pen refills. The tips are a tad too wide and end up clobbering each other, and the mechanical pencil point, when switching from one point to another. Staedtler Multi-Pen refills work fine though.I wish it had the option to ditch the pencil and use another pen refill to allow for three pen colors but, like many pen/pencil multi-pens, it does not.
