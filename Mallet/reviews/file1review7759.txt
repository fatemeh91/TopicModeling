review/text: I had just remodeled my kitchen and got a brand new black apron style kitchen sink. Could not bear the thought of buying another $1 brush that would tear up in two week,s like the other two dozen, in the "use for the outdoor" bin. I thought I was splurging to by an "expensive" kitchen brush, but good grief, this thing is still in pristine condition. There has been no problem with bristle breakage, smell, mold, handle wear, etc. I never imagined it would hold up like it has. So definitely worth the small investment. Save yourself the aggravation of replacing a brush constantly and go with the quality. I mainly use this for prewashing dishes before they go in the dishwasher, but also can use it on pots and pans. I've not needed to buy an extra one for any other purpose. I do agree that the bristles are widely spaced, but this has not interfered with my daily use of it.
