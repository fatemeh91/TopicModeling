review/text: These strips were a great bargain over the ones available in Canada(which cost about $55 CAN for 5-9 strips). I bought 10 OPK strips and 2 pregnancy test strips for $21 CAN. Just be aware that it took about 3 weeks for them to arrive, so if you're in a hurry buy the horribly overpriced ones at Shoppers Drug Mart or pick up a copy of "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Wechsler--it's a great resource on natural signals of fertility (ovulation).
