review/text: I have used several different hair clippers over the years and I always come back to Wahl hair clippers. The attaachments are better constructed and the use instructions are much better. I also found that the cutting and trimming blades do a much better job. The blade adjustments are excelent and extras that come with the kit aere well thought out. The comb, sissors, drop cloth and most importantly the ear trimm attachments are an item that no other trim kit has thought to include in their extres.
