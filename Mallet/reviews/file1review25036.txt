review/text: For many years I used Secret then one day I just broke out in a terrible rash. I then started my search for the right antiperspirant/deodorant to no avail. I spent TONS of money on different brands only to end up tossing them because they gave me terrible rashes. Huge waste of money. I tried EVERYTHING. I was pretty much out of options and did not know what I was going to. Then one day while at the 99 Cent Only Store (in Los Angeles) I saw this one. I never would have normally bought deodorant at the 99cent store but I was desperate. I am SOOOOOO glad I tried it. It has been the ONLY one that will not give me a rash. Keeps me dry all day. Best of all NO RASHES!!! I have been a loyal user now for over 15 yrs. Only problem was that they were SO hard to find that when I did find them I had to pretty much buy out a stores supply. I never knew if they were going to discontinue it or not. Seems any time I find something I like they discontinue it. I am so glad to see that more stores have it available online though prices do vary greatly. I never pay more than 80 cent to a dollar for them. I hope they never stop making or selling these because I dont know what I would do with out them. I have tried both the powder fresh and unscented. I love the powder fresh the best, though it can make me a little itchy if I shaved too fast or too much. I just try to be more careful and not rush so much. I don't know how to tell you how great it is not to get rashes anymore. The would be so bad that they would span my whole underarm and side boob as they call it. If you are sensitive to most deodorants you might want to give this a shot. At the price you can definitely afford it.
