review/text: The last time I used an electric razor was 20 years ago. It was a Philishave Triple Head and it left ingrown whiskers, burned my face and the batteries just didn't last. I was getting tired of paying the high price for Mach 3 blades and yes I fell for the Fusion which worked beautifully but the blades require a finance plan.I decided to try an electric again. After reading all the ratings I decided to go for the Braun. When you first open up the package you can tell you are working with a company that takes it's product seriously.All the parts are well made and the shaver is a work of art.As well the shave is very close and very quick. I am converted.No more shaving cream and I think I will by another cheaper Braun for travelling as I don't want to damage this jewel.
