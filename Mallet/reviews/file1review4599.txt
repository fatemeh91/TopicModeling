review/text: I found that this razor doesn't work as well as my Mach 3 for infrequent shaves. The blade spacing is much closer than the Mach 3 so it requires many more passes to take off the long hairs. I find the single blade on the back side handy to trim unruly nose hairs and around the lips.I received this as a free sample from Sam's and I won't buy more, but if a person shaved more than once or twice a week it might be a good investment, as it does get a close smooth shave. I used this razor with Gillette's razor gel.
