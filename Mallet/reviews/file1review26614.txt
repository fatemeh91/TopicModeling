review/text: i had high hope for this product, it was in expensive. the concept was easy enough.but as a car seat addition? no. no sir.when inflated to the max it pushed my lower back forward so much i could not rest my upper back and shoulders, i released 90% of the air out to fit my cars' seat design, at then i still has to be readjusted even with the secure straps which keeps it in place. but since it's 10% inflated is weirdly shaped and eventually uncomfortable.
