review/text: The arthritis in my hip had almost crippled me. I bought a cane 2 weeks ago. After 6-8 weeks of gradually losing mobility, I was desperate for some sort of relief. I've tried ibuprofen, glucosomine pills and liquid, you name it. I was to the point where getting in and out of a car where a near impossibility and climbing my stairs was almost out of the question. I was afraid walking would be a thing of the past. I mentioned something about arthritis creams and patches to a friend who went to the nearest drug store for my first jar of Australian Dream Cream. This was on a Saturday. Within 4 days, climbing the stairs was no problem, my limp was completely gone. After a week, no limp at all. Occurrence of pain down about 90%. After two weeks, the whole 8 weeks episode is just a bad memory. I still use the cream once every other day, just for safe measure. I've recommended it to several friends as well as my 83 old mother, all have the same results. This is the stuff miracles are made from!
