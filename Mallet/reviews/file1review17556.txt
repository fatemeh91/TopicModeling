review/text: After reading some great reviews about this beard trimmer, I decided to purchase it for about $15, back in November. What a great deal! I've used it at least a dozen times and it always has enough juice, cuts close*, and surprisingly, the curved handle works well for me. To be honest, once I opened the package, I figured I'd be really annoyed by the curved handle. Instead, it forces my hand out of the line of sight when I'm trying to trim/edge my beard.Also, if you're like me, beard trimmers can get annoying pretty quickly. Just consider all the separate parts that usually come with beard trimmers - my last one had a stand for the 7 different guards, plus the oil and the comb! Alternatively, this trimmer's zoom wheel is a great alternative to the usual method of swapping out edge guards. The trimmer comes with no stand, no separate edge guards, nor any oil. Instead, it contains only one detachable guard (works great with the zoom wheel, allowing 9 different lengths), one small comb, and the electric cord. Plus, it never needs to be oiled! (And everything stores away without any hassle!)Overall this was a great purchase. There are probably other trimmers out there that have even longer battery lives, have even more power, or cut even closer*, but for the money, this was an exceptional purchase. By the way, knowing what I know now, I'd definitely pay the normal $30 price for this product.(Note: I've seen a few reviews talk about how this doesn't cut very close. That may be the case, when compared to high dollar trimmers, but it cuts close enough, in my opinion.)
