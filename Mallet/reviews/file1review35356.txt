review/text: We bought 2 of these car caddies because I was unable to get our daughter in the minivan from her wheelchair and she was not allowed to put much weight on her legs. I hooked one to the window frame (as shown) and the other to the handle above the door. By grasping both, she was able to support most of her weight and could hoist herself into the car with minimal assistance from me or her legs. Slide board didn't work because I couldn't slide her uphill from the wheelchair to the van seat. Prior to finding this solution, my husband had to put her in the minivan by picking her up.
