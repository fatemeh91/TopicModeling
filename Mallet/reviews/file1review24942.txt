review/text: I started taking this about 2 months ago along with pregnitude and my husband the male version. We have been ttc since May 2010 after we lost our daughter at 23 weeks in Feb 2010. So far it hasnt worked for pregnancy. However, i was pretty regular before starting this but with extremely heavy bleeding for the first 3 days of my cycle and they last 7-8 days. Since taking this my cycles are not as heavy and subside for the most part by evening of day 3 and its just spotting day 4-6. That alone has helped me. My cycles were also extremely painful and since starting this they are not so bad in tha pain dept either!! I will update this if and when we ever become pregnant!
