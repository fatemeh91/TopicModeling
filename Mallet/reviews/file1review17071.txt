review/text: I just bought this to replace a larger trimmer I have had for a few years. I like this model a lot. The cutting length guide is small enough to easily trim under your chin and above your lip. There are no attachments, just the attached guide. I prefer it that way. I am tried of getting a bunch of plastic crap with every trimmer I buy when I just use one piece. It cuts hair well without tugging or pain. The adjustment wheel is like a mouse scroll wheel and functions a lot easier and smoother than most crude "snapping" adjustments on other trimmers. The only problem is that the guide doesn't appear to lock in place. Granted it takes a reasonable amount of force to adjust it and I don't think you will adjust it by pressing up against your face, but you could potentially bump / roll the wheel and adjust it inadvertently.I like the prodcut a lot for facial hair trimming. I have used 4 or 5 trimmers over the years and this is the best. It's pretty cheap too.
