review/text: I first heard of this product during a recent cruise to Alaska. I quickly used up the one I purchased there and was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a better price. This is something I hope to always have on hand. Make sure to use only every 2-3 days because more usuage will definitely dry out your skin. Used properly, it is wonderful not only for aching muscles and in my case also for Fibromyalgia and severe back stenois. One side note. I recently had a small kitten get really stopped up with a cold. He would sleep on my chest while I was bathing and it really helped him breathe better. We did this several times until he got over his cold.
