review/text: The first time using this is PAINFUL, but the results last a long time. It is nice to not have to shave every day anymore. The first time I used it, (I let the hair grow for 5 days or so) I could still feel little hairs, but I have found that if I shave the little leftovers, my legs stay smooth for a week or so. There must be slower growing hairs that don't quite get long enough for the epilator to "grab," but still stay away for awhile after shaving. Subsiquent uses are less painful. Watch TV or something to keep you mind occupied. I have never been one to shave my arms, but I used this on them, and am so pleased with the results. Smooth for days. Even when the hairs start to grow back, the are soft. No more hairy arms for me!
