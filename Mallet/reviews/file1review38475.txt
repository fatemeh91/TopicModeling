review/text: I'm a guy who is sick of being hairy and have tried chemical,causing skin damage because of leaving on too long trying to get hair off and the smelly stink, found that it won't work on stubble and is not efficient.Waxing is too costly for large areas, more pain to wallet than me.Shaving is a joke, time consuming, and a day or so later the ugly little things are back and irritating, and no matter how many blades electric or hand, I got cut or scrapped and red.As a last resort I tried this method. WHAT PAIN at first, esp on inner thighs,side of waist,underarm,and bikini area. Legs and arms were little to no pain. Chest was about middle level. It took about three days of morning & evening sessions to get nerve back to get job completed, but what smooth results. Now it's a breeze about once a week because there are few to any hairs so the pain factor is NOTHING,the short fuzzys come right out, one or two you missed that are a little longer are jerked right out like a small pin prick. Even the afore mentioned painful areas are nothing at this point. I just LOVE IT.I wish I had done this a zillion years ago. This thing works.
