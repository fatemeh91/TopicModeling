review/text: Lobob Optimum Extra Strength Cleaner is the BEST product I have found for cleaning my gas-permeable contact lenses! I have worn contacts for over 50 years, and frankly, I would not still be wearing them if I had not found Optimum ESC. It cleans ALL of the "foggy" residue and does not damage the lens in anyway. Hopefully, I will be using Optimum ESC for 50 more years!!!
