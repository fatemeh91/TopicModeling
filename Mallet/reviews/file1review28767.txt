review/text: This is my second shipment of ON Whey protein. It is the best bang for the buck. I did my research and ON met my needs the best, at the lowest price as well. It mixes easily, but on occasion does clump up. I usually make some smoothies with it, or take it mix with 2% milk or some soy milk. I wouldnt recommend it with pure water, tried it once and could hardly stomach it. Tasted too too horrible with pure water. This of course is my personal taste, so stick with milk or smoothies. Overall great product, great tasting and cheap as well.
