review/text: I'm a dental student and I bought this cuff for taking BP at school. I use this twice a day and I find the readings to be consistent for patients with the readings they get from their doctor. I like that this cuff doesn't have a positioning sensor, which often makes you move your arm around until the cuff picks it up. The only problem I've had with the cuff is that it doesn't work well on individuals with very large wrists.
