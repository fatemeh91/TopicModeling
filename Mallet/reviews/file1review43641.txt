review/text: This monitor is an excellent product. First of all, it is a very accurate measuring device. It allows for repeated daily monitoring and averages out the readings for a more accurate total.It is a very easy to use, out of the box unit. Along with the benefits that come from this blood pressure monitor there are also sensors that allow it to detect an erratic heart beat.The price we paid for it, in terms of monitoring our health at home was very well worth every penny.
