review/text: In the winter time the skin on both of my hands becomes extremely dry and tight, with flakiness and cracks, like a severe dermatitis. I've been trying every lotion and hand cream I can find to help heal my skin. I saw Dermarest at a local store and felt hopeful that it might work. My skin is so extremely dry that it cracks and creates deep cuts in my skin that are painful. Applying Dermarest felt like I was pouring straight rubbing alcohol onto my skin...it had a burning sensation and was very painful. I have tried my best to deal with it and I've applied Dermarest a few time because I thought it "may" be working, but each time I apply the lotion it burns so much that I've quit using it. I don't know if my skin is just super sensitive or what, but I can't use Dermarest. Still searching for a product that will heal my dry irritated hands.
