review/text: I bought this blood pressure monitor to replace the inaccurate wrist monitor that I bought at Rite Aid after reading that this was one of the top-rated ones by Consumer Reports.I haven't been able to check my blood pressure yet as the pediatric cuff they sent was sized for a child. It works fine on the arm of my six year old grandson. I am an average size person with average size arms, but there was no way I could use the pediatric cuff.I wish they had sent something larger than the pediatric cuff.I had to order the adult-size cuff for an additional $27.I gave it only four stars because of the wrong pediatric cuff. Shipping was very fast, and I am a happy camper otherwise.
