review/text: This cleansing wash is the best ever! I have been using this now for over a month and I have yet to have a ringworm breakout! I have been struggling with ringworm break outs for over 2 years now. The doctor told me the chronic ringworm is something I will just have to deal with because of my activity level and if you had it once you will definitely get it again - because the spores are so difficult to get rid of - you have to treat everything (towels, pants, shirts, underwear, etc). This wash is fresh smelling, tingly, and wonderful. You know it is "disinfecting" the area that you are washing. I love this stuff. Use it every time I shower and I am confident in this product. I love that this is an "alternative" to taking orals Fluconazole (Diflucan) and using topical medication as well. Using this and the tea tree creme has changed my life. I am so happy and will continue to use this forever!
