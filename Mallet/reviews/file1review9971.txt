review/text: I was absolutely disgusted when I opened the package, and the supposed "Improve your measuring skills" booklet was not included. I also need to mention that the measurements may be close, but the calculation is RIDICULOUSLY inaccurate. I sent a complaint to the company and recieved no response whatsoever. Manual calipers may be less convenient, but at least you can do the math yourself, and come up with an accurate number. Save your money!!
