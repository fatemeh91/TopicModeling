review/text: Many years ago when I first started wear hard contact lenses Lobob was recommended. Gas permeable became the standard and other cleaning products came on-line. Finding this compatible product that cleans better is a great re-acquaintance. Be aware that this product is alot more slippery than the other items I have used
