review/text: this product was much better than the mini mite massager i bought. the jelly is a nice texture and its an enjoyable size. the only thing is that it claims to have multi levels of vibration but doesnt, it has only one, which i dont find to be quite strong enough. it is very quiet though and battery efficient. over all i like it alot.
