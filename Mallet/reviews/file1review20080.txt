review/text: Ok so maybe it doesn't smell terrific, but now I have enough of it to have a scent. I was getting desperate for something to reverse my hair loss. My hair was so thin and sparse that my scalp kept getting sun burned and I would use hair clips in a female equivalent of a comb-over. I knew that the mainstream topical products were useless for my hormone-induced hair loss so after a little research and reading the good reviews I tried the 120 cap bottle. I started out with the two capsules a day and in less than a month, started noticing improvement. The only negative effect is you'll grow hair like crazy everywhere else. You might want to read the reviews on the Emjoy. So give yourself more time in your beauty routine for hair removal. I switched to one capsule a day for that reason with good results. The shape of my hairline has totally changed. I haven't had this much hair since I was a teen. I've also done a lot of reading regarding DIM and preventing estrogen-driven tumors. I personally will take it for this reason also, but you'll want to draw your own conclusion, there has been one older study that suggested if you had a tumor already DIM may cause it to grow.
