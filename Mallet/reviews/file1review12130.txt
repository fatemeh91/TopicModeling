review/text: I get nauseated very easily, these were great pills that I could take and not ever feel nauseated, I don't even have to eat a whole meal with them. Sometimes my skin does itch when I take them, but I think I might just be a little alergic to something in them. No big deal though, I'd rather have a little itch than be sick all the time. Great pills.
