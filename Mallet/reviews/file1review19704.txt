review/text: I bought this for my kids as part of their training to transition to a normal toilet. They used to get worried of falling into a adult toilet (some reason refused to use the kiddie pot - trying to ape parents?). this worked wonderfully and they enjoy using it as it makes them feel 'big' like an adult. There is a an adjustment screw at the rear of the seat to allow it to fit snuggly to any shape of the toilet seat & prevent it from slipping. Thus quite useful for us.Now if it could also clean the bums as well...haha
