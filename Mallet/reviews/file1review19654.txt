review/text: We bought this for our daughter, who is now 5. It has been wonderful!! My 3 year old son is now using it. We just ordered another for the second bathroom in our house. The best part is this seat fits, and we mean really fits, on all sized toilet seats. We move frequently, and never realized how many different sizes and shapes toilet seats actually come in. BRAVO Baby Bjorn!!
