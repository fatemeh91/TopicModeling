review/text: Overall the product was satisfactory. I would not agree that it offers 24-hour protection. Even in the cooler fall/winter months, the product started to lose its effectiveness after 10-12 hours. The scent was above average. I personally feel that gel products go on better and offer better protection. They should produce the product with a tamper-proof seal (under the top). I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It's simply ""average"".
