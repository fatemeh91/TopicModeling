review/text: Great suction! Easy to use, long cord, and big enough space to use repeatedly without having to dispose the filter too often for someone who hates doing really disgusting things like that. In fact, I've had it for over a month and still have not emptied out the vacuum. I like the vacuum cleaner-it was a good deal.
