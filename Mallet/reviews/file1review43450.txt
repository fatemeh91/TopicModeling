review/text: This blood pressure monitor is easy to use and very reliable. It fits into a small, compact bag so is easy to transport, has only two simple connections, and fits a range of arm sizes. It has a memory feature and also provides the heart rate (beats per minute.) I would definitely recommend this to others.
