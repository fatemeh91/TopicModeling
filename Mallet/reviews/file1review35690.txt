review/text: At first wasn't excited about it then we read the brochure/instructions on how to use the brace. Number One Clue: read the enclosed instructions before using. It makes all the difference in the world. My husband has flat feet, the ankle rotates inward and the outside of the ankle is bone to bone. He has been told he will need surgery on it but if he got a good brace to help hold his foot and ankle in place, then he could put it off until the brace doesn't work any longer. We have spent hundreds of dollars on different types of braces and orthotics and nothing had worked. Then we saw this one, Swede-O Inner Lok Ankle Brace and ordered it right away. He doesn't get out of bed without putting the brace on first before any walking on it. It has helped so much that we know there is no other brace especially at this low price, that will work. He is truly amazed on how easy he can adjust it to do exactly what he needs. Plus, it means he does more and walks more. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to give our opinion.
