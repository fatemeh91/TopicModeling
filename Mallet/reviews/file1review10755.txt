review/text: I really love this product & it was worth every penny to me. It was such a headache to try & remember "Did I already take this earlier?" Now, since they're portioned out in advance, I know I'm taking my meds at the right time, in the right dosage, and I don't skip doses accidentally. When you take a variety of medications & supplements, this is really important. I can automatically tell now if I took my meds on-time that day. I portion out my medicines & supplements for the week ahead on Sunday evening. It is SO nice to have my take-every-four-hour meds already measured out. It was a real pain to go through bottle after bottle all day, every day before. These are portable, too, great to just slip in my purse if need be, since every day has it's own container. These hold many pills, each slot holding both "horse pills" & smaller pills easily together. These don't come open so easily that you're losing pills accidentally, but they aren't so hard to open that you'll break a nail or cut your finger. The plastic is smooth, the colors are bright, and the days of the week are in nice, big, easy-to-read black letters. I like the big case that holds all seven days at once, so they're not just sitting around loose. This is easy to store, easy to refill, and it's pretty easy to see into them.
