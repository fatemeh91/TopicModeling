review/text: I cleaned out the rear end of my truck and needed to really get it clean and the guys told me of the automotive store that this stuff really works and it does but boy does it smell and talk about chemicals WOW but of course use common sense use it outside and do not wallow in it use it and get it done because man this stuff is worse than methylene chloride.
