review/text: Took the plunge to get these because I was ordering $370 camera and Amazon pitched this as a half price item if purchased in combination. Obviously I should have checked the reviews anyway. Put the batteries in the charger, they won't charge. Remove them, replace them, charger lights right up and eventually registers a full charge. Put them in the camera, it won't power up. Remove them and replace them and it powers on fine. Check them with a battery tester, 3 of 4 check fine, one shows no charge. Check it again a few seconds later, and it shows a full charge. THESE ARE UNRELIABLE JUNK.Pitching a bad product (and from the quantity of poor reviews this has been a poor product for some time) is a disappointment, from a retailer I WANT to be able to trust!
