review/text: Great cleaning tool that can't be beat . . . it's soft enough to assure no scratching on our plastic glasses, yet sturdy enough to remove the toughest, dried on food on all of our dishware [with a little pre-soaking, of course]. These wands last forever and are easy on the wallet . . .
