review/text: I bought this product because my boyfriend seriously needs to trim his beard. There's a lot of trimmers out there but I chose this one specifically because of the balance of price, and functionality. In terms of price, it is inexpensive compared to other trimmers. The trimmer is an all in one beard trimmer meaning you don't need to keep multiple heads so there is no worry to misplace or lose some parts. It looks solid and sturdy. It is rechargeable. You can wash the head. It is cordless. The blades are self-sharpening.He got his gift yesterday and he loves it because it is so simple, so easy to use, so portable yet meets his needs to trim his facial hair perfectly.
