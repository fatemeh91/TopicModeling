review/text: I have tried alot of natural deodorants and this one is by far the best. I have read the other reviews and have to say that I didn't think it had that much of a scent. In fact my daughter, who is very allergic to alot of fragrances, liked it alot. It smells faintly of baby powder. It has been years since I was able to lift my arm at the end of a day and not worry if I smelled bad. I wholeheartedly recommend this product.
