review/text: I got this because it seemed sturdier than the vibratex one which kept breaking. This seemed studier- so I gave it a shot. It is sturdier, it is also larger, less pliable, and quieter. The larger and less pliable make it quite uncomfortable for me, especially when the rotating part is on. I think it would be good for those who can comfortably accommodate something wider.
