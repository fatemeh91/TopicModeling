review/text: Disappointing product. Thought it could perform on tough issues: Shower soap scum , tough dirty grout. This product is for basic easy tasks that I have done with the ole "elbow grease". Looks like I will be returning to that method....hehe. Machine is awkward to handle. It does "shoot out" LOOSE dirt in hard to reach areas, but that dirt better not be "tough" dirt :-)). I do not recommend wasting your money on this. I do not know of any alternative product. Sorry.
