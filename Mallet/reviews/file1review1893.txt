review/text: I love this product so much that it is my very first "subscribe and save" product. I can't live without it. I had laser treatment to clear up toenail fungus a couple of years ago, and I bought this as one of the products I use to protect my investment and ensure that the toenail fungus doesn't come back. However, I've ended up using it for so many other purposes. It smells so good. I just love using it anywhere and everywhere that I want to feel clean and fresh. I find that it even helps calm itchy skin. It really soothes the itch on contact.
