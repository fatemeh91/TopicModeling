review/text: I have a brain injury and so I have to have a pill reminder as well as something which has a history on it. I am able to look back and make sure that I have been taking all of my medications and if I am taking them on time. I have no problem hearing the alarm even from another room and I have even had friends remark on how the sound carries. I can say however that the sound is not very distinct and for someone with hearing difficulties it would be hard to differentiate the alarm from other everyday sounds. This organizer is amazingly versatile because I can just take a few days with me if I am going out of town for a weekend and I still have my alarm. I am also able to just toss one days pill box into my purse without sacrificing my alarm. It is easy to set and has amazing options on how many alarms you want. I did receive one that did not work out of the box but I promptly returned it and the next one worked fine. The battery will not last as long as they say it does but it is easy to change. I have found that it can be easy to break over time but the one I have now is over 4 years old and so far no problems. There is more than enough room to fit calcium pills as well as prescriptions into one box, yet it is not bulky. It is small enough that it doesn't take up too much room but the numbers are still large enought to work for someone even if their eye sight is no longer perfect. On the whole it is the best pill box and alarm that I have every used and it took me quite a while to find it. Now that I have found it I wouldn't change to anything else.
