review/text: Had a hard time finding a Navy cover for my son's room.This one is perfect in color. Nice deep dark Navy (no hint of royal blue). The 2 stars though is because it really doesn't have a nice fit and it's very thin and cheap feeling. It's also not soft at all. Even after 2 washes. It's supposed to be for a naked baby bum people. Seriously? My TP is way softer. For real.
