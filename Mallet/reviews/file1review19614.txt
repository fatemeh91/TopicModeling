review/text: Initially saw that the daycare had this kind of kiddie toilet seat and noticed an ease of use when my daughter had to go to the potty. It's on the pricier side than say the Dora or Sesame Street types you can find at Target, but I found it more secure and comfortable for my daughter than those ones. It fits snug on the toilet so I'm not worried about it shifting around when my kid tries to sit on top of it (which was an issue with the Dora/Sesame Street type I previously purchased.) Another plus - the thing is easy to clean! I'm planning to get a second one for a different bathroom.
