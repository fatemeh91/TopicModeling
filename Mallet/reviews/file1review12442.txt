review/text: Sorry I am late in adding this review. A couple of years ago, my right foot plantar fascia "popped" during a tennis match. At first I didn't notice it... soon was favoring it. Cascaded to hurting so much I could barely move on court and lost the match. In an hour was barely walking.By the next morning... stabbing pain getting out of bed and much online research told me I had dreaded Plantar Fasciitis. I even read that I might not ever fully recover. I am glad that was not the case! I tried all the usual suspects: stretches.. the little balls with nubs on them, standing on 2x4's, balls of feet on stairs... ad nauseum. I tried the elastic band/velco foot supports that wrap around the foot... those actually helped some.. and recommend those. I read that some people had cortizone, visited podiatrists to no avail Boo!But one night I happened on a review of another product that pointed me in the direction of a night splint. I picked this one because it did not "trap your foot" and feel uncomfortable, wake you up. I bought it.. AND AFTER THE FIRST NIGHT.. the foot started feeling better!!!! It took a couple of months and after that I was fully healed.The primary symptom for plantar fasciitis (jabbing pain when you first put your foot on the floor climbing out of bed) is a clue that the problem happens while you sleep. As we age, during sleep our calf muscle and plantar muscles pull the toes downward in a point, and stiffen in that position. When you jump out of bed, those muscles have "set" in that position and resist mightily being pushed back to 90 degrees... and hurt. This device gently prevents all that from happening. So if you have plantar fasciitis, give this a try. I'll bet it will work for you, too. For me, nothing short of a miracle!
