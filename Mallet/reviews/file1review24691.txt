review/text: This is a great product. I use it at work. I have a typical black office chair on wheels- the back of the chair offers no support. As soon as I started using this product on my chair, I haven't had one ache in my back! Before this item, I couldnt sit at my desk for too long without accumulating back pain. Usually I'd go home every night and have to stretch out my lower back a lot!, cracking it. Now I go to stretch my back and realize I don't have to!! Whoever didn't give this product a high rating is nuts! I love it!! It makes being at work soo much better!!! I know I am taking care of my back and will have better spinal health as I age! It not only offers you great lower back support but keeps you from slumping forward towards your computer which is also bad for your spine. It lets you lean forward with no strain to your back!! The only down side is it makes you spoiled so whenever you sit in a different chair somewhere in the office you will notice how unsupportive it is and miss your back cushion!! Plus, it is really pretty blue and soft!! I had to write this review out of moral obligation b/c I almost didnt get it b/c there were some poor reviews! Don't listen to them! Do your back a favor! Buy this product!
