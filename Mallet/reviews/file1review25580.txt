review/text: I purchased this trimmer for a X-Mas gift for my husband, he has an old trimmer he had used for years, so I thought a new good one for x-mas, I read alll the reviews and bought this one, well he says it works ok but it pulls hairs, this is a nose,ears trimmer,but he says it feels more like a type of torture device. His old one is still in use and I just wasted the money for this one. The old one is a Remington nedh-2500
