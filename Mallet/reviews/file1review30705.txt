review/text: I've been using this razor for about 4 years now. I went from using a Mach 3 with standard shaving gel at the sink to shaving with this (usually with Gillette blades) and Shave Secret shaving oil in the shower. A few observations:*Pros:-I went from having a constant red razor burn rash on my neck to basically blemish free skin. I attribute this to GREATLY reduced irritation from shaving. I actually enjoy shaving now. This in and of itself makes this a worthy purchase in my eyes.-I can and do shave against the grain with this thing, but only after making a first pass with the grain.-Blades are incredibly cheaper. 10 blades for $5-10 dollars instead of 8 blades for $15. They last longer as well, which makes it an even better deal. I usually get about a month out of each of my blades.*Cons:-Learning curve is a bit steeper. You have to train yourself to vary how you hold the razor to follow the curves of your face, the razor won't do it for you. I cut myself the first few times shaving with it. Get a good styptic pencil, and maybe some hydrocortison cream.-After 4 years of using it in the shower mostly and not drying it off before storing it head down, the chrome has started to flake a bit on the top curved portion. I did ding that part up a little by dropping it a while back, so I'm going to say that's mostly my fault. Still, it's worth noting.-Don't go really cheap on blades. You can get a pack of 10 for around $3. Don't do it. Trust me. Your face will curse you if you do.*Bottom line: I'm getting another Murkur razor to replace this one, possibly with a long handle. There's no way I'm going back to the latest fades in shaving. One blade is truly better than 3. Or 4. Or 5. Or 27...
