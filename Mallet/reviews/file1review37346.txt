review/text: I was in the habit of shaving my legs and arms and got bored of it :) I wanted to try a method of hair removal that would last a few weeks. I saw the silk epil at my local target and thought of giving it a try, but the model that was available there didnt have an additional shaver head..that i might need for sensitive areas. Then i saw the newer 3370 model in amazon and ordered it. I tried it as soon as i received it, in my arms. I expected to scream in pain, since im epilating for the first time. But much to my surprise, it was not as terrible as i thought. I could feel pulling sensation on my skin and a little redness afterward, but definitely bearable for anyone who has undergone the pains of tweezing or waxing. I still havent tried it on my legs, waiting for hair to grow. In short, its a good buy & its definitely a keeper!Update:I have finally tried this on my legs and had the same experience as with my arms. I just felt some pulling sensation. Manageable. I would try epilating without the pain minimizer the next time :)
