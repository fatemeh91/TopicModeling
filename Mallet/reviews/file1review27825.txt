review/text: Got the Tropical Punch flavor for the first time and to be honest the taste is horrid. It is basically the artificial bubblegum flavoring you find at the dentist when they use fluoride treatment (the only way I can describe it). I doubt whey drink mixes are ever going to taste "good" but this is definitely not tropical punch, I was imagining koolaid or something!. I would suggest sticking with the flavor you like or usually get. Other than that, the powder blends easy with a spoon and works better than other brands in my experience.
