review/text: If you manage to slice a fingertip off, there are not many alternatives to stem the bleeding and protect the area that work as well as these do. Unfortunately, the batch that I got is made in China (leaves me to question the sterility and general quality - we'll see how they do). At least some of these used to be made in Brazil. So minus 2 stars. Harsh - maybe, but when a "household" brand goes the way of the lowest bidder, leaves you to wonder what is the point of buying a "premium" product. At least some of the 3M medical stuff is still made in Europe and the US.
