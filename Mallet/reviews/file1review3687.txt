review/text: I love these pills.Ever since I can remember, I had trouble going to the bathroom. My bf went to the store and said "Look, I need my gf to have healthy poops, how can you help me?" Magnesium Citrate is what he recommended and ever since I've been using this product, my bowels have been moving non stop like a wild animal stampede in a hot, dry day in Africa.The only con is that, I've been having to pee more often than a 8 month pregnant lady. I now have the bladder of a 6 year old. But it's ok, cos I have healthy poops, and not many people can say that. I wear this badge of honor proudly.P.s. I tried another brand that didn't really work for me. NOW is the only one I've been using constantly.
