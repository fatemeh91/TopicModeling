review/text: I've heard a lot about ON's whey powder. A LOT. Such as everyone saying it's the best on the market.Having used a couple sorta generic brands prior to (Target's own brand, and Body Fortress), I was very interested in trying this stuff out after all the rave reviews it's gotten. I picked up the Extreme Milk Chocolate upon the recommendation of some other people.Pros: I can say this stuff mixes better than probably anything else I have ever used. Definitely like that fact.Cons: The taste. WTF is wrong with the Extreme Milk Chocolate? It has a VERY distinct salty flavor in it, and it does not taste all that chocolatey in my opinion. In fact, I'd liken the flavor to something closer to gingerbread. If I add a little chocolate and caramel syrup to it, that makes it decent...thank God because I can barely stand to drink this stuff on its own. Body Fortress was not that great, but at least it didn't taste like somebody had dumped salt in it.Additionally...I swear my workout has gone to crap since right about the time I started taking this stuff. Maybe just a weird coincidence, but it seems odd. I might try a different flavor of ON's whey again someday but it will probably be awhile.
