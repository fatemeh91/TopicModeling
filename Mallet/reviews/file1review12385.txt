review/text: I've used this product only on two occasions. One, when recovering from a stomach flu, and it helped me to get back to "normal". The other time was as a preventative measure for a stressful situation, and it worked great.The contents look like muddy water, and taste is ok (not something you'd seek out, of course) -- certainly better than most of the vitamins and supplements I have taken.If you find that you have gut issues -- this product is certainly worth a try. I've used probably less than 5% of the bottle, and still find the money well spent.
