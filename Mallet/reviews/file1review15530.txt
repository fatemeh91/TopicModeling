review/text: When I received this product it was old and smelled funny. I'd never used it before, so I dont know what color it is supposed to be. Looking at the picture I assumed that it would be an opaque honey color, but it was brown which led me to believe that it was old. It also smelled funny....like old olive oil. Oh well, you live and you learn.
