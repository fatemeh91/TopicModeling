review/text: Sure if I had tons of money I would diversify my proteins a little more. With that being said, I truly do not believe that you will be disappointed in this product if you use it in accordance with a proper exercise program and diet. All their products taste great, do not give you gas, and mix quickly.I chose The Vitamin Shoppe as my vendor because "Bodybuilding.com" wants to charge $18 for shipping to an APO address and The Vitamin Shoppe did it for $5. I use to think that Bodybuilding.com had the fastest shipping, but The Vitamin Shoppe got me my protein to Misawa, Japan in less than 6 days!!!!! That is record time. They shipped the order the very next morning.Thanks again Vitamin Shoppe!!!!!
