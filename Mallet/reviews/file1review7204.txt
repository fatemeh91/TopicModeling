review/text: The first day I received the product if filled it with cold tap water turned on the jet system and then the heat. It only took about 5 min until the the water temp was perfect. The heater turns itself off every thirty minutes which works well if you forget. You will find yourself turning the heater on and off as time goes by to keep the temperature exactly where you want it .....it can get almost too hot for comfort if left alone.....but you feel like you are in-charge.Good product that lets you get water all over you foot without having water splashing all over the place.
