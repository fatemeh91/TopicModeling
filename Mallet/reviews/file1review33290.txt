review/text: This shoulder wrap is not only a fantastic bargain, but it's a fantastic product. It's large enough to effectively treat the shoulder girdle and neck (and chest!), but not so large that it's bulky or uncomfortable. The fabric is of high quality, and it smells wonderfully. The only thing keeping it from getting that 5th star is that I would like to have a washable cover for it. But for the price, it's still a deal.
