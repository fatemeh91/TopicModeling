review/text: The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I had to take so many pills to have 3 or more bowel movements in a day.The first evening I took the pills and my stool was liquid,but I still wasn't having the recommended amount of bowel movements so I kept increasing by two pills each night and finally it happened.I also hate having to go on a diet for this program...
