review/text: We bought the hummingbird flosser, I took the head off of it and used it. Works fine that way, it's good for reaching the back teeth compared to regular dental floss. But I will not buy again. I will just stretch the fingers with regular floss for now on. I am not sure why anyone would say it hurts though it hardly moves.
