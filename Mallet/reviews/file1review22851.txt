review/text: Animal Cuts does not live up to it's description. I never even felt it kick in. I looked puffier than usual. Felt groggy because the stimulating effects were insignificant. It does not decrease your appetite. It's a dud. I usually don't recommend another competitors product in a review because it will be perceived as if a the competitor is posting a fake review just to drum up sales - with that said, I am not in any way affiliated with USP Labs, but I highly recommend OxyElite Pro. It works, hands down. You will feel the energy, it kills your appetite, and you will see a difference on the scale and in the mirror. I'm not sure why I switched to Animal Cuts perhaps I got caught up by the hype - but it was an expensive mistake that I will never make again. Sorry if this review seems like a sales pitch for OXY, but it's not - I just swear by it.
