review/text: As though who have read my review of the Braun Thermoscan will know, the ear thermometer is not as accurate for newborns as the underarm thermometer. So, for a newborn, this is an easy, accurate and INEXPENSIVE alternative.The tradeoff is that this thermometer is much slower to provide the final temperature. As those with a squirming newborn and infant know, time is essential.Ahh, but isn't life a series of tradeoffs . . . Speed versus accuracy, speed versus expense. The Thermoscan versus underarm thermometer is just another of those tradeoffs.That said, buy both. For a newborn, the underarm is more accurate, albeit slower. For a older infant, the Thermoscan is faster and accurate.
