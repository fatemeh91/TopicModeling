review/text: Doesn't smell lemony, so 2 stars.Performs like a champ.This stuff lathers into whipped cream in under 5 seconds on my face.I use a 30 dollar badger brush soaked with hot water. Smells too soapy for my taste. Taylor's Rose smells like rose so I love it. Taylor's Avocado doesn't smell like avocado, thank God. It smells like a field after it rains + lavender.
