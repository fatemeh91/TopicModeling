review/text: I purchased this a while back and enjoyed it...it did much better than my previous razor. The downfall is the fact that (for me at least) it is damn near impossible to find replacement screens anywhere but the internet, which means it takes time to get them here. In the mean time, I'm without a razor since the screen is broken and I don't want the blades to remove half of my face.This is a decent razor for the price, but stock up on backup screens if you can find them.
