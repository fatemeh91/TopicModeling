review/text: This product is much cheaper than the name brands, but contains the same active ingredients. My kids go through SO much fluoride rinse, it's ridiculous, so I bought them a whole case. I think the tops of the bottles are supposed to blink to let you know how long to swish for - but I have not seen that happen on any of the bottles - thus the lower rating. Great price for a whole case.
