review/text: This is my first epilator.I love this product.For many years I was shaving my legs to get rid of hairs.First it was ok but eventually I started getting razor burns and I lost the smoothness of my legs.I was totally upset.I was trying for something different and finally I found out a good product which is completely worth of the amount that I spent.It is not so costly .It is simply awesome.I love it.There is no much pain.The pain during epilating is really very less.Anybody can bear it.I highly recommend this product.
