review/text: My mother initially bought me a hummingbird flosser years ago.... it was the only reason I ever flossed. Really it is just so easy to use. After tons of use my initial one died and THANK YOU Amazon (and associated merchants) for allowing me to find a replacement. I highly recommend this for anyone that hates flossing but knows you really should do it daily. It makes it a joy!
