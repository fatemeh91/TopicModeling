review/text: I have been on a plant-based diet for about 2 years and had noticed some days were very lacking in energy. I'm in my late 'fifties and just though it was age, even though I'm an active cyclist and in good health. I had read articles that suggested my diet could be deficient in B vitamins. I found Nature's Plus had all the vitamins I needed so gave it a try. Wonderful! I use it every day and have had very consistent results- no ups and downs like before. No upset stomach. Works very well for my diet and daily workouts.
