review/text: If your like me and a health nut but don't always have the time to eat your fruits and veggies this product will do the trick superbly! My roommate recommended this to me when he said his sister recommended it to him when she was trying to get pregnant. I do feel good after taking it with my protein shake; however, I'd recommend mixing it with something strong tasting like OJ or a protein shake because it has a very ummm "unique" taste. Still a winner in my book though!UPDATE!!! I am on my second canister and I have to say that all the positive reviews about it boosting your immune system are 100% true!!! Lately a mass flu has been going around my workplace and the less than considerate folks have made every attempt at spreading their viruses by not covering their mouth when coughing. I am one of the few who have withstood the flu storm and there is no doubt in my mind it's because this product!
