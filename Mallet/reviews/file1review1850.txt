review/text: I have had a difficult rash - similar to Psorisis - for months. If I wash my hands with this soap several times a day it disappears. As soon as I stop. it's back. I tried many things like Cortizon products even had one prescribed and sometimes it got worse. Used different cremes and found that this soap was the answer. Was upset when Walgreen's discontinued carrying it. Probably it is just not a very well known product.
