review/text: These gloves really help. I have erosive arthritis which means the bones are eroding and joints become nerve on nerve. Nothing stops the erosion and there are no successful surgeries to help. These gloves help keep joints somewhat stationery while letting you perform normal tasks. Thermoskin, please keep making these gloves.
