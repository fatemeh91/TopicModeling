review/text: I have owned about 10 pairs of these bucky eyemasks, because in the beginning, they were great. I love that convex factor and that it is lightweight. However, the inside liner peels off within a few weeks/months. But, I liked them so much that I decided to overlook that problem and attribute it to normal wear and tear, so I bought a few more, which also fell apart (even faster I might add). THEN, I read somewhere that the company fixed that peeling-lining problem, so I gleefully bought 4 more of the "new" style, and all of those peeled off as well within a few weeks. I resent that claim that the problem had been rectified with a so-called new, improved design.I am NEVER buying these again, and I feel compelled to inform everyone who is considering buying these that they are cheaply made and fall apart and are not meant to be washed. I have since purchased dream essentials which also has the raised portion so as not to weigh upon your eyes as you sleep, and I couldn't be happier. They launder very well, and will last for years compared to these eye masks. They actually have stitching rather than glue to hold the pieces together.
