review/text: This stuff was great, b/c I go through 5 lbs like it's going out of style. However, they say not to use this as a appetite suppressant. It's easy when it tastes so bad...I retract that statement. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not on my tastebuds VIP list. Overall, not a bad product.
