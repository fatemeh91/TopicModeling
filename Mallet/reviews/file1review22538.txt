review/text: If anyone is looking to buy this product, please read the description carefully. The picture makes this look like a regular size jar, .63oz, of Tiger Balm. In actuality, what comes is not the same thing as the picture. Also, i believe the seller uses grams instead of ounces to intentionally misguide buyers. What I recieved in the mail was a tiny red tin, about the size of my thumb, from the tip to the first knuckle. The amount in ounces is .14oz. I am really disappointed in this product and feel as if I have been , if not directly lied to, then at the very least grossly mislead.
