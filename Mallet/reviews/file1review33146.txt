review/text: I started using this after I got a slew of sicknesses earlier this year. I was hit with it all-- started with a cold, turned into a sinus infection, turned into bronchitis, then another sinus infection! April and May 2011 were consumed with sick for me. A friend of mine told me about Wellness Formula, so I started taking it to hopefully recover faster. (I was willing to try anything!) A serving size is 6 pills. When you see/smell these pills, swallowing 6 of them will appear impossible. I have yet to take 6 all at once. I just started taking one per day for a week, then two per day. I feel it really helped me recover from all my illnesses. Usually takes me a couple weeks to get over a sinus infection. After taking two per week I sprung back to life quicker than I ever have. Now I take one per day as a preventative, and if I feel icky I take two.Here's some tips: Take each pill with a FULL glass of water and some food. If you don't do this, expect to burp up a really gross flavor. (Ew.) If you feel the need to take the full dosage, I suggest spacing out the pills throughout the day! Your stomach might feel a bit upset at first, but this pill contains a lot of herbs and vitamins that most of us aren't used to.Also, since starting to take this pill, I've noticed my fingernails are much healthier, they grow like weeds, and never break. (Which is awesome if you're a girly girl like me! Ha.)Highly recommend!
