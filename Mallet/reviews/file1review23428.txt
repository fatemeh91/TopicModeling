review/text: I'm a nursing student and the stethoscopes the school provided for us were bulky, heavy and hurt my ears because it didn't fit correctly. I bought the stethoscope for the design (I found it cute and clever) but was happily surprised with the acoustics! I can hear everything about 100x better than with the one the school provided for us. Which makes it perfect when I use it at the elderly home - very good for detecting those thready and quiet heart beats.
