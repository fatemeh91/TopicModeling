review/text: Hard to keep handle locked. Grasper mechanism Breaks very easily - suction cups break off. Seems like a good idea but insufficiently robust execution, Solid grabbers with magnets at end and with the operational tool made from a hinged hook attached to pull cord would be a better choice, e.g. Duromed aluminum reacher with magnetic tip
