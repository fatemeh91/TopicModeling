review/text: My bone density has increased since I started taking Bone Builder about a year and a half ago. I had been using basic, oyster shell calcium or other purportedly more absorbable calcium products without the MCHC for several years, and my bone density had been slipping. After using the Bone Builder for several months, my density increased for the first time in a number of years, and after a year on Bone Builder the density is continuing to move in the right direction. I can't think of anything else I'm doing, or not doing, that would account for the improvement, so I have to credit the Bone Builder.
