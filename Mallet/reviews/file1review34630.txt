review/text: I bought a jar at my local health food store for my thinning hair. Can't see any change in the thinning but i like how it makes my hair softer. I use it as a oil to base my scalp at night. If you use it on your hair, go easy b/c it can leave your hair heavy and greasy. It does not have a smell so don't worry about walking around smelling like coconuts.The owner of the natural food store told me she used it in her stir-fry dishes and on her son's face to keep it moisturized. In stir-fry dishes, I like it b/c it doesn't leave your food oily and does not taste like coconut. It does not overpower the flavor of your veggies. I did not like it as much as a skin moisturizer b/c it didn't seem to do much for my dry skin. So for now, I'm sticking to using it on my hair and in my stir fry.It does liquify at room temperature. Turns into a clear liquid. I keep some in the fridge and some liquid.
