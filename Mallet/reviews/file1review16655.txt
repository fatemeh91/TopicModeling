review/text: I am not a smoker. I do however work in a restaurant where I constantly need a lighter to light candles. I have bought countless disposable lighters over the years and saw a Zippo here for only $9 and some change, so I decided to go for it.These are nicely constructed of steel with a sturdy hinge. The best part is they are made in America. The lighter is very different from the Bic at the corner store you may be used to. It uses a compartment filled with cotton batting that you soak with lighter fluid. At first I thought something was wrong. The area where the lighter fluid goes is not really air tight nor does it have a secure bottom. In fact there is only a piece of felt that keeps excess fluid from leaking out of the bottom of the lighter. But I digress. The lighter lights very easily as the flint produces a robust spark. However, when you turn the lighter on its side to light a candle the flame does not protrude from the "chimney." It makes lighting candles rather difficult, to the point where I immediately went back to my old disposable.This is a great lighter for a smoker. It does withstand a fair amount of wind without going out as well. For everyone else I recommend looking elsewhere...maybe the Zippo butane lighter.
