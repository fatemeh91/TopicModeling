review/text: I ordered these vitamins when I ran out of my prescription vitamins. They're very good because they have DHA and are very complete when you follow they're regimine. The only problem is, you have to take 4 of them to get 100% of a lot of the essential nutrients, like Vitamins A, C, E, and the B's. With my prescriptions, I only had to take one a day. This is a lot more to remember. Also, they make me burp. And the burp is kind of foul. It's probably the fish oil, but it isn't pleasant. I'm still going to take them because they have all the good stuff I was looking for but be warned about these imperfections!
