review/text: After developing a persistent "back of the body problem" that extends from neck to hamstrings & calves I've gone into research & solution mode trying everything from acupuncture (helpful) to assisted stretching (costly) to physical therapy three times per week (not as effective for the cost). I bought the Body Back Buddy after watching a video on youtube on Myofascial Release/Myofascial Trigger Points... the BBB is AMAZING!!! It allows me to hit my trigger points with very little effort, I feel like I'm standing outside myself giving myself the PERFECT massage. I'm regaining my flexibility after 9 days of use, I just use it whenever I've got a moment (like watching TV). I took it to the Pilates studio where I workout and the ladies tried it and fell in love... my boss also ordered herself one from Amazon.I'm generally a complainer, the sort of person who's hard to please, but I really can't find any fault with the BBB, initially I thought it was pricey but that opinion is long out the window because it delivers time and again and my returning strength and flexibility is proof. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
