review/text: I mostly like this model, I've used an older model for years, but it wasn't holding a charge anymore and that's why I needed a new one. This one has too much power. I have to put it on gentle mode or it feels like it's going to knock my teeth out! Other than that, I do like it. I like the 30 sec warning for brushing each quadrant of you teeth. It makes the two minutes seem to go by much faster. With my old brush, it only warned at the two minute mark and it seemed like "forever" so I rarely brushed that long. I also like the feature of different brushes you can use. Currently I'm using the flosser & the polisher. I'm thinking if I get the regular brush (w/out all the fancy stuff on it) I might be able to use it at full power, as that brush is softer on your teeth.I would recommend this to anyone & everyone. My teeth are actually appearing whiter (w/out using whiteners).
