review/text: I received this foot spa as an anniversary gift from my hubby, and I love it! Straight out of the box, I had hot water within 5 minutes, and plenty of bubbles to sooth my soles. :) Was also pleased with how quiet this unit is, allowing me to watch a movie without even increasing the volume.PROS:- Not only keeps water hot, but will actually heat it to a comfortable temp and maintain it for as long as you want!- 2 Powerful jets -- yes, they really are powerful! -- positioned in front of tub, sending bubbles over your toes; jets are adjustable in both direction and intensity- Quiet operation (could compare to someone using a hair dryer behind a closed door in the next room, or the neighbor mowing their lawn while your windows are shut.)- Large capacity allows for water to cover ankles; also allows for some movement of feet and/or accomodates larger feet- Can be used with or without heat feature- Handy remote control operation (they even include the batteries!); remote stores in top of unit- Large splash guard works well to prevent spray and spills- Easy to set up and operate- Nice pumice stone included to smooth away calluses, which can be used in unit or removed to use by hand- Sturdy construction, lightweight, easy to move, easy cord storageCONS:- Could have used another 2 jets at the rear of the unit- Slightly bulkier than other spas (I don't mind this at all, but some might)- Rollers on bottom of spa do nothing. They are hardly big enough for even my flat feet to feel, and to use them you have to rub your feet back and forth... Kinda hard to do they're confined in a tub.- Does not include any additional features or powered accessoriesOverall, I am extremely pleased with this foot spa. If you're frustrated with cheaper models that only leave you with cold water, wimpy jets, and jet-engine noise, I highly recommend spending a little extra for this product. I will certainly be enjoying mine for a long time!
