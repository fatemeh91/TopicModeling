review/text: I just used these for the first time and am amazed at how well they got out the ingrown hairs. I'd been considering them but really didn't think they would be that much better than other methods of getting out ingrown hairs - but I was wrong - these are so much better.Yes, they do pierce the skin a bit, but that's how you get out hairs that are ingrown. Using these is so much more delicate than any other way I've tried, and faster and more effective. I agree with others that these may not be the best for actually plucking hairs from the root (though you can do it with a bit of maneuvering) - but that isn't a drawback for me because that isn't the point of these tweezers. The point of these is to extract ingrown hairs from under the skin. Once they are out you can then use regular tweezers to pull the hair out if you are having trouble using these - and this helps save the tips of these so they stay the necessarily sharp.
