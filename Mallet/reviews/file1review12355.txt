review/text: Recieved the product and mixed it up as directed, then applied to the water stain on the ceiling of our kitchen. Could not believe it was that easy! Stain is gone. The ceiling is painted drywall and the leak came from a dripping pipe in the attic. It has long since been fixed but I didn't know of any way, short of painting, to remove the marks. I was thrilled at the results.Thanks for a great product!!
