review/text: I used the 3-blade cartridges from Gilette but didn't like them because they gave me more irritation. I have a sensitive skin. I think the actual blades are made from the same sharp metal just 2 here Vs more in the newer cartridges (though I'm not 100% sure). I prefer these because they give somewhat less irritation.Most of the time if I have to pass a certain area of my face more than once it's because the shaver wasn't aligned properly to the face and not because the blades aren't sharp enough or there're not enough of them. Number of times I passed a certain area of my face didn't seem to matter if I used the 2 or 3-blade cartridge. So if I pass the same area twice that makes it total 4 times on 2-blade cartridge, rather than 6 times if I used a 3-blade cartridge. I suppose that's why I get less irritation with these. But everyone's got a unique face so your results may vary :)Oh by the way, for shaving gel try: "Aveeno Therapeutic Shaving Gel" it's the BEST I've found so far.
