review/text: I was about to contact my alarm company to come and fix the "low battery" message I kept getting, when I decided to do some research online. (The alarm company's literature about my alarm system does not mention anything about replacing the battery. Nice way to get more money out of customers!) Since the system is more than a few years old, the brand of battery that was in it was no longer in business, but when I ran the name/size in Amazon, the EnerSys Np4-12 came up, so I decided to order it. It arrived within a few days, fully charged, so as soon as I switched it out for my old battery, the error message on my alarm keypad went away. One month later, still no error message. Problem solved, for about 1/5 the cost of what the alarm company would have charged me to make a house call!
