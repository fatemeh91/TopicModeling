review/text: I did a lot of research on Amazon before deciding to buy this trimmer. I bought this over a year ago, so I have had good time to review its effectiveness. Note that I have never owned a trimmer prior to this so I do not know what is common to all of them, or even unique for that matter, so I will just describe what I have liked (pros) and disliked (cons).Pros:-cover protects face from sharp blades-zoom wheel with numbered stops (incredibly useful)-firm build-cordless-charge seems to last a good while-cleaning brush included-small comb included-great price ($15 at the time)Cons:-cannot use while charging (if you hear it dying out, and want to quickly connect the charger and use it, forget it. It needs time to charge, it's not a laptop in this regard. So, charge it every so often.)-no charging base-cannot stand on its own; can only lay down-washable?!? I don't know. Amazon's bullet-point description says that it is not washable, but further down on the product page under product description, Remington has a table displaying four of their models and there is distinctly says that this model has washable design. I looked on Remington's website, but did not find anything that clarifies this. Well, I'm not taking any chances, so I'd avoid dunking this in water.I think this is a great trimmer. At the time of purchase, this product was $15. Now, it is $24.99. There are some other Remington models that are higher-end, or appear that way, and they are about the same as the current price. But, overall, I would say that this has been a great trimmer.
