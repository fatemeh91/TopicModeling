review/text: I first bought the Dream Essentials sleep mask, which did not work for me. I returned that and purchased this mask and found it to be much better. Some light is still let in, but to me the purpose of the mask isn't to put myself in total darkness, but rather not to let light bother me when I'm asleep. And this mask does that well. The eye sockets are deep enough if the mask is on the right position. Too high or too low and your eyelids may touch, but right in the middle is perfect.
