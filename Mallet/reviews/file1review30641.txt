review/text: I've read some great things about safety razors. Read a ton of reviews. Everybody points to the Merkur as the top dog. I've used 2,3,5 bladed razors. Shave creams, gels, oils.... This razor has a small learning curve. Normally I have a heavy beard shadow by 11am, but with this I am baby smooth through the day, no irritation, just soft skin. I bought the merkur blades as well- though I haven't tried others. I would also recommend Proraso shaving cream from florence italy. You can find that on Amazon as well.
