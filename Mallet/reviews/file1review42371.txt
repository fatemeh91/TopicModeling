review/text: This product is highly effective at destroying odors; I have been using it for about 3 years. I recommend placing about 12 drops into pouch each time after emptying so as to continuously destroy odors. Even though I add the odor eliminator every time I empty my pouch (5x per day), the bottle still lasts me about a month! I usually pour it into a smaller bottle so it fits discreetly in a purse or backpack, and I can use it when I'm at school or out in public. Using this product has saved me so much embarrassment, especially in public, at work, and living with people. Now nobody has to know about my condition. I will say that the eliminator is less effective when eating spicy foods. The product is blue in color, is water-soluble, and is odorless.
