review/text: It definitely has a positive effect on fatigue. I liked it so much that I ordered a refill. Mayo Clinic also reviewed it favorably for heart health.Here is an extract from National Institutes of Health publication database:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[...]Brain Dev. 1994 Mar-Apr;16(2):146-9."L-carnitine as a treatment of lethargy in children with chronic neurologic handicaps."Plioplys AV, Bagherpour S, Kasnicka I.Source: Little Angels Nursing Home, Mercy Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, IL.AbstractWe present five cases of children with severe neurologic handicaps whose management was complicated by excessive lethargy. Treatment with L-carnitine in a dosage range of 35-50 mg/kg/day resulted in a marked improvement in alertness and arousability. In four cases, when L-carnitine was discontinued for a month, they all promptly became lethargic. When L-carnitine was re-started, the lethargy resolved and the improvement has been maintained for up to 14 months. In three children who were tested, serum carnitine levels (total and free) were normal before starting L-carnitine treatment.PMID: 8048704 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
