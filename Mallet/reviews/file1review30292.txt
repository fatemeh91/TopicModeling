review/text: A note of caution, when I plugged it in it ran and scared me. The switch was on out of the box?When you turn it on, it twists due to the torque of the motor. With that being said, this sucks with the power of a regular full size machine. It's easy to clean and handy to pull out for a simple cleaning instead of going to the closet to pull out the regular vacuum. We bought this to clean up our kitty litter and bird seed. The feathers were sticking to the brush we were using due to static electricity.
