review/text: I had been using Neutrogena's Post Shave Lotion for my sensitive skin and I find that this product outdoes what I had thought was the best. As soon as I apply the balm to my face my skin feels immediately relieved, smooth, and moisturized. The best part: it lasts all day. I shaved this morning and my face still feels smooth and protected (@ 9:15 pm). Nivea For Men has an incredible line of top-notch products and the Sensitive Post Shave Balm is no exception.Aesthetically, the bottle is very sleek-looking and appealing to the eye. As far as the nose, the scent of this stuff, I find, smells differently out of the bottle than when applied to the face; it actually smells even better when applied with its nice, masculine scent.I would highly recommend this product as a person with very sensitive skin.
