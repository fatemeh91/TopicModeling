review/text: I bought these thinking maybe I could get the same benefit of the new Sketchers or Reebok work out shoes, but after trying both, I can tell you that these insoles do absolutely nothing!! I wore them around the house over the course of two days, and other than feeling nice, I felt no difference with or without them on. I've gone to shoe stores and have tried on both Sketchers and Reeboks versions....and even though they may look a bit odd, the Sketchers are definitely the ones to go with. I will be buying those asap!
