review/text: I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try. Big mistake. This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps. The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke. So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose. The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze. Alas, it was worthless. I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June. Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves. Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me.
