review/text: i think i've found the winning formula, the double rich chocolate flavor blended into a shake with chocolate soy milk. there are some repulsive soy milks out there, but try it with 8th Continent brand chocolate soy milk; extremely low fat and adds 7 extra grams of protein, bringing your grand total to 31 grams of protein per shake! and did i mention that the powder makes it thicken up into a delicious chocolate concoction? give it a try!
