review/text: This product did all it claimed to. I used it on a percolator coffee pot that was over 8 years old. This pot made consistantly 1 to 2 pots of coffee per day over that time period. Dip-it cleaned the metal to a like-new shine. The coffee made from it now tastes fresher as well. This is a good product.
