review/text: Ok so i saw this shaver in a magazine ad and it caught my eye, I needed a new shaver to replace my old Norelco, so i thought i'll give this one a shot since it had alot of things to offer. I don't have a beard or goatee so i can't tell you about shaping up using the features provided on this shaver but i'm really satisfied with it so far just after the first day of use. After one quick shave, my skin felt alot smoother i like the fact that you can rinse it in water and you can go wireless. Well i must warn you though, those of you looking for a perfect shave look elsewhere and expect to pay more, because this if for more of a quick shave on the go person. For the price i recommend it to everyone and amazon.com got it to my house in 3 days with free shipping!
