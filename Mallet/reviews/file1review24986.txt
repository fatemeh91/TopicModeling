review/text: Good evening all! I was reading all of your wonderful success stories, congratulations. I just wanted to say that I to had difficulty with irregular cycles and tried clomid for 5 months unsuccessfully. I decided to plan a cruise and forget the clomid for awhile. In the back of my mind I couldn't quite give up trying to have a baby, so I bought some Vitex on a whim. Three days before my cruise I found out I was pregnant!!!! Vitex chasteberry is one of the ingredients in Fertilaid. Vitex regulates hormones and causes cycles to regulate and ovulation to occur. It really works. I had 37 to 40 day cycles.. and sometimes longer. With Vitex I have 30 day cycles with ovulation on the 15th day. I will leave you with my main point... the drops of vitex were under $10 for a months supply. My daughter Natalia is a Vitex success story. I hope to have another success story soon as well... :) God Bless and Good luck!
