review/text: The Remington MB200 had a good start but a short run. It was the perfect beard trimmer but stopped taking a charge after only seven months of moderate use.ADDENDUM: July 2011. I will say that Remington was very cooperative and replaced the product with a brand new one. They do stand behind their warranty.
