review/text: Well i bought this on december 2005, i used only 4 months, after that i dropped it and the blades went bad, not broken but they are not aligned anymore. I tried to fix it 3 times and i couldnt, but today i said that if i dont fix it i trash it, and finally i could fix it, its working again. But anyways, this grooming hurts a lot on the nose, and it eats a lot of batteries. I dont recomend it
