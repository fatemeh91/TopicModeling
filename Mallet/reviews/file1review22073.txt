review/text: I received a pack of these as a gift, and glad of it. Buying these myself would have resulted in some serious buyer's remorse. These pads washed poorly the first time around, and felt "gritty" and a little rough to the touch. After a few more initial washings (hot water, clear detergent, no softeners), they didn't seem to improve much but were doable if I was out of my other brand. I tried them out at home, just to see if I was being too hard on them without trying them out, and discovered that the pads' absorption rate is poor at best, and wicking abilities are practically nonexistent. I looked like I wasn't even wearing pads, except for the circular "frames" they created around the milk spots in my shirt. If I had known the pads would work this poorly, I would have exchanged them at the store for another brand - or even disposables. At least with disposables, I know what I'm in for!
