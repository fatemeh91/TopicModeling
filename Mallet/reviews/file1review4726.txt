review/text: I've had this product before, purchased at another retailer, and I really enjoyed the flavor, but it's been a while. I've since developed new food allergies and I can't for the life of me find an ingredient list on Amazon's page. You'd think for advertising Allergen-Free, they'd want to make the ingredients as clear as possible so that people with allergies can make their own sound decisions. Sure, I can probably dig up the list online somewhere, but when I'm comparing and contrasting with other products on Amazon.com, I want it clear and spelled out in the product description. Disappointed.
