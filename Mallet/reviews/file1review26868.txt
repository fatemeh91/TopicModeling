review/text: I was unlucky enough to order strawberry. Anyone ever have pepto bismol? That will be the exact flavor and taste. I've asked several friends what this smelled like, and they came up with the exact same answer. After a while I had to force my friends to help finish the rest of my powder. The other flavors are awesome, and it's a great product which is why I gave it four stars instead of one.
