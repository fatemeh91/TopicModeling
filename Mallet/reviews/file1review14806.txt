review/text: I was looking into a home biofeedback device to help teach me to control stress reactions. I looked at this system, and the "Journey to the Wild Divine" system. I just couldn't take the New Age spin that came with "Journey." I don't want a computer program to help me to imagine being one with the universe; I want a computer program that says, "Your heartrate is too high. Lower it." When I saw the reviews about how badly written the "Journey" software was, I went with Heartmath in the hope of finding a more professional product, despite its high cost.I was disappointed with what I got for the money. You get the USB finger sensor, and an installation disk for the software, and a quickstart guide. No further information is provided -- such as, what is heartrate variability? What is coherence? Why would you care? Is this the equivalent of "clearing Thetans" in Scientology, or is there some actual medical research behind this?Turns out there is some real science that shows a correlation between HRV levels and stress and anxiety. But correlation is not causation. I am not yet convinced that if I learn how to control my coherence, I will be able to retrain my body not to stress. I haven't had the time to go hunt up the science and read it carefully. If you are thinking of spending the money on this system, I would suggest you do that homework first.The software is . . . well, amateurish, to put it politely. It crashes and has other bugs, although it is usually simple enough to exit and restart the system. The graphics are incredibly crude, and the program does not manage multiple windows well.The only reason this package does not receive one star is because there isn't a whole lot of choice on the market for what this package does. And it does what it claims to do -- monitor and report HRV and coherence. Whether that is anything you should want or care about is a separate question.
