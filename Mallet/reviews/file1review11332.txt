review/text: I saw this oil on Amazon website, but ordered directly from the supplier, Auroma. Tried it in a cold process soap. It has a very weak fragrance, even when used directly in a massage oil. Now Foods grapefruit oil is much cheaper and way better quality. You can also try the Eden's brand on AmazonWaste of money. Seek another brand. Also, when contacted, their customer service is very slow to respond, or do not respnond at all.
