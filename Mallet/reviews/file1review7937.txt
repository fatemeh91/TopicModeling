review/text: This is a great lip balm with no scent or flavor, other then a slight beeswaxy aroma that disappears shortly after application. The formula itself is more 'waxy' then 'slick', but in no way does it ever feel like this heavily coats my lips. The balm partially sinks into my lips, and partially remains on top to continue moisturizing. I find it a wonderful texture to apply underneath my more drying lipsticks, and when I apply this overnight I find it is still there when I wake up in the morning. Long lasting moisture, and stays put. Perfect!
