review/text: I've been using ON 100% Whey for about a year now, and I will continue to use it. It's a great product, goes down well, and in combination with my 5x per-week lifting routine I've noticed great results.I've tried chocolate, vanilla, and cookies 'n cream.They were all pretty good, but my favorite is the chocolate. While the vanilla one tasted fine, for some reason no matter what I mixed it with (whether it be water or milk) I would always have a TON of foam after mixing it; I would then have to let it sit for a few minutes for the foam to turn back into liquid. So, beacuse of the foaming issue with the vanilla one, I think I might go back to chocolate.But still, it's a great product and I will continue to try other flavors as well.
