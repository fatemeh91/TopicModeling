review/text: I love Digestive Advantage's once-a-day chewable lactose intolerance tablets for kids. It works as well as Lactaid chewables, but it's so much more convenient. My child just takes 1 each morning and doesn't need to carry a supply of them and remember to take 1 with each dairy serving. And it's much less expensive, too. I love it!
