review/text: I wouldn't buy these again unless they go on sale again. I got them really cheap on here like 11.50 for the whole box. So i decided what the hell. I bought three boxes of protein bars because I'm currently dieting and always on the go. I also bought luna sunrise bars which i loved!! And clif mojo bars which was my 2nd fave.These chocolate raspberry bars are ok. The texture is a little weird, it has a fake chocolate taste, and the raspberry taste is pretty light. But I did appreciate that the raspberry's seemed fresh because of the seeds from them in the bars. They are not horrible but if you're looking for good taste and not just a diet bar, I'd go for luna or clif.
