review/text: This is not a reflection on the seller. They delivered the product on time.This is however to tell you not to waist your money on this piece of junk.I purchased this a month ago and it is now unable to hold a charge. One month old.I'm now back on the road traveling which is why I needed this to start with and am looking for a new shaver.Never trust Remington again.Don't Buy!
