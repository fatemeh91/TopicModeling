review/text: I like these blades for wetshaving a lot, hence 5 stars. Blades are a very personal choice and many other factors play in to the result one gets from them, so here are my conditions:- Wetshaving for 2 months at time of writing.- Merkur Classic Safety razor.- My beard is not dense, straight whiskers.- Shave daily.The blades give me close shaves and I have yet to cut or nick myself (knock on wood). The sharpness is very consistent from one blade to the next, and I change blades every week usually. I have read that these blades are not considered the sharpest in the spectrum of DE blades, so if you have a dense or thick beard, these might not be sharp enough for a shave without tugging. But sharper blades also mean more irritation, so you'll have to find the right fit for you.
