review/text: I have this chair and it's very uncomfortable. There is a bar at the leg rest that presses against the back of my legs, making them uncomfortable and the back of the chair hurts my back and that's without the massage system even turned on. My chair is brand new and I would sell it for half price in a minute!!!!
