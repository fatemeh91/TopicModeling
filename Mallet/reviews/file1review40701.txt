review/text: this pressing oil helps when I need to press with the hot comb.It is kind of heavy and does contain petroleum but it gets the job done.I don't use it on my scalp, since many hair stylist recommend not using petroleum on your scalp, because it blocks the pores. I use it primarily on my ends since they are so dry. I am pleased with how my hair looks after I have used this product.
