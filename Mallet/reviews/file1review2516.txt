review/text: This is fabulous for removing unwanted hair. This makes Nad's hair remover strips and waxing absolete. It works so well and is easier than shaving. The first time on the legs might take a little time but after that 5-10 minutes every two weeks and my legs remain nice and smooth with no stubble.
