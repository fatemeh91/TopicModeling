review/text: This stuff is very powdery and dissolves fast in liquid, unlike other creatines out there that I've used. I ran out of my normal creatine one day and was forced to buy this MRM brand at a vitamin supplement shop. This stuff works very well and it's probably one of the cheapest creatines out there. This is the brand that I use regularly now.I use creatine primarily for strength training, and not exclusively for bulking-up...so I don't know if this will bulk you up better than other creatines. One teaspoon of this right before a workout is sufficient for me. Taking 2 teaspoons a day seems to be wasteful IMO. If you take a teaspoon of this right before a hard workout, you shouldn't have sore muscles the next day.
