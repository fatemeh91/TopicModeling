review/text: Well, we aren't pregnant -- so I'd give the Durex Extra Sensitive Spermicidally Lubricated Latex Condoms five stars!! Actually, we're quite pleased with the product. It's easy to open, and easy to use. And what we like best: they don't have that heavy rubbery, medicinal scent that some other brands do.
