review/text: I grew a beard and moustache last November and quickly realized I needed a trimmer to avoid descending into woolly Neanderthaldom. I've been using this for about a month and so far have no complaints. The trimmer has a guard that can be quickly adjusted to several lengths, allowing even a novice beard-grower like me to achieve a sophisticated, clean-shaven look. I can then easily remove the guard to shorten my sideburns or clean up the edges of my facial hair. I still need a conventional razor or electric shaver to achieve a really close shave, but for the longer hair this item is just the ticket.The trimmer is also cordless, rechargeable, and comfortable to hold.Great value, and highly recommended.
