review/text: The Waterpik is great for getting food out of your teeth! First time I used it, I was amazed on how much crud it got out of my mouth. Really makes me wonder how good brushing is!The Waterpik is loud and held at the wrong angle, it can dribble down your arm. Some people complained about the pressure of the water being too strong, but I almost think it is like a gum massage. I would recommend this to anyone trying to have better dental hygiene. You can also add Listerine to the tank for added cleaning.This paired with regular brushing and flossing will make your dentist happy! Highly recommend.
