review/text: I started off with the ON Platinum Whey and downgraded to Gold because I figured I wouldn't notice the quality and save some money. I was wrong, because it really does differ by a lot. I know most people get the Gold Standard because the Platinum is a lot more expensive. If you can make a few sacrifices in other expense areas, and instead spend more for the Platinum Whey, it's like night and day in my opinion. The Platinum Whey tastes 10x better, it's thicker, feels like great quality and goes down easy. I've had family members make a Platinum shake just to drink it because they like the taste! The Gold by comparison felt watery (even when I doubled the scoops) and tasted horrible compared to the Platinum.
