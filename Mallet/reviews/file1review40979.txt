review/text: Bought this to use for our baby's clothes. Most baby clothes require a cold wash, though, and not all of the detergent breaks down in cold water (at least not in _soft_ cold water). That means that several items are always full of detergent granules that are sticking to them. Works fine in warm and hot washes.
