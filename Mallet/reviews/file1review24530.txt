review/text: My mother is 91.8 years months of age, 92 in June. I mailed this to her and later showed her how to enter the tub from the outside as was posted on a clip on YOU TUBE.com. She had a been stepping over the side of a 13" or higher tub curb to shower. She had not enjoyed a bath in several years. This is a -very sturdy unit- that made me feel secure when I sat on it while putting it together, assembly is also found on You Tube.com. When my child put on a swim suit and transfered from the outside to the inside of the tub and then took the remote and powered down. My mother was cheering on the sidelines! My child has cerebal palsy and will also need a bathlift after I saw the ease of use for her. I do not live in my mothers area/country, but I feel like a million dollars to know she has more independence back. She lives alone, and has no qualms about taking a real hot sudsy bath again. If your loved one is closer to my mothers age, show this to them and show them the info movie on YouTube.com. If you can get them a model as I did, it will seal the deal! Older people think electricity may be near. We charge in a completely different room, and then push the remote back on to the water proof cord. Hope this helps the young and the older who are a bit nervous about it. Also, her tub has an "uneven" bottom so I put plexiglass down first, and there is very little wabble. At any rate, it sure does not bother her! She keeps saying, Wow! I almost gave this away, I almost missed having wonderful baths again.
