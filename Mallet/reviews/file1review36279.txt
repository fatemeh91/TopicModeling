review/text: I normally don't write reviews, but feel a need to as this effects the health of your and my baby. I bought this inJanuary and have used it multiple times over the last few months. Followed the instructions to a T, even worked with a nurse to make sure we were not using this incorrectly.It is consistent.. for sure.. consistently inaccurate to the tune of more than a degree, sometimes even two. Yes it is fast, but whats the use of a fast read when it cannot be relied upon?I spoke to their customer service and even they would not stand behind their product. They say they cannot guarantee the accuracy and offered to issue me a coupon for some other product from their website. I wish I had read a clear review when I bought this, hopefully this will help some of you make up your minds.
