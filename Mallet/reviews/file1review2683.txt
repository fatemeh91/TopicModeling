review/text: I bought this shaver because it was cheap. I figured even if it doesn't shave very well, I could at least use it as a trimmer for beard and sideburns. I was wrong. This thing does not cut hair. At all. I honestly can't fathom how it made it to market; it fails completely, and I mean totally and fully, 100%, at its intended primary function.Avoid at all costs. Do yourself a favor, spend a few more bucks, and get a rotary Norelco.
