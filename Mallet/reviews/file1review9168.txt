review/text: Great organizer ........ especially beneficial for the elderly, takes the confusion out of medicine taking. I fill this organizer once a week for both my elderly parents. All they have to do is take the days tray out and place at the their place at the table ........ no excuse for missed medication. I actually have two for each of them. That way if something comes up that I can't get there the regular day to fill they have a reserve all ready to go! Of course, to avoid confusion as to which belongs to whom I have clear for my mother and green ones for my father. A must for anyone on several medications.
