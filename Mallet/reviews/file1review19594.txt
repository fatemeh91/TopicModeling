review/text: It is a toilet seat, so a grown man shouldn't get to excited about one, but if you are trying to toilet train your toddler, your perspective changes.My son was not really digging the tiny little potty Mom had gotten him at Wal Mart. Though he is in the 50 percentile in height and weight, this thing was just too small, especially for a boy. When he finally did "go" he wasn't "tucked" and it was traumatic for him. He gave up on things for a while. We wanted to get him back on track.As a guy, I knew the importance of having a long-enough distance from front to back. I also knew my son would dig being able to use a "big boy potty." He used it the first time and has pretty much been dry, when awake, for several weeks now.This Bjorn seat is perfect. It is long enough for boys. Also, the connection system with the dial is both very secure and very easy to set up. Installation or removal of the seat takes literally 3-5 seconds. This is important if the bathroom is shared.I really don't know how they could have designed this better.
