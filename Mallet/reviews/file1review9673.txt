review/text: I paid $50 in a store and its not worth it. As said above you cannot hear your babys heartbeat above the gurgling and movements within. I was shocked to find out that for $50 i had to go out and buy my own cd player! t has some headphones that you put on your belly and play music from your mp3 or cd player, but if thats all im getting out of this then the package is not worth it. Shoulda just held my ear buds from ipod onto belly
