review/text: I wish I'd bought one of theses a year ago when I first heard of it. I still think $30 is pretty steep for a piece of shaped plastic, but I never found it cheaper elsewhere and now that I'm walking out the door pain-free, I'm gonna say it was worth it. Definitely recommend that you buy this in conjunction with a foam roller to help stretch out the muscles after digging into them.
