review/text: As others have noted, this thing leaks a lot. Basically, it is single layer construction -- like the cheapo type of air mattresses for swimming pools. The outside has a kind of short velour-like texture, which is not bad. Despite the leaks, it works okay for sitting on the sofa. However, I originally purchased it for use during an air flight. I discovered that since the seats are so close now, when I used the cushion my face was too close to the seat back in front of me. I purchased this thing for a reduced price, so the low level use is okay. However, at $20 or so now, it is well overpriced for the quality. I will look for something else to support my back...
