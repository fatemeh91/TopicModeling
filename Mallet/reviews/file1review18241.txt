review/text: After I had my gall bladder removed, I continued to have episodes of queasi-ness due to my body's adjustment and by the meds I was taking. I read on the internet to try peppermint to calm my stomach and Pepogest was the first product I came across at the store, so I bought some. It worked wonders!! Now I use it for nausea and take some as a preventive if I've been exposed to anyone who has a gastro-intestinal virus (stomach flu). Yes - it makes your innards feel "minty" which can be an odd sensation. I too have acid reflux and a few times the peppermint has made it up into my esphogus, but I just drink a lot of water and everything settles down. I love this product!!
