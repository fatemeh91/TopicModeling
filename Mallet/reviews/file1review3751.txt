review/text: First, shipping was fast. This was great, because I needed something! Second, it worked with the first dose.I am 43 and have had bowel issues since I can remember. I remember sitting on the toilet at the bowling alley when I was 3, not being able to go. It didn't get better as I grew older, only continued to get worse.My diet probably didn't help things, either. I know I had atrocious eating habits, and constant constipation plagued me. I tried increasing fruits, vegetables, and water intake. Still, nothing seemed to help except the harsh chemical laxatives and stool softeners that would make me cramp up and feel like dying. I'd spend hours doubled over in pain, and still not going.Mag 07 started working with the first dose. I could actually feel it working in my intestines. I have only been using it for a few days, but plan on using it as a maintenance product. No pain, no cramping, no sitting on the toilet for hours.
