review/text: This is a good looking brush and it is certainly functional, but it is not cost effective, especially when there are much better options. For this brush, the brush head is permanently attached to the unit. When the brush hair get old, you will have to toss it away. Believe me, the brush hair will get soft or dirty pretty fast. Even if you are frugal/saving, you will need to replace the brush hair once every 6 months if not more often. When the time comes, you will have to throw the entire thing away.There are cheaper brushes sold by other companies. Even Oxo sells two other palm brushes where the brush hair component can be replaced. One looks very similar to this but it is difficult to find. The other one is theOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush. Yes, the SteeL brush is more expensive, but you will save money in the long run because you can replace the brush head withOxo SteeL Soap Squirting Palm Brush Refills, 2-Pack. Here is a quick math, three of these permanent brushes ($18) cost more than one SteeL brush with two replacement brush heads ($15). If you believe you will go through three of these brushes, than you might as well get the SteeL version. Now, it would be even cheaper if you can get hold of a non-SteeL replaceable palm brush.I am giving this a 2-stars.
