review/text: Calm brand magnesium citrate has been the best laxative I've found so far. With chronic constipation and needing to take it regularly, it's been the least abrasive, easy to drink, and generally doesn't cause runny poo. I actually prefer the unflavored ones because I can add nearly any flavor to it with tea or whatever and the flavored ones limit that, though I guess they don't really need any flavor added. I still prefer the unflavored though.
