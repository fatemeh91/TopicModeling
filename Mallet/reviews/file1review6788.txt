review/text: I have back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain. I used to go for massage 1-2 times a week. Most of the time, the massage therapist could not go deep enough into the "sweet" spot. Now, I use this product every day and I can pin point the specific area and press as hard as I want. It is a great design. I study the meridian points and this product has the ability to do 2-3 pressure points at one time. It surely does help blood circulation and the knots on my back are getting smaller. The only limitation of this product is it "gives" a little when I press really hard (Sorry, I like deep tissue massage). Overall it is a great product, I spend more time with it than with my husband!!
