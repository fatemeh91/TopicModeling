review/text: I was very pleased when I received this item. It seems to work beautifully. The only thing I wish it had was more profiles for people to weigh on it, but I do believe they are changeable so it isn't really that big a deal. Very clear instructions as long as you don't take them too literally as one reviewer has saying something like "what am I supposed to do come home at my lunch break and weigh?" No.. the instructions state that you weigh in bare feet AT LEAST 3 hours after a large meal. You don't have to weigh 3 hours on the dot afterwards, that would be a little silly.
