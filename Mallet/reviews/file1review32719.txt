review/text: This product is great overall. Comfortable (at least as far as a brace can be). Only catch is that I was right on the cusp on the measurements, so I ordered up. I really wish I had ordered the smaller size, I sometimes have issue with this one slowly sliding down. As I prefer to wear it under clothing, This can be quite an issue with walking through the grocery store. Just imagine a three year old pointing at you and stating in what can only be described as a loud voice, "Momma your knee is falling off!" So I would suggest going toward the smaller side if you have any doubt as I am also sure it will loosen a bit with time and I have only had this one a week.
