review/text: For many people who are having problems with the handle, you just need to follow the instructions - Bang the handle until it is fixated!The sweeper itself is easy to clean and use. The only drawback is the pick-up brush is located in the middle of the sweeper, so it's hard to use when I try to clean corners.
