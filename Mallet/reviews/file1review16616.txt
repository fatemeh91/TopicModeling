review/text: I've used a Zippo lighter for many years. My current one is about 35 years old. They work forever, are rugged, have cheap consumable parts (fluid, flint, wick). Wick will last years, flints quite a while. Fluid needs refilling fairly often. My last bottle of fluid (Ronsonal---same company as Zippo now) was under 2.00 at WalMart.You know, with tight suits, skinny ties and the "Don Draper" look coming back, this is just the lighter for you. Even if you don't smoke (I don't). I use mine to light other stuff (handwarmer, candles, gas grill, etc.) but you youngsters with the 60's attire can use them to light cigarettes for other people while you are out drinking martinis. How cool is that?
