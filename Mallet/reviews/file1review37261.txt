review/text: The product is everything it promises to be, but IGNORE THE SIZING CHART! Use your intuition and order the size you normally would order for any other type of glove. The circumference of my hand around the knuckle (as described in the sizing chart) is 8.5" and the sizing chart suggests Medium for me. I tried Large (one size larger) and it was MUCH too small. The glove that fits me is XL. If in doubt, order one or two sizes larger than the sizing chart would suggest.This manufacturer (Swede-O, Inc) also makes a similar product (also available on Amazon) that is called a Carpal Tunnel Glove, identical in appearance and material to the Arthritic Glove, but incorporating a metal splint designed to restrict movement of the wrist "in ways that can cause carpal tunnel syndrome". Just so you know.
