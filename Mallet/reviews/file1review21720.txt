review/text: My 7 month old still hates baths, but I've found this bathtub makes bathing her a lot easier. We previously had a tub that reclined, and it seemed like part of the reason she hated bath time, was that she felt very insecure in the tub.This tub helps me hold her in a more upright position, and hopefully help her feel like she's not falling backward. It fits in our bathtub well, and I've found that it doesn't slip around. Hopefully in time, she will like bath time!
