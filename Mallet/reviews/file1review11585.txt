review/text: These batteries DO NOT hold a charge. I use them for my backup point and shoot which might sit for a couple of months before use. I learned (the hard way) long ago to recharge the batteries just before I was going to use them. As I did not want to carry my DSLR into a pizza restaurant, I took my Powershot A620 instead. I had charged the batteries (all 8) the evening before. I managed 25 pictures in 20 minutes before the 1st set (different duracell rechargeables) died. I got 5 pictures on these before the batteries died. I was quite upset as all the partygoers had not yet arrived. The next morning when I charged these batteries, nothing happened when I put them into the camera (I had a family gathering to go to that afternoon). Completely dead. So much for recharging them up to 1000 times. I doubt that I recharged them even 20 times. Duracell has lost a customer.
