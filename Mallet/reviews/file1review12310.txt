review/text: This one was a bit too sweet for me. While overall it has a good texture and flavor, that extra kick of sweetness was a bit much. Some folks might prefer this bar, though, to its less sweet counterpart, the chocolate peanut butter bar. (The PB bar is my favorite)Suggestion: buy one of each flavor and do a taste test. Come back to your favorite for the 25-bar box discount.
