review/text: We looked everywhere on the internet for a good pet vacuum that was cheap and small for our small apartment, and this was the closest thing we found-- it's pretty effective on the couch and blankets, which is great, but not as effective for our carpets, which are pretty "flat" as carpets go; I think this vacuum does best when it can dig into carpets a little with its rotating appendage. All in all, it's cheap, it's a dustbuster, and it's pretty effective, so I'm pretty happy with it, but don't expect miracles :)
