review/text: I have been using this product for the nth time and was quite satisfied with it until recently when it came in with a new design style. It used to look sturdy and more stable when placed in a countertop, now it is so lightweight, nosier and the material used looks cheap. Even the design has been modified. If i were based in the United States, I could have returned the product but since I have to bring it home with me to my home country, the Philippines, I have no choice but get stucked with it. Frankly, it's quite a disapointment.
