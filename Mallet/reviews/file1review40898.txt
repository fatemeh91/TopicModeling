review/text: The best part about this lip product is that it's smooth and penetrating, with a sheen so light that even a man could use it. The smell is not overbearing and is reminiscent of tootsie rolls. And the taste is sweet, but not saccharine-sweet. It's also long lasting compared to a lot of other lip products that don't penetrate as well. I normally wouldn't have given this product a second look, but the sale price lured me in and it's a great find.
