review/text: Simple and Elegant in Design.I've never met a BabyBjorn product that I didn't love.Easy to use, Easy to Clean, the kids gain confidence on the Real Potty and you're not wiping poop out of a "bucket".It's worth the extra costs, it's worth the shipping costs if you can't find it near you!
