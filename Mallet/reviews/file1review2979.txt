review/text: These are the best out there. Started with the 48 pack and we're almost finished with a 100 pack (ordered elsewhere). These are very thin, tight fitting, great feeling, and I have yet to have a single break.With that said, they are tight fitting and they are not particularly well lubricated. Make sure she is well lubricated, either by putting in some effort or by buying a lubricant. If not, the form-fit ends up being a discomfort and you may possibly encounter some ripping. I haven't, because I take care of business and make sure she's good to go. So should you. Get these.
