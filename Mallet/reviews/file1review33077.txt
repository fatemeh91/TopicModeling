review/text: I love Wellness Formula and should get a kickback from the company for all the people I have introduced to it who love it too. I prefer taking the capsules, although I know the tablets are more potent. Taking six at a time upsets my stomach, so I generally take two or three at a time every two hours or so when I first feel like I'm getting sick. I continue taking them around the clock until I'm doing better. I've heard you should not take it for more than 10 days in a row though as some of the ingredients (goldenseal in particular) can be tough on your kidneys.
