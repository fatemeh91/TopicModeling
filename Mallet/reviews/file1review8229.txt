review/text: My husband found this and we love it. It is better than anything else. You don't have to worry about leaving scratches as it has a heavy duty plastic stem. It is not flimsy so it will not be easy to break. We had to buy a second for our trailer. If you want a great bottle brush that works great and won't leave scratches on your items, this is the one for you.
