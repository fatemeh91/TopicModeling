review/text: I like this protect simply because it is easy to use and easy to read. Not only is it easy to read, but when it is time to take a baby's temperature they are not always cooperative. It is especially difficult to take baby's temperature rectal when they are irritable. So, I like this because the temperature can be taken three different ways, which is also good for accuracy.
