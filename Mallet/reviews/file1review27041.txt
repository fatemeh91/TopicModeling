review/text: I'm new to the protein world so I don't have anything to compare against it. But for what its worth, this stuff works and the choc. flavor is great. Have a whey shake before and after workouts and a casein shake @ bedtime, have noticed quicker muscle gains while taking this protein. Will be trying other flavors soon.
