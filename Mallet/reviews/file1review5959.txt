review/text: I don't know if the other reviewer even used it. But I picked up a box from Lowe's(for $10) on recommendation by Alton Brown. I use them to replace Brawney paper towels in the kitchen. I've used them for everything from drying hands, cleaning surfaces to reoiling my cutting blocks/boards with food safe oil.It's way tougher than Brawney paper towles (I used to use select-a-size) and more absorbant. You can do a lot of scrubbing. Only after major scrubbing does any lint start to appear. Way after a regular paper towel would start, though. Highly recommended for kitchen use.I would like to find a dispenser to put these in and hang it on my kitchen wall above the sink.
