review/text: I've tried the Medela washable nursing pads, and found them to be really bulky. When they come out of the wash, they're all distorted too, so I have to reshape them before using. The AVENT nursing pads are great because they have a slimmer profile, and the lace covering on one side does provide some traction so it doesn't become displaced. I love that they come out of the wash in perfect shape! These are best for mild leakage, just enough to keep from staining your bra. Also, for those interested in disposable nursing pads, I highly recommend Babies R Us's own brand of nursing pads. The Medela disposable nursing pads says they offer better shape, but if you wear any bra with even the thinnest padding, you can't tell anyway. The BRU brand pads absorb better than the Medela brand, provide better coverage, and are the least expensive I've found, even cheaper than on Amazon or stores with coupons. BRU will have them on sale sometimes for BOGO half off, so even better.
