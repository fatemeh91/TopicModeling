review/text: What more could you ask for? It tastes great (I got the double rich chocolate flavor), mixes easily and is loaded in protein. Low sugar/calories/etc.The taste isn't so great mixed with water, so I usually mix it with 6oz. of 1% milk. You can use a shaker or just a spoon.Protein is something a lot of people don't think about while dieting and this is a tasty way to remember it. =) If you don't want to lose your muscle mass along with that fat I'd certainly recommend a protein supplement and this is hard to beat.
