review/text: These may not work as an effective "appetite suppressant" for me, BUT, they seriously take between 45 minutes to 1 hour to finish!!! That is great for me because they keep my mouth busy and I'm not thinking of snacking all day. Also, by the time I finish one, I have to wait to eat anyways just because the sweet taste is still in my mouth and therefore keeps me satisfied for another 30min to an hour later =) Well, then maybe they are an appetite suppressant. LOL I ordered the assorted flavors pack because I wasn't sure what I was in for. Initially, I thought I wanted to order just watermelon. Glad I didn't, it was nasty! My favorite flavors ended up sup rising me: cappuccino, candy cane, root beer float (I normally HATE root beer anything). I also love the cherry (taste like Luden's cough drops) and the grape. Interesting side effect: I've cut back on the smoking!
