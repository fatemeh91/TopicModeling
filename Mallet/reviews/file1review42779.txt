review/text: During one of my "health kick" regimes I periodically go through, I decided to try Primal Defense. I figured it was worth seeing what it could do. Though I showed no candida overgrowth in my body (I was tested a while before) I figured a MEGA dose of probiotics could get my good gut bacteria in check (due to the many times I've taken antibiotics since my teens) if needed. I never expected Primal Defense to clear my face! I have always had moderate acne and each pimple took FOREVER to clear up, even in my 40's. I figured it was due to my low immune system. When I do get an occasional small pimple, it comes and goes "normally." It also cleared my mild eczema which is in between my fingers during winter. How do I know it's the Primal Defense that did it? I ran out 3 months ago and have the eczema back and my face won't clear up! The price on Amazon is %50 off from health food stores. That's why I am ordering it here. It's worked wonders for me. I didn't expect any "noticable" results from it. I was wrong :)
