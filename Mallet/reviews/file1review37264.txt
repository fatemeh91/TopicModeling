review/text: I got these about 4 years ago and they have been great. I've had Rheumatoid Arthritis since 2008...still not in remission even after 4 different biologic drugs. I work a computer for a job and hadn't worked that type of job before 2008. These gloves keep the heat in for my finger and hand joints. I did buy them one size up because I like to machine wash and dry. I am finally buying a new pair because the velcro sometimes sticks to this one spot below the thumb joint and roughs it up (if I don't stick it correctly or the washer is rough- i do wash them in a lingerie bag). It has done to the point where a have tiny holes- which I've stitched up- They won't go to the garbage just yet...they are that good and I can use them for messy housework now.
