review/text: I ordered the Concord Sodium Bicarbonate, they sent me Rugby Sodium Bicarbonate, yet the invoice read CONCORD. Rugby Sodium Bicarbonate isn't have as good as Concord Sodium Bicarbonate. Concord desolves perfectly, taste unnoticable, Rugy taste like fish water and is graining in the glass. I'm a big user of Concord Sodium Bicarbonate and miss not being able to get it here on Amazon.SincerelyBill in Las Vegas;-(
