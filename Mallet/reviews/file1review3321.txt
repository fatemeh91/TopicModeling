review/text: I've been wanting a Tweezerman for awhile now. I finally decided for the mini in case I didn't like it. I instantly fell in love with it after using it. It grabs my hairs precisely and I love the mint green/green tea color! :) I can't wait until I get a full size later on! Very happy and satisfied with my purchase!
