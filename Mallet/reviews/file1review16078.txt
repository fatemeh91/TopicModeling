review/text: Dr Oz recently had a segment about headaches and had a specialist on the show that said for migraines (which I get monthly) to try treating with Magnesium. So today when I woke up with a splitting headache I mixed up a glass of this and within an hour my headache was gone. Normally I cannot kick these headaches for 24 hours or more, no matter what I do. The drink tastes like Crystal Light raspberry-lemonade and isn't gritty, so it is very pleasant to drink. LOVE it!!
