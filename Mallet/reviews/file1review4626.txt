review/text: I bought this razor because I had run out of Mach3 blades and remember this being advertised on television. I know that Gillette has made great razors in the past so I bought it. The design, I would give it 5 stars however, the single blade trimmer is not all that effective and like many of the reviews above it is very difficult to clean. The five blades however did not run as smoothly across my face. Yes it gave me an incredibly close shave the first couple of tries but on the third day i felt that I was sawing at my face and having to do multiple strokes in areas just to cut the whiskers.
