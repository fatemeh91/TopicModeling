review/text: I was a little surprised to see this advertised as a "sleeping mask", because I bought it somewhere else where it was geared towards meditators, and it works excellent for that. I can't even imagine trying to sleep with it, it has thick foam that sticks out about an inch from the face. It's very comfortable, but wouldn't be that great for sleeping, it seems, unless you only sleep on your back. The reason it sticks out from the face is because there are holes in the thick foam, so that you can open your eyes completely, without feeling anything pressing against your eyes, and yet it's completely dark. If I were to get something for sleeping, I would think a simple cloth thing that covers the eyes more like a bandanna would be a lot more comfortable. But for meditation, and for doing yoga, etc. it's awesome.
