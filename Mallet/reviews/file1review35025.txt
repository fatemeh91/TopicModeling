review/text: I gave it 5 stars and highly recommend this product! When life stresses you out this is a great product to have on hand. While on the phone and the conversation is getting you upset, spray twice on tongue. I saw this on Dr. Oz and just had to give it a try. I am so glad I did! I bought one for my friend and she loves it ,too! Can help when you are dreading a car ride to...., a test, a conversation, a meeting, an event, etc. You get the idea. I carry it with me in my purse so I always know where it is and always have it with me when I need it.
