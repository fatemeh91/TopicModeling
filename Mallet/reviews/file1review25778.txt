review/text: I've had this trimmer for 2 years now, and what a trouper it's been! I'm one of those evolutionary challenged individuals whom nature forgot when it slowly eliminated fur from the great apes. I was seriously beginning to consider braiding the unsightly nose hair while claiming to 'express' my individuality.As luck would have it, my wife got this for my birthday after several bouts of sneezing during our intimate moments. I have not looked back since. Despite the fact that my sink clogs up with massive amounts of hair this trimmer mows them down and keeps going. Kudos to Panasonic for designing an essential product for every red blooded man's toilet kit!
