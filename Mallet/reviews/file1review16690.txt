review/text: This lighters moderate size proves to fit comfortably into your pocket. It holds it's fuel in very well and is fun just to flip open and play with. It's also a great price for a Zippo. The only thing I dislike about it is that it doesn't look a lot like in the picture, but instead looks used with its outer shell scratched (which is what street crome means I guesse).
