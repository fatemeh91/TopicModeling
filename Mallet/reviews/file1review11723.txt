review/text: I have been using this product since I received some as a hand-out right after Katrina. It is the best I ever used. I saw the review about it bleaching your clothes, but I have never had this happen. Perhaps it is the combination of the Ban deodorant and the type of laundry detergent that person uses. I have never had it rub off on my clothes or cause any type of problem to my skin. It works without conflicting with whatever perfume I may use from time-to-time. I highly recommend this product.
