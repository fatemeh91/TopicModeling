review/text: I know that Panasonic made good shavers because I have owned a panasonic wet/dry shaver for 7 years. I was suspicious about this shaver after reading some review about noise problem but I tried anyway. This shaver works good and didn't make much noise. The biggest benefit of this shaver is cleaning. Just put it in running water.I recommend this shaver to anyone.
