review/text: I personally really enjoy Celsius. My favorite flavor is Ginger Ale, but my wife really likes the orange. I think that it is fine. But the five stars come from what Celsius does for me when I work out after drinking it.Working out on Celsius is like nothing I have ever done before, I can run farther, lift more and go longer. I strongly recommend drinking a can 15 minutes before you work out and letting the Celsius help you do your best.
