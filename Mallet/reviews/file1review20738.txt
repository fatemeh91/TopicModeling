review/text: Last winter, I stumbled a Remington Titanium razor at a great price and decided to buy it (my Braun needed replaced). What a mistake! Sometimes you need to leave home to understand how good you really had it....My wife realized my frustration with the Remington and bought me this Braun for Fathers Day. What a relief! The Braun razors are just that good.I was a little skeptical on the whole cleaning/charging station. After a few months with it I have come to like it. I do like having a clean razor (mmmmm the smell of alcohol!) for each shave - something I had never thought about before. As far as performance, it is up to Braun standards. It does occasionally miss a hair on my neck, but it's much less common an occurance than what I went through with the Remington.If you are looking for an electric, you can't go wrong with this one. I've been using Braun razors for 15 years now and have yet to be disappointed.
