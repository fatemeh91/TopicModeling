review/text: This damp mop system is the best of its kind, it is lightweight, easy to use and very efficient. The pads are sized to cover larger surfaces efficiently and the swivel head makes mopping a breeze. Keeping my dark marble entryway clean and smudgefree is so much easier with this mop system.
