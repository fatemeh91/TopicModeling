review/text: This is a nice brush, and with the Good Grips features with are ergonomic and soft to the touch.The only thing I find is you can't put much pressure behind your cleaning stroke, as the bristles are so soft. They just buckle under any kind of pushing. For cleaning water bottles it's great but if you want to clean a stainless steel travel mug, such as the excellent Contigo line,Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler, 16 Ounces, Blackand there are coffee or tea stains (like in mine) then this brush isn't going to have much oomph to help abrade the stains away. Next I'll try baking soda or vinegar and see how that goes. But soap and soft bristles ain't cuttin' it. It might not matter even with stiffer bristles. I saw one brush that looked nice with some stiffer bristles, but...$92.00? Can that be right? Anyway, I'll update after I try some baking soda or other help to get the tea stains out.
