review/text: I bought this product after reading some positive reviews. I used the pads once - and I leaked though the pads, my bra, and through my shirt. I tend to only leak a little at night and the disposable pads seam to work much better.The pads also were itchy -I don't know if this will improve after I wash them. I am just too afraid to try again!I wanted to save money and the waste of pads, but a wet shirt just isn't worth it!
