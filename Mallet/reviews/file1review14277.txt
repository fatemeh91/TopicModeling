review/text: This product works as advertised. I've had it for a couple of months now and it makes a noticeable difference. I use it just once a day. The bottles last about three weeks, so that becomes an ongoing expense of about $5.00 per month. The spray doesn't go quite high enough for my shower, and this is what lets me know how well it's working. I'm mystified why one reviewer says this doesn't work. My shower is acrylic and glass, if that makes a difference. You are supposed to use it immediately after a shower while the walls are still wet. And my shower was pretty clean to begin with. (Not to disparage the other reviewer, but this isn't a miracle cure. If you live in grunge and mold it will probably take awhile to see results! :-) And I suppose the type of water you have might affect the outcome, though I consider my water rather hard, so I would think my water is the worst environment for this sort of product. There is a very faint flowery odor when you use it, but much less than any other household cleaner you would use on a shower. I'm very pleased with this and highly recommend it.
