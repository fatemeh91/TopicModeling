review/text: Fantastic product, fantastic price! I work for ophthalmologists that deal with patients with macular degeneration and have increasing difficulty with reading. The flat bottom of the dome allows the patients to read without the difficulty of a magnifying glass that has to be moved just so to get the optimum amount of light. The clear dome allows light from all sides to get in with less effort. Patients who have sampled my office dome were amazed and ready to order.
