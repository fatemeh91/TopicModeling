review/text: I buy these bars locally & have found they are a good source of protein, very filling and I love the tast of the peanut butter crisp. I use them as a replacement for breakfast a few times a week, because I just really don't like many breakfast foods (except for the gooey fattening ones of course!).The problem I had with these bars is that they had not been stored properly or they were very old. They did not look right when I opened one, so I tried another & it was the same thing. Dried out & crumbly looking. I returned these to Amazon and got a refund.So, the bars are great, just not good from this supplier.
