review/text: I decided to check online for these Met-RX bars because my local grocery store had run out. They were being sold at a very competitive price, so I decided to order.The bars arrived according to the expectations set. My only issue is that they were stuck to their packaging inside due to melting (assuming during shipment). The bars are very good, but just messy when melted to the packaging as they flake as you try to eat them.I have found the bars to be a good protein source for my current regimen and I have lost 14 pounds since incorporating them in my diet AND exercise. The bars aren't the magic sauce for weight loss, but they were a great addition to my routine.
