review/text: I like this brand and flavor (although I haven't tried another flavor yet) for these reasons:1) It tastes pretty good in milk-no overpowering "protein taste" and only a subtle flavoring.2) According to ConsumerReports research (google "Consumer Reports protein drinks" and it should be the first link), Optimum Nutrition is very good about keeping down the amounts of dangerous heavy metals in their products.3)It's high in protein, including most of the essential amino acids, but it doesn't have a lot of carbs. Carbs are necessary for post-workout recovery, but this allows me to control my carb intake much more easily.What's not to love. I can't guarantee that you'll like the flavor, but you won't know until you try.
