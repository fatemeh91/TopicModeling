review/text: We tried several infant gas drops for our little one, and these are undoubtedly the BEST. They work instantly, have non-staining formula unlike [pink] Mylicon, and have a pleasant taste and aroma unlike [store] brand. Our daughter actually preferred the taste of Little Tummys over any other gas relief medicine, and we could swear that these drops work faster than anything. Little Tummys are also the best value - the Mylicon is 1,5 times more expensive.
