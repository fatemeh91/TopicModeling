review/text: There are many of these for much higher prices. For $24.00 this thing really does the job. I recently installed it into the shower for an elderly couple. I didn't want to mess up their tile by drilling holes so I bought 2 of these. I pushed and pulled and they are seriously on the wall- I honestly couldn't budge them. Its a tile shower I installed them in, and it really does the job. These are professional quality at an affordable price.
