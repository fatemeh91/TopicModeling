review/text: The Balance Bar has a very good taste with none of the vitamin taste that I sometimes get in these bars. It has all the vitamins, minerals, and even Ginseng for the energy I need. I usually have a bar for breakfast - the calorie count is reasonable and you get your day's supply of vitamins. The consistency is the only thing that some people might not like, as it's a little pasty; but overall, I thought it was excellent.
