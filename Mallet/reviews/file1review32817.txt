review/text: I didn't know that Amazon was selling Slim-Fast so when I saw it I jumped in immediately because it was a great prize, no tax and free shipment. They also have the fastest delivery around, which I love. Back to Slim-Fast, after trying so many diet products and not getting any result I gave Slim-Fast a try because I was size 15-16 and couldn't even look at myself so, I got up one morning in January and in June I had to go and buy size 10 pants. At that time Slim-Fast didn't have anything else but the powder cans and liquid shakes. Today, since I'm facing the same situation and many more years older I am trying it again because in reality is the only one I trust.
