review/text: LOVE these. Great for kids lunches and husbands! No leaks between sections or out of container in general. Last a long time for what could be considered disposable containers. Finally had to throw 1 way after a year and I use almost daily during the school year. Fit perfectly in Old Navy square lunch boxes and similar ones sold at Wal-Mart.
