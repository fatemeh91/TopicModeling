review/text: I've been acne-free for years, but I'm just now getting over the acne mentality that makes me want to go down to the river's edge and scrub my face with sand. Enough with the abrasives, the ex-foliants, the battery acid astringents, time for a grown-up cleanser like this light, herbal-scented gel that leaves my skin fresh but not dry. I highly recommend this product.
