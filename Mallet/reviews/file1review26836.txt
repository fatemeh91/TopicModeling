review/text: I've been using Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein Powder for a long time and beyond any doubt they are of top quality in the market. It contains a blend of whey protein isolate and concentrate. Each serving contains a high percentage of protein (24g), low cholesterol and carbohydrates.I have researched both in price and gains, it really kicks muscle growth and Amzaon is the only place where this product is availablle at its competitive price. Amazon ships this product free of charge.Overall, this is the best product whether you are trying to get lean, build muscle or just maintaining your body weight. I have found O.N the only company that has a wide range of exciting new flavors to choose from which are also plesant tasting.Amazon is my favorite shopping place with excellent prices and on time shipping!
