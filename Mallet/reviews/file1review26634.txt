review/text: it' s adjustable by simply inflating it to where you want. well designed to help my lower back pain. not at all cumbersome to move any where you want and is very light weight to position for any chair and where on the back you want to place it.. nice texture for bare skin. it even has a strap, which i never use, to place it on any chair. can be deflated and carried on a plane for long flights if you want.
