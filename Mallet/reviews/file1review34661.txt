review/text: I purchased these in hopes of helping my dry skin. It has helped, but it took a couple of weeks to really see any difference. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was losing weight without even trying. I thought it had to be a coincidence, so I googled it. Turns out that weight loss is common with coconut oil consumption. :)
