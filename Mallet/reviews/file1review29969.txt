review/text: Great product for the price. Helped me put on some weight in combo with some other stuff (jack3d and l-arginine). Serving is 4 capsuls but they are small compared to other amino acid suppliments - I once got pills that were so large you hand to cut them into 4 peices to swallow them, and a serving was still 4 capsuls. Overall pretty good product and there are 360 capsuls for pretty cheap.
