review/text: I had bariatric surgery in January and I need to supplement this vitamin. The sublingual tablets had sort of rough edges and took too long to dissolve, so I looked into another form. I tried some stuff from a drugstore that was an orange liquid and you had to put a dropperful of it under your tongue. That one is barely tolerable and tastes like DayQuil. This spray, although I cannot tell you how it has worked on my lab results, is much less liquid than the dropperful and has an okay taste. It is sweet like stevia with a hint of grape. I recommend it.
