review/text: This protein is amazing, period. I've always shopped around for the best and cheapest protein and this is by far the greatest in both area's. Aside from some sites that do reduced price for buying large orders O.N.'s 10lb bag is the best deal out there (and to beat it's price you have to order 4-5 months worth of protein from the other sites anyway.) It even beats out any deal's with GNC's ridiculous gold card offers. Also the savings increase if you use Amazon's subscribed shipping (which I highly recommend to anyone planning to use this for more than a one or two month period,) which puts it as the best deal I've ever seen on protein so far.On top of being exceptionally cost efficient it has one of the highest protein per serving ratio's I have seen on any protein. 155 Servings at 24g per serving, it end's up coming out to 55 cents a serving if you get the super saving shipping. There are other protein's that will boast 45-50 cents per serving but most of them only offer 18-22g of protein per serving, so do not be fooled and always compare price per serving to protein per serving.Hand's down the best protein I have been able to find in extensive bargain shopping, highly recommended.
