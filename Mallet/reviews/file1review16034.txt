review/text: I love this scrubber. I had one like this for 15 years. I used it until there was nothing left of it. I tried all of the other scrubbers you could get at places such at Walmart. They start rusting and falling apart within a week. BUT this scrubber is built to last. It does not take hardly any elbow grease to get my pots clean with it. LOVE IT!
