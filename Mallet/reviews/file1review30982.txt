review/text: My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/DoPrb ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!Hyaluronic acid has been nicknamed by my personal physician as the "key to the fountain of youth" because it has been noted that at least some people who ingest a lot of Hyaluronan in their diets tend to live to ripe old ages.He told me the enormous benifit of it:1. Hyaluronic acid moisturizes skin from the inside out, smoothing out wrinkles in the process.2. Hyaluronic acid helps people who need to ease the flexing of their joints, especially their knees, by restoring cushioning to their joints.3. Hyaluronic acid is suitable for men and women in their 30s and 40s who are beginning to see the first signs of aging.4. Hyaluronic acid is suitable for seniors who have established joint conditions.My personal physician told me that Hyaluronic acid is essential for the health of the synovial fluid which supports the bones and joints. To maximize the benefit, he asked me to take it with Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM for my joints problems. I decided to have a try and was recommendeded to buy at goo.gl/7CEUP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!! Usually vitamins and supplements take a few months to work but I can tell you that this product has made a DRAMATIC difference to my skin and I've only been taking it for 2 weeks. I am 42 and I have not been kind to my skin due to sun damage and harsh products used on my face for adult acne. I am simply amazed at how moist my skin feels but it's not oily or greasy. I will definitely keep up with this product. I'll let you know when it starts to help my joints which is the initiial reason I ordered the product. :-)
