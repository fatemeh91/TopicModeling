review/text: I've tried various chocolate flavored protein powders, including BSN Syntha-6, Body Fortress, and Designer Whey... this one (Double Rich Chocolate) is by FAR the best when added to milk. I also like that it has a low amount of fat, low amounts of heavy metals, and a high proportion of protein. I've never found a protein powder that successfully dissolves in water/milk through stirring (I always have to shake it in a bottle), but I do notice that this one tends to dissolve faster than others.All in all, a great tasting protein powder that doesn't make me feel nauseous.
