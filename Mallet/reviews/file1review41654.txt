review/text: I immediately noticed two things once I begun using the Oral B triumph over a manual brush. First, it has never been so easy to brush the hard to reach areas of your mouth - the combination of the long head and powerful brushing really made me notice a difference in the back. Secondly me teath never felt this clean before, this brush just left my mouth feeling clean. I recommend anyone thinking about switching to a powered brush from a manual to give it a try - you won't be dissappointed.
