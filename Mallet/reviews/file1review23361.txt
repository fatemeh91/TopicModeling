review/text: I offered my mother these compression stockings given that she is always standing and complains about her legs aching. Her legs feel so much better now but she did mention they were hard to put on. The open toe ones cut the circulation to her toes (I ordered some closed toe ones the second time around). It's too bad I couldn't find them for the same price though, hope it doesn't go up every time I will have to order her some.
