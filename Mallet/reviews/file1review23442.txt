review/text: This stethoscope has been a Godsend to me. It is just as described. Nothing negative to say about it. I like and sincerely appreciate that I CAN hear through LAYERS of clothes. I am a Paramedic and this feature is especially important to me because I don't have to expose elderly nursing home patients (or any patient for that matter) to the extreme elements while trying to assess lung sounds or blood pressures. I don't hear noise from the tires driving down the road while doing assessments like I do with other stethoscopes ( this is typical when outside of a quiet, clinical setting). I like the length of the tubing so I may keep appropriate social distance while assessing. I can hear sounds just as well with this as I could with my Littman Master Cardiology before it was stolen. I refused to invest that type of money into another stethoscope so I bought this one to get equal quality at a lower price. I have been recommending this to other EMS personnel and nurses!!KUDOS!!!
