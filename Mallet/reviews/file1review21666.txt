review/text: Good little tub. Fits just fine in our American Standard regular tub. Little man sometimes pulls the drain plug, so make sure that it is pushed all the way down. The tub is slightly wedge shaped, to help "lock it in" to your tub. We have been using it for 5 months with no problems, little man is now 1 year.
