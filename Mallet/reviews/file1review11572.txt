review/text: I purchased these batteries from NYC Electronics, throug Amazon and received them within the week; I also purchased the Duracell CEF14NC charger. It took 8 hours to charge the batteries, but that charge lasted 14 days in my Microsoft Wireless Entertainment Desktop 8000 Keyboard with lighted keys and Mouse. Giving that I used them 10-12 hours a day, and they were on standby for the rest of the time I am truly impressed. The Energizer batteries that came with the keyboard and mouse had to be charged every day, there is no comparison in the charge between the two batteries. I do believe the original charge of eight hours had something to do with the longevity of the batteries. I just recharged the keyboard and mouse for the first time, with the charger that is part of the total keyboard package; it only took 4 hours to get a full charge for the keyboard and two hours for the mouse. I give both purchases a 5 star rating.
