review/text: The Thermophore standard (14" x 27") moist heating pad is totally amazing. My doctor ordered my first one & It helped me so much that I ordered more & actually gave them to people I know that have either serious arthritis and/Or surgury. They both love it and use it every single day!!! Thank you THermophore & thank you Amazon.com for having these available!!!! This is a serious BLESSING in disguise...God Bless!!! (also, thank you for keeping the price reasonable)
