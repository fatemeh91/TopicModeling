review/text: Got this to clean large workout bottles. This thing is great! High quality OXO Product and it cleans perfectly. It cost a bit more than the average brush from Target, but I really like it. My wife uses it all the time in her large bottles that she uses daily. Amazing how much crud is in those things when you don't brush them out!
