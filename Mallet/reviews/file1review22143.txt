review/text: I've been using TwinLab Daily One capsules for about 10 months. I have borderline anemia so I switched to the Daily One with Iron and my recent blood work came back with my iron levels in the normal range. I don't always take them with a meal, but they have not caused any stomach upset or burping like solid pill-type vitamins do to me.
