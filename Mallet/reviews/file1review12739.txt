review/text: Order this product as a replacement for a SAMS splint I used in the field. I was a tad uneasy about buying a "Non Name Brand" product. Well I am SO SOLD on these splints. Amazon shipped it and I got the package a day earlier than I was told (Bonus points for Amazon) I looked the splint over and placed in my field kit. Less than four days later I had used the splint and I was amazed with the product. It was easier to use than a SAMS and honestly, the splint was built a bit better than the last few SAMS splints I seen and used. Final word on this product, its a great priced splint.PS. The Cilla part of My Company likes the price!
