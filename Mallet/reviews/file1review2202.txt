review/text: I definitely liked the taste of this toothpaste. It's not too sweet like many toothpastes. After using this, my mouth tastes fresher than usual. I'd previously used Rembrandt's Whitening kit, so my teeth were already pretty white, but I noticed that they seemed even whiter after using this toothpaste for about a week.
