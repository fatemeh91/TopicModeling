review/text: This was recommended by my therapist but I am so thankful that he gave me the information. I needed something that I would be able to count on while I was recovering from rotator-cuff surgery and almost spent 4X as much on another product. When I mentioned the other product to him he immediately told me about the Elasto-gel Cervical Collar. The way it contours the shoulder is perfect. There is no need to spend the extra $$ on the "shoulder" kits and you can use this one for many areas of your body(knee,neck, shoulder,etc.) I had just gone though 6 wks. of therapy for a frozen shoulder and now have to recover from the rotator-cuff surgery. With the capabilities of either hot or cold therapy it will enable me to use just this one product. It is comforting to the skin (doesn't freeze it) and will last a long time. They have had theirs at the therapy center forever!! It is worth its weight in gold!! I highly recommend it!
