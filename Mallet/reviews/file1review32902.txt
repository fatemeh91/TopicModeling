review/text: I suffer from chronic constipation due to irritable bowel syndrome, and have tried all kinds of methods to be able to go each day and the only thing that works is Smooth Move tea. And it tastes good, too! One or two bags is all you need and a little sweetener and you're all set. It's all natural and you can use it every day. Works great for someone like me.
