review/text: I have been taking the vitamins for a bit over 1 month now. My hair has stayed the same but on a random day I noticed that my eyebrows changed a bit. My eyebrows sorta grew or darkend a bit, I am not sure which but the shape I usually get with the help of a brow pencil is kinda natural now. I am still waiting for results on my hiar. I think my skin has always been good so am not certain if the pills have any affect.
