review/text: This straw makes it so easy to prepare and drink loose leaf tea. I've always wanted to drink more tea this way, but I guess I was too lazy to go through the process of straining or using one of those little ball-filters. Now all I have to do is dump my tea in the cup, stick the straw in and enjoy!
