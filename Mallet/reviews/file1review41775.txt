review/text: The creation of the electrical toothbrush never really phased me. I always stuck to hand-brushing. But after realizing that oral care is just as important as breathing... I figured I had to purchase an electrical toothbrush to not only wow the dentists when I visit every 6 months, but to also improve my gums and teeth. And that is what exactly happened. Recently I went in for my regular 6-month teeth cleaning and the lady (who knew me from a prior cleaning) told me my teeth and gums were looking better than ever, after only using the product for I believe 1 or 2 months. I'm very happy I spent the 100 dollars and some change to buy this product and I don't regret doing so. I'm really happy I came across this product on Amazom, considering Walgreens and CVS Pharmacy (among other retail stores) were charging $30+ more than what Amazon was offering it for.Thank you Oral-B for providing such a great product.Thank you Amazon for providing a great price.
