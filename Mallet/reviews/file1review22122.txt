review/text: When I saw this listed in the baby products, I thought "What a great way to take my baby's temperature." Naturally, though, I wanted to try out the product on myself first before the time came that I would need to use it on my baby. I sucked and sucked and sucked on the digital pacifier (it says sucking must be for atleast 90 seconds), and finally after 4 minutes, the pacifier registered my temperature. Then, I used traditional oral thermometer to compare the results. The digital pacifier registered my temperature 2 degrees lower than the traditional thermometer (not a good sign, in my opinion). Needless to say, I probably will be buying another thermometer (perhaps the 3-way thermometer; can take temperature orally, rectally, or under the arm in less than 5 seconds supposedly) for my baby when the times comes. As mentioned in the title, this digital pacifier thermometer is a great concept, but still needs to be worked on.
