review/text: Big Pharma hates homeopathy because the remedies can't be patented and they actually do help people get well.Example: Several years ago I worked in AIDS clinics in East Africa that only use homeopathy. For $1 to $2 per person per month we CURED people of full-blown AIDS. Not suppressing it temporarily as the anti-retro virals do, but cured it.CD4 counts went from 12 to around 1027 (normal CD4 counts, which measure the activity of the immune system, range from 750 to 1150). People looked and felt well for the first time in many years. They were able to take care of themselves and their families.So these turkeys who post loooong reviews not of the product but of the practice are very likely Big Pharmacy hacks trying to sew doubt about a very effective and very inexpensive way to achieve and maintain health.Your choice, your health.
