review/text: I have very sensitive skin and can wear only 100% cotton. Any clothing label has to be cut off or I go crazy with itch and redness. My son is the same way. This is so soothing to itchy feet or belly button. It's not a bad price, but I'd like to buy a larger bottle if possible. It's very thin, so watch you don't lose too much when you squeeze the bottle. I actually just let it dribble out on it's own. It doesn't take much, so I feel it's a good value and very soothing to skin.
