review/text: I have been taking these over a year together with Lutein and Zeaxanthin. When I went in for my annual check up there was no change, so it is working for me. I have the beginning stages, hopefully with this regiment I can continue to keep it that way, hopefully, it will go away. My Father had Magular Degeneration, and I was told it runs in the family.
