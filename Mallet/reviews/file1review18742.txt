review/text: When applied to my three head rotary shaver, I was very pleased at the results. A Couple of drops applied to each shaving head, ran for a few seconds, and then applied to my three day moderate beard. Shaver ran Cool, Efficent, and I received a smooth, comfortable shave. My face felt like it was free of post shaving dryness, yet NOT greasy like some lotions can leave it feeling. Granted, this oil is designed for "Clippers" but its light enough for my shaver. Priced FAR FAR lower than some "Aerosols" that are nothing but expensive alcohol based cleaners, that DO NOT work, this bottle will last for MONTHS. I tend to be VERY critical of products that DO NOT work, so when I find something that DOES, I will do my best to share it.Bottom line, Odorless, NON-Greasy, , Evironmentally Friendly.
