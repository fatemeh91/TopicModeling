review/text: I find this Rollator/Transaport chair to be very useful. As a Parkinson's patient, I tire easily. With this chair I can walk and when I get tired I can sit. If I am walking too slow I can sit and be pushed along. It is easy to fold, just don't forget about the cord under the seat to pull up the legs. This is a great mobility aid.
