review/text: There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle. The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today. You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!
