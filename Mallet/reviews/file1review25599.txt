review/text: Don't even THINK of using this for anything but the stated purpose. I've yet to see anything on the market for my particular affliction: dingleberries (no, not the unfortunately named Christmas cookie.) Despite my guyish partiality to gadgets, I'd recommend a simple bikini waxing kit until the free market recognizes this great need. If you've already similarly misused the ER411NC, try Band-Aid Liquid Bandage Skin Crack Gel. Traditional strip bandages just don't work up there.
