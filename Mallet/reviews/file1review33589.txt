review/text: I had this model for 10 years before it broke down 2 months ago. I ordered the same model thinking if it lasted 10 years, it's good enough. Not so. I can't get a hard pulse; only works on the lowest pulsing. I have many caps so I must maintain healthy gums. I won't give up on Waterpik, however, so I am ordering the next model up and hoping I have better results.
