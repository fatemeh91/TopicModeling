review/text: On first usage, I noticed the next morning that only one pair of batteries showed a green light. I tested all four and it seemed like they were all charged, but the charge didn't hold when I tried to use them in my camera about a week later. Nimh batteries are supposed to keep their charge much longer. I got this at special pricing (around $6 or $7) due to my camera purchase, so I didn't bother sending it back at any additional cost.
