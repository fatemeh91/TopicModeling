review/text: This puppy just plain works, and is worth the price. The heat gets to be just a tad too hot if you leave it on--meaning you have real temperature control for once! We haven't had ours long, but out of the box it worked as promised. It's also much quieter than we expected, even with the jets on full blast. Try the Earth Therapuetics Tea Tree Oil foot soak (salts) and Foot Balm; they worked impressively well on my poor wife's feet--and my hands!
