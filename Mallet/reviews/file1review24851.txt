review/text: I have PCOS and have been TTC for almost 4 years now. I have been to a fertility doctor and stopped going right before starting shots. My body did not respond to clomid. I have very irregular periods about 1 a year on my own. I have lost about 70 pounds and read all the rave reviews on this product so I decided to give it a go. The first month nothing, the second nothing, the third month nothing. The website said allow 3 months so I went and had a blood pregnancy test done just to be sure I wasn't and decided to give it 1 more month so 4 months and nothing happened. Please women do not get your hopes up on this one like I did. You nay be sadly lead into believing it will definitely work for you because you are irregular.
