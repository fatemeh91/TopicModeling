review/text: My four-year-old struggles with BMs and after working with a gastro doctor to try plenty of medicines, we have found that Little Tummies Laxative works the best. After looking at it and smelling it, I don't even think I want to try giving this to him straight, so we mix it in with some juice or chocolate milk and it works wonders. We don't even need to mix it with a lot of juice or milk, just enough to help dull what seems like an iffy tasting medicine. But it has been the only thing to keep him regular.
