review/text: I've been taking Zantrex 3 Fat Burner for about 2 weeks now and I've lost maybe 5 pounds. It's great as an appetite suppressor. I take two capsules in the morning, drink lots of water, eat maybe a granola bar or two for breakfast and that's all I need until lunch where I'll take two more capsules and have something small like a salad. If you don't mind a product that makes it so you just don't feel like eating, it's great. I almost never feel like eating dinner and when I do it's just some soup or something small. Whereas before I was chowing down like a pig.I recommend this to anyone who's problem is over-eating.
