review/text: I really like this gel face mask. Every once in a while I get bad headaches and putting a cold compress on my eyes makes it feel much better. What's really nice about this product is that it isn't "too cold" coming out of the freezer so you can start wearing it right away. One downside in my opinion is that it warms up somewhat fast so the cooling feeling does fade away. I will be buying a second mask so that I can use one and have a second in the freezer if I need to use it longer once it gets warm.Be careful to read the directions. The mask can't get wet and when store in the freezer it should be kept in a sealed zipper bag to prevent moisture.There was also a small issue with the stitching because after my thrird use I noticed that the stitching along the top of the mask popped open a little. The stitching that came out made a hole in the fabric of about 1/8th of an inch so it really isn't an issue. I think that I may have been laying down on my side and when I moved I tugged on the mask. The product is high quality so I think it was really just my fault that a small tear happened. This didn't impact the use of the mask in any way, and despite this I am still planning to purchase a second mask. I highly suggest this to anyone who would like a face mask that you can use for cold and hot temps.
