review/text: I've owned a few Braun shavers before, and have always thought them very good. The Cruzer is no exception - it's a good shaver. It's so-so as a trimmer. It's rated 100~240V, so it will be good in several countries. I'd give it a 5 as a shaver and a 3 as a trimmer, so it gets a 4 overall.
