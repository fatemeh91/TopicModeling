review/text: It should have been easy to predict that my cane tips would wear through & I'd be like SKIDDING on ice. Living in the woods with a gravel driveway equals "wear & Tear" big time.It isn't always possible to get to the hardware store & picking up the 'phone or ordering via the 'net is simpler. "Next Time" my back-up TIPs will be in a safe spot to assure that steel-reinforced rubber is here to save my day . . . always an item near the top of my "best buy" list.
