review/text: I had one of these a few year ago and it just stopped working one day after about 5 years. I tried other adjustable trimmers and the types that have the attachable plastic guards, which are the worst!!! This unit is great and adjusts easily to any trim length. Can also use a comb to help create an even trim if desired. I use it mainly for my bread to keep it a certain length, the 3 day unshaven look. It also great for triming other areas of the body if you need to do that as well. Hopefully this last a lot longer than 5 years. If so, then it's five stars!!
