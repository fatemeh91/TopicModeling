review/text: My eye doctor recommended this supplement of vitamins for dry eyes. Excellent product, it does help alot, no more dry eyes. I looked for this product elsewhere in stores.Only Amazon had the product I was looking for. Price is affordable also. Also those omega 3's are good at lower cholesterol levels.So I hear. I haven't checked into that yet.
