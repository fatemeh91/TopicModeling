review/text: All ACT Mouthrinses have .05% Sodium Flouride as their active ingredient. Fluoride disasociates into its ion form in the mouth and will bond with the tooth enamel forming a harder enamel crystal. Thus, it strenghtens enamel and makes teeth more resistant to decay. Studies show a reduction of 40% in kids who use this product daily, and a 71% reduction in root caries in older adults. So it makes sense to use a fluoridated mouthwash.This product is to be kept away from children under 6 who may inadvertantly drink the whole bottle, thus getting a case of fluoride toxicity in the process. These containers do come with a child-proof cap.The only ACT fluoride rinse that has alcohol in it is ACT Restoring Anti-cavity Mouthwash. The 11% alcohol content is added to kill bacteria. Keep alcohol products out of the reach of children due to the potential for alcohol abuse. I tend to avoid alcohol mouthrinses and prefer those that are non-alcohol. Alcohol is associated with tender oral tissues (dry) with chronic repeated use, and with unusually excessive use (many times per day), alcohol is a potential carcinogen.As a dentist, I recommend a 30 second to 1 minute rinse once per day, preferably at night before bed. If you have little or no cavities, this product is not really necessary. However, if you are one of those people who get cavites regularly or from time to time, this is a product that can save you the cost and trauma of going to the dentist to get a filling. Recommended for all kids ages 6 - 18, and for adults who still get decay. Again, choose an ACT fluoride that has no alcohol - it is better for the long-haul.Dr. Jim Koenig, DDS
