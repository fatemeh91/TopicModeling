review/text: Received this product in the mail really fast - was very excited. Plugged it in for the recommended 16 hours however it didnt charge.The charge light lit up for the first 10 minutes of charging before going out. I was unable to use this product at all !!!!!very dissapointed.Can't comment on its useability as I simply couldn't even turn it on!Overall a terrible experience
