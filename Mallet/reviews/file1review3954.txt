review/text: This product has a pleasant, mild malt taste. I purchased 1 box and took the 5 Tbs. dose twice daily until gone. I have a bit of a sluggish digestive system and I noticed improvement within the first dose, however once the product was gone my system struggled even harder to regulate itself. I probably needed to purchase a couple of boxes and stay on the product longer. Also, there was no measuring spoon included in my product. The instructions do give an equivalent though.As an afterthought, I have digested dairy products much easier since taking this product. If I could give it 4.5 I would.
