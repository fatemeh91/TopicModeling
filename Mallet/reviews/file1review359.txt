review/text: Nothing more to say, it did the trick quite nicely - in fact probably a little too powerful for her so didn't take it to the highest setting...don't know if she has done by herself or not since? Nice that it's waterproof, makes cleanup a lot more reassuring. Brought a smile to her face & she was very grateful!As warned, the size may be a little bit of a shock (but a little warm up and some lube does the trick nicely). Take it easy, go slow to start with & enjoy.
