review/text: If you're looking to add L-Arginine to your diet--which I highly recommend--go with this product. It is extremely high quality and the price is right on. The only poor reviews this gets is because of the taste. If you're new to taking amino acids in powder form, it will take a little, but only a little, time to get used to. However, I use this daily in a morning smoothie, and you cannot taste it at all. Zero. I also take it nightly in a bit of water. Then you can taste it, but its not so bad.
