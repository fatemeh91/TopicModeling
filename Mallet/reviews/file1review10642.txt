review/text: This is great, especially for frugal folks like myself. I received it quickly. It's a roll of PH test strips in a sturdy plastic dispenser which has a PH legend on it. You just have to tear off a tiny strip, although the directions instruct using a one inch strip, less can be used. I have probably used it enough times to equal to buying a couple of packages of the test strips with the white "handles" and I still have lots of the roll left. I highly recommend this. I think it's fun to use, too! It's great to get a product that exceeds expectations.
