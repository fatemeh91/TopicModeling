review/text: ON really hit a home run on the cake batter. I hope they make it a permanent flavor (it's limited edition) because it's definitely my favorite flavor I've had yet. It doesn't seem super cake-battery tasting but its a sweet vanilla-type goodness. I haven't tried it with water but I usually mix it with just 6 ounces of milk to get the thick batter experience. Lumps not an issue, mixes great. All around awesome buy!
