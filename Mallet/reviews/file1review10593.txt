review/text: This is definitely a handy item. I have only recently had hand problems, so it is tough to adjust, but after months of fumbles, strains, and sprains of my fingers and hands trying to do what I used to do, I gave up and bought this. It makes it so easy now to open many items with ease. I wish it came with a belt loop holder to keep it on me all the time. In the past I would have made myself one, but can't do that anymore.This item was so great I have bought one for friends and family members who also have the same problems I do.
