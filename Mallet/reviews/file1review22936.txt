review/text: For years I put off buying this sweeper because although it could sweep with the best of them......everyone complained about a flaw design which caused the handle to pull apart when you tried to use the sweeperI was reminded of this problem 2 weeks ago when I went to my Time Share Unit and saw the handle separate repeatedly on an older modelThe sweeper worked great except for this flaw so ......I ordered one when I got home and was planning on using " gorilla tape " to keep the handle from coming apartTo my pleasant surprise.....I received my new Bissell Sturdy Sweeper this week and discovered that I did not need to use " gorilla tape " or anything else because Bissell had corrected this design flaw and all parts of the handle screwed together nicelyProblem Solved !-- Well Done Bissell !!
