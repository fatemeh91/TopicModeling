review/text: I bought this item in March of 2011.Almost 2 years later, and with CONSTANT, REGULAR, FREQUENT daily use in our business office kitchen, the bristles have kept their integrity.This is wholly unlike most dish brushes which lose their shape and become annoyingly flat on the side you use the most, thereby rendering the brush USELESS.HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The only note for potential buyers is the brush I bought 2 years ago had a completely black handle, not the black/white one shown in the photo, so don't be shocked if you get something different!
