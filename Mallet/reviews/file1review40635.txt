review/text: it will be more nicer if one of the diaphragms is pediatrics size & the other is adult size & the metal used is lighterit is a little bulgy, because of the two big diaphragm, the bell should not skewed it has to be fixed on the support partif Welch Allyn make these changes & use lighter metal this Stethoscope will be the best ever
