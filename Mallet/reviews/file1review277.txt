review/text: My fiancee absolutely adores this thing..If it cud open jars and reach high stuff im pretty sure i would't serve any purpous..lol..Seriously though..She loves it..Amazing valentine present..Best present ever apparently..The smell aint all that bad just like plastic really..Seems to work its magic pretty quick..Already said when its been exhausted she wants another one..She genuinely seems delighted with it.. Sooo .. If u wanna walk around with a massive smile on your face ladies..buy one of these :P But let your man open the jars even if u can..We do have a little bit of dignity even if its only a little bit.
