review/text: Mine worked wonders at first. But like a bunch of other reviewers it just quit one morning. I tried washing the tip but now it just makes an awful racket when I can get it to work. The blades seem very fragile. It appears after some usage the blades gum up and get distorted. It doesn't take much to make it quit. I don't expect it to last forever, but I did expect it to last longer than it did. I'll be looking for a different product as a replacement.
