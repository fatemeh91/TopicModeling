review/text: $3.50 every time you change blades is just insane. May I recommend Gillette's 'Good News Pivot Plus with Lubrastrip' 12 pack for 50 cents each. And there's a guy selling Platinum double-edge blades on ebay for fifteen cents. A lot of people think these things are better than the Fusion /or/ the Pivot. Lots of hype, but Gillette has gone backwards in the past fifty years in my opinion. I will say one thing: the Pivot Plus is a marvel of plastics technology and quality control. It gives a pretty good shave, but not as good as the double-edges I used as a kid.
