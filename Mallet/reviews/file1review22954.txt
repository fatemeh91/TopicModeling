review/text: I really wish this sweeper worked properly but it just doesn't. All the reviews about the stick falling apart are true. I do not see how it is possible to enjoy using this sweeper when the stick always coming apart. You have connect about 4 pieces of metal to create the metal pole which connects the little sweeper to the handle but within a minute of normal use it falls apart and does not stay together.For the few seconds it did stay together it did clean my rug pretty well however it is completely useless for ceramic tiles. I didn't try it on hard wood floors however based on the terrible performance on ceramic tiles I bet it would be useless on hard wood floors.
