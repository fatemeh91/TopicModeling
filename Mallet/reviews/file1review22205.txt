review/text: I use them for home made baby food. I pour hot baby food in them and put them in freezer. From the freezer into the microwave and then to the dishwasher.So far they were very durable and no leaks. Kept their shape and color as if they were new.BPA free. 1 cup \ 8 oz containers.The size and shape are great to use them as a bowl for the baby. You don't need to use more dishes during meal time.When full I can stack up to 3 to 4 containers. More than that is not stable.Stackable when empty. Lids do not interlock with each other, but they are stackable as well.These are very inexpensive baby food containers. Perfect solution!
