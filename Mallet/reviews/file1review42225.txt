review/text: I wanted to give this Item a zero star rating but wasn't allowed to do so. I was searching for an item to enlarge my breast and the search engine showed me this product. The product is called Women's Dual Exerciser Breast Enhancement Pump so I thought it would enhance my boobs; i was soo wrong. When I recieved the product there was a woman with her breast exposed on the side of the package as well as sexual statements written all over the box. I didn't know it was made by Doc Johnson; if i known that I would have never brought this product in the first place. If your're buying this product for sexual satisfaction or for breast enlargement and your breast cup size is an AA/A then this is NOT the product for you. I was warned before buying this product from another unsatisfied buyer and didn't listen; do not be like me. This product is made up of a very, very hard plastic; mines snaped and broke before I had the chance to even use it that's how hard it is. For the last time...the happy customer is someone who doesn't mind hard /tough products on their body, use suction for sexual satisfaction, and whos breast are at least a full B cup and above. Good Luck!!!
