review/text: I had previously been very satisfied with this product, but my first, and only, 4-count package from Amazon had defective "Lubrastrips" that curled, leaving sharp edges that could cut facial skin -- and did. The strip was still mostly green, indicating that it should have been good for additional shaves. The strips on all four blades in the package curled and one fell off. Perhaps there is a manufacturing difference in the blades sold here versus in stores, or perhaps it was just a bad lot. I would've given the blades I purchased in stores five stars for sharpness and longevity.See the user loaded photo of a blade with a curled strip (if Amazon hasn't removed it, again).
