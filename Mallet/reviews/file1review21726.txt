review/text: Bought this for my baby granddaughter's recent visit. My daughter is so happy with it that she wants to take it home with her! Nice size. Soft for baby.Has a large suction cup to hang it from the shower wall when not in use and has a drain hole at opposite end so drains and dries nicely
