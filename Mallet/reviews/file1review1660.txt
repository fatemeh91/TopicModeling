review/text: I have used Bragg's Liquid Aminos (BLA) for a couple decades now, but I'm not so sure anymore. I have read the comments at http://www.welikeitraw.com/rawfood/2005/06/bragg_liquid_am.html (if the link is deleted, do a search for Brag Liquid Aminos at the welikeitraw dot com web site). Glutamic Acid and MSG do naturally occur in foods, so their presence is not an indication that the product is harmful. Claims that the soybeans are broken down with hydrochloric acid and then the acid is neutralized with a base substance, like baking soda. However, BLA does not contain much sodium. So, as an experiment, I am laying off the Bragg's for a while and using natural herbal seasonings like powdered cayenne, garlic, onion, kelp, etc., just to see what happens.
