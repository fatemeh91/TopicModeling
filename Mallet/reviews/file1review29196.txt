review/text: These oral b brushes are fantastic. in some cases they are cheaper than crest battery powered brushes, and certainly use less battery power, so batteries last much longer in oral b brushes than crest.plus! even small hands can hold the brush, as the handle is narrower diameter than crest brushes!
