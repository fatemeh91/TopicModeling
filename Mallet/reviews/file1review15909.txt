review/text: What a waste of money. If you are able to get this product on correctly (good luck) , it is horrible. When I received it I wasnt having any back or pelvic pain. OnceI put it on my back started to hurt. And have fun sitting with this thing. Itll just put pressure on your belly and offers no back support when sitting. The ASP, goes on first, just puts pressure on your back. It almost didnt make any sense for it to go on first. Im so dissappointed.
