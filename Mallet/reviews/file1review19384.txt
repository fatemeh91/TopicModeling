review/text: I've been taking this multi for about a year now, and I couldnt live without them. I have suffered from severe pms symptoms for years, and this is the only thing that has helped me. I used to have 2 weeks of pms symptoms, bloating, hunger, cramps, bad mood, depression, etc. Ever since taknig these, my symptoms have disappeared. When I dont take them for a few weeks the symptoms come right back, so I know for sure it is the vitamin working. In addition to all that it keeps me energized and feeling healthy! Love them!! The only downfall is they taste really bad, and are hard to swallow. Something I can live with to be free of severe pms.
