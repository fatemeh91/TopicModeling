review/text: I bought this as a 2nd toothbrush for my girlfriend who visits on the weekends. She normally uses the one that rotates by Oral B. After using this sonic TB she wants to take it home and leave the old one at my house. I highly recommend this TB. Had it since October '09 and have had no problems with it. Only lacks the travel case which you can easily rig one up but that would have been a nice accessory.
