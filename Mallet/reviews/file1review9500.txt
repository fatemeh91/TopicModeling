review/text: The machine works fine, but a lay person may have trouble poking finger and squeezing a LARGE drop of blood onto the strip to make it work. Take practice. It works similar to a glucometer used to check blood sugar for diabetes except it requires a much bigger drop of blood and the strips are much more expensive. Another caveat is it only gives you the TOTAL cholesterol level. If you have cholesterol checked at doctor's office, you usually get total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, and LDL levels.
