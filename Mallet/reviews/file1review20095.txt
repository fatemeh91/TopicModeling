review/text: I came to this product looking for help with pms issues and pre-menopause issues. I was having ovary pain, bad cramps, low libido and mood swings. My periods were very irregular and problematic. After taking DIM, I am totally regulated. I have almost no pain and I have no mood swings at all. I use this product with Emerita natural progesterone. This combo is so much better than the birth control pill. Birth control pills were not working for me at all and they gave me heart palpitations. I had my tubes tied so I don't need the contraception. This product is amazing, it changed my life.update 8/10/12-still taking DIM and glad. have heard lots about its anti cancer propeties- u can google that. anyways, havent had hot flashes or weird periods since using this with the emerita progesterone cream. cant complain. i have lost two friends to blood clots due to the birth control pill in the last year, they put too much cr*p in those pills, its not healthy. so glad to be on something natural.
