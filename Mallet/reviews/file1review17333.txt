review/text: I grew a beard for the first time after surgery but decided I wanted a neat look, not stubble like I forgot to shave or something out of the back woods. This very reasonably priced trimmer has allowed me my fantasy of looking sophisticated, and I haven't yet managed to shave off half of my new facial hair while admiring the other side. My beard is carefully trimmed, and I hope to keep it that way. I was able to progressively reduce the length until I found a look that I like. Nine positions is more than enough. I'd give the trimmer 5 stars, but am saving the fifth for one that can shave the spaces in between.
