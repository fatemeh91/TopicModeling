review/text: I take well over 20 vitamins a day from calcium to B12 to iron and some of the pills need to be spaced out and/or taken at particular times. I love this pill organizer. It has simplified my life and made the process of taking what I need to take to stay healthy less of a chore. The compartments are deep and handle even the largest vitamins. I purchased two of these organizers and am now able to fill 14 days worth of vitamins so I am not wasting precious moments in the morning trying to figure out which vitamins I need and when I need to take them. Each square easily fits in most purses and they are sturdy enough for traveling. I have had no problems with the lids opening in transit. The lids are also easy to open for filling.
