review/text: I purchased this to use on my son's twin bed. He's still getting used to not wearing diapers at night. Unfortunately, I have had the need to wash this liner SEVERAL times. Comes out great every time. I wash with warm water, being careful not to overcrowd the washer (I have a front loader). Then to dry, I use my timed setting with the lowest heat setting for about 45 minutes, again not overcrowding the dryer. Perfect every time. Also, I have not had any leaking onto the mattress. It's great quality. Knit jersey is the fabric that stretches over the edges of the mattress. Very soft and gives a bit of 'padded' feel on top. It's way better than another product I purchased only slightly cheaper at the local big box store for the same purpose! Would definitely purchase this product again!
