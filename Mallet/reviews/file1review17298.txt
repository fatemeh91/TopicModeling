review/text: After 5.5 solid years with my previous Remington trimmer, I expected a similarly pleasant experience with the 200. Instead I have had only problems.It's one plus: it shaves well.On the negative side: it only shaves well when it's plugged into a wall socket. Thankfully, my beard is short, I couldn't even imagine using it for thicker hair.Though it shaves nicely when plugged-in, the charger burnt out after 3.5 weeks. The batteries proceeded to last only two shaves without a recharge. What if I was away on a business trip?Either I had great luck with my first Remington or miserable luck with the newest Remington.
