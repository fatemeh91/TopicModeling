review/text: I have been cloth diapering my son since birth. These diapers were perfect when he was a newborn. I folded them in thirds and then in half. I stored them like that, and then when I needed to use them, the size fit perfectly into my thirsties x-small wraps and made a great diaper! They are thin, but a newborn needs frequent diaper changes anyway and they fit very well.You also cannot beat the price! I loved that when I needed more diapers I just had to do laundry, too!I started changing what diapers I used with bigger covers as he got bigger, but these were great at first because they didn't provide bulk when he was tiny. I now use heavy duty prefolds with covers. These diapers still come in handy for rags, burp cloths, everything else. Most of mine are stored away patiently awaiting my next child.
