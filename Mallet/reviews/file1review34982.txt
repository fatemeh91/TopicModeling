review/text: I agree with some of the other reviews that I can't tell if it's really working or not. I have major bowel issues and wanted to get off fiber, psyllium and all that stuff, so started using it at first with 47 pistashios, Dr. Andrew Weil's cure for all stomach ailments. I ended up with the runs that were awful! So now I am still using what I have along with Organic Papaya Juice that I also buy at Amazon.com because it is impossible to find in the stores. Not even Whole Foods carries pure papaya juice. Papaya juice is well known for digestive issues and according to Dr. Oz, speeds up the rate of digestion which is my problem. It seems to be working but I am not sure if it just the juice.
