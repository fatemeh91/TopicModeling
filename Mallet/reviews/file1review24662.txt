review/text: I am in college and noticed that I was gaining weight quickly. Two months after going off to college I realized I needed to do something and needed it to work fast. I found Zantrex online and thought I would give it a shot. The first night I used it before dinner and noticed that while eating the meal I did not feel less hungry but by the time I was done I could was not in the mood for anything. The rest of the night I did not eat one thing because I had no appetite for it. That was the only night where I felt restless and weird. Since then, it has worked like an absolute charm. It has done everything I wanted it to. I dont eat after dinner and barely anything throughout the afternoon. I lost three pounds in four days and have been using it for a solid month, skipping days here and there where I feel the pill is not necessary. It has given me so much energy to work out and I never feel super tired afterwards. I am in the best shape now and plan on using the Zantrex until I run out. Then, I think I will have enough motivation to keep everything up on my own. This past week, I have noticed that the pill is slowly having lighter impacts on my appetite. It gives me more energy than it does decrease my appetite. I would recommend taking it no later than 6:00 because it could keep you up for a while. A half hour before a meal works good for me. Zantrex does work, very well. No heart attack feelings, no sweating, no extreme hunger. It has been a great experience so far. I have lost six pounds and I recommend it!
