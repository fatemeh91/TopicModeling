review/text: The fiber doesn't dissolve in water the way I hoped it would. Yes, I followed the instructions precisely but the fiber itself clumps and expands rather quickly. The texture doesn't suit me when puffy balls of tasteless mush are needing to go down. Instead of using it in a beverage I will have to use the rest of the can in dry applications...and not purchase again. I really wanted this product to work out for me but no...
