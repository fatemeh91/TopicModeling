review/text: The Clean Day Surface Scrub (geranium scented) was the first Mrs. Meyers product that I tried. I wondered if it would clean as effectively as some of the stronger chemical scrubs. Much to my delight, the scrub was exceptional and actually removed several stains on my countertop that Clorox Cleanup wouldn't budge. I'm not overly sensitive to smells, but I think that this scrub has just the right amount of scent, and I wouldn't characterize it as strong at all. It's a product that really works and leaves a very light, clean scent.
