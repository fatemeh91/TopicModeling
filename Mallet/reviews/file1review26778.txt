review/text: Let's face it:After a good workout WHEY protein is what you need - nothing else.This product is relatively reasonably priced (considering the ingredients) and its definitely worked for me.(I work out daily and take 3 protein shakes in addition to 4 meals a day; I have tried pretty much ALL Whey proteins, but this one seems to give me the best results)To all insiders - no issues with excessive &#34;gas&#34; here! :)Top product which I will continue to use.
