review/text: I used hot water to mold these trays. The trays shrunk after a few seconds on the hot water, after making sure that it's not too hot for molding - I proceeded and got my trays properly indented with my teeth. The trays also cools very fast, so you got to work fast with molding too. I trimmed the excess by using a regular scissor. It did not change shape after cooling off.
