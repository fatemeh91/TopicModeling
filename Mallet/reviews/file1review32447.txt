review/text: Used this for a recent trip to Disney. Worked great on the stroller. We were able to put 3-4 regular bottles of water or sippy cup combo in and still be able to fold the stroller easily. My husband at first thought this was a strange item when I bought it but it really comes in handy and is so unobtrusive you can easily just keep it there for when you need it.
