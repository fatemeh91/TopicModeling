review/text: I got this to replace my older (but newer model) MS2-390. The 200 is just as good a shave, but the battery lasts about 3-5 days, where the 390 would go a whole week before needing recharged. I got the factory-refurbished, and the pop-up trimmer doesn't go half-way, like one adjustment should, which is not a big deal, just a slight miss of quality control. Overall, I like the Remington Titanium MicroScreen shavers more than any other that I've had, including a Braun, and a Panasonic. I just don't think the best ones need to be as expensive as they are, and that's why I compromised for a lesser model. They do the same job with a quick, close, daily shave, but maybe without all the bells and whistles.
