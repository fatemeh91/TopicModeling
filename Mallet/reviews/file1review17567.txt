review/text: I was a little hesitant to buy this trimmer after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad I bought it. It has worked well for me. I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I had nothing to compare it with. This was the first time ever I grew a beard. I found the settings worked very well and was able to get a nice even trim and lots of complements.**Update: I reduced this form 4 stars to 2 stars simply because the battery does not hold a charge, and you can't use it while plugged in to recharge. I have some time ago shaved off my beard.
