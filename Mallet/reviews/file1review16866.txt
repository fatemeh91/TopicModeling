review/text: The first thing I noticed when I received the Squish is how BIG it is! I bought it for the purpose of plane travel, and this pillow is seriously 2-3 times the size of a travel pillow. It is overstuffed.Which is great news if you want to use it lying down, or even (as I did) as a substitute seat cushion (I used it like a coccyx suspending donut cushion, and it worked crudely but it worked!) With its donut shape, it also works surprisingly well as a substitute for a regular pillow when sleeping, especially if you are having trouble sleeping and need to find a strange angle to get comfortable.It was comfy to use in a recliner around my neck while watching TV. It is IMPOSSIBLe to use it sitting in an average pitch flight seat and be comfortable. It is also VERY UNCOMORTABLE to use in other normal non-reclinig seat positions.Also, because it's so overstuffed and big, it is unwieldy to take onto planes. It much squishier than other similar pillows and has a lot of other unexpected uses so I give it 4 stars, but it is definitely NOT suited for travel like I intended. I'll buy a (more expesnive) travel pillow and use this around the house.I never tested the massage function, but even w/o it, for the price of roughly $15, it's not a bad deal.
