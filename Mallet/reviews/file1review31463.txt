review/text: I love this wax. I have PCOS and it causes me to have more hair on my face then I should have. I bought this from a salon store and thought hey lets see if it works? It did. No you don't need muslin strips to take it off but it helps and if you don't have muslin use coffee filters. If you don't follow the directions then this product doesn't work right. Hope this was helpful.
