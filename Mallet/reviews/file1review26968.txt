review/text: This Whey Protein is absolutely delicious. If somebody served it up to me in a glass and told me it was a light chocolate milk I would never know the difference! To be fair, I have not tried other protein powders so I can't compare, but this one really does taste amazing.In terms of performance, it is always difficult to tell if a protein powder is working. I would say it is. Over a 6 month span of working out and consuming ON Whey I was able to see muscles take shape across my body and put on about 8 pounds - not of fat either. I would say this stuff works pretty well for me and based on reviews for most other people as well.
