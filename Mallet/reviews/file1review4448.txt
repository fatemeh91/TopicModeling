review/text: I started shaving using the Gillette Fusion Proglide manual razor for a long time, but wanted to see what the cheaper version would be like. To my amazement, it was better for a few reasons. The first is that the blades seem to be thicker than the proglide razor and make it easier to cut through thicker hair without much pulling. I tend to shave every other day so the regular fusion blades seem to cut through a light beard easier. I also seemed to get less irritation using the regular fusion blades due to the increased surface area below the blades. On the proglide, this "squeegee" is reduced a lot and every otherday or two I would get some irritation. So if your looking for a cheaper alternative to the proglide, I would say stick to the regular fusion blades and save a couple bucks.
