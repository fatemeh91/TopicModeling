review/text: I found Doctor's Brush Picks several years ago & fell in love with them. I find them gentle & easy to use which translates to my be able to keep my gums healthier. Unfortunately I can no longer find them in stores. The price on Amazon is good & being able to purchase in a larger quanity is a huge plus.
