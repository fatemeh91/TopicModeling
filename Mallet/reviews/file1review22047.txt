review/text: I used this product for our son until he was 1 1/2 years old. He never had ANY dry patches and he had many comments on the pleasent smell and his soft skin. My son was a preemie and we were very picky as to what went on his skin during his first year or so of life. I never had an issues with this product and I would freely recommend it use for all members of the household.
