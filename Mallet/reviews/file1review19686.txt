review/text: I was skeptical about buying such an expensive potty seat (I previously bought the $10 seats that slip around all the time). I started toilet training my 2.5 yr old son and he immediately felt comfortable on this seat. It stays put even when we don't have time to tighten the ring all the way. He felt confident on it and and could easily get on/off by himself after 2 weeks of steady use. This seat is completely worth the money, imo, since it relieved some of my stress about how the training process would go. Awesome product.
