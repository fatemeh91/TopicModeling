review/text: for sneakers these work and they do help me feel less foot pain...however they are too wide for leather shoes or boots. Even my wide feet fit in my boots but these don't!They also make my foot too tall to fit in most shoes. I would prefer an option with no cushioning so I can add them to shoes and still have room for my foot.They are all around too bulky
