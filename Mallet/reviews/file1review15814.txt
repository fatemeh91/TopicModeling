review/text: Every morning I woke up, had breakfast, got dressed and went to sleep on the sofa the rest of they day because I was in so much pain. I had no life. My doctor recommended this product to me. He said it might be a month before I could tell a difference. In less than a week, I was able to function again and had my life back. I would recommend this product to anyone who has severe osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia.
