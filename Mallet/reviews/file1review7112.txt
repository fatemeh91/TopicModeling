review/text: I bought this shaver a few weeks ago. I have previously used Remington & Braun. To be honest I had never heard of Wahl before but it was a good price at my local store. At first I thought the multi-head idea was just a gimmick but I have to tell you - I have never gotten as close a shave with any other shaver than I have with this one using the "super close" shaving head. I like being able to choose a particular head based on the level of growth. Although it feels plasticky (ok, it is plastic!) and somewhat cheap, the shave is remarkable and a real delight. Replacement heads and cutters are less than competing brands. I'm very happy with my choice.UPDATE: FEB/2011: This shaver doesn't fail to impress. It still gives a great shave. The blades last forever (still haven't changed them!) and the Super Close foil gives an incredibly close, clean shave. I love it.
