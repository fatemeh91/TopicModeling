review/text: I purchased the Thermoskin Arthritic gloves, size medium, as suggested by my physician. The intended purpose was to help use my fingers/hands with less strain and pain, as I have arthritis/R.A. in joints of hands. The activities which have been bothering me are things like keyboard typing/ using the mouse, some handwriting, working with beads/jewelry making, and some light sewing projects. First reaction was that movement of fingers became much too clumsy while wearing these gloves. The size I ordered is correct (I used measurement chart) but I was surprised by how thick they are (incl. along the fingers). The exterior finish is quite scratchy/prickly, so I found it tends to catch on some fabrics. After a while, my hands felt somewhat sweaty, while fingertips become too cold.Since I also do various other outdoor activities, such as gardening, raking, more recently, some shoveling and driving, it looks like these gloves may help to protect and stabilize my hands/fingers during these activities. However, to keep gloves clean and/or hands warm (if weather is cold/ depending on what I am doing), then I need to find roomy enough workgloves/ mittens to wear over them. Driving with them is about the only activity where I can use them 'as is'. My conclusion is some folks, like myself, might find their use limited, mainly due to their bulkiness. I will still keep them for tasks that use the entire hand, but not for anything requiring more precise finger placement (like typing).
