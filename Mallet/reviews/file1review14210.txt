review/text: You can take this bottle on the plane - this is the to go cup.This stuff is the bomb. OK, guys, you're on your own, you are missing that special somebody, watching television or your comptuer, and well, you're on your own.... Yep, this stuff feels like, well you know, the real thing. It's just the right thickness and slippery that, you'd swear you were someplace else. Now the best part, this stuff stays wet for a long time. I've tried some other lubes that just get gummy after like 5 minutes, and you have to keep adding more or adding liquid to work. No, this stuff, good for 20 minutes.And the best part - it's like latex paint, water clean up man. No left over residue, nothing. Now, add this to your favorite mechanical or flexible assistant, and you've got an incredible combination. When you're finished, flip that baby inside out, give her a good rinse and it's all ready to go for the next time.Look at the reviews from females here, add this to your normal routine if there's a hot dry wind blowing and you need some help on that condom or bareback; this stuff just kills. I found out about this stuff from a really great sex shop mostly geared for women. I bought basically the wrong lube for a blue lagoon (you get it, flexible blue tube with little bumps inside), but the person that waited on me didn't want to say - hey wrong lube sir. Instead she did this really cool thing, tossed two samples of LiquidSilk in the bag. And she added a really good pamplet on how to care for the blue lagoon. Oh the other junk just went gummy, this stuff was heaven.Flavor, yeah well it's kind of bland. Not offensive, but not super pleasant. Not sure I'd eat a lot of this. You probably want to get the tasting part done before pulling this out.So I loaded up on a nice bottle with a pump. The good news, LiquidSilk, doesn't go gummy in your hand, on your tools, or on your private parts.
