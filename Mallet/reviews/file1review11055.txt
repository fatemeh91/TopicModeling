review/text: I have been on a low carb diet and had some nasty breath. My son told me my breath stunk and asked if it was because of my diet. Well, I felt very uncomfortable and tried everything to mask the smell like; mouth wash, breath strips, gums, constanst brushing and nothing helped. I found this on AMAZON and ordered it. Well, let me tell you it has helped me so much, I no longer want to turn my head away when I talk to someone and I feel very fresh. I would say for myself after two days of use I felt a noticeable difference. I think I will stick to this product even after I am done with this diet, just to help with overall confidence.
