review/text: I have been using these since we have started TTC, and they work really well. An excellent value for the product. For the women that have been using these and are not seeing a positive with them, have you been to your GYN or RE yet because you may not be ovulating. That is what was going on with me, I was using ovulation tests and was upset when I would not get a + one, and I finally went to my gyn and he tested me for all different things and come to find out I have PCOS and was not ovulating. I am currently taking clomid and I have been using these and they have worked for me so far, now that I am ovulating again.
