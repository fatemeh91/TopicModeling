review/text: The straps that go along your ribs and between your breasts were REALLY tight! The part that fits under your belly didn't fit me until I was 6 months pregnant and I'm carrying twins. The fit of this thing was really strange to me since I weighed 120 lbs before pregnancy and my upper body is pretty small. The only part of me that seems really big is my belly and that is the part of the prenatal cradle that was loose. My midwife recommended this and I've heard from other woman that they loved theirs, so maybe it just wasn't for me:)
