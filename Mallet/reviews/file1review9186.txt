review/text: I bought two of these in late April based on the five-star review. They hold a ton of meds, BUT, the covers to the individual compartments break EASILY. Within the first week of use, a cover on both mine and my daughter's broke as we were lifting the individual trays out. We are currently using one medi-chest as a replacement for the other as the covers continue to break--no matter how carefully we handle them. At this rate, we are hoping one of them can be used for a few months while we search for a better case for our meds!!
