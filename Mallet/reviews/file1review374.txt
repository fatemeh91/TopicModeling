review/text: Holy. Freakin'. Crap.I absolutely love my jackrabbit! :-)-Price: Great deal. Plus it costs just enough for free standard shipping.-Delivery: Ordered Sat evening. It shipped Wed & arrived Thurs in the a.m. Package was perfectly discreet (altho maybe my grinning all the way back from the post office wasn't).-Vibration: Just intense enough & its quiet ;-). Ive only used the lower 2 settings (mostly the lowest).-Size: A bit difficult to work with at 1st, but ultimately very pleasurable. Lube is recommended. Also due to the size, Ive been wary of (& haven't used) the rotation feature... yet.-The little bunny: this alone is worth the $25. Gets the job done amazingly (even without using the phallus).-Waterproof(?): I have used it in the shower and washed it several times (w/out submerging it). No problems.
