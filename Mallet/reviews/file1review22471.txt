review/text: I've bought and used this product locally at thehealth food store for years. This time I purchasedthe larger size to save money from Amazon.The product from the health food store was sealedand the tablets were fresh with a hard shell andslight vitamin smell.The product from Amazon was also sealed, but thetablets were softer and had a heavy vitamin smell.This condition results from having the tabletsexposed to the air for at least a months time.This tells me that the tablets sat out at thefactory and aged, then packaged and shipped.Its a shame! I'll go back to buying locally inthe smaller quantity again, or start looking fora similar product. So it goes with products intodays world. No integrity!
