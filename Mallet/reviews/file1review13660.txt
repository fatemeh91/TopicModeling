review/text: This mop cover is perfect - just toss it in the wash and it dries quickly. Use it over and over and it does not shrinkin the wash. There is no "color" to fade on other items in the wash. This item is much better than the throw awaycovers. I would purchase it again. The price is reasonable for something so durable. Just check the size of yourmop before purchase - there are several sizes. Keep an extra on hand if doing a lot of floors in your home.
