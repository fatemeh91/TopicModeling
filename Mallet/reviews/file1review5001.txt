review/text: I, too, can't believe the bad reviews for this product! I have been using Zeiss pre-moistened lens cleansing wipes for YEARS and they provide a fast, steak-free shine every single time. After cleaning my eyeglasses, I often use the rest of the "juice" that's left in the cloth to wipe down my iPhone or clean my bathroom mirror.I have noticed that if you buy the wipes in bulk and it takes you quite a while to use them up (say, 1 year), the last batch of wipes may be dryer (have less juice) and not clean quite as effectively. Now I buy only what my family can reasonably use up in a 3-4 month window. After all, why stockpile them... they are available everywhere!And yes, I do know that I could save money by using a bottle of the lens cleaning solution and a clean, soft cloth. But in the morning, as I head out the door to work, convenience counts!
