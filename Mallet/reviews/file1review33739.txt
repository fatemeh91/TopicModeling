review/text: I have throat cancer, am being treated with chemo and radiation and have been drinking supplements to keep up my weight. I've tried "Ensure Plus", the "go to" supplement, "Carnation Breakfast VHC", the CVS knock off, (all three liquids) and a GNC product, "Amplified Mass XXX" of 900 calories recommended by my radiation oncologist. I cannot tolerate the VHC as it is very sticky, slimy, and has a strong, odd taste. Similarly the GNC product has a gluey texture and a strong taste. The "Ensure" is tolerable but this tastes much better, more milky and easier to drink/swallow (I use whole milk with all the powders), has a higher calorie count than the liquids and has 25gms of fiber to help prevent constipation where "Ensure" has none. I add Ice Cream and Egg Beater to increase the calories. I may have to rely on this for six months which I believe is possible, I know I couldn't do so for the other products.Update, 11/2/12: Towards the end of radiation my throat was too sore to eat by mouth and I had to use a feeding tube, When I started to be able to drink food I found that "Scandishake" irritated my throat much more than "Ensure" did so I stopped using it. Because radiation affects many aspects of eating, I can't blame "Scandishake" but did want people to know that under certain conditions "Scandishake" may not be the best for them.Update/ 1/15/13: After drinking "Boost VHC" (formerly "Carnation VHC") because of its high calories, I am back to using "Scandishake" which tastes so much better and has 600 calories per serving as opposed to the 530 calories of "Boost VHC". It no longer affects my throat.
