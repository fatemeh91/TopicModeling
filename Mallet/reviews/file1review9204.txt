review/text: Poor quality, will not last. Opened pkg, very large, lots of room BUT....one of the lift out sections had problems with the lids, very difficult to open each section, also one of the "hinges" on one compartment was severed 3/4 of the hinge. It is now holding together by a tiny bit of plastic. I had already loaded all but the last section with pills. If you choose to buy this check everything first, open and close the lids and inspect carefully and be prepared to return this.I had a smaller one I have used for years, finally one of the latches broke and I thought it was time to upgrade. Don't waste your money!
