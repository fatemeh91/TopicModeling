review/text: **Note: I am reviewing the fruit flavor**These chews have been a lifesaver. They are affordable, vegan, and the raspberry flavor is quite tasty. My only complaints are that the orange flavor is too tart/strong for my liking, and the zip-lock "resealable" bag is not properly made. On all 3 boxes I've purchased over the past years, it's impossible to open it by separating the two locking sides because the ziploc portion is glued to only one side. I wind up cutting the top off and then just rolling it down to keep the air out. This doesn't affect the softness of the chews too much, but it's still a bit odd. There are only two flavors, raspberry and orange, and the raspberry is creamy sweet deliciousness. The orange, however, is a pungent, tart punch in the mouth! If you like sour candies, you'll love the orange flavor.
