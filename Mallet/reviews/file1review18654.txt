review/text: I am using the least resistive bar (tan) for rehabilitation of elbow tendinitis. I have had elbow tendinitis for over 18 months. It got so painful I could hardly function with my right arm, and I am right handed. I started going to physical therapy, and I encountered this bar for rehabilitation. I use it every session, and it helps to slowly strengthen the weakened and damaged tendons that attach to the lateral epicondyle. The important point to remember is that one does not want to overdo this (or any) exercise, or a regression will occur. I tried using a heavier bar on my own, and that is exactly what happened. Use the lightest bar first and then progress through the entire series slowly and surely. Once the tendon is healed, the bars can be resold, or the heavier bars can be used to further strengthen the tendons and hands. This is proven therapy and it will work if doe right and done at the right time.kone
