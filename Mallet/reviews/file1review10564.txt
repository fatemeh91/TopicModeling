review/text: I've bought two of these recently--one for myself, one for a neighbor who liked mine. It's sturdy and stable; can be adjusted for right-or-left-hand use. (the loop should face forward for best balance--I've seen some people not use them correctly). Mine has a plastic film giving it some color--it's light-colored. It replaces a black one lost in travel. Light color is easier to find at night in dim light. The film CAN get nicked. I plan to touch up nicks with nail polish; craft stores have paints that also would probably work for touch-up. The foam handle is firm--softer than a rubber handle, but will probably wear. However--this was less than a third of the price for one available at a local store--so when the foam wears out, I'll just get a new cane! My neighbor is totally pleased with her silver cane also.
