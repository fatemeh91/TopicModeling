review/text: I used it for my son for four months already.It does stand the washing machine, and is still waterproof.It can absorb lot of liquid.The only problem is that it is does not cover the entire bed, so it is only partial protection.I now use it over my luna bed cover, so if my son wets the bed in the middle of the night, I can take out this one, and still has Luna there.=============Review after one year of use= = = = = = =I bought two more sets of this sheet protector.Is the ONLY one that really stays waterproof.I also bought others 2 sets of LUNA, and they stopped being waterproof after few months of everyday wash.My son is autistic and he wets bed almost every night.Now I have 3 sets of this protector and it is a peace of mind because no matter how many washes, they stay waterproof.I still use it over the LUNA protector, and underneath the LUNA I have another plastic, because LUNA is no longer waterproof after many washes.
