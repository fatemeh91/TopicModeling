review/text: I use the magnesium taurate to help me get to sleep and stay asleep as well as cure those powerful leg cramps I get.Magnesium oxide did not help, but caused diarrhea. Magnesium malate was better but had to take more.The taurate is the only formula that easily helps without unwanted side effects.Love the capsule form as well. I also have 250 mg at bedtime and sleep, so important, is back to being easy again.
