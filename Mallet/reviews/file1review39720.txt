review/text: I really liked the conditioning ability of the shaving gel. It made for a smooth close shave with less chance of cutting myself. However, I found the scent to be overwhelming and obnoxious. I prefer a lighter scent or no scent at all. All in all, I'd recommend this product for those of us with hard-to-shave skin who enjoy more strongly scented products.
