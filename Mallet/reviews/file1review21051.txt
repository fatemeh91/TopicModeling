review/text: This has been such a help for my fibromyalgia and arthritis pain. The moist heat makes a huge difference and it is so much hotter than my old heating pad. I also think that the weight of the pad is a help..and I had not expected that at all. It heats up quickly and the size is impressive. I was afraid having to hold the on button down would be an issue but it is not. Great product.
