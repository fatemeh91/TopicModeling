review/text: Shipping is fast, product arrives in good condition, and the price is the best I've found. If you like ON Whey Gold Standard this is where to get it. As for the product itself I experience better recovery times and more muscle growth with it than without it. I find the key is to drink it within 30 mins of a workout and use skim milk to keep the calories down.
