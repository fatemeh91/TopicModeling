review/text: I purchased this to take with on my first cruise. We did hit pretty rocky seas a couple of nights and I wasn't a bit sick. I also used it during the day when we were driving thru some very curvy, up & down roads and my trip in the back seat didn't give me any motion sickness.It smells pleasant and seems to really work.
