review/text: This pen is marvelous: Black, Red and 0.5mm in the same instrument. It looks stylish without being ostentatious. It has a nice weight to it and is well balanced. I can write a long time in total comfort. The black satin finish never gets slippery.I like that there are so many choices for refills: I still have a ton of refills left over from my previous multifunction pen and was delighted to find that they also fit this pen.The function is very intuitive: keep twisting the barrel until you get what you want. What could be easier!
