review/text: I have been using this product for aobut 7 months after a health food store employee recommended it. I take two each night at bedtime -- it doesn't put me to sleep immediately, but I have many fewer sleepless nights. (I've tended toward insomnia since puberty and am now 66.) Absolutely no hold-over the next day. If you have trouble sleeping and want something that has no after-effects and no tendency towards habituation, I recommend you give this product a try. Amazon's prices are only slightly better than the health food store, but the delivery makes life SO much simpler.
