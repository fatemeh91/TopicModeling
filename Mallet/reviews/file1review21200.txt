review/text: I got this heating pad on the recommendation from an older friend. I didn't believe that the moist heat would really be any different from any other type of heating pad. Wow was I wrong. This pad delivers such extreme targeted heat that my lower back pain disappears within minutes of applying.The only feature I would add to the pad is that I would have it cycle on and off automatically rather than having to manually hold the switch.
