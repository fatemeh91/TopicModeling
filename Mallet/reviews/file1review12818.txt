review/text: Love this! It fits snug without being uncomfortable...almost like it was made just for my face. It stays cold long enough to do its job. I was always told you shouldn't use ice longer than 10-15 minutes at a time. It is covered is an elastic fabric which feels silky on the skin. It has to be stored in a plastic bag which is provided because it can not get wet or it will swell and be unusable. My mom loves it too and she is going to order one. Anyone with sinus issues should own one.
