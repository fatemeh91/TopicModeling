review/text: The tablets I received have a tag that says mfg date 09/12. This is confusing as this date is in the place where the expiration date should be. I assume it means manufacturing date, but if this is the case, when is the expiry date? Because of this confusion I won't ingest these pills, and will return them because I want to be totally clear and certain about anything I put into my body. I am quite annoyed because I paid $4.99 for shipment and waited some time for its arrival.I guess I will now go to my local health food store and purchase from a manufacturer who provides unambiguous information about their product.Digestive Enzymes 180 Tabs by Swanson Premium
