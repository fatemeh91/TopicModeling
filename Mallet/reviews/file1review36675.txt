review/text: My family and I really liked the Irish Spring Sport soap. With three males and two females in our family, it's very hard to find a soap that we will all use. Irish Spring Sport gets a thumbs up from all five of us. We all particularly enjoyed the fresh, clean scent. I would buy this soap for my family and I would highly recommend it to others as well.
