review/text: went by the size chart but i think that it is to big, I'm a 10 to 10.5 and i think this is to big to really pull the fore foot and toe to provide a proper stretch for the plantar tendon. it fall off of my foot a night or i've got it so tight to try to get to work that i loose circulation to my foot. get something else.
