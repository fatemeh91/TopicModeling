review/text: I am having twins and my back has been killing me lately. I read so many good reviews about this belt I had high hopes, but I just couldn't wear it for longer than a few hours.Pros: When standing, it does hold the belly up, which did relieve pressure from my back.Cons: Unfortunately there were more cons than pros....first I had to safety pin the top straps to my bra so they didn't show. I thought this could have been designed a little better--even with more modest tops it would show through. Second, I thought the part that goes below your belly should have been a little wider. Whenever I sat down it folded/cut into me. So now instead of a backache I had stomach pain where it would cut into me. I feel if they made it a little wider this wouldn't have happened so easily.So while this belt has a good concept (and I was really really really hoping this would be the answer to my back issues), it is not for everyone.
