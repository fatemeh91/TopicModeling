review/text: When I first started using a safety razor, I jumped in full force and got this shave cup and soap, plus a badger brush. Wanted to do the whole experience. It was fun for a while, but after going through two shave soap bars, the novelty has worn off and I just use regular, decent quality shave cream.The included shave soap smells good and lathers well. No complaints there. Very much enjoyed it. The bowl looks good enough to leave on the bathroom sink if desired.My only complaint is that the Colonel Conk Shave Soap bars are so small in the cup. The picture looks like it's a nice fit, but when removed from the packaging and placed in the bowl, it's dwarfed by the size of the bowl. "So what?" you may ask. Well, when using your brush to generate a lather, the soap bar will move all around the bottom of the bowl. You need to have the soap stationary so you can whip that brush on it and generate a lather. However, I found myself simply chasing the thing around the bottom of the bowl like an ice cube in a cup. As it dries between shaves it'll affix itself to the bottom, but sometimes comes loose and here we go again. The Colonel Conk soap bar is not a good fit for the bowl.Nonetheless, the shave cup itself is nice.
