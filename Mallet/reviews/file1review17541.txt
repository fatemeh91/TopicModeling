review/text: Typing on mobile device excuse typos. I used the older model for years and it has worked very well.I've even dropped in water (you can imagine where) and after a rinse and dry cycle it worked fine. Only reason to replaceIs because the battery doesn't hold a charge very long anymore and im sure the blade is a bit dullCompared to new. I highly recommend. Cell phones don't use charging stands and I'm glad this doesn't use one either ,Just more stuff to take up counter space in bathroom.
