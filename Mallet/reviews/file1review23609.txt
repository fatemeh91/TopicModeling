review/text: I purchased this item due to my skin defect after birth contol pills. My OB-GYN doctor recommended birth control pills due to my age, almost 40. After taking BCP for three months, my facial condition became terrible. I started having all pigmentations darker and increased, also even moles started showing up more and darker. My face became something else, not a human face, I thought. I got very much depressed and stopped going out. I have no idea, but my dermatologist never called me back either. I started looking up all over internet and found this item. So far so good. Its scent is good. Somehow, this product does not have detailed instruction or warning. It only has instruction on the outer box.(no extra insert information). I have no idea how often I need to use this. No warnings of side affect either. So, I assumed and decided to use it once a month. Therefore, I really cannot say if this product does work. I will update some months later.So far it is pretty good enough to use at home without big charge at a dermatologist's office.
