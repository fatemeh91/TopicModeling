review/text: The Daily Shower Spray is great and makes cleaning the shower a lot easier. I keep one in each shower/tub area. I was however disapointed when the product arrived. Several of the nozzle/sprayers were damaged during shipment. Because of this, I replace the damaged tops with undamaged ones as I use the product. Hopefully my next case will arrive in perfect condition.
