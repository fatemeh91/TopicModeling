review/text: I initially bought this potty seat based on reviews that said it was good for a boy. It seemed a bit pricey, but was cheaper at amazon.com than anywhere else. My main objective with this was for my son to poop on the toilet. He has constipation issues, so I thought a potty would be easier for him than trying to poop in his diaper. He does what we call a "poop dance" so we always know when he has to go. His little bottom fits well on this seat, and he uses it with ease. The shield in front is sufficient. We have not had any accidents yet. Common sense says to keep his boy parts pointed down, though. My son is on the small side, but I think this potty seat will carry him through his training. I like that it is adjustable to fit on all toilets. We are currently using it on an elongated seat. As we are not seriously training yet, he does not get on and off the toilet himself. He does try to put the potty seat on the toilet himself, though. All in all, I highly recommend this product. It is easy to clean and sleek/contemporary looking. A lot more expensive than the $8 potty rings, but worth it for the comfort of the kid and the fit on the toilet. I have just ordered a second one, and will most likely be taking it on vacation with us.
