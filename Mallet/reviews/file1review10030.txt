review/text: wow!!! I should get my money back!The same companies non digital caliper is amazing and this is just as useless!the numbers are never consistent and never accuarate! dont even dare to buy!!!but the tape is very good. Easy to use and you can measure areas like biceps etc without the help of anyone...
