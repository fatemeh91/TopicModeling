review/text: The roll on container leaked the contents, was leaking when I opened it. I did try the product anyway, just rolled in on, didn't rub or massage on. It burned my skin immediately, got all red and welty. I will try DMSO again. I liked the concept of easy application, but this kind isn't it!
