review/text: The pro's of this tub are:*It is inexpensive.*It is very compact and folds up small enough to fit in a small space. If space is an issue, this tub is great.The con's of this tub are:*My baby (9 weeks old) loves to kick when she is bathing. Her little feet get caught in the space where the tub folds. This is a significant safety concern.*You can't fill the tub very much with water. The water leaks out of the joints where the tub folds. It can get quite messy!If you have storage problems, I would recommend purchasing this tub. However, the mess of water all over and her little feet getting jammed in the joint space do not make this tub a recommended item. We will be purchasing a new tub soon.
