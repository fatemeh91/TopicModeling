review/text: I have been using this toothbrush for over a week now. In the beginning the bristles felt very stiff and uncomfortable, but after about a week they softened up due to regular brushing. The cleansing power is great and there isn't much effort that is needed to thoroughly clean your teeth. I have a partially erupted wisdom tooth and while in waiting to get it extracted I have used this toothbrush to brush around that tooth and it has worked wonderfully in vibrating those little food particles out (ewww I know). It is loud, but not significantly so. Amazing toothbrush for the $13 price-tag. Very happy with this toothbrush. Also, very sleek handle and light build =). Yippeee!
