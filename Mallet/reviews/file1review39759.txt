review/text: I purchased a few of these for my elementary school children to use as a desk. These portable desks are great for children to sit and write their homework when needing to do school work in the car, at the soccer field, or just waiting for sister to finish ballet. Then they fold up and the children can carry them to the car. Perfect for kids portable desks.
