review/text: If you've never tried a latex seat cushion, then you don't know what you're missing. They are definitely far and away more comfortable than a standard seat cushion. They distribute your weight evenly, cradle you in all the right places, and mold perfectly to each individual person, yet always spring back to their original shape. They have a bunch of little holes that go through the latex itself to help circulate air and to keep your fanny cool. If you've ever tried that crappy memory foam, you'll know it doesn't breathe one iota and makes you sweat in cracks where you DON'T want sweat. The outer covering feels nice and smooth, and doesn't attract debris or particles. If you're allergic to latex, like I am, worry not, the covering should keep most people protected and free from reactions. The only gripe I have, is I'd rather it was 20" by 20", instead of 16" by 20". Other than that, I'm really happy with these and I bought 2 of them; 1 for my wheelchair and 1 for my favorite chair at home. They really are very comfortable and help with a bad back.
