review/text: I used Sensor or Fusion for years and never tried the Mach3. They were good but expensive and I could only get 3 shaves per cartridge. I thought I would try this deal since I had nothing to lose but $30.I actually prefer the feel of the Mach3 over the Fusion. I always felt the Fusion would slip off my face and cut my eye open. Something about the grip and motion makes it feel unsafe. Has anyone else experienced this?Anyway, I have thick, fast growing facial hair and I get a weeks worth of shaves off the Mach3 for half the Fusion price. By day 5 it is rawer than the first day, but that is to be expected.I am pleased with the Mach3 and will buy again when this massive supply runs out.
