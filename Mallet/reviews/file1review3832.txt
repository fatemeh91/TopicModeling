review/text: I got this because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea. Ginger is known to be a remedy for nausea, including morning sickness... but the thing I thought was funny about this product was that it says on the box to check with your doctor if you are pregnant! I did, she said as long as it wasn't the only thing I drink all day, I should be ok! But if you are pregnant, I would check with your own doctor before use. The thing that dissappointed me a little bit was that when I got my package, the box was smushed. They had only packed it in a bubble mailer envelope. However, I have had a few glasses of this tea now, and I must say, it does take the edge off of my nausea! It is not very spicy or overly gingery like other ginger drinks I have tried. I would recommend to other pregnant women... but ask your doctor first, like the box says!
