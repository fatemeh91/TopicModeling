review/text: I have very sensitive skin even on my feet area and regular soaps make my feet extremely dry. I was browsing on Amazon looking for foot soap and came upon this product, read the many good reviews and decided to give it a try. This works! My feet actually feels very refreshed and the dry parts of my feet aren't that noticeable and slowly improving. I actually bought the bigger size one just recently since the 1st one I bought is almost half way and didn't want to run out off this soap.
