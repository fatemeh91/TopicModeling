review/text: love the "gopher"!--had bought one for myself and one for a handicapped friend a few years ago at Walmart's----at long last, mine wore out and i needed a replacement---couldn't get one at at Walmart's this time--tried several stores and was told that they usually had them, but not at this time--not good enough!--i wanted a "gopher now!--it is perfect for reaching the little out of the way places when you've dropped something or for just picking up anything not too heavy--i close my drapes with it or haul my radio across the table with it--if i can grab it with the "gopher" i can usually get it into my hands--i've even changed the stations on my TV with it before i got a new set!!--i usually keep it close by when i'm reading in case i drop the paper or mag---all in all, i'm very happy to have one and i will continue to buy the "gopher" as long as it is available. By the way,I was very surprised that i got so soon--a couple of days after i ordered it on-line, it was in my mailbox--
