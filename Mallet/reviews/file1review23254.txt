review/text: I was looking for a sweeper that would work well on my tile floors. Most sweepers are for low-pile carpeting, but this was marketed to work excellent on tile, laminate, etc. also. Not so! It picks up maybe 50% of what a broom would. Very disappointed. I have thick carpeting in both my living and family rooms, so I can't use it there either. It works very well on the low-pile carpeting on my stairwell and landing, but that is not really what I wanted it for. Bottom-line, do not purchase this if you are looking for a sweeper to use on tile, wood or laminate! For carpet or rugs it's great, and works as you would expect a sweeper to.
