review/text: My daughter and I both use an epilator so ingrown hairs are an issue. I bought these tweezers for me a couple years ago. They keep disappearing to my daughter's bathroom so I recently bought her a pair. I am a bit clumsly and have dropped these a few times onto my slate floor. The tips bend easily. They no longer "tweeze" like they did originally, but still work for loosening ingrown hairs then I remove with the regular tweezers.
