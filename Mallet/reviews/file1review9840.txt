review/text: These tweezers are great for ingrown hairs. They work best to work out the hair you're after, although sometimes I need to bust out my heavy-duty TM tweezers to actually get the whole hair out. The tips are so tiny and precise that it can be difficult to get a grip sometimes but I've never used a pair that worked so well to loosen up the ingrown hair.
