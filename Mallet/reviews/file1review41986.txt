review/text: I have been purchasing this kava kava root through Amazon for two months now. I just ordered it for the 4th time. I have a non-contagious disorder which is extremely painful and also causes major insomnia problems. Usually I take the capsules 2 at a time when I am taking my medicines for pain beyond the usual levels. It hasn't stopped my insomnia, but I definitely feel better. My overall impression after a couple months is that this is one of those things that I would notice the efficacy of most by stopping its use. In other words, since I notice that it makes me feel better, I'm guessing I would feel quite a bit worse by stopping so that is something I'm not real inclined to do. Maybe later. Since I have Amazon Prime, the price is great & the 2-day shipping is free. The effects claimed regarding this herbal remedy are so helpful to the person taking it that I can't imagine why a person wouldn't want to try it. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
