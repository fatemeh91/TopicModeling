review/text: I'll preface by saying I didn't by this oxo palm brush on Amazon, but at Target. It is an amazing, solidly designed little gem that doesn't leak soap like some other brands and shoots a little squirt of soap on command. It actually makes washing dishes a little fun. This is much better and faster than grabbing a bottle of soap and putting it on a brush repeatedly during a dish washing session.The fact that the brush itself is replaceable is a nice touch too.
