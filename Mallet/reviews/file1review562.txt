review/text: I purchased this chair 4 years ago and am a mechanical engineer.At the 14 month point, (2 months after the warranty expired) the chair stopped working. I took it apart and discovered the upper journal bearing had cracked and failed. This is the bearing which holds the massage mechanism. It bears all of your back weight and it's spinning is converted into the roller motion. That might sound fancy, but when you look at it, it is a small plastic part.When I contacted support, they would not sell me the bearing or even to upper support assembly. The only option was to buy the whole massage mechanism, motor and all for $130.I was frustrated, but I loved the massage, so I purchased and installed the mechanism.It is a self contained unit, so unplug a few connectors, bolt it down... an easy replacement.18 months later it broke again and I threw it away.I am a 170lb man who used it maybe twice a week for 30 minutes.In my second deconstruction, I noted it again broke in the upper support area. In my opinion, this is not a well designed chair.
