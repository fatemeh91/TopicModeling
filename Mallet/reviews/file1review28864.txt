review/text: Good stuff and, from everything I've read, the best on the market. I'm working on 2 lbs of the French Vanilla Creme: like a thin milkshake with milk, even thinner with water. Tastes great, mixes easily with spoon, ie no lumps. I'm going to stick with it, 1 glass after AM workout, 1 before bed.
