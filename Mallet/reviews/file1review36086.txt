review/text: I don't think this product works very well. Then again, I have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies. So maybe it is just me. I found these to be mildly relaxing but not necessarily sleep inducing. Also you have to take several -- four -- and the pills are large. I wouldn't buy again.
