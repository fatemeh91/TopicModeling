review/text: It works well for me. I can last triple or four time longer than before. I use it with condom, then it does not have bad effect on my wife. However, I cannot make it quickly as I want when my wife wants to stop. The problem I may think of is that the spray does not have strong presure as I expected. I am not sure whether it is already used, or without a seal. Whatever the way it is packed, the spray is not as a spray at all. It is almost a tiny drop.
