review/text: My uncle used to get me these all the time when I was a kid. At the time, I didn't care if they were healthy or not. Now that I'm older, and trying to watch what I'm eating, I was looking for a healthy snack. I recently "rediscovered" Tigers Milk again. These bars are great. They actually have a good taste to them, unlike some other bars that I tried. They're also less epensive. The only downside is that they're kind of small.
