review/text: After the recommendation from my dentist to use toothpaste with peroxide in it, I tried PeroxiCare. I couldn't even use it; it tasted so bad, I threw it away. After trying Colgate, I can now follow my dentist's recommendation. The taste isn't like toothpaste without peroxide but tons better than PeroxiCare. This product also had all the other features I look for in toothpaste. I'll continue to use it!
