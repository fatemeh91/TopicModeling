review/text: Having tried numerous products, we find this brand offers two important advantages over others. It mixes well- spoon and water, leaving almost no traces of the powder in the cup. Taste- very good chocolate taste. I mix it with water and find it enjoyable. Wife uses yogurt and fruits then blends it for (what I feel is a week) for about 30 seconds. She refuses to try any other brand.
