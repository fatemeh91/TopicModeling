review/text: The things I like about these containers are that you can nest them and they seal really well.Although Ziploc advertises that you can use their containers safely in the freezer, almost every Ziploc container we've put in the freezer has broken. They usually break right at the bottom corners. If you do use them in the freezer anyway, they seem less likely to break if they're filled with fluids than if they're filled with solid foods.
