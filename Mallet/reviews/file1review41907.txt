review/text: i'm totally disappointed when I get it this morning. first of all, the bottle is not sealed. second, it seems like they just poured some kind of oil in the bottle because since it is not sealed, there is no way for me to know whether it is really grapeseed oil or just some kind of cheap oil. they just hand-wrote the word " cucumber" & "16 oz". I will not recommend anyone to get this product.
