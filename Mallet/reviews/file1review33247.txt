review/text: I purchased the Herbal Concepts Comfort Booties after my previous pair "sprung a leak" on one of the booties and needed to be replaced. I based my purchase on a 4 star rating which was better than most of the other brands displayed. My first surprise came when i tried on the delivered pair. It seemed very tight, but I managed to put them on after warming them in the microwave for a little over 1 minute. I noticed that the seeds tended to bunch up in the middle under the arch of my foot and needed to be manipulated to warm the toes, where they were most needed. Although I am used to this procedure, I am not very satisfied with the ultimate result. I think the booties need several smaller compartments to distribute the warming seeds around primarily the the front part of the foot and not in the arch.Since returns involve authorization, repacking and mailing I am living with these booties and derive some (albeit not enough) benefit.Alfred Fischer
