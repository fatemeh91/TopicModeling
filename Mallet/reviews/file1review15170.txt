review/text: I eat these bars all the time and thought it would be a good deal and convenient to get them from Amazon. But, they were horrible. Stale and crumbly and deformed. I complained and customer service sent me replacement bars, but they were exactly the same - inedible. They refunded my money, which I appreciated.Based on this experience, I will never purchase food from amazon.com.
