review/text: First of all this is great with patients. They just love the heart and color! Other then that its very hard to hear anything. I was not able to hear a NG placement and boy, was I mad. I'm a nursing student so the price was right at the time but its hard to hear any sounds, sometimes I can, sometimes I cant. Maybe I recieved a bad Prestige Stethoscope. Plus the shipping deal, the stethoscope, to my house took forever, I had to call and check the status of my order. It arrived but later then expected. Good luck!
