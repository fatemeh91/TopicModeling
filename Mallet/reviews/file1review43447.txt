review/text: I visited England a couple times, a few years ago. I bought several of the flake bars at that time and I don't think they even made it home to the US. I think they are flaky and wonderful. You do have to be a little prepared for the flakiness or you will lose some of your tasty chocolate candy. A local store (World Market) carried some Cadbury, but not these Flake Bars. In England, they were really cheap at that time, about 28 pence if I recall. To buy them here, it is much more of a commitment, but well worth it. I enjoyed them so much.
