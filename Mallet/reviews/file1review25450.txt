review/text: I bought it for under $10, and it works - that's a great bang for my buck.It takes a few runs in each nostril to get everything trimmed, and it starts smelling like oiled-metal as you use it (naturally - it IS lodged up in your nose), but the family notices it trimmed well. I'm happy with the purchase.
