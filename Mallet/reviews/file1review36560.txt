review/text: I bought this from Amazon because finding gentian violet is getting harder and harder to do. I use it primarily for mixing up an ear remedy for my dogs. However, I also found that, not too long ago, I developed a very stubborn case of athlete's foot that just wouldn't go away. since it helps prevent yeast infections in my dog's ears, I figured I would try some on my problem. I put a little on a cotton swab and coated the affected area. Let it dry and then put on the usual cream. After doing this for a few days, my athlete's foot was gone. it didn't not burn but helped ease the itch, which was nice.Now if you never have used gentian violet before, I have to worn you, it stains. I mean IT STAINS. I mean Everything and it is very difficult to get out, even if you get it on your fingers, you will have purple fingers for a while, so avoid using the applicator directly on an area to avoid drips, but instead dab it on a swab and you should be OK.I love the stuff and it is sad that it is getting harder to find locally. At least I can get it here on line.
