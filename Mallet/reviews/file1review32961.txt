review/text: I've been taking Glucosamine for about a year now because of shoulder and hip joint pain and stiffness in pill form. After about 2 weeks it worked pretty dang good and the pain went away. I ran out 2 weeks ago and kept forgetting to get more until the old pains came back with a vengeance. I bought a bottle of Wellesse Joint Movement Glucosamine w/Chondroitin and within 24 hours the pain COMPLETELY disappeared.I volunteer at the local library and stretching to those top shelves was difficult. Today the top and bottom shelves were no longer off limits to me. I'm serious here - I don't have a medical degree but I know when something works - This stuff works!
