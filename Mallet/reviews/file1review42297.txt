review/text: I just purchased a bottle of this today. I went straight home and took the prescribed 2 tablespoons. I have been feeling totally nauseous ever since. My stomach is burning and gurgling. I'm worried I am going to get diarrhea!! YUCK! It tastes HORRID. I don't know if I dare to try it again. Seriously, it is sitting like a rock in my stomach. Blah.Okay, it's the next day. Today I took half a dose and mixed it with grape juice. It was much better that way. We'll see how it goes.
