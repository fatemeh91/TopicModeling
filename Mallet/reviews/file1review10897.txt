review/text: I have had a problem with the ligament that runs from the knee to the hip while attempting to change direction with the right leg planted. This device has eliminated the problem for now and I expect it will for the future. I do not know how it would work for a a younger and more agressive player but for a 73 year old guy who plays old guy doubles it is great.
