review/text: I am a 19 year old college student that was looking for help lifting weights. I have a skinny frame, 6'1" 165 pounds. My friend and lifting partner has been using whey protein for some time and I decided to buy some for myself. The fitness center at my college only sells ON (Optimum Nutrition) 100% Gold Standard Whey Protein. I decided to buy some French Vanilla flavored whey just expecting it to be average tasting. It actually mixes in with milk very well and tastes like a milkshake. I started to notice gains in strength and definition within a couple weeks. ON is a fairly priced protein, but I would not suggest taking the two to three scoops per serving that they suggest. Your body can only take in about one and a half scoops, the rest just runs through your digestive system. I would recommend this protein to anybody that is lifting weights. It is safe, relatively cheap, and works very well. Good bang for the buck!
