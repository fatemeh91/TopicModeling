review/text: you get exactly what you pay for, a simple zippo lighter in the box brand new. It does not come with fluid you will have to buy that separately (I've ordered some fluid from amazon, review coming shortly) but you cant mark it down for not coming with fluid because it says it doesn't. its a good basic zippo that i recommend to anyone who wants a zippo but doesn't quite want to pay a small fortune for the high end zippos on the market, i recommend this to anyone new to zippos, overall really great product.Now for the downsides, sometimes when in my pocket whilst on the move the insert comes out slightly this is terribly annoying as i keep having to pop it back in, also i noticed on the inside of the case there are yellow stains, not sure if thats with all zippo lighters or not.comes in a really nice black box to store and display the lighter, comes with a small booklet with info on zippos
