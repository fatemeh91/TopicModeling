review/text: I have plantar fasciitis and these insoles have a good arch support and are comfortable to wear when I can find shoes that are deep enough. Unfortunately, with most of my shoes, these inserts are so thick that my feet pop out of the back of the shoe when I walk.Since buying these, I have discovered that the same item is made in a thin version, the Spenco Thinsole version, and I really love that one. But if you have walking shoes or athletic shoes, these will be great. I especially like the fact that they are not full length, so they leave some "wiggle room" for your toes.
