review/text: I was disappointed with these calipers from the beginning because1. The readout is very faint, you need good back lighting to read it.2. If you work with clients it is very time consuming to input the required information for each client. You have to go through a series of pressing SELECT, NEXT, NEXT, Enter age, etc. It was just very fussy and took a while to get used to.3. Just when I got used to it. It slipped from my grasp and fell on the gym floor and now it doesn't work.Only had it a few months.
