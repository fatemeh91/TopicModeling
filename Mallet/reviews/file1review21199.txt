review/text: I have used a couple of heating pads in the past and they either fall apart or don't get hot enough or feel very cheap. I have a friend who recommended this one and I took a flier and gave it a try. While only using it a couple of times, I can tell already that it is going to be different! It gets warmer, has a nice heavy feeling to it and I really like the way it draws the moisture out of the air (like magic!) and just feels "right" - I am now fighting my wife half the time to use it - will have to get her her own! I think I got a winner!
