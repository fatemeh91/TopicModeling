review/text: I received these whitestrips as a X-Mas gift and recently finished the 7 day application. They worked quite well. My teeth are brighter and whiter than they have ever been. I am completely satisfied.You are supposed to apply the strips twice a day for 30 minutes at a time (so 1 hour per day) for 7 days. It took about 3 - 4 days before I really noticed a difference and after the full 7 days, there was a great improvement.I never had any tooth or gum pain using these but I know someone else who said it made her gums hurt a little. Wearing the strips makes it a little hard to talk so don't plan to converse a lot while you whiten. Also they seem to cause more saliva to produce in your mouth. However, it's only 30 minutes at a time.As the title suggests, these strips are a quick and easy way to whiten your teeth. I recommend them and will probably use them again if my teeth become too dark.
