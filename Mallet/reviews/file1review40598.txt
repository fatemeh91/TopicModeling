review/text: Other reviews have commented about the ineffective nature of this product, but I feel compelled to add my thoughts. I've used several environmentally-friendly (at least purportedly) dishwasher detergents, and this is by far the absolute worst product I've encountered. It does, as they claim, clean tea and coffee stains. However, I can use baking soda and a little elbow grease to take care of those. What it doesn't do is clean dishes well. You could, of course, rinse dishes so that they're nearly spotless before placing them into the dishwasher, but that defeats the purpose of using it in the first place. Avoid this stuff completely, unless you enjoy wasting your money.
