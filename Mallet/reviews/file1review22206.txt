review/text: These do not last forever if you use the dishwasher to clean them, but considering the low price, they last well enough. They are also cheap enough that you don't have to worry when you lose one.They stay sealed pretty well. The newer version of these have a screw top, but that isn't available in this size, and I don't think they are anymore secure or leak proof than these are, based on how they work in the smaller size.
