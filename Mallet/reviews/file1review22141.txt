review/text: I have only used the pacifier thermometer but I find that it is perfect for new moms who want to take a quick temp for peace of mind. It is heavier than a normal pacifier but my daughter is pretty picky about what pacifiers she will take and she will keep this one in. Further I find it much more accurate than the ear thermometer.
