review/text: I purchased these when I began taking care of my elderly in-laws and find it very convenient to get thier pills ready and sit out a " day" on the counter each morning for them! I have read that the pill cases are slippery, but I didnt see a problem with that. I also read on the reviews that the items lid is heavier than the base and its hard to fill...maybe its cause I'm a nurse and give pills for a living, lol...but I found it not a problem to fill. I also read people saying that it was hard to give pills in the am if there were pills for pm due to no lid on each side...I hold one finger over the pills in the pm and turn the item over and never have once lost one in the shuffle...SO...I bought enough for two weeks worth of pills and am ordering more tonight so I can have a month ready at one time! Tried many other types of packaging and decided to go with these and toss the rest in the garbage!
