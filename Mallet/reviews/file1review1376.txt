review/text: I agree almost completely with Mr. Nix's well-written review of August, 2008.A tool which makes the assembly a bit easier is a pair of pliers for grasping the hook which attaches to the base mechanism. While I bought Model 437 you should purchase either Model 439 or 339 if you're keeping track of growing children.
