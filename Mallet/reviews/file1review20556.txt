review/text: We bought our unit at a local drugstore over two years ago, but will like to share our experience, which overall has been great. We do repeat readings just to be sure (can't wonder about your baby's health) but if done properly, we have never had a difference of over 0.2 Celsius degrees. It is great to take our baby's temperature in a blink while he is asleep. Thermal temperature reading is accurate, fast and reliable. The unit is well made, you can tell the quality, and Braun is renown as a reliable manufacturer.
