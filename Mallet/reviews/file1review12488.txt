review/text: I followed the directions on the bottle. And it said to increase 2 capsules a night until you have three or more bowel movements a day. So I did, and I got up to 10 capsules - I didn't want to go past that. Then I woke in the middle of the night because of phenomenally sharp pain in my side! I thought my appendix had burst! Then I had diarhea for 3 days! I had to miss work! That pain in my side didn't go away for a week. I was really worried that this product damaged my insides.I've tried several things since trying these. My advice to anyone is - if you are having this type of trouble, try elimation diets - start with gluten (wheat) and/or casein (milk) products. I have been gluten/casein/soy free for 2 months. And I go regularly 3 times a day with no fiber, no psyllium husk, no senna, no enzymes, no All-Bran, no Flax seed, no laxatives, no nothing! Your body is constipated because it REALLY doesn't like something you are eating! I've also been able to lose the weight I've been struggling to lose.
