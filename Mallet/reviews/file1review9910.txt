review/text: I finally bought a pair of these after years of trying to get ingrown hairs out the old-fashioned way, with a needle and conventional tweezers. These things are perfect. I can just go straight in and in one or two attempts I can pull it right out, with no other tools and far less damage to the skin than the old way. The sharpness and gripping ability seem just about perfect to me: it easily breaks the surface of the skin to get to the hair and is able to form a firm and precise grip. I really don't think I could ask for more.I see that Tweezerman carries what appears to be a newer model. I have no idea how it performs in comparison. It looks to me like the needle points are more pronounced on that one, and that may be a pro or con for some people. All I can say is that this model works perfectly for me and I've already recommended them to family.By the way, I've seen this exact model for sale locally at Sally's Beauty Supply, if you'd like to take a look in person. They come in a plastic vial for storage, with a rubber cover for the tip to keep the blades safe, and a lifetime guarantee to send them in for resharpening.
