review/text: I purchased this item after using a Just a Trim product to give my boyfriend quick hair-cuts. After that product broke, I decided to move up to a real clipper set. I was scared at first, but the set is relatively easy to use. My boyfriend stated that it did not hurt or pull his hair, and he seems to be quite pleased with the result. For the price, I think this is a superb set. The scissors included are not very good quality or very sharp, so if you really need those, I'd recommend buying a different pair. Other than that, so far we are both pleased, and would certainly recommend this product.
