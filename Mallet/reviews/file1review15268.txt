review/text: The Almond Brownie Balance Bars have a deep chocolate appearance and really look luscious. However, the taste is disappointing. Although the almond pieces provide a nice crunchy feel, the bars are slightly dry, not as tasty as the appearance suggests, and they have a slight aftertaste. I will definitely keep them on hand, though, for a nutritious snack. I'll also carry them with me when I go hiking.
