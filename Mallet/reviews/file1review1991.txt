review/text: I am a Mexican Citizen living in Matamoros, Tamps, very close to Brownsville, TX. I recently went to a kids party with my sons in the US side, and the organizer provided me one sample of these Pampers Pocket Bibsters, and it was VERY USEFUL for me.I want to buy them, but unfortunately I have not seen them in Mexico side (Matamoros) even in the Mexican WEB PAge from you I could not, too!!!!I writting down this note from Amazon.Com site (by the way, IT IS NOT available here, too)This is a very useful option, specially if we are out of home. I do not like to use disposable things (except diapers, ok?) at home, in order to do not contribute to the earth pollution. I do not know if these bibsters are "biodegradable". If not, instead of 5 stars, I would provide 3 stars only.
