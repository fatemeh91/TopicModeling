review/text: We are in the process of transitioning our son from a separate little potty to this seat on the big potty. I wish we had known about this seat from the beginning. It really is wonderful and could have worked well with a smaller child. He likes taking it on and off as needed. It has an excellent shield for boys and seems really comfortable for all occasions. It is easy to clean and looks good in the bathroom, too. Our son like the teddy bear on it.
