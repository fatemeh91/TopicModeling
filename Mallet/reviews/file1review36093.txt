review/text: 3.5 stars. I found this stuff worked pretty well for me, but wasn't ideal. The first thing is that you have to take a lot (up to six) of the large tablets, so it's quite a mouthful just to get them down. Then the main problem is that they didn't really help me get to sleep -- but once I was finally asleep, they helped keep my that way and I had fewer nighttime wakeups than usual. Overall, I'm ordering this product again.
