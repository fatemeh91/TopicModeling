review/text: The pills smell like garlic, but I haven't experienced any garlic smells or after tastes after taking the supplement. The pills punch through the blister pack very easily and I assume that keeps them fresher than if they were in a bottle. You only need to take one pill once a day. It's a very convenient way to take a garlic supplement.
