review/text: I buy a lot of stuff via my t.v. and computer.I have never had any problems with returns before.But then I must have been dealing with honest companies.Not only did these things make the pain in my feet 10 times worse......now I'm out $92.00.To say I'm sorry I ordered them would be an understatement.
