review/text: I bought this thinking that it would help me prevent stretch marks, and it did for a long time until my 8th month or so. The stretch marks that I got are not so bad but I did get a lot.Honestly, if it's in your genes, you're going to get them NO MATTER WHAT what you do.If you decide on putting any kind of stretch mark preventing/fading cream, it helps with the itching and makes your stretch marks shiny so they don't look bad later. Mind you, I NEVER scratched my tummy and still got some.Creams don't work, they help! Overall, I liked this product, especially becuase the scent. I don't like the smell of cocoa butter and this smells like a baby.
