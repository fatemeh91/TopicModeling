review/text: I've never used any nose/ear hair trimming products before (other than cuticle scissors and yanking) but I'd been looking for something and this unit got good reviews.I just received it 2 days ago but am VERY impressed with it. I obviously don't have much to compare with but this unit did everything I'd hoped it would (and could reasonably expect from it).You do still end up with very short stubble in your nose but this is certainly within the realm of what I expected. The unit is not very loud so I experienced no discomfort around my ear.Inexpensive, well designed, effective... what more could you want? Thumbs up!
