review/text: I love this stuff- after two months with my daughter's laundry smelling like the lullaby scent, I just catch a whiff and it smells like her and I love it. Before she was born it was the smell that made me think that I made the right choice instead of using Dreft or Woolite. She has sensitive skin like me (we both break out with fabric softener) and this soap is gentle enough for her. I bought this from Amazon because my Target stopped carrying it- it's a good value though it seems like a lot for a small bottle. I went through one bottle in about 2 months, so it has lasted a long time- and I do a lot of baby laundry.
