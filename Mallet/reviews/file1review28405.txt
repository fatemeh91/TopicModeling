review/text: I've been using ON Gold Standard Whey Protein for about 3 years now, and I love it, it always helps to speed up recovery time which is very useful. The Rocky Road flavor was pretty good mixed with milk and bland with Water. I also recently ordered the French Vanilla flavor which is a standout, definitely my favorite so far. All in all I will continue to use this as I've been using it for years with no side effects except great gains, growth and increased recovery time.
