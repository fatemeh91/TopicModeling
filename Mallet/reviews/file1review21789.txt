review/text: First, to the "dentist" who reviewed this product. Yes, you're supposed to follow the directions in the box and if you had read them you would know that *these* strips only require a once daily application.Yes, these strips are thicker than the other brands. This is because the paper thin whitening strip is attached to a waxy backing. The waxy backing is what helps the strip adhere to your teeth better. I rinse my mouth with water to moisten the strip, then press on the waxy outside to help mold it to the curves of my teeth (more contact area with the strip), then I fold the (waxy) tabs under and press them to the back of my teeth. The strips don't move or slide around or get TOO covered with saliva.This is probably not a product you want to use if you're going to be out in public. But, the other whitening strips aren't that concealable, either. If you want to whiten in public, maybe you should try the gel brushes or pens.I've used the Crest strips and I don't like that they don't stick to my teeth. I also don't like that less sticking means more contact with saliva that I have to swallow and tastes like peroxide. Yuck. Because these mint strips are covered with wax, there is much less of this annoyance and the subtle mint flavor masks any yuckiness. I use them on my 30-minute drive home from work and I can talk on the phone but have to be careful with "s" or it sounds like I'm lisping. Rinse with water when you're done and it does make removal easier. But, you know what? Sticky removal means it was sticking to your teeth which means it had more whitening contact time!After 2 days I noticed a real difference. After a week, my teeth were nice and white. Now the test will be to see how long it lasts and how often I'll need to repeat the process.
