review/text: After researching,reviewing and comparing so many Prenatal Multi Vitamins, we zeroed in on this one.My wife has been using these for the past eight months and they are really great. She uses these along with Rainbow Light DHA .They are very gentle and absolutely no side effects.It is made of natural ingredients.The percentages of some of the vitamins are much more than Daily recommended values like Vitamin E more than 300% of DV and Vitamin B1 and B1 greater than 500% ! etc., I wondered initially if these high dosages are really required. But the product is good , no side effects, easily digestable. Amazon has best prices on these.Will definitely recommend it.
