review/text: *update*I've now tried adding water the the supplement, supplement to the water, mixing with fork, spoon, wisk, different temp water, and it just doesn't mix that easily. I imagine a hand mixer (like I used for protein shakes) might work OK but I'm not really excited about having to clean a mixer every time I take some psyllium so I'm dropping the rating from 3 to 2 stars.*original*I've tried the orange stuff (sugar-free and regular) and psyllium husks from one or two of the "big box" pharmacies, and the "Now Foods" version. Overall I like the sugar free orange stuff best, and the Now Foods least. It doesn't mix well in cold water (the pharmacy stuff mixes better) and both the pharmacy stuff and Now Foods, being unflavored, have a texture and taste that is somewhat unpleasant. While the orange stuff does have some additives that I'm not so excited about, the vastly improved taste and texture mean that I'm apt to use it much more regularly (haha!). I'm giving it three stars because it is cost effective.
