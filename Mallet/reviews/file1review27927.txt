review/text: I heard about Whey Protein when I started working out at the gym. I could definitely feel the improvement and energy after using this product for a week. The price on amazon was perfect, as it was a lot cheaper than the one in stores and on other websites. I would recommend the "Chocolate Malt" flavor. It tastes awesome.
