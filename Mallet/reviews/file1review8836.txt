review/text: I love Green Vibrance. I'm an acupuncturist and I have tried several green drinks. Most of them taste like grass and is very hard to mix. I feel a burst of energy after I drink this, I also add some protein mix and black strap molosses with distilled water. I recomend green vibrance to all my patients, and they love it as well. Good price at Amazon.. I get the 60 day supply..
