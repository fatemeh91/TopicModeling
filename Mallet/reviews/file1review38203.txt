review/text: Dr. Scholl's Pedicure Essentials Ultra Overnight Foot Cream has a very pleasant aroma -- a very light and clean scent. The lotion is not greasy, but it does not absorb completely. It leaves a moist feeling. I haven't found it to completely relieve my dry skin as yet. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has very dry skin, However if you have light to moderately dry skin, then I'd recommend it. The best feature of this product is the scent.
