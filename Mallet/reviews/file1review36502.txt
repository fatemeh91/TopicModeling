review/text: The deodorant smells fantastic and works well. I apply in the morning and re-apply in the middle of the day, using baby powder to absorb sweat. I've tried other natural versions but this is only one that works. I'm really happy to have something that keeps me smelling great and doesn't have aluminum in it.
