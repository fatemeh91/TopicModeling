review/text: I've been using this whey protein for a couple of years, and I'm definitely a big fan of the product. This isn't the cheapest protein that you'll be able to find, but it's also not the most expensive. Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard is solid protein powder for the price that tastes great and mixes well.Most of the time I have this powder (double rich chocolate) mixed with a spoon in a glass of skim milk. In the past I've tried plenty of protein powders that essentially turn into cement at the bottom of the glass, but I don't have that problem with this product - it dissolves/mixes in well and goes down smooth. Occasionally I get fancy and get out the blender, adding a banana, strawberries, almonds, etc. and this protein works great there too. I've tried plenty of protein powder in the past that leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth, but this Gold Standard doesn't have this problem and does taste fantastic - I actually look forward to drinking these shakes. Highly recommended!UPDATE: I tried the "Delicious Strawberry" flavor, and don't like it at all. Unlike the double rich chocolate, it tastes funky and leaves behind a very strong aftertaste. I'm very disappointed in that flavor and would never buy it again.
