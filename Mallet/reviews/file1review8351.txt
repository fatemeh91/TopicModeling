review/text: OXO Good Grips Bottle BrushI use these brushes to clean out my thermos bottles. They get the bottom well scrubbed becausethe bristles aren't just on the sides but also cover the bottom of the brush, so you can clean all surfaces of glasses, cups, and especially thermoses.I also use one of these brushes to clean out the little squares inside my clothes dryer drum where the lint filter is. The bristles grab and hold onto the lint.We've used a lot of OXO products in our home because of the quality and ease of handling.I've liked almost all of these different kinds of OXO products.
