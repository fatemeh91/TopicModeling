review/text: This is my second Activator shaving system; I had one of the original models and it didn't survive a 1,000 mile move, so I purchased this one last year. I've tried many high end electric shavers over the years, and I've found that none of them work nearly as well as Braun shavers, and this one is no exception. The self cleaning system is really nice, and it does do a good job of cleaning the razor provided you use it daily. A refill lasts about a month for me, with daily use. You can buy 12-packs of the refills here on Amazon, so I only worry about it once a year. I find that I have to replace the foil and blade yearly as well... so in January I buy it all in one shot and forget about it until next year. I've been looking for an excuse to upgrade to one of the new models, but the thing works so well and hasn't had any issues, so I really can't find one!
