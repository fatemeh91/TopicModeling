review/text: The Braun 8585, after extensive shaver research, was one of the few items I listed on my Christmas wish list. Being completely new to electric shaving, I relied upon consumer reviews and product web-sites. After using the Braun 8585 for almost two weeks, all I can say is WOW! This is an amazing machine. It took me two or so days to figure out how to manuver the shaver over my face to get my optimal shave. I experience zero irritation and the shave is fantastic. It is not 100% as close as a blade, but it is 95% as close. Given no irritation anywhere on my face and neck, the 5% differential is just fine. I find that I do have to shave every day or every other day to get an excellent, easy shave. If I wait longer than two days, it's a bit more work and takes a few minutes longer, but the results come through. NOTE: I do shave before taking a shower as Braun recommends. Taking a shower before shaving may soften the facial hair, but it also causes the skin to swell a bit. Shaving before showering completely works for me. The other aspect of this product that sends it soaring is the the self-cleaning system. Works flawlessly!! No mess and comes out perfectly clean. I have zero complaints about the Braun 8585. The cleaning system is a little noisy, but in no way irritating (step out of the bathroom and close the door!!). The blue charging light isn't that bright (as some others have complained...come on, really now...what kind of complaint is that anyway?) The cleaning system emits only a very faint (i.e., you have to literally put your nose to the system in order to detect a smell) odor of alcohol when the shaver is being cleaned.I have experienced none of the problems the negative reviews on this product list. The machine works excellently in all regards.
