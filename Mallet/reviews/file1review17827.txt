review/text: I just started wearing RGP contacts a few weeks ago, and really only began wearing them regularly last week (had a few setbacks b/c of allergies and a slight corneal scratch. If you don't have a plunger for RGP removal, order a few, they can save you so much trouble.). In any case, after daily wear for about a week, I still hadn't gotten past ~2 hours of wear, until I started using the Optimum system (ESC, plus CD solution and WRW drops). The first day I sailed through 3.5 hours of wear, and could have gone longer, but decided not to push my luck. Since then I've continued to lengthen the wearing period and while I'm still adjusting to the 'there's something in my eye' sensation from the lenses themselves, I am free of other irritations I was experiencing (using Boston Advanced) and the need to instill drops every 20 minutes or so. Still need drops periodically, but I only need to put in the WRW drops every 1.5 - 2 hours, a much lengthened interval for me.Overall, if you have sensitive eyes or contact allergies (I am allergic to several of the quaterniums) I recommend that you try the Optimum system. Though I have not been using Optimum long, this is the first time I have found my RGPs comfortable enough to hope that wearing them all day, every day might actually work for me.
