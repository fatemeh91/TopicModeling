review/text: If I could rate this product less than one star I would. For the price, they are a complete rip-off. I have used this product before and have purchased it from Amazon previously. The color strips on these are orange, when previously they were blue. Even the first shave from these cartridges is uncomfortable. Subsequent shaves are much worse. Do not waste your money. If you like the Gillette brand, spend a little more and buy them from your local store. These are obviously reject products and Amazon should not be selling them.
