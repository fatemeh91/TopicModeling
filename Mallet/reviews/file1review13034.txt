review/text: The collar is easy to use, I found it to be a little to long and overlapping, but I am small I guess. It's comfortable and easy to put on. I wish the coldness would last longer, but it's a good option to have when needed. I have 3 ice packs I use in rotation after brain/spinal surgery and this is one of them. I would recommend it from my research on other options online.
