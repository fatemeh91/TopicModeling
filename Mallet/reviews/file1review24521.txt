review/text: I have constant dry lips it seems all year round and every time I put this on my lips it's like instant softness! This is a complete STEAL for less then a dollar! There is no taste, no smell, has SPF, moisturizes instantly, and etc. I use to think Vaseline Intensive lip was the best but not anymore it was only half as good and costed more.
