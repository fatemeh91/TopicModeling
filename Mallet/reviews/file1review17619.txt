review/text: I bought this on Amazon for $15 though it's now priced at $20. I liked the built-in cut-length adjustment, and that (they claim) it will NEVER need oiling or sharpening. That alone is worth the $15. The first time I used it, it worked fine - had a strong charge, and trimmed well. You can also pull off the length-adjuster to get a close trim or to clean out any hairs. All you could ask for, and great price.
