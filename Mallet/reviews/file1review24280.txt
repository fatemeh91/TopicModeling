review/text: Ow. Owowowowow. Do Not Mistake These for actual orthotics made for your unique feet. In fact, these I found to be painful and counter-productive. I bought these as a stop-gap to actual orthotics to straighten out my knees and the Walk Fits radically affected my gait, stride and shape on my foot. The podiatrist I finally got to see scolded me for making my orthotics a much more expensive proposition by first wearing a non-specific insole that did not address my feet, but rather was a commercial One Size Fits All.I'd be very very careful about putting these in your shoes.
