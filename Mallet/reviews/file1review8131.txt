review/text: I always used a dishrag or a sponge for cleaning counter tops. Then I read a review of this product that mentioned using the brush for counter tops and stainless steel sinks. I am so glad that this review prompted me to buy this brush. It really cleans up the counter tops and the stainless sink looks really great after cleaning with this brush. It is also a great tool for cleaning the interior of the refrigerator. It has cut down the time required to do that job, and just makes this weekly task more effective in less time. It's an excellent investment and would have been worth the cost at twice the price.
