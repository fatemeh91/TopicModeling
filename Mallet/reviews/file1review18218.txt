review/text: I was very VERY hopeful about this, as I too suffer from stomach symptoms. I've tried many things and nothing seemed to work.I rarely leave negative reviews, but need to be honest about this.The first thing I noticed about 20 minutes after taking it is there is a cooling sensation in your throat from the peppermint (not a problem) but then it left this weird unenjoyable peppermint taste in my mouth. After a while my throat felt like an icy/burn and I couldn't shake the smell and taste of this softgel.So I grabbed a piece of cake that I felt would be strong enough to get rid of the taste. Didn't work.I downed lots of water to maybe push the softgel down further just in case it was too high up. Didn't work.As I was walking around I felt very nauseas and I ended up vomiting in the closest waste bin I could which was the one next to my desk. It was just coming and coming out. (TMI Sorry)I actually feel a little better now since I probably vomited some of it out, even though the icy coolness is still in my throat and I can still the peppermint.I'm disappointed, I really liked the idea that something pure as peppermint (one of my favorite flavors!) could actually help me with my annoying problems.Obviously I am in the minority with my review, and I'm sure this may work for the majority. But I felt the need to write my experience after having such an uncomfortable reaction. I really hope others have better luck.
