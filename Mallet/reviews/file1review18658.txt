review/text: I found out about this device from a NY Times article on a startlingly simple and inexpensive treatment for tennis elbow (which I got from another sport, jiu jitsu). You just hold this straight out at arm's length and "wring it" in one direction then the other. Apparently this provides the same therapy to the tendon as quite expensive PT equipment.I bought one of these last year and my wife lost it while in one of her spring cleaning flurries. So I had to buy another one.Works as I had hoped. The black version this year is MUCH harder to twist than the last one. You might want to buy two, one easier and one harder, to find what is right for you. Costs a little more that way but cheaper than PT.
