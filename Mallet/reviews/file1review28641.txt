review/text: I've tried a few others from department stores. None of which mix as well as this whey. Their vanilla flavored mix is dessert-like. I will pass on the strawberry as it tastes like amoxicylin in liquid form, yet it is tolerable. I can't wait to try the other flavors. You can't beat the price of this stuff. THANK YOU OPTIMUM NUTRITION FOR NOT SUCKING AND BEING TOTALLY AWESOME! YO GABBA GABBA!
