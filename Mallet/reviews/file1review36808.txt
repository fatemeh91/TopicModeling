review/text: I purchased this for my 82yo mother who has had two hip replacements and suffers from limited mobility arising from two torn rotator cuffs. In the winter she likes to wear socks or slippers to keep her feet warm, but is often loath to ask me for help. Of course she is incapable of reaching down to pull them on herself. I admit that I was a little skeptical of whether this would work as well as some of the reviews stated, but yesterday morning she showed up at the breakfast table already wearing her socks! She hasn't been able to pull on her own socks in literally years, and this product has given her a great deal of independence as well as the important ability to regulate her own comfort levels. Before, she often didn't want her socks taken off, for fear she would get cold again when I wasn't available to aid her. Now she takes them on or off whenever she likes, depending on her needs. Highly recommended for anyone with limited mobility or recent surgeries.
