review/text: I use this item religiously and got this one for my granddaughter who has braces. Biggest problem is the breaking hose problem but have now found replacement items on Amazon so it's not such a big deal. I do feel that WaterPik could easily correct this problem with a small spring stiffener at the handle if they wanted to but they probably would not sell as many units.
