review/text: I really wanted to like this razor. Nice engineering, a clean comfortable shave, not too loud. Unfortunately, it just missed too many little hairs. I don't think my beard is any thicker than normal, but some of the hairs can curl under a little especially on my neck. Despite the nifty screen design, the razor just couldn't pick them all up no matter how many times I went over the darn things.Anyway, my advice: If you've had good luck with other electric razors and can afford the price tag, go ahead and buy it, you probably won't be disappointed. However, if you've had trouble with other electrics missing individual hairs, then you may want to stick with a blade.
