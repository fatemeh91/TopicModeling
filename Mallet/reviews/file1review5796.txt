review/text: I could not wait to receive this item. I suffer from various forms of arthritis, especially in my feet. Being middle-aged, I need therapy that will keep me going at work, as well as at home. The product promised therapeutic massage and relaxing heat. The massage is mainly vibration, which is comforting but not truly the massage I was expecting. Honestly, I do not notice any heat at all when I have the heat setting on. The fleece helps to warm my feet though! I enjoy it, but it is not quite what I expected.
