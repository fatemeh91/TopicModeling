review/text: I have tried pretty much everything out there. Anything you can buy in the grocery store, mail order products like proactive etc. I picked up a bottle of this at a spa b/c it is what they used at their business for a facial. It works great. I have super sensitive skin and although some other products were ok, I was alway blotchy and have a hard time with adult acne. I have mixed skin and it can never decide if it is dry or oily. This WORKS! It is very gentle on my skin and I don't need to put any cream or moisturizer on afterwards.
