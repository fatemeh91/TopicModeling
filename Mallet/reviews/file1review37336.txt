review/text: Definitely have to go with the Braun Epilator... NOT EPILADY! It works... much better than waxing... much neater & quicker. Just have to get used to the PULLING sensation! One hair at a time... I use it on my arms & toes. ew. Lasts longer than waxing & you can use it when the hairs are VERY short. Also has an electric razor attachment with a guard. GREAT! Easy to clean. Great quality. GET IT!! Doesn't really leave red marks afterwards, like I thought it would.
