review/text: These electrodes are very good. I'm glad I got them. They have longevity and sticking power. If you're like me and can't afford some expensive, fancy electrodes, then these are perfect. They get the job done, and I've been able to re-use them again and again. I will buy these again when I run out (but I don't expect that to be for a while).
