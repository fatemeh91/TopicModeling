review/text: The Panasonic ES7024SC was a terrible shaver. It missed spots and was very insufficient. I must give credit where credit is due though; Amazon did promptly refunded my money back, so I am greatful for that. I wasn't sure how the refund process was going to be, but I was very satisfied with Amazon's service.
