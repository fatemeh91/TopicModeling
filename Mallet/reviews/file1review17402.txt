review/text: I bought this to trim my gotee. I had been using the trimmer on my electric razor, but it didn't have a guard. I would regularly gap it bad and have to shave it all off and start over. This thing did the trick. It has an adjustable guard that will go pretty long if you need it. My only complaint is that it is a little loud and might wake up the wife in the morning, but nothing too bad. Good purchase.
