review/text: As with an electric shaver, you don't get a blade smooth result. But considering the area that is being shaved, it works great.I've had it for quite some time (bought it last spring) and haven't had to oil it yet. Half the time I forget it in the shower and have gotten multiple shaves from a single charge. But again, I'm not shaving a large area.It works as expected.
