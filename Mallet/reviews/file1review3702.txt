review/text: I didn't recommend this product. Its too expensive and doesn't serve the purpose. I was waiting for this product for two weeks to arrive at my house, to use it after my bonion surgery and I was very disappointed it broke the first day and my both feet get wet and I end up throwing in the garbage and insteadI used garbage bags to cover my feet in the shower. I truly believe that this product should be removed from the market and I deserve my money back.
