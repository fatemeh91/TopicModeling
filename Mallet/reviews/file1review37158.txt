review/text: My Rheumatologist suggested that I get some Arthritis gloves to sleep in, and gave me some local medical supply stores to shop. I decided to try the Thermoskin gloves instead of going to the suggested stores- where I was sure the product would not be in stock, have to be special ordered, and be off the charts expensive. I like my Thermoskin gloves, and my hands don't hurt like they did before the gloves. The one thing I just started to do is put powder on my hands before bedtime, as the gloves make your hands sweat, and I was getting fungal type irritation between my middle and ring fingers at the junction of my palm. This area would be super sore in the morning, but go away as soon as I took the gloves off. The powder hasn't helped as of yet.
