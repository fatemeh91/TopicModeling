review/text: Let me say that I loved this shaver since it makes it easy to do around beards etc with it's small single foil. Problem is, they don't always run properly. I've had two that did exactly the same thing. Sometimes they run fine, other times they run very very slowly like the battery is dead (but it's not). All my attempts to figure out what was wrong failed. In the end I just had to ditch them and buy a Panasonic. I still like the smaller foil of the SF3 better, but I just couldn't rely on it to work when I need it.
