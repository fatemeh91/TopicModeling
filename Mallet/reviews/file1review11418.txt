review/text: I just woke up after the second night of wearing this nightguard. If your dentist told you you have to wait and save to buy a custom night guard, ignore him and go buy this product. I woke up today without the dull headache I have had for so many years, I can't remember when they started. I have no pain and tension in my jaw, which is a miracle. I feel like I'm a new person practically. Best 40 bucks I've ever spent in my whole life.
