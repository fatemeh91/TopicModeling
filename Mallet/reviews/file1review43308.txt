review/text: I see from other reviews that not everyone feels the same way about this cleaner. We think it does a marvelous job and enjoy its pleasant scent. Mrs. Spudman especially likes the fineness of the spray, its cleaning properties, and its non streaking characteristics. Before buying Method in quantity, it would be best to try a single bottle to evaluate its performance for yourself.
