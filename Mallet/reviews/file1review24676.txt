review/text: I've heard a few things good and bad about Zantrex 3 for the past few years, and truly I thought nothing more of it than it was just many of the diet pills you hear about, but on a total whim, I decided to try it maybe it was the pretty blue bottle I don't know. Anyway I'v lost 8 pounds in almost 2 months while, I don't feel super energetic as some reviews have stated, but something even better happened.Since I began taking the Zantrex I have not, had the sensation of hunger,at all, not ONCE!!! you know that hungry feeling that "I am so hungry" feeling that makes your stomach growl, well that feeling is totally gone.I even have to stop eating at much less than I would usually eat, because I feel like I'm stuffing myself, even though it is half the food I once ate,and at night I feel like I'm sleeping on a empty stomach comfortably not on a chock full stomach-so any way Thumbs up!
