review/text: I have had lots of experience over the years with Protein and Whey Protein Powder supplements and Dymatize Elite is by far the best I have ever used. The Gourmet Vanilla is my particular favorite as it blends with lots of different fruits and veggies and milks and maintains its rich vanilla taste. Even taste good mixed with water. Also, Elite processes well and is not grainy after mixing. Also, there is "O" sugar in this product but the description on Amazon indicates that there is 3 grams of sugar per serving. I suggest that someone get this corrected as there are lots of new customers on "0" sugar diets and they would benefit greatly from making this correction and these new "0" sugar customers would experience a truly great product. I know this to be incorrect as it is the exact same product that I purchased from the Smoothie Factory and their product is 30% higher in price. The value that the Vitamin Shoppe offers on this product is excellent. They have won me over as a regular customer.
