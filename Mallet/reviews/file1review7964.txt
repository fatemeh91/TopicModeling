review/text: This brush has to be coaxed and begged, to allow the soap to come out! Do not buy this product, I bought a couple for my wife and her friends, and now every time I am in the kitchen with my wife, and she's washing the dishes I get the evil eye. One of the sponges unstuck from the brush within two weeks. Her friend's brush broke while she was trying to take off the sponge.This is really a poor design for a company with such a big reputation. I hope they read this and re-design this product.
