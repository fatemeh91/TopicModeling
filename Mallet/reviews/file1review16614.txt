review/text: I love this lighter. it light my cigars without a problem. Only thing is you have to buy the butane separately. I reccoment going to a store and getting the fluid cause shipping is ridiculous on line. i paid over $6 for the fluid. Dumb move on my part. i do recommend this lighter. $9 and it will last a long time. Can't beat a Zippo!
