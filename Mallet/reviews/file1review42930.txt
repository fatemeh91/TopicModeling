review/text: Before I ordered, I did notice that the ingredient list included "Fragrance", but, sad to say, I fell for the greenwashing and decided it must be a small amount to enhance the essential oils' scent. (For those who don't know, "fragrance" in an ingredient list indicates a product is NOT natural.) The company makes an awfully big deal about how this line is scented with essential oils. That, my friends, is a load of bullhockey. This product contains a nominal amount of natural oils for marketing purposes, and enough artificial fragrance to out-stank Great Aunt Trudy's dime-store perfume. Twice I've tried to use a small amount of this product, and both times I've had to leave the room for some fresh air. The smell seemed to coat my nostrils for at least a half hour later. Gak! Truly awful. Seemed to clean ok but I couldn't really spend a lot of time scrubbing, what with that sickening odor... And I'm only very mildly fragrance-sensitive.Want to clean green? Just use some baking soda or Borax. You'll save a couple bucks, as well as your sense of smell.
