review/text: We have a small shih-tzu mix, and these clippers worked great. Our dog is very laid-back, which is a good thing because it took us a long time the first time we groomed him. The clippers were pretty quiet and did not seem to heat up even after 30 minutes or so of almost constant use.Unfortunately, the instructional DVD did not work very well - it kept skipping. I have yet to contact Wahl to get a replacement...I would recommend these clippers.
