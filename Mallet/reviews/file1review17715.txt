review/text: Have had this razor for just over 6 months, used for mustache, moderat size beardand related trimming. Has easily adjustable head for variable lengthtrimming, handles easily, recharging rarely needed, light weight for traveling. I also use it fortrimming nose, ears and around ears which it does well. I purchased it after readingcomparative reviews of several shavers on the web. This grimmer regulary cameup as among the best and I have not been disappointed.
