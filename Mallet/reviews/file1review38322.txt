review/text: I bought this product roughly a year ago. And for the first few months, it was great. It worked just the way I thought it would, and I used it nearly twice a week because I felt more comfortable the more I used it. I hate hair, my family make fun of me because I seem to have an obsession with always being completely hairless on my legs and armpits. Well, after about 3 months, I noticed that it was becoming less reliable. It was picking up less hair, and I would have to go over the same spots over and over again. Later, the spinning twizzer wheels would constantly get jammed and would just stop until I turned it off and readjusted them. At first, it would happen maybe once every time I epilated. After a few weeks, I had to thrown it out because it would get jammed after every 10 seconds and I'd have to constantly readjust it. Believe me, this isn't the first time I've had trouble with Emjoi products. I've used two different types of epilator products from them before, and I should have known better to buy this one in the first place, because both those others had similar problems. But I figured since this one was so highly reviewed, by now they would have worked all the kinks out. Nope, I was wrong. But you don't have to be. I purchased the Braun Silk-epil Xelle Body System, Model 5270 right after I threw away the Optima... and so far, no problems! I'm completely in love with it--it works so much better than the Optima and I recommend it highly to anyone.
