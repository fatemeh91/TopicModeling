review/text: If you ordinarily take showers, your feet don't get the automatic exfoliation they would in a tub. This item fills the void very nicely. Regular use--several times a week will do it--can make a positive difference in how your feet look. It's also a nice start to your weekly pedicure. If you spend a lot of time on your feet, you'll probably find the bubble feature to be especially nice. (If you add a few drops of liquid soap, give it a quick rinse before putting it away to avoid build up.)I've had mine for over a year, and I like it. But if space is an issue in your home, you may want to consider these questions before you buy:1. Where will you use it? I would not recommend this be used on most carpeted surfaces. There is a tiny fan on the bottom. Also, the vibration feature makes the water splash somewhat. (The hood helps somewhat.) Over time, this may be a problem--especially if you live where the humidity is high.2. Where will it live when not in use? This is fairly large in size. Check out the product dimensions so that you can identify its future home before you buy it.3. Where will you put it to drain? This needs to drain and dry completely before being put away. Deciding how to do this in advance will put you ahead of the game.Since I start with warm water and don't soak for more than five minutes, I can't speak for the quality of the heat feature. But the cord is a decent length, and overall this footbath is worth at least four stars. The only negative thing: the pumice stone is rather wimpy.ADDENDUM: If you are in the caregiver role for an eldery parent or other relative, and especially if you can help with its set up and use, this item has the potential to be a great gift. For not much more than the cost of a single pedicure, you can assure that good foot care is in place. For diabetics, that can make the difference between good functioning and rapid decline. In that context, I would rate it FIVE stars!
