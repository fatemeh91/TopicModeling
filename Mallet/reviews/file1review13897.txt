review/text: Tried Ultra Fuel based on suggestions by Anthony Ellis (The "Gaining Mass" guru) in his book. A very pleasant change from traditional energy drinks. Does not make you feel heavy or bloated nor does it give you a rush of energy followed shortly by a sharp dip (like in conventional carb drinks). Provides long-lasting energy and makes a great post-workout recovery drink. Seems harder to mix with water than conventional powders but thats probably what makes the difference!
