review/text: My brother in law brought this for my mother in law and since she already had one, she left this one with me. I have used this pad for everything from back pain, bursitis, migraine headaches, sinus headaches to just warming my hands and feet. This is an awesome pad because you can regulate the temperature by holding the switch, however that is also one of its minor drawbacks, because you have to hold the switch down to maintain heat. Regardless, it is a great product
