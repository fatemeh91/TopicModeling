review/text: I've also hated stubble, gone the waxing route (first paying someone else and then doing it myself at home) and stumbled on the Braun EpilSoft here on Amazon.First, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WAXING before your first use -- otherwise it *will* hurt (and I depil all the normal areas with my Braun).Second -- and this will make things MUCH less painful: Prep the area you're about to depil with a little Bactine spray (contains lidocaine, a topical anesthetic which numbs the skin a little, greatly reducing the amount of pain -- YAY!) and wait a couple of minutes for it to work before beginning.I find that going over areas that need doing once a week (slowly, as the other poster stated) is more than often enough to keep me feeling soft and stubble-free! (Real pain-wimps [like me!] can try gradually working their way into more highly-populated-with-[re]growth sections with short strokes, and then backing off again into previously done/less populated areas, to allow endorphins a chance to enter your blood stream -- this works!)This SO beats shaving or waxing -- and it takes MUCH less time out of your life in the aggregate than either!
