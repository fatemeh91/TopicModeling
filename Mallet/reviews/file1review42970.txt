review/text: I have Power 2000 AA 2700 mah rechargeable batteries for my Canon camera. They are wonderful, betteries last a long time in my camera. When I needed AAA rechargeable batteries, I automatically looked for Power 2000 brand. I use AAA batteries for my digital voice recorder, Olympus DS-2. When I use non-chargeable alkaline AAA batteries, the batteries only last approximately 4 hours (at stereo mode); but the Power 2000 rechargeable batteries last many, many hours (even they are only 800 mah). I'm very pleased with the result of Power 2000 800 mah AAA rechargeable batteries. Another cost and space saving fact is that one charger can be used for both Power 2000 AA and AAA batteries, and charging time is rapid.
