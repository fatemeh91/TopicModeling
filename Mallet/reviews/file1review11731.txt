review/text: My son is one and isn't even on the charts with his weight. He has a couple of medical issues and he doesn't eat enough food because of it. He loves Pediasure and uses it as his sole nutrition. He is finally starting to grow from drinking Pediasure! I love this stuff and it's easily accessible. I did taste the drink and it tastes like ice cream to me :)
