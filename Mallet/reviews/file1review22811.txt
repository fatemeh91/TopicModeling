review/text: I tried with Acai before and it did not work for me.I switched to Animal Pak Cuts and this one works awesome since day 1!I do not feel bloated anymore, and when I'm working out, I feel the thermo thing working.There is one big con: swallowing 18 pills at day. 8 pills per package/ twice at day. But it works really good so it's worth doing!
