review/text: My son is now 12 months old, and we have had this item since he was born and love it. We have two covers in different colors, and this works perfect. When one is in the wash, the other is on. I haven't had any problems with shrinking in the wash, and I don't really understand the need for the slots either as the straps come up under the cover. The only issue I have seen is that both covers did get some pulls early on. No big deal, though. Sometimes I turn them inside out and use them that way. The pulls happened really early on and haven't gotten any worse. I love these covers and would highly recommend them to anyone!
