review/text: My son was afraid to sit on the big potty at all. I was nervous that this seat would be wiggly without handles, but it doesn't move at all when it is on the toilet. He can easily get it on and off by himself and then sits comfortably and confidently.Within 2 hours of having these seats in the house, he was pooping on the potty! He trained in 3 days - no joke!
