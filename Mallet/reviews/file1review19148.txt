review/text: I have suffered from tinitus for some time now with it steadly getting worse. It was getting to the point of being past annoying and becoming painful much of the time. I have been using the Ring Stop now for about 6 weeks, following the dosing instructions of taking 4 capsules a day and have found it to decrease the ringing to levels that are no longer painful and sometimes hardly noticable. I will continue to use this product and hope to continue to see a decrease in the ringing. That it has improved my ability to get to sleep is the greatest benefit. The price here is much better than what I can purchase it locally for if I can even find it available.
