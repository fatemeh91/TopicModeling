review/text: This product looks like a cheap little sticker, but don't judge too quickly. It works wonders! People tell me ALL the time that my brows look professionally done, like a supermodel's or someone in Hollywood.My only caution: WASH YOUR SKIN CLEAN first. It does not work well on oily skin. Give a good scrub, pat dry, and the hair comes RIGHT off, with no pain. Amazing. Really.
