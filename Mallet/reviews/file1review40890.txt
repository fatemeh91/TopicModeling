review/text: Normally my reviews are in partial jest, but I'll be upfront about this one. If you are a smoker and thinking about quitting smoking, these things are absolutely crucial. Yes, they are a little strong, but they are great for replacing the hand-to-mouth habit that most smokers find the hardest to give up. For me, smoking was always "something to do," and these chewing sticks (combined with nicotine gum) helped to kick the habit part of it.Of course, they won't actually replace the nicotine, but like I said, they really will help curb those cravings. Obviously one needs to be careful about swallowing them or the occasional splinter, but beyond that, there are no drawbacks. I would much rather take a splinter in the lip than be a slave to nicotine.
