review/text: As promised, 100 Condoms, with a bit of variety. Half Durex (of 4 different styles), a quarter Crown, and the rest split between Elexas (by Trojan), Lifestyles Warming Pleasure, and Kimono MicroThins. I might have liked a wider selection, but I can't really complain. Only thing that kept this below 5 stars was that four condoms expire in only six months, and another six condoms expire in less than a year. It's not a problem using them before then, but a longer lifespan would be preferred. The other 40 are good for at least four years.
