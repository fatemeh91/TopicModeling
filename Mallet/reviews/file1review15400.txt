review/text: Instead of scouring through ingredient lists to find tea tree oil in health and beauty products, and then searching (usually without results) for the amount of tea tree oil, I suggest just buying the stuff and adding it to whatever--shampoo, cream rinse, lotions.Known mainly for its antiseptic qualities, the tea tree is most famously grown in Australia. The 100% pure oil here (you just have to trust them) is, not surprisingly, slightly oily, with a sort of oily, eucalyptus-like scent. I suggest using it sparingly, or else rinsing thoroughly if you've added it to shampoo. Because you don't need a lot, the one ounce lasts several months or more, and the per annum price is a lot more palatable.
