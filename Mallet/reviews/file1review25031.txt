review/text: I was interested in finding a BCAA supplement that was affordable and low in sugars as a supplement to my protein shakes. This product fit the bill very well. However, packaging can be deceiving and the container is much smaller than it looks. however, it packs the amount of BCAAs it advertises in a great-tasting, low-sugar, grape flavoring. I highly recommend this. There are superior products but they cost a lot more per serving.
