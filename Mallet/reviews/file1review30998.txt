review/text: This stuff works. It kept the swelling in my knee down and was able to continue working until I could see a doctor and get MRI and surgery. Told the Dr. I was taking this and he said its a good product and to continue taking it. Had surgery to repair the knee and am still taking this. I would recommend this to anyone with knee problems.
