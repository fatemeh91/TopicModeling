review/text: I thought this would be a fun gift for a friend's birthday. I expected the 100 condoms would come in some sort of cute box or package that described "condoms from around the world" etc. I also ordered a box for myself. What I ended up getting was a plain white US Post Office box with some handfuls of condoms thrown in. (Possible 200? I haven't counted.) Certainly not a fun gift item I can give to a friend. I've tried contacting CondomMan to return the items for a refund, and ten days later have still heard nothing back from them. Learn from my experience--don't waste your time with this vendor.
