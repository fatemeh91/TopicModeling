review/text: I've tried others; they didn't work. This Panasonic (ER112B) is different. It really works. It easily cuts off nose and ear hairs. It can get close to the hair's base without hurting the underlying skin. And it removes the hairs after they're cut with a mild vacuum action. Neat.It has pretty good power for something that uses a battery; it doesn't slow down or require multiple passes.The noise level is moderate - not silent, but not a racket either. You can use it in your ears without going deaf.I was skeptical before I bought it, but am now convinced; it works.I recommend this product.
