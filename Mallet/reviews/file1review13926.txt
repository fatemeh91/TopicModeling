review/text: Lip Smacker glosses are SUPER stuff! I've been wearing them since I was a teen -- but these pretty pomades in fun flavors are not JUST for schoolgirls. They provide a great glimmery shine, a really pretty tint -- especially when applied thick, and their moisturizing properties are unparalleled! Prevents chapped lips the FUN way! They also make kissing fun and rewarding for one's partner!The Smackers are fun to use, pretty to wear, and who says they're just for seventh-graders? The Dr. Pepper one tints lips an attractive just-been-kissed red and impart the refreshingly yummy taste of cherry cola. If I could give Lip Smackers 10 stars, I would!
