review/text: I drink this every morning at work (mixed with fat-free milk). I bought a "Fit & Fresh" personal/portable mixer for it, but it seems to work when it's just shaken too (it even says shakable on the canister). It tastes pretty good. It's not perfectly smooth like the pre-mixed ones in the cans, but it's not chalky either.
