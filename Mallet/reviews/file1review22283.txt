review/text: I starting using the lanolin in the first few days then stopped because I thought it wasn't working. I quickly realized how much it aided in the moisturizing of my nipples because they began to crack. I then went back to using the lanolin and they healed immediately. Highly recommend using this product and don't stop until the first week or 2!
