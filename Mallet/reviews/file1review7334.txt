review/text: I use the foot spa infrequently, primarily for helping to recover from foot surgery.I've had the unit for over a year, but have used it only about 6 times (and being careful not to add anything to the water per the directions).This morning, I pulled it out, filled it with warm water, plugged it in and started it up in anticipation of helping a foot recover from another, recent operation. The unit worked for about 5 minutes and then the air pump quit functioning properly, making only a clicking sound and providing no air jet flow.The only advice from Brookstone customer service is to take it to a repair shop.I am extremely disappointed that such an expensive unit has failed and requires repair after just 6 uses.
