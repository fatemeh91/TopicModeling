review/text: I've used Primal Defense for many years and consider it essential. The soil based organisms help to control fungal overgrowth, support the immune system and improve digestion. The most dramatic results have been in my elderly Mother-in-law. She has suffered with toenail fungus for many years. I take care of her feet and a topically applied fungicide has had only minor results. When she started taking 2 Primal Defense tablets a day with her vitamins, it took only a few months to see profound changes in her toenails. We didn't expect any change in that area but the fungus must be systemic because PD has helped so much.
