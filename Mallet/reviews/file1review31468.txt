review/text: This kit replaces my 1 lb. 9oz. group-size first aid kit and right out of the box saved me a pound from my pack weight. It contains everything one could want for a weekend hiking trip, except for scissors and plenty of advil and/or tylenol. (I added those items, but not anything else.) I would have given it 5 stars if it contained a small set of scissors.I love the fact that it is water resistant, which my old kit was not, and I consider the waterproof bags to be easy to open and close. I am hoping that I never have to use this for anything major, but if I do, it contains everything that I would probably use as an avid, long-time hiker and explorer!
