review/text: I love SoyJoy bars! The Mango Coconut has a hint of the islands with the delightful mango and chewy coconut. It's a "just right" snack for any time! I sometimes find myself craving one of these yummy bars. They are perfect for just before or after the gym. I appreciate the fact that they are all natural and filled with real fruit and nuts and no artificial sweeteners. I love all the flavors; Raisin almond, Berry, Apple, and Mango Coconut! Great product! I have recommended them to all my friends and family!
