review/text: I just got one of these at GNC and paid way too much. Its a piece of garbage, Does not work at all. Put the battery in and it is just beeping, flashing OK. Finally after pressing NEXT about 20 times the profile for B flashes. The display doesn't work properly and showed from what I could tell a body fat % of 0.00%
