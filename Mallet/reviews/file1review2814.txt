review/text: Ha, I should have made a video review for this! (Barf) Without being too graphic, this stuff works really well. It lasts a long time, feels great, and doesn't get messy. Easy clean up too and I swear my skin is healthier then ever now!Also, this bottle is downright novelty sized. This would make a practicle yet borderline gag gift for a bridal shower.
