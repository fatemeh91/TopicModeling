review/text: Without this product, or another of its quality equivalent, the blade of your clipper will have a short life. I found this out the hard way. And those blades are quite costly.This is the way I use it: When I am finished clipping a dog (or when the blade gets so hot I feel it prudent to stop and let the blade cool off before continuing), I lightly dot the front rim of the blade atop the separation of wide and short blades. Then I switch on the clipper for probably no more than 15 or 20 seconds, turn it from side to side and upside down to get the oil distributed, then turn off the clipper. Then I tamp around the blade to remove any lube still on it.I have four big dogs and one toy that I groom and I find that the blade is holding up very well with this method. When I didn't use the lube, I had to toss the blade out and order another one after grooming the five of them only one time.Excellent product!
