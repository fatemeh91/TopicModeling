review/text: This creatine powder is like many... It's granulated... it tastes horrible.It's icky, and it even looks like an illegal drug.Why do I love this product? Because it is real, high quality creatine.Introduce this supplement to your lifestyle... even if you are not a body builder or an athlete you will notice the difference in six days of taking this product.
