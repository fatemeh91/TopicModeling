review/text: Before I begin this review I have to get this out there, this is my first body fat measuring unit I have used and It is possible that I'm not utilizing it the correct way. That being said, I read the manual and pamphlet that came with the unit over and over again and looked up as much information as I could online to find out how to get a consistent and accurate reading. So far I have used a ruler to measure from the same spot as much as possible and my readings still can vary 10% give or take. I feel like my readings fluctuate less the more I use it, but I don't really think they're all that accurate, just more of a point of reference. I guess you could say that I feel like I "got what I paid for" from this thing. I don't see many other appealing alternatives out there in this price range, so maybe this is the best you can get for $30. Be prepared to be frustrated in the begin using this thing, because you have to figure out how hard to squeeze the caliper and when to push the button that takes the measurement, this can be tricky. The measuring tape included with the unit is very useful however.
