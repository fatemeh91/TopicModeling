review/text: I bought these gloves because my hands have a very hard time keeping warm & I work outside as well as inside the house. Outside these gloves are wonderful, they keep my hands warm, yet with the open fingers I am able to pickup things that I need to get. They sometimes can get a little moist inside, all I have to do is open the wrist clasps to allow a little air inside.Inside I work as a massage therapist, these gloves keep my hands warm for my clients before we start a massage session. They are great to drive in as well.These gloves will be a true "hand saver" for me this winter season. I'm so glad I found them...Thank You... :) A GOOD BUY...
