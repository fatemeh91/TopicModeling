review/text: There are a few good things, and to many bad things about this product. I'll start with the good!The vibration is awesome, its not to much but just enough.The handle makes this toy easy to hold onto and easy to find the buttons to control the speed...it even includes a reverse for the metal balls and the rotation!Its big, but not to big. I'd say just about right.The bad....I cannot use the metal balls/rotation part of this toy which is the main reason I bought it. While the size is great (it matches my partners size perfect)adding in something that rotates, moves, and is made out of metal...for me it was to much, and not in a the good kind of way. Using them for stimulation would probably work but using them while having an orgasm (to me) hurt.The ears are also slightly annoying...I cut mine down, otherwise they had a tendency to poke in all the wrong places.Overall this toy is a great buy, and even though the rotation part is out, the vibration is awesome and the size is nice.
