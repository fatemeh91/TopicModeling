review/text: This is a great product, and we have tried many similar products. This is the easiest to mix & gives the most energy & mental clarity, and for the longest sustained period of time. I tell everyone I know about it. I give people free samples & then they get hooked & give up caffiene! I carry a serving with me in a small Tupperware container in my purse wherever I go, in case I'm particularly busy & would enjoy a nice pick me up. (I usually wind up giving it to someone complaining about being tired & stressed out!) I give it to all my employees & achieve a far superior, not only work performance, but also attitude & quality of temperment. ABSOLUTELY NO comparison to caffeine (jitters, cranky mood swings... Who needs it! Yuk!) Caffeine just makes you more tired later by stressing your adreanal glands! We mix this Green Vibrance with a product call Ruby Reds which can be be found at www.rubyreds.com, which is a product of equal quality, only based in fruits. Yummy! Great combo! This is a great phytonutrient one-two punch that is actually GOOD for you! Get yours today & find out just how lousy you have been feeling & just how easy & simple it is to immediately feel GREAT!
