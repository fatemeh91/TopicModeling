review/text: I'm sorry to write such a negative review, but the maker messed up and this product is going back. The box and bag clearly and in large WARNING letters say "DO NOT GET WRAP WET", "IF THE PRODUCT BECOMES DAMP, FULLY AIR DRY IT BEFORE CONTINUING USE", and in smaller letters, "Do not use wet towels under the gel".So exactly how do you do moist heat, if you need to stop as soon as the gel gets "damp" and "fully air dry before continuing use"? This product should not be advertised as being suitable for moist heat until it is fully sealed in something that completely protects the gel from moisture.Also very important, what happens when you break a sweat under the pad? I'm not by any means a chronic sweater, but it's a heating pad and that is just part of the deal. My current heat therapy device is fully sealed in plastic so it can be washed for hygienic reasons, and that's just common sense in action.Further, heating compounds tends to release chemicals, so covering the wonder-gel with something known to be safe for human contact after heating would be highly advisable to avoid the possibility of giving people allergic reactions to whatever the gel is made of.1 star and I'd give it 0 if I could for wasting my time and shipping costs. Don't cut important things that a customer would happily pay for because you are trying to hit a price point you made up in your offices.
