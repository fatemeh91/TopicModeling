review/text: I received this product today and I will be returning this product today.The biggest red flag is you cannot read the label online.I was looking for the Amino Acid Combination that Dr Oz spoke about on his show and this is not it. (Not even, close)The label states you have to take 4 pills to get only 600 mg of the combined vitamin. Some to the vitamin contents are as low as 24 mg.Unless you are taking meds to stay alive, NO ONE should be taking almost 40 pills a day.I am looking for the G.O.A.L 2000 mg that Dr OZ speaks of on his show.Any Suggestions?Glycine &#8211;Ornithine-Arginine -Lysine
