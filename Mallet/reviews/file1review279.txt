review/text: After reading reviews complaining about the size and smell of this product, I was a little worried. Upon taking it out of the box, it did have a toxic odor; this odor, however, had nearly disappeared after one use. I'm average height, but small and young (19 years old), so I was worried about the size, but it did not disappoint. It is a LITTLE big for me, but I didn't even use lube and I was fine - I just didn't plunge right in when using it. I could see the problem if you're used to something skinnier, but it's not so bad (~6" circumference, ~1.6" diameter). The rotation is my favorite part - it doesn't even stop moving like other rotating vibrators. The vibration is a little strong and the ears are not so pliable, but on the lowest setting in combination with the rotation, it is perfect. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you can get over size and are not sensitive to vibration.
