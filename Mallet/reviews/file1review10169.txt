review/text: My daughter gave me my first Blistex Infusion and I was sold on the product, however it became harder and harder to find on the shelf in various drugstore and cosmetic departments. I was traveling 45 miles each way to a store where I used to live to find the Infusion and was buying in multiples! And then the worst case scenario, even they stopped carrying it. So I went on line to several web sites and finally found it at Amazon.com. I had to buy a 12 pack which was a lot of Blistex, but that way I could share with my grandson in college and my daughter. The rest is in my purse, my bedside table, my desk, my car and the remainder in a closet for future use. It is the smoothest and softest, not gritty or heavy, product I have found. It even comes in cherry flavor! I also use it along with lipstick. My complaint with other lip products is that after they wear off, my lips actually felt dryer than before. That is not the case with Blistex Infusion. It's the last thing I put on at night and I wake up without the dry lip feeling that I had before using this great product. I'm thankful my daughter shared this with me and I'm glad Amazon continues to carry it.
