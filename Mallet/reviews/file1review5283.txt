review/text: I really like the taste of this candy, just the right amount of ginger.I have to take a fair amount of medicine in the morning after I eat breakfast. I find at different times, I will become nause or get an upset stomach from the medicine. Gin.Gins candy really stoothes my stomach and makes it feel better. I even use this candy as a breath mint, when out and about I take along some of this candy in my purse to refresh my breath.
