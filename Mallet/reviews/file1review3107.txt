review/text: So far these have been my favorite and it sucks that it took me so long to discover this brand / style. They have been the best feeling so far and seem to give a bit more friction/sensitivity as well compared to other brands. A definite keeper and I'll probably reorder these over all brands unless the gf wants to keep trying other brands.
