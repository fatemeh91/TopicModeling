review/text: I was excited to get this product after reading the reviews. I had previously used a 7 day, one compartment per day, each connected to the other (like you would purchase at the drug store). Each day I would have to sort out the morning from the evening pills so I was looking forward to the AM/PM pills being separate as well as having one detachable "pod" per day. When I began using it, I found the following flaws, which were very annoying:1. I always load my pills at the beginning of the week like an assembly like. So I lined up each of the pill container pods on my countertop and opened them all. They immediately TIPPED BACKWARDS TO REST ON THE HINGE (each lid making a 45 degree angle with the countertop). This made filling each pod impossible without picking each one up and manually filling one, closing it again (so they don't fall out when I set it back down, picking up another bottle of pills, and repeating the process. With my old system, I could open all the days and fill all of them. I ended up trying to prop the back lid against a wall but since they are so slippery and oval shaped, they tended to slide back down).THIS IS WHAT SHOULD BE FIXED: THE LOWER LID SHOULD BE HEAVIER THAN THE UPPER LID SO IT CAN REST FLAT AND HAVE A LOWER CENTER OF GRAVITY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE SHOULD BE A RUBBER PAD OR LOW FRICTION SURFACE UNDER THE LOWER LID TO DECREASE TIPPING AND SLIDING.2. It's unbelievable that each compartment (morning and evening) does not have it's own lid. WOW. Taking out the morning pills is difficult without the PM pills spilling out too. Also, when filling them, AM and PM pills can easily fall into the other compartment (or fall out of the pod).FIX: MAKE TWO SEPARATE LIDS PLEASE!!3. I don't consider myself "elderly" but these are SLIPPERY CONTAINERS. They often slip out of my hands and with meds inside, this is dangerous for losing pills (you absolutely don't want any falling on the floor with kids or pets around).4. The lids do not reassure me that they are closed securely. Opens too eaily. No nice snap sound. Furthermore, the opening mechanism is such that you need to lift the left tab upwards while the right tab downwards. I could not figure out how to open it for a short while and this requires some small amount of dexterity (again, perhaps not best for some people).So good concept, needs improvement. I am a 5 stars or 1 star person, but the most I could give this is 1.5 to 2 stars.
