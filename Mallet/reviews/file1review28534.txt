review/text: I am satisfied so far with the product. I find that unless I use a blender or blender bottle it is very difficult to create a shake that is not clumpy. That being said, my blender bottle makes it dissolve fully, as does mixing it into my morning smoothies (Banana, frozen blueberries, almond milk & spinach). It tastes great mixed into the smoothies and adds lots of protein!
