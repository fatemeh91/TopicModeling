review/text: I have Fibromyalgia which has weakened my colon dramatically. I was at my wit's end, searching for some non-harmful way to eliminate waste. I had lost the ability to have bowel movements! Very distressing and unhealthy. Even coffee enemas were no longer working. Oxy-Powder has solved the problem. I no longer need to use enemas. I no longer use any kind of laxative. I never need high colonics. And remarkably, I've even regained some bowel function. Every body is different, but for me this product has been a blessing.
