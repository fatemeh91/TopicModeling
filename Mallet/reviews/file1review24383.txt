review/text: So far every hammer gel flavor I have tried is delicious, but apple is my personal favorite. It doesn't make me feel as thirsty immediately after drinking it and it taste like apple pie filling!As far as performance goes, it does seem to keep my energy levels up while I'm out hitting the trails. I just wish there was an easier way to take it while mountain biking. I've tried a couple of different flasks, but they were both difficult to manage without loosing pace. I usually have to slow down to keep from making a big sticky mess of myself.
