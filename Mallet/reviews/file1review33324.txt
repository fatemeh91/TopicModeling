review/text: These bars are quite tasty and filling - a great tasting option for someone concerned about nutrition and/or weight loss. I really like the chocolate peanut butter bars, which taste like Little Debbie Nutty Bars. The double chocolate flavor is good, too, I just don't find it quite as satisfying. (No childhood nostalgia with that one.)Unfortunately, this is an overpriced way to buy them, especially after you add in shipping. I buy this same box for $11 at my military base commissary. You can also buy smaller 6 CT boxes of just the chocolate peanut butter flavor at just about any grocery store. There are also some other Amazon.com venders[...] selling just the chocolate peanut butter flavor. So shop around if you think you'd like to try these.
