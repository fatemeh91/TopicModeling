review/text: Bought this together with a another product, Ultra Fiber, to see which would be a better fiber supplement. I found Fiber Choice to have lesser side effects. Ultra Fiber bloated my stomach even with only half the recommended dosage. Did not have the same problem when I used Fiber Choice.
