review/text: In my never ending quest to kick the habit - I started on the patches. My first run to the store I boughtNicoDerm CQ STEP 1 - 3 Week Kit - 21 Clear Nicotine Patchesand though those patches were gunky and incredibly itchy - it never occured to me to smoke while I was using them. I went to the store to buy my second box and they didn't have them.So I noticed that not only did they have this brand, but they were cheaper by about ten bucks. So I bought a box. First of all the patch itself is much more attractive (a round flesh colored circle) and second of all - they don't itch or coat you in gunk.The problem is that you might as well buy a pack of stickers and cover yourself with them. There is NO nicotine relief to be felt in these patches. I don't know if in their attempt to make the patch more comfortable they prevented the nicotine from entering your system or what - but they don't work. At all. In fact I think I've smoked MORE since sticking these stupid things on. I'll be back to the nicoderm next week when they get them in the local store. Those actually helped with the cravings.
