review/text: These Plantation chewing sticks are very strong. I haven't tried the cinnamon variety but I have heard those are even stronger. These are very "tea tree" and minty, and are really a great way to freshen your breath when you don't have a chance to brush your teeth. I always kept a pack in my car and a pack in the office and after a meal I would use them as you would use a normal toothpick. Doing so left me with cleaner feeling teeth and fresher breath.Others have recommended these chewing sticks to help cope with smoking cessation but I can not comment on this usage as I don't smoke. If you do smoke and you'd like to stop, it's worth a try! At the very least your breath will be better :)
