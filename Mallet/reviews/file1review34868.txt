review/text: ....and if you can keep it sharp, and OK shaving blade.If you are looking for a daily razor, go to one or more of the Straight Razor sites. This is a $10 blade. Don't expect to get a Solingen quality razor at this price.On the other hand. If you screw it up learning to hone your own blades, you're not out much.As a learning tool, it's worth four-stars, as shaver, not more than two-stars.
