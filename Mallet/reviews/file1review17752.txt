review/text: At first, the battery would last for weeks on a single charge. Towards the end, after charging for hours,the trimmer couldn't sustain operation for not even a minute. I had to throw it out.Not to mention, the blade plate was not secure. It would pop out when I went to use itand I had to careful click it back into place and hope it wouldn't fall off.
