review/text: I am not pregnant and have no plans of getting pregnant but I heard that this helps with hair growth. I have long hair but it's not as thick as it used to be (probably due to my unhealthy vegetarian diet I've kept for a LONG time...I only ate bad stuff) and wanted the thickness back. I KNOW it's genetic but my parents both have really thick hair and I used to as well so I'm sure I somehow thinned it out. In any case I bought these and then kind of chickened out on taking them consistently because they have a LOT of vitamins in them for just 1 person - especially vitamin A which can kill you if taken too much. So I can't really say if they help or not. I've also heard it's more about the woman's hormones when pregnant that help with hair growth not necessarily the vitamin content so I'm not sure what to do with that. In terms of the size - the vitamin is big but I had no problem swallowing it (and believe me I used to have a problem swallowing any size pills when I was a kid). There is no strange taste if you swallow it so people complaining about taste must be sucking on it..which is a little weird and not recommended.
