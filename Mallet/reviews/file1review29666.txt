review/text: I love how soft and thick this nursing pad is compared to the other cloth ones available! I also like that it doesn't show the typical "line" a lot of pads often show through your shirt. The only down side is, the pad doesn't always stay exactly put. In the month that I've owned them, one has gravitated out of my nursing bra, and up my shirt 3 times.
