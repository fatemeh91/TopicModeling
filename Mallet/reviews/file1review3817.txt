review/text: I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise. The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat. I think a better blend would be something with more "heat" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that.
