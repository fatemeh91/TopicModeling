review/text: I usually purchase liquid forms of vitamins and if I cant find liquid I get the clear capsole because most tablet vitamins take forever to desolve in your body. Then its extracted from the body before it can even be absorbed. if you hold this horse pill in your mouth for longer than 10sec...its starts to desolve. Also if you cut it in halve you'll see that just under the thin coating its basically a soft chalk consistency. This is great.All that being said, I still use a crusher to grind it up so I can add it to my protein shake w/ liquid calcium but I also take 1 pill whole atleast once a day. I know that my body is absorbing the magnessium because every other day I have 2 bowel movements when I'm use to just 1 a day. I am taking magnesium because it help with my calcium absorbtion. Beause it does increase bowel movements I started out just taking 1 a day to see how that would affect me...didn't want to take too much and get dihrea. I by mid week I knew I could increase to 2 pills with no problems and then by week 2 I knew I could go up to 3 pill (600mg). I also know that if I do 4 pills (800mg) that it produces a 2nd bowel movement every other day. I'm okay with this so now I alternate between either 3 or 4 pills which are taken in 6 - 8hr apart.
