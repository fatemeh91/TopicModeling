review/text: I have been using this product for many years. It is the most effective deodorant I have ever used. I work closely with people all day long and need to have protection from underarm odor, without aluminum (which is in nearly all commercial deodorants). Many of the "natural" deodorants are not so effective, especially after a long day at work.I love this one.
