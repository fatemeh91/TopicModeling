review/text: This is the 4th pair of the Happy Toes that I've owned, my family loves them and I was happy to find them instead of settling for a cheap substitute. However after the very first use, one of the outer seems became quickly unsewn, due to the location and material it is impossible to repair. I am very disappointed to say the least, the quality was unacceptable.I bought two pairs and the other was perfectly fine.
