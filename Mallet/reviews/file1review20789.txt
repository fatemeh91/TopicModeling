review/text: I switched from Mach3 + Edge gel to this beauty and couldn't have made a better choice. My skin started getting razor burn and bumps in the neck area from the Mach 3, so I decided to buy this after reading the reviews. Best purchase I've made. No more burn and a smooth (against the grain) shave with no irritation whatsoever and no water. Not going back..
