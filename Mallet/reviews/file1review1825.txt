review/text: I have a very bad case of tinea versicolor all over my shoulders and back, so I tried out this stuff. It took about 2 1/2 weeks to start seeing results, but the stuff is nearly gone. It did not cure all of it, but my back almost looks normal again. My shoulders have basically completly cleared. This is much safer to use than some of the pills they give you at the doctor and the pills usually don't work anyway. I am a believer in this soap now. :)
