review/text: I think 300 calories per shake is waaaaay to much for people that do not burn calories like others do. Oh yea... they call it a SLOW METABOLISM! I used it as directed for two weeks. I never lost a pound.I lost 70 pounds on the Medi-Fast Shakes, but they are waaaaay too expensive.I bought 2 - 3 packs of the 3-2-1 Plan shakes. They are OK tasting (but not very sweet and rather Bland. Even only using 6 ice cubes and 6 ounces of water they are very thin and not like a SHAKE!Tip - get the Jello Sugar Free - Fat Free INSTANT Pudding (adds very few calories) and add just one level tablespoon of it with your shake mix before you put it in the blender. You'll get a slight texture to your shake and it sweetens it up just right! I use the vanilla Pudding for the Strawberry Shakes and the Chocolate Pudding for the Chocolate Shakes.A few Frozen Strawberries or half a banana helps add a little consistency to the watery shakes too... but the more you add to it - the more calories are adding up!The thin watery shake made me feel like I was drinking Flavored Water. YUCK!
