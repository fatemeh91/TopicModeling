review/text: My favorite part is that I can open my eyes and not know that they are open because it is so black. The mask doesn't press against my eyes, which is wonderful. Someone mentioned a gap in the nose, but I don't have that problem. The velcro did get stuck in my hair a few times and it isn't very side-sleeper friendly. Because the mask does bulge out at the eye sockets, it gets pressed to the side if you sleep on your side. I do like that the length is adjustable so you can tighten it to stay on better. Definitely recommend. :)
