review/text: This product replaced my WaterPik personal unit which lasted barely 3 years. The problem I had with thatunit is similar to this...the pumping of the water from the holding container to the jet isn't reliable...This unit too, works erratically, and I have to constantly reposition and reset the container filled with water on the base. Sometimes no water comes out and I realize the contact might be off...When I say "contact', I'mtalking about the small rubber ring on the bottom of the water container having to meet the rubber ringthat sits on top of the motorized base. If it's slightly off, no water comes out of the jet...Half the time I thinkit's perfect and it's not. So, something about the design of this unit isn't right..I gave it 3 stars because whenit works, it works fine...I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what a perfect contact IS..and most of thetime, there's nothing obvious to notice.
