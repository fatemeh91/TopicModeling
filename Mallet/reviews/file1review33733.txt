review/text: I ordered a used wastebasket in "new" condition. It had a huge dent in it. If you really want this product, make sure you buy it new. I'm not sure it's worth the price they're asking, but you might as well get one that isn't beaten up. Another item I ordered brand new from this company also arrived damaged. The mesh on it was torn. The company was totally reasonable about replacing it, but of course that takes time. Buy in advance.
