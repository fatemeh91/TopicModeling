review/text: This shaver has only one drawback. It has no light to tell you when to re-charge it, so you either have to run it down or run the risk of cooking the battery.On the other hand, the shaver foil heads are one third the cost of Braun or Remington, and the shave is as good or better. In the literature that comes with it, they warn you to shave for 3-4 times to condition your face, and this is true. Also, you can get foil heads for three types of beard, which works well.The purchase price is excellent compared to Braun or Remington, and the last one I had lasted 5 years. I don't know why this company doesn't push these shavers more, as they are an excellent value for the money.
