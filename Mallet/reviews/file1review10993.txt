review/text: I bought the Cryoderm spray because my mother swears by it, but I haven't been nearly as satisfied with it as she is. While a spray can help you reach areas you can't as well with a roll-on, it also can make a bit of a mess and get to areas you don't want it to. But it just doesn't work as well as Biofreeze, which I've gone back to. Biofreeze goes on easily and the scent disappears (which would be nice for Tiger Balm, which is the best but the smelliest), and is a far better product than Cryoderm.
