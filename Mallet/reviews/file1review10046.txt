review/text: I had an Interplaque electric toothbrush, which was great. The plaque really came off, and my teeth felt smooth to the tongue. The thing finally broke, and I decided to get this Oral B as a replacement. What a disappointment. I tried the circular brush, and the double brush head. It's big and bulkn, makes a lot of noise and hub-bub in your mouth. It often stops if you press too hard against your teeth. But the main problem is that my teeth are not smooth afterwards. It simply does not work as well as the old interplaque. I think the interplaques bristles went in and out and rotated. These bristles do not rotate, and what they DO do does not work as well. I spend a hundred bucks on this including a pack of double brush heads. I then bought the new version of the interplaque, made by Conair, for about $20. My teeth are smoother, and brush head is smaller, and it just works better. (used without toothpaste, though sometimes with an anti-plaque mouthwash). I don't know why the interplaque is not more widely popular. It just works better, feels better in your mouth, doesn't stop if you press harder against the teeth, etc.
