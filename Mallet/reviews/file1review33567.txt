review/text: I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device's tips quality. The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break. Mine broke within 2 days. I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product.
