review/text: Cetyl myristoleate was mentioned to me by several agility competitors, as a joint supplement worth considering for older but still competitively active working dogs. I'm happy to report it seems to be very helpful for my 9 year old Australian Shepherd; we can warm up, work hard, enjoy both the running and jumping in our favorite sports, and show no signs of stiffness or pain later.
