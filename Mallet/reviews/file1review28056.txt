review/text: It tastes great. According to different sources, it is one of the better protein sources. I don't care about the absolute best protein in the world, but I do care about taste. Even in water, this stuff is still good. Use it with bananas and a water/milk mixture and you have a milkshake worthy of the Dairy Queen menu, yet you don't have to feel guilty about it. Ten pounds is also killer so you don't have to keep buying it every week. A little more expensive than some others, but worth it in my opinion since I don't want to throw it up afterwards.
