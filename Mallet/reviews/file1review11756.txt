review/text: I purchased the correct size based on the companies measurement process. The portion of the brace that fits over the forearm seems to fit well, but the portion that sits over the upper arm is SUPER baggy on the backside (tricep) portion of my arm. There is no way this thing would provide any support for me, might as well wear a sock. Unless you are really fat and have a huge amount of flesh on the back of your arm, you will not find a size that will fit and perform as described. Also, their return policy is terrible. Cost me over $40 in shipping and restocking fees to return this pos.
