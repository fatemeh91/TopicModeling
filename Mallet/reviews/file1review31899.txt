review/text: I gave this product a try to aid in digestion and my Crohn's. I tried different doses from high to low but it kept yielding the same results... severe abdominal gas! I experimented with the product for 2 weeks and my body was unable to acclimate to it. I have tried other Garden of Life products with great results but this one, IMHO, is not worth it.
