review/text: I have tried many protein bars (except for peanut flavors), and this is my favorite. It's better-tasting than most candybars, and none of the BalanceBars have spiked my blood pressure (not an energy bar; those they call their "gold" line). Also the nutritional "balance" is at least on par with others-- bear in mind this qualifies as a meal (by the numbers if not for real), not just a snack.CONS--It will melt in heat (as in shipping); there has been some batch-to-batch variation for whatever reason, maybe the shipping, but they're still tasty; and as with other of these fairly dense protein bars, I prefer eating them with fluids, for better digestion. If I'm going to grab one heading out the door, for a breakfast, better get a drink too, or just eat half. 16g of protein is a big breakfast.
