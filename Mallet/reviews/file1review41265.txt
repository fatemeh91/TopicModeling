review/text: My husband bought these from a healthfoods store. My job as a chef is highly physical and exhausting. At the end of the day is when you will feel the results of these vitamins. I was not worn out like I had been by just taking over the counter vitamins. I recommended them to my sister, she too is over 40 and felt more energy at the end of her day. If you are fatigued try them, they are worth every penny. Glad to see them being sold at Amazon.
