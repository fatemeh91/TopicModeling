review/text: I've been using a professional model Roto-Dent brush for a few years, but lately have been using mostly manual brushes. Went to the store to replace my old Oral-B manual brush, and saw this Power model for only about two dollars more. Wow! The difference is amazing. Crisp and clean. I bought another for my wife, and she loves it too.
