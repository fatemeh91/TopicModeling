review/text: I'm a 64-year-old woman with difficulty seeing close up. I've had many lighted make-up mirrors over the years and had yet to find one that had adequate lighting, enough magnification, and distortion-free mirror glass. My last mirror had been purchased from a speciality store for about $80 and I wasn't that happy with it.I recently purchased my second Conair Infiniti mirror. I received my first one two years ago as a Christmas gift. When I got home and plugged it in I was amazed at how clear the images were and how perfect the magnification was. It has a regular 1X side with a small 10X magnification "button," and a reverse side with 7X magnification - this is the side that I use and it's perfect for me. It has three light settings which are controlled by touching the base of the mirror. I would prefer that it had a switch instead, but this is only a minor annoyance in my opinion. The only reason that I replaced the original one was that I accidentally broke the mirror on one side. I tried using one of my "old" mirrors (I have about 4 or 5 of them, always searching for the perfect mirror) but they don't compare with the Infiniti. This is why I ordered another one just like it.I highly recommend this mirror for women like me who want a good clear view of their face so they can get their makeup on right!
