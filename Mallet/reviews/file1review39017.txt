review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised by the value of this kit. The clipper is professional quality, heavy (not plastic) and well balanced. It comes with every accesory you could ever want, right down to a drape and neck brush. The only thing I would improve would be the hand shears, which do not seem up to the quality of the clippers. But, hey, I didn't even expect to get the scissors at all for the $27 price! Comes in a handy plastic case to keep everything together neatly.
