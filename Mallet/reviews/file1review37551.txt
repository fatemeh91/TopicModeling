review/text: Ok, here goes, this product is so great that I don't have to shower for weeks. I give it 5 stars because after two weeks of not showering, while the rest of my body smells like a wet dog that hasn't been bathed in 6 months, my armpits smell clean and fresh.....okay, seriously, I did buy this. It works great and smells nice. I have not tried marathon no-showering sessions, and I certainly would not recommend it unless you live alone, have no contact with the outside world, and have no plans to socialize. If that is the case, then let us know how things work out for you. What I like is that very little goes a long way, and it holds up very well. I am satisfied with this product (and so are the people I interact with).
