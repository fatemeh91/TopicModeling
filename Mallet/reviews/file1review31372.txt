review/text: I purchased this product and began using it two times daily as directed. I used it for 3 weeks with no improvement in my rosacea.When I tried to return the product to the seller, they refused to take it back because it had been used. I cannot remember how many times I returned lipstick or makeup to a department store with no questions asked.Since then I have purchased and used Skin Medica's product. It is much better quality. Initially it burns a bit when you first start using it bu it quickly goes away, and most important, it works very well in clearing up the rosacea. It's more expensive but well worth it in my opinion.
