review/text: This product cleans, waxes and polishes all in one step. It gives a durable finish, makes old floors look new. Scuff marks are easily buffed out. Paste wax is really great, but a lot of work. I have used One-Step for years and cannot imagine what else might be so satisfactory! Try it, you will like it.
