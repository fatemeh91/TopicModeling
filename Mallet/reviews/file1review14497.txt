review/text: The saleswoman at the maternity store recommended these for my all day long morning sickness and they really do work! I only buy the sour ones because I like the taste of them. As with anything else, they aren't going to work for everyone, but they are definitely worth a shot. I gave some to my uncle, who is sick from chemo and they are helping him as well.
