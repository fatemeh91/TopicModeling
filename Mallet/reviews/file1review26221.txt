review/text: About 5 years ago I stopped eating breakfast, I started Drinking one of these every morning. Then about 2 years ago I stopped eating Dinner. So much stress gone (I can't cook to save my life). Lunch is the only solid food I eat. (usually Fast food or diners). I hope they never stop making it, cause I can't go back. Ensure is great for people like me who don't like food, don't like eating and/or don't like preparing food. I am also Lactose intolerant, and Ensure causes no problems. It is also great for a zombie invasion, because you can stock up!
