review/text: I apparently purchased this item from BP Medical Supplies. No paperwork came with the item. The name BP Medical Supplies does not appear on the envelope as the sender, in fact a man's name is down as the sender. The item was not packaged as I expected it to be if coming from 'medical supplies'. The item was in an open clear plastic bag inside a brown padded envelope. The item does appear to be in working order.
