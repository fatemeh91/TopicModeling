review/text: I've owned this razor for over a year now, but only used it off and on until recently. While it has always shaved well, I have found it works best if you are a regular, every-day shaver. For quite a while, I wasn't, which meant that my face never fully conditioned to the shaver, and that I was more often than not trying to shave a thicker growth of beard. The first was not a big deal (I knew how to fix that), but the the latter proved to be a problem - this razor is NOT for people who don't shave every day. If you let your beard go for a couple days between shaves, you will more than likely need to take it down with the trimmer before shaving.However...I recently dug this razor out again and decided to give it another try. I have found that if I shave every day, the shaver performs very well indeed. It's still not as close as a blade, but let's face it, no electric razor is. This one is comfortable, efficient, easy to clean and worth the money (this based on my experience with much cheaper shavers in the past). I would suggest that people shave with a completely *dry* face - preferably even before you shower. Having a truly dry beard makes a difference. I haven't used a pre-shave, but shaving dry is getting me close enough that I'm not worried about it.The trimmer is okay for basic side-burn straightening and so on, but I don't trust it to groom my mustache or beard - I use my beard trimmer for that. But as a razor for my face, I am very happy with this model. The only draw back is that it is hard to get a clean line along the edge of my beard with the round heads, but an occasional touch up with a regular razor handles that. It now takes me a lot less time to shave every morning, compared to using foam and a cartridge razor, which is worth it.
