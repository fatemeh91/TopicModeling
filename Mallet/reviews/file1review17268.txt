review/text: This works quite well and it was my way around buying other trimmers that come with a dizzying array of attachments. This has a simple adjustment wheel that changes the guard height. My old Remington had a genius vacuum built into the base to collect all those annoying beard trimming that otherwise land all over the sink, which also worked as a foot that you could set the trimmer up vertically. I miss that.
