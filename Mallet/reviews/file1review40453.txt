review/text: Yes, it is expensive. But after guilting myself into purchasing less expensive brands and being unhappy with the slimy texture, or just plain feeling like crap from the petroleum, I simply buy it and remain happy. The formula is thicker than a gloss thus stays on for much longer. You should still feel moisturized in the morning after applying before lights out. My hubby loves the texture and fragrance,and seeks out kisses if I've recently applied. My &#34;all boy&#34; teen sons have given up their &#34;manly&#34; Chapstick in favor of this Karite Lips because they say it just works better. If you are looking for a light feel, this is not your product. But if you are looking for a highly healing lip moisturizer without evil petroleum or other drying additives, then this product is definitely a best buy!
