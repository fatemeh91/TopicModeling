review/text: I recently bought the silk epil, and I really like it. I have been waxing my legs for about 3 years now, and it was getting a bit costly. This works well, however I only use it on my legs. (Underarms are hard to do) It is a bit time consuming (though waxing took the same amount of time) - however it does the job and I believe is way better than shaving every few days. Plus the hair does grow back thinner and less noticeable. I have been using it about once every week - week and a half. I think it is great, and after two uses, has already paid itself off!
