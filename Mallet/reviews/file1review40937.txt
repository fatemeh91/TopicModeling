review/text: I have semi-sensitive skin and have gotten into Nubian heritage soaps. This soap smells great and feels great. The only problem is that it leaves heavier residue in the bathroom post-shower than an ordinary soap, but I think it is worth it. My skin is a lot softer now that I use this soap.
