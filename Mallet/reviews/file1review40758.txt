review/text: Unfortunately, this product is worthless. The voice alarm is not very loud, certainly not loud enough for a person with hearing loss or a person in another room. The alarm only sounds three times at one minute intervals. In other words, only use with people of perfect hearing who carry the pill box with them at all times, including any trips to the bathroom.I was quite disappointed, as I was hoping it would help my elderly mother.
