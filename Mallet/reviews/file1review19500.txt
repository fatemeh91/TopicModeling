review/text: I would definitely recommend this toilet seat for little kids. I first purchased a less expensive seat which slid all over the toilet seat making it very difficult for a small child to learn how to go to the bathroom all by themself. So, I returned it and purchased this one at the recommendation of my sister. It's great! You can adjust it so it fits snuggly on your specific toilet seat and I paid less purchasing on amazon.com than buying at a retail store.
