review/text: I started using Crest Pro-Health night toothpaste in January. By Feb I had developed a pronounced discoloration on my teeth, particularly between teeth. It looked like I chewed tobacco. I tried brushing harder, flossing more and mouthwashes, but it continued to get worse. I went to my regular dentist appt expecting to be told my teeth were rotting away. Much to my relief my dentist was able to remove most of it. It has be be scrapped off. She suppected it was a stannous fluoride rinse, but my rinse was ok, it was the toothpaste. This is a horribe product.
