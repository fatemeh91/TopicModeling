review/text: This is a good price for a good product. It tastes vaguely like vanilla ice cream, which is somewhat unnerving at first, in terms of subconscious urges to eat ice cream, but you get used to it quickly. It goes nicely in lowfat milk, although if you use water it tastes fine. I like using a shaker to mix it, but you can stir it and it is instantized so it mixes better than some other whey products. If you have Prime it makes it a really good deal.
