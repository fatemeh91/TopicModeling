review/text: I have tried every cane sugar substitute there is and this stuff is the best.It doesn't affect my blood sugar levels...it's good for my gums and teeth.It tastes great and no icky aftertaste.I use a bit more than I would cane sugar.I have recently learned that Birch Sugar and other xylitol products are poisen to dogs and cats.
