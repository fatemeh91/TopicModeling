review/text: Delsym cough suppressant provides long-lasting relief from coughs for children as young as 4, as well as adults. There are few products available for 4 year olds, so when my nearly 4 year old son developed a very mild cough that worsened overnight, I sought out a quality product. I suspect there's some post nasal drip causing this issue, so I came home with Dimetapp children's cough and cold; it took forever, sometimes two hours, to kick in, and only lasted 3 hours. It's also sedating. Mucinex cough is a suppressant and expectorant, and works quickly - as soon as 15-30 minutes - but only lasts 4-5 hours, so we are up at least twice overnight. Then the pharmacist recommended Delsym, along with Benadryl to sedate. Starts quickly, but lasts ALL night! However it's not quite 12 hours; if I give it at 8, he's up at 6. So I wake him at 10, just before I go to bed, and he sleeps til 7:30, as usual! It's just a suppressant, so if the cough sounds productive or there's chest congestion, you'll need an expectorant, too. I added the Benadryl to dry up the PND and sedate.
