review/text: I have and use jacknobbers, in fact, I have several of them. The jackknobber is a tool for taking out muscular spasms. It has four arms so that it can be laid in the floor with one arm upwards for working on the soles of the feet. At the end of each arm is a ball. There are two small balls and two larger ones. While you could use thumb pressure, many people may not have the finger strength, especially women or ahem, older men with arthritis. For them, the jacknobber is a big helpThere are really three steps to relieving a muscle in spasm. First you probe along the muscle to locate the source of the spasm, popularly known as a "trigger point". There may be several so don't stop with the first one. When you locate them press down and hold for 10 seconds. There is no need to press really hard, medium pressure is usually enough. When you've pressed out the triggers you come to the second step, you massage the muscle along its length, finally, in the third step you stretch the muscle.As a matter of experience, I use the small balls to probe for triggers and the larger balls to do the massage afterward. When I work on my back, I lay on the the floor using a folded blanket as padding. Now, do they work? Emphatically, Yes ! Oh yes, one other tip. For back sufferers, don't be surprised if you discover, as I did, that a large part of your back pain is really referred pain from your feet and legs.The subject of pain relief is of course far more complex than simply probing for trigger points. There are many good books that can give you the additional information you need. I can highly recommend the books by the late Bonnie Prudden. She was a dancer and television's first exercise guru back in the 1950s. Later she turned her hand to physiotherapy. Amazon has her books.
