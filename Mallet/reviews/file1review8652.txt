review/text: I really enjoy cleaning vegetables with this brush. The handle is easy to grip and the entire shape of the brush feels designed to really apply scrubbing action on the vegetables, compared with the more common donut shaped brushes. I use it on all all root vegetables as well as stalk vegetables such as celery as well as cabbages and brussels sprouts. I also use it to clean apples as well. Also like the fact that I can put it into the dishwasher. Will buy this brush again.
