review/text: In 2008 my husband and I started on a fertility drug to get pregnant. I have severe PCOS. For two years we were going to doctor appointments twice a month and I never once ovulated. The doctors finally told me I would have to go to a fertility clinic. My husband and I decided we wanted to try a more natural alternative before going to the clinic. I started taking FertilAid and after taking it for 2 weeks, I ovulated. After taking it for 2 months, I was pregnant. I now have a happy healthy baby girl. I've recently started buying FertilAid for my sister who also has PCOS. She's only been taking it a few weeks, but her cycle is regulating, so hopefully I'll have a niece or nephew soon!
