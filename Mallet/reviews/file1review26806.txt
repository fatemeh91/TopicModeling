review/text: The product that I brought was "Delicious Strawberry" and it did not taste good or smell good at all with water.But seems to blend right with milk. But I strongly don't recommend you buying the strawberry flavor, cause it taste like some rubber and it smells horrible. Your best bet would be reviewing other flavors or perhaps start with muscle milk which I previously enjoyed and will continue to use it instead of this product.
