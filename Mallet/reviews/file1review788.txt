review/text: I needed a kit to take on vacation in case my sunglasses had any issues. Sungalsses are pretty important on vacation (sunny) and it is not possible to replace expensive ones, nor should you have to. We all hate when those little screws come out and it is really hard to find them. Now if it happens, I am prepared. It has a variety of things and after checking I can see it has what I would need. Lots of different sizes and more than just screws. I feel confident with this purchase but the case should be a little more sturdy, seems like it can crack easy and the can update the contents to be more contemporary. Overall good product. This seemed to be the best one for the price for what I was looking for.
