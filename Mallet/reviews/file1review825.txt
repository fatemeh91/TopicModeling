review/text: All I wanted was nuts, not screws but all I got was screws and not enough nuts :-)Most repair kits out there, they all seem to provide screws, not nuts. Wonder why?For each screw, you need a nut to tighten it, so why restrict the repair kit to only 2 nuts and 40 screws ??Got the 1 nut that I wanted and the price of this kit paid for itself, i.e. a trip to the repair shop - gas, and 1 hr drive time and paying $5 to the optician for repair.Wish it had many more nuts in it. That seems to be the only thing I ever lose in the pairs I have.
