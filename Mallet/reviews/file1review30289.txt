review/text: I have a balinese cat that sheds 2"-3" hairs -- not huge clumps, but a uniform "dusting" everywhere.The pet hair attachment here is ALMOST a really good design -- pops open easily for regular cleaning. Unfortunately, it's driven by a fan unit (i.e. by the cleaner's suction power) which is not user-serviceable. After ten square feet of slightly-furred close-nap area rug, its axle was gunked up and it didn't spin freely.This hobbled design is simply not up to the task for which it's sold.
