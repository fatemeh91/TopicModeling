review/text: This product is life changing. I, too, have never written a product review. I have been taking this for about two months now, and I truly feel much, much better. I have more energy all day long. I feel better, well, internally. I used to take Advil everyday to help with my morning stiffness and creaking knee joints. I have noticed that my knees don't crackle on stairs or in exercise classes, and I am not even taking the Advil anymore!About the taste, yes it is totally vile. Worst thing I have ever put in my mouth, but as others have noted, we are all grown up and it's good for us. My trick to make it semi-palatable is to mix it with 4-6 oz of Odwalla's Mighty Mango pur&eacute;ed juice. Just mix, drink, and don't stop til it is all gone.
