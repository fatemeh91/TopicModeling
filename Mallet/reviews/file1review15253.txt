review/text: I've been eating Almond Brownie Balance Bars since roughly the year 2000. I used to eat another Balance Bar flavor (Honey Peanut), but found that I quickly tired of that taste. For some reason, I never get tired of Almond Brownie, perhaps because of the sweet chocolate fix it provides plus the suprise of the almond nuts.I prefer to eat the bar cold with some ice cold milk. This way, it tastes like a real brownie. Well, maybe that's a stretch, but after eating about 2000 (yes indeed) of these bars over the years, my taste buds have adjusted to the taste.Almond Brownie is my favorite Balance Bar flavor by far. In addiion to eating it cold, I can also eat it warm (if it's been siting in my car -- I live in Florida) along with water.Looks like Amazon Grocery has the lowest price by about 10%, which could save me up to $100 per year.By the way, I think the review dates for this Amazon Grocery item (and perhaps all reviews of Amazon Grocery items) are incorrect since all reviews appear to be from January 2000.
