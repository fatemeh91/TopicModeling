review/text: This is great to see. I worked as a lifeguard and we used HeartStart AED's in our facility and they could mean the difference between life and death in a cardiac arrest situation. Parents, they could save your child's life in a swimming accident. It also could make the difference with elderly when a sudden heart attack occurs. Death is certain after only five minutes without oxygen. Sometimes the ambulance just won't be fast enough. Take it into your own hands!
