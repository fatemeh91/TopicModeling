review/text: I was a little worried when I ordered this trimmer. The price is a bit steep compared to some of the others on the market. Although it is not a bargain, the quality of the trim makes it worth the money.This is a nice unit that will work with a cord or without. The adjustment setting is straight forward and easy to set. The plastic guard pulls off for cleaning of the blades. There is some maintenance required -oiling the blade and brushing out the trimmings- but its not onerous. Overall a pretty nice deal.
