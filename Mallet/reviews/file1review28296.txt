review/text: Using this for a pre or postworkout shake has been great. Doesn't give the bloated feeling that other protein powders do. I tried the Double Rich Chocolate and it tastes good as well. I will be ordering this again as soon as I run out. The price was unmatched when I purchased this product as well.
