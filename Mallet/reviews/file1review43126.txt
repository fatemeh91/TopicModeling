review/text: i had concern about the product is not perfume free before i purchase it. other reviews are either hate it or love it based around the smell. Once i used it, I fell into the "love" category. the smell is heavenly. it's very light, and went away after couple of hours of usage. but whenever i get new cloths out of drawers, i can't stop but smell them first.
