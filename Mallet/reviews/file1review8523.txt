review/text: I'm picky about everything I buy, including cleaning utensils. I want the best--something that works well and isn't expensive--so I do a lot of research. This bottle brush works great! I mainly use it for my Kleen Kanteen water bottles. The brush fits through the bottleneck. It is very flexible so it also cleans the underside of the top curved portion of the bottle (hope that makes sense). Will not try another bottle brush.
