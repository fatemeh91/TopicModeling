review/text: I really wish Amazon would list ingredients in their vitamins so we know what we're getting. In this instance, I was upset to see that taking the THREE vitamins a day you need with this bottle only amounts to 8% of your daily needed value of calcium (75mg)!! You get more calcium drinking a glass of MILK and that would be much, much cheaper. Do yourself a favor and don't throw away money on this product. You can buy a whole-food calcium vitamin on Amazon called Rainbow Light, which has 50% of your daily needed calcium (500mg) and higher amounts of all other minerals/ingredients (e.g. magnesium) for a lot less money. I'm going to try that next!
