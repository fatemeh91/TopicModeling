review/text: Wonderful tool, it's like the next generation leap from the theracane. I have weak arms and hands and find the theracane difficult to grip and maneuver (have had it for at least 15 yrs. The Body Back Buddy has a flat surface to hold on to and it is much easier to grip as a result, is extremely lightweight but not at all flimsy. The knobs are well positioned and the pointy knobs are a great tool to have as well. This thing is awesome! I'm coming back for the mini to bring it to work!
