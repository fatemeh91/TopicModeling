review/text: I have an adult child with developmental disabilities who is totally incontinent. I have 4 of these pads and they get washed at least daily, sometimes 2-3 times a day! They wash and dry nicely. I am always so happy every time I put it on her bed. It has saved me a ton of washing!! Even after being washed hundreds of times, it still does not leak through to her bedding.I HIGHLY recommend this bed pad!
