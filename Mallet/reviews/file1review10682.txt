review/text: I've had this for a few weeks and it is really helping me remember to take all my meds. There's plenty of room in each of the four compartments for every day. I take a lot of pills (ugh) and I can still add supplements. The lids snap shut very securely so I can toss the day's meds into my bag on the run with no worries. The compartments are deep and it would be nice if they were a tad rounded in the corners but that really isn't much of a drawback. I had thought about buying the version with only am and pm compartments for each day because I worried the am/noon/evening/pm compartments might be too small. Turns out they are just fine and are great for taking antibiotics & such. The day container is likely too large for a pocket. If that is what you're looking for, this isn't it. Otherwise, it's great.I plan on getting another one so I can have another week set up. Maybe even a third. I'm very happy with this purchase and I think it's worth the money.
