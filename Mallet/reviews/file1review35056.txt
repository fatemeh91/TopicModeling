review/text: My wife was using this product for her canine massage business to help calm new 'clients' and a events where a calm atmosphere was not simple to maintain. The claims are that this will assist with anxiety in pets and help them deal with the stress of new situations.So - I think the main question here is 'does this work'.Over the course of two years and using this on dozens of dogs, the answer is 'I don't think so'.I fully understand the premise - flower essences are easier on the canine nose than essential oils - that makes logical sense. The reality here is do these specific essences work? We have seen no evidence that they do. We have researched, tested and utilized this product as directed with no noticeable result.All I can say is that in our experience over a couple of years with dozens of dogs, we don't see it being useful at all.Hope that helps.
