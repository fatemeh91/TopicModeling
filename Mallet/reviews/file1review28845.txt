review/text: This is the best nutritional shake of any kind that I've had. Mixed with 2% milk the Double Rich Chocolate tastes great (I wish I could drink it all day) and it mixes really well with just a spoon, not clumping up like other brands. I first got this at GNC and was turned off by the price but it's half as much here on Amazon so it's perfect. I can't speak for the other flavors but I can highly recommend the Double Rich Chocolate.
