review/text: I bought this item on the recommendation of a holistic medicine book called The Veterinarian's Guide to Natural Remedies for Dogs. When my min-pin was diagnosed with dry eye, I started to do some research. Even though he was placed on Restasis ( which I then found began with canine medicine and eventual became a human drug), I also learned something about the nature of tears. Through the afore-mentioned recommendation I learned it was important for the eye to have certain nutrients as well. This produst provides those nutrients and also helps soothe my dog's eyes. In addition to the Restasis and omega three capsules,I credit this product for why my mini pin now has normal tear production. Also be advised it took two months for his eyes to be 'normal' from having NO tear production at all. He was close to losing his eyesight and now he is a normal year old dog and shows no signs of blindness. I have also started using it on my thirteen year old yorkie to aid with cloudiness from age and have seen some improvement. I cannot say enough about how much I appreciate this item.
