review/text: I have been using Optimum for a few years and love it. The combination of proteins in their specific order are of great use for someone trying to gain lean muscle mass. The ten lb bag is convenience for those using it often. I personally have two scoops three times per day. This gets me 144 grams of protein in addition to the foods I eat.I recommend purchasing 2 5 lb tubs of this product and use the empty containers to use instead of the bag itself. The bag tends to be messy when using so i immediately empty it into the tubs.Great tasting and mixes easily with a blender cup.
