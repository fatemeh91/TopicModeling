review/text: So, before I found this bar, I was on a very long and tedious quest to find a protein bar that was HIGH in protein, LOW in Sugar, and LOW in fat, AND it had to taste amazingly good. Yep, if you've ever tried protein bars, you know why the search continued on for more than 2 years... then, I gambled a few bucks and tried Met-rx cookie crisp one- and that actually is a really good one, but it's got a decent amount of sugar in it.I grudgingly decided to try this peanut butter crisp one only because I was desperate- I love peanut butter, but the stuff that goes into protein bars that is called peanut butter is usually disgusting, so I didn't have high hopes.Oh-My-!This reminds me of something like a butterfinger, minus the chewy nougat. If you like butterfingers, you'll like this- is that's easy.I now have one a day, 5 days a week- and I don't know if I'll ever change bars again. I actually split the bar for two snacks a few hours before and after my lunch.HIGH protein:30g in 1 barLOW sugar: 3g in 1 barLOW fat 10g in 1 barit's exactly what I'd been searching for, and almost gave up on... I'm glad I tried this one! :)As a side note- I've tried the chocolate chocolate chunk and roasted peanut too- my quick 2 cents there:If you aren't a MAJOR MAJOR chocoholic, stay far away from the chocolate chocolate chunk. FAR FAR AWAY! I like chocolate, just not a chocoholic...it felt like torture trying to force the other 1/2 of that thing down... wow..The roasted peanut one is ok, also low in sugar like this one, but still not as good. :)If you don't care about a slightly higher sugar content (10g in the bar) and you like alittle chocolate here and there, try the cookies and cream one, it's like an oreo. :)
