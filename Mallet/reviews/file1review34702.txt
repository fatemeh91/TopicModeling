review/text: Bought this kit after my second hip replacement and I wish I'd had it instead of all the other nonsense stuff I bought before my first one! The grabber is better than any other ones on the market and the sock putter-onner(my own lable for it lol)is invaluable! The scrubber sponge holds up well unlike some that come off the stick right away! This is a bargain and a great set of aids for your months of incapacitation! Good luck on your surgery whoever you are! Buy this... you'll be glad you have it!!!
