review/text: I did my first Oxy-Powder cleanse in the summer of 2008. I had been having health problems which were not resolving with the herbs I was taking, meaning the herbs were not having an effect like they usually did in the previous 20 years when I had any health challenge. I did the 7-day cleanse. For a few years prior to this time, I had started getting mild pain in my joints - mainly in the wrists and ankles. I just chalked it up to getting older, but this was not the reason I was doing the cleanse. During the cleanse I noticed my pain diminishing and by the time the week was over, it was completely gone. Three years later, and it hasn't returned. The herbs I was taking also began to work and the health problem I was having at the time was resolved. My theory is that the nutrients that weren't being absorbed by my body before the cleanse were being utilized after I did the cleanse. I have been taking maintenance doses off and on since then.I am currently half-way through the 6-day (more advanced) cleanse and haven't suffered any ill effects yet.I realize this isn't for everyone. There are probably people out there who it won't work for, or who would react badly to the product. I just wanted to share how it can positively impact someone's health in a profound way.
