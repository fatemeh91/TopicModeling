review/text: Being 25 years old and far from financially wealthy, I became sick of paying so much for cartridge blades and looked into my grandpa's way of shaving. After reading lots of reviews, I went with the Merkur Classic as my first safety razor and couldn't be happier.First off, there's definitely a learning curve. I was hasty and impatient and the first couple weeks of shaving (I'm not that hairy of a guy, I only need to shave every other day) were a bit dreadful. If you buy this razor, I really encourage you to take a few minutes to study the direction that your hairs grow. I now make about two passes following the grain, then go back for one or two more passes against it. I'm also using a badger hair brush ($25) and some shaving cream that I found at Bath & Body Works (It's in a green tube, cost about $10 for enough to last seemingly forever, and it works great!)Be warned that these will take more time to shave with. Whereas I could shave with my old Mach 3 in about 5 minutes, I now set aside about 20. However, the closeness of the shave, the reduced irritation, and the warm badger hair brush definitely make it worth the extra time.Happy shaving!
