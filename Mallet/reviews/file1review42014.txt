review/text: I have used this product for 20 years and love it. I use the coconut after every shower and have flippin' awesome skin for a gal of 40 years. Plus the scent is alluring. I usually buy 6 bottles at a time from the company directly and only once was the product a bit off - as oil can sometimes be.
