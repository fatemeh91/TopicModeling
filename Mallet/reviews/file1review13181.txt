review/text: I purchased this pad in September 2010 for my father, who has dementia and lives with us. He is increasingly incontenant and wears Depends to bed, but consistantly overflows them. The smaller pads I had from my kids as babies were not large enough. This pad is awesome, very large, and contains the liquid. It has saved me many loads of laundry. I immediately purchased another, and may be buying a third soon just to have extra on hand. If you have a bed to protect, or wish to cut down on laundry due to accidents, this is the one to buy!
