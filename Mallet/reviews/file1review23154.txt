review/text: All the caveats written by other reviewers are true. I had to use duct tape to hold the pieces of the handle together... and then the two prong piece connecting the pole to the sweeper itself broke! In other words, this is a perfect piece of junk. I'm still looking for something reasonably sturdy to sweep my carpet effectively when I'm not using the vacuum cleaner (which I do twice a week anyway).
