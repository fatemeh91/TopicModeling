review/text: I have almost constant heartburn that started about six weeks ago after I took antibiotics for a bacterial infection caused by a cat bite. I have been using these tablets before breakfast and dinner, and again before I go to bed. The taste is OK, chocolate with a hint of coconut, but they don't seen to be helping me. I am really disappointed because this heartburn is making my life miserable, and I had high hopes for this product.
