review/text: It seemed like it might be a great product, but I bought it for my mom whom has a hard time handling those little disposible flossers. I wasn't expecting to be so little and it doesn't really work for her. She dropped it one of our dogs got it,it was barely damaged and would not work anymore at all. They only chewed the disposible part. It shouldn't of broke so easy. Also the button is hard to push.
