review/text: I ordered this product because I have always suffered from dry mouth. Mostly because of some medications I take. Well I did this treatment only once at night and almost threw it up. That was the grossest most disgusting taste I have had in any type of treatment and it did not work that well to relieve the dry mouth problem anyway. I did order the other biotene products such as the mouth rinse and the spray and although the taste is not as bad, they also didn't help that much with dry mouth. I would highly recommend that people save their money and buy gum (sugarless or not) instead that they can chew on to create more saliva.
