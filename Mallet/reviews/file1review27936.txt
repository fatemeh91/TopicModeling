review/text: I don't know what people are talking about when they say the Chocolate flavor is awesome. This flavor sucks. And I'm stuck with a huge tub of this crap that I'll just end up throwing away. It tastes thin, weak, and like a bad super watered down version of Chocolate Slim Fast. Gag! Skip this for sure. It's really gross.
