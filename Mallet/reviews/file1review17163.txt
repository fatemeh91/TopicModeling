review/text: I purchased this to replace a beloved MB-300 that I used for 4 consecutive years before leaving it in a hotel room. This model has failed to meet my expectations in a couple of ways:- There is no smaller mustache trimmer built-in.- It does not allow corded operations.This trimmer remains one of my favorite models because there aren't any parts to mess with or keep track of. I can easily adjust the length and, until now, I didn't need a separate tool for delicate regions like my mustache.
