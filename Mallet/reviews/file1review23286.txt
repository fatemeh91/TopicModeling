review/text: I have two toddlers who are terrified of the vaccuum, and those with toddlers know just how messy they can be. So I bought this to help with inbetween cleaning, when Daddy wasn't around to take the kiddos somewhere else, and was blown away by how well it worked!!! It picked up everything from cockie crumbs to hair. And I have not had any problems with the handle, as reported in other reviews. I am extremely happy with my purchase.
