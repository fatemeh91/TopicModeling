review/text: It's my first time to use epiator and before I use this I sahved and it hurt my skin often. Before I bought this I read all of the customer review and I was kind of afraid about the pain. But it was not that painful at all. I think it's depend on the person's hair and skin. For me I only use for my leg and it was not painful. It was easy to use for me. I had to go several times again to remove hair perfectly and maybe that's why it was not that painful. Because they were not removed at once. Anyway, I'm very satisfied with this epilator and happy that I don't have to shave any more!!
