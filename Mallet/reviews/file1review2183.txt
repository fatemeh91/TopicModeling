review/text: I bought this to replace a broken Brookstone sound machine. First off it is bigger than I anticipated and it uses water. The information presented does not state it needs water. I wouldn't have bought it had it said "you must add water". There is no way to turn off the water part (which means you need water for the electronic sounds)It needs to be cleaned all the time (even using distilled water).The electronic sounds do not seem as real to me as the Brookstone one did. Wave cycles too fast, etc. For the cost of RAM these days you would think they could have a sound loop longer than a second or so. The Brookstone one was about 7 seconds for a sound loop and you had to listen carefully to hear the replete. Not bad considering I purchased the Brookstone unit in 1996. No so with this unit.
