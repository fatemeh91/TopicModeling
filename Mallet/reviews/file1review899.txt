review/text: ...another awesome product by BodySense! So comfortable, warm and soft while warming and comforting my arthritic neck. It is a great product and I recommend it to EVERYONE. Heats nicely in the miocrowave (start with a 1 minute increment, then remove from microwave oven, shake, and replace to keep pellets/rice/herbs within from getting too hot and melting the outer cover.) This is the second one I have had. They last a very long time and really work well! Definitely a quality product that I will continue to use for a very long time. Also works on other specific pains where heat is required to feel better.
