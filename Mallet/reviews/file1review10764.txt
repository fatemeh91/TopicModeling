review/text: I like this package because it is sturdy and a very good way to store your unused batteries. Most other batteries have flimsy packaging that starts falling apart or becoming unstable for the remaining batteries as soon as you remove a few. (Edit Jan '13: I store the package on its side to keep the batteries neatly in place once I've removed some.)The last time I researched the topic several years ago Rayovac alkalines were found to be of about the same quality as Duracell. Obviously they don't spend as much money on advertising, which may explain why they are less expensive.
