review/text: I love how this can be used over and over again, but every time I use it the floss gets loose. The design was also somewhat awkward in my mouth, because it's larger sized.Overall, I'd go withPlackers Dental Flossers Micro Mint - 75 Eaif you're looking into easing the flossing process and don't mind purchasing more every few months, and this if you're more for the environment and into saving money.
