review/text: I've been a contact lens wearer for 35 years. I tolerate my lenses well but my eyes often become dry at the end of the day. I must say I'm quite pleased with the ReNu Rewetting Drops. Most every brand of rewetting solution will add moisture, but I was pleased to find that the ReNu drops added LONG-LASTING moisture. One use in the early evening gave me comfortable eyes until bedtime. I'll certainly buy ReNu Rewetting Drops again.
