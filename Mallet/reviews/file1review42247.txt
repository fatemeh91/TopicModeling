review/text: I purchased buried treasure VM100 liquid vitamins and natures plus liquid vitamins at the same time. I used the VM100 first and felt no difference. Now I am on the Buried treasure vitamins and I can say i feel a difference. I have more all day energy, better concentration, and i actually feel like i want to do something now. I have taken numerous brands throughout the years including GNC megamen vitamins for many years and i have to say this is the first product to do something for me in my favor!!. I just started taking this product a week ago after the VM100 and i have already ordered another bottle. The smell seems that it might be pretty potent but the taste is actually pleasing. it tastes like every fruit and berry from this planet concentrated and blended together and put into this bottle. just so you know the VM 100 tastes stout!! be prepared if you try it!!
