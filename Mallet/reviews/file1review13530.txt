review/text: I don't buy into the hype about products reducing cellulite. That said shoes and insoles that claim to do so are generally pretty good for your feet! I have neck and back problems and needed some good insoles for work - standing for hours at a time. I love these insoles. My feet don't hurt after a long day at work and I can put them in almost all of my sneakers/ boots. I will be buying another pair of these when the ones I'm currently wearing fall apart. They are a better investment than the $100 I spent on a pair of sneakers that do the exact same thing.
