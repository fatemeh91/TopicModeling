review/text: By far the best toothbrush I've ever used. I've had several generations of sonicares, brawns, etc. and this puppy works much, much better than any of them. If I had the time and money I'd buy a few thousand and pass them out on the streets. Yes, it's that good. For your own sake stop over-analyzing and just get one right now.
