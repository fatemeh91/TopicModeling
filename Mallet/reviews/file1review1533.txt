review/text: This stick is extremely dangerous. I tried it to remove a small wart from the top of my foot, and it created a major chemical burn on the skin surrounding the wart. It is incredibly painful and now I'll probably need to have the wart surgically removed, which I was trying to avoid. I'd rate it NO stars if I could.
