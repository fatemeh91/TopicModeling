review/text: At first I thought the Balance Bar tasted like sawdust, but I sort of got used to that after awhile. The bar isn't moist enough. I need a glass of milk wash it down or it's hard to swallow. The taste was OK, but not something I'd buy really. I'd say if you're on a diet and want a nice 200-calorie lunch, get a salad with a nice low-cal dressing instead.
