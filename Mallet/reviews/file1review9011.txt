review/text: I have been supplementing with this product for years. I'm a clinical RN, specializing in pain/symptom management and end of life care with Hospice. I recommend this product many times to my patients with life limiting illnesses. please note, this is not a " magic cure" by no means, however, when a colon cancer patient in pronounced pain and irregular bowel pattern calls me literally weeping to say his pain has subsided and he just had his 3rd bowel movement that day ( previously 2 BM's per week if fortunate) or the Crohn's patient who is able to finally have a sabbatical from chronic diarrrhea, or the Stroke patient in a lethargic state for months who was fed this through his PEG tube for two days then awoke I must admit this product works. If I had the time I could document dozens of testimonials such as these. I have shared this with many in the health care field, Physicians, Surgeons and clinicians who now use and recommend this product with positive results, not just digestive related, but for autoimmune boost,anemia, energy and mental clarity.
