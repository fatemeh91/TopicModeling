review/text: This is the best waxing kit ever. I've used it ever since it came out and wax all areas (except head) with it. It's great!The wax gets warm very quickly (only 15 seconds so be careful not to leave it too long) and stays soft for a long time, so you don't have to keep it in a pot of warm water or anything so it doesn't get hard.It's also cheap because depending on how much you wax, the tube can last you for a long time. You don't even have to buy new strips, just rinse the used ones with hot water and hang to dry. A box costs $8-$10 while going to the salon can cost you maybe $20 for only one area (armpits/legs).If you have some troubles using this, I don't know what to say. I'm a clumsy person so if even I can do it then anyone should be able to.
