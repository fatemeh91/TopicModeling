review/text: The cheap battery in this thing is reason enough not to buy it. Trust me.You'll charge it per instructions, use it for 5 minutes, come back to it 2-3 days later and find there's 8 seconds of juice left before it disappoints you and forces you to charge it again. Oh, and you can't use while the AC adapter is plugged in. You have to wait for a charge....and before you say, "all rechargeable batteries act that way!". No, no they don't. My Norelco Spectra goes months on a single charge.Avoid this junk, even for the low cost.
