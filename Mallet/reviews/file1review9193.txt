review/text: I don't know where Mr. Davis (review of 2007) is coming from in saying that in two years this item has not broken. I used this product for a month or so and already two of the tops have broken off. And its not like I am dropping it from an airplane. I've been careful. Since the lids are broken I can't turn the item upside down now to get my pills out or several days worth of pills fall out and onto the floor. And if you tape the lids back on they don't stay closed. They are always partly open.Another thing, it might be nice that the individual days come out but on the other hand they don't stay in when you want them to, they are always falling out, adding to the problem referred to above.I am usually pretty satisfied with products but I have to say that this item is not satisfactory.
