review/text: Obviously only a small segment of the population shaves their heads, but if you're sporting a bald dome, I can recommend the Gillette Fusion as the best razor for your head.After trying both the Mach 3 and the Headblade Sport for my head, the Fusion took top prize hands down (the high-quality Mach 3 came in second; the Headblade was fun, but only gave a pretty good shave).The Fusion gave my head a very close shave, and with less irritation than the other razors. Though, at first, the Fusion's five blades can feel a little heavy scraping across the scalp, I've been pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't taking off skin or causing an excessive amount of tiny little bumps on my head (I've found that light, quick, and long strokes eliminate any discomfort, while still providing an excellent shave). Of the three razors, this was the only one that provided my head with that baby's-butt-smooth texture that I was looking for.This razor also shaves my face closer and quicker than the Mach 3 did, and the extra blade on the back is quite handy for cleaning up around tough areas.The cartridges are expensive, but hear me out: without changing the cartridge, I've been shaving both my head and face every day, and only after A MONTH have I noticed a decrease in the quality of shave. The indicator strip faded after a week or two, so pay no mind to that (for every person who changes his cartridge too early, Gillette sees $$$). These cartridges will last you a long time, which will more than make up for the high cost.
