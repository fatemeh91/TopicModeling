review/text: The Skin Bracer Pre-Electric lotion by Mennen is excellent. Five stars for the lotion itself. What is extremely irritating is the dispensing method. I've not found a way that doesn't make a mess. The bottle cap pops off instead of twisting and that's fine. But the dispensing hole of the inner cover in the bottle is 6.8 mm wide! More than 1/4". I've tried tilting the bottle slowly to put liquid into my cupped palm, I've tried plugging the hole with a finger and then slowly releasing finger pressure, I've tried putting the bottle top to a cheek and then tilting it slightly to put lotion on, and none of these methods work well. Excess lotion gets all over the inner cover, runs down the bottle, and leaves a mess to clean up on both the bottle top and the inner cap. Whoever designed this dispensing method at Colgate-Palmolive certainly did not have 'convenience' and 'ease of use' in mind.
