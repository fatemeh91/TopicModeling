review/text: I used to love the old Speed Stick mens deodorants. They were effective in warm & humid weather but not too heavily perfumed - the way it should be, in my opinion. The new & allegedly 'improved' products are identical in name only - no more effectiveness but lots of strong perfume.This is why: The old Speed Sticks used to contain Triclosan - an effective antibacterial ingredientthat made those deodorant sticks pleasant to use and gave them all-day effectiveness.Colgate Palmolive, the maker of those deos removed the Triclosan and instead added more and strongerperfume. The same situation also happened with the Old Spice High Endurance Deodorant: Used to be goodthey removed the Triclosan, now is a crap product. I will not buy this again instead will get a deowith an antibacterial ingredient like Right Guard Sport or Right Guard Total Defense 5.If you buy this expecting all-day effectiveness you're in for some disappointment. Strong perfume fora couple of hours at best nothing more. Not recommended!
