review/text: I got this for my wife for Christmas. It is simple to use, just plug and play, and has simple controls. I am impressed with the heater, it heated room temp water to 100F in a few minutes and gets quite hot. The only downside I have is that the pumps seem loud and I wish it could still heat on an extra low pump setting just for soaking feet. Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase!
