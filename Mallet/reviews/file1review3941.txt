review/text: I received a free sample of Crest White Strips in the mail and I am very pleased with the results. For anyone who has tried whitening strips in the past, Crest White Strips offer significant benefits. First they don't slide around in your mouth, competing strips I have tried have to be adjusted every time you speak, swallow or breathe...not convenient. Second Crest has eliminated the slimy-gel that gets all over your hands while you're putting them in. And finally b/c the strips adhere tightly to the surface of your teeth the solvent is equally distributed and you don't get a messy half-white, half coffee-colored look on your face. My teeth feel cleaner and look healthier, strong recommends for any caffeine junkies out there. Cheers, K.
