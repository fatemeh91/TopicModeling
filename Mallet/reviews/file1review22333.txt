review/text: we purchased this after noticing multiple burn-type stains on our new stainless stove. This did as advertised and removed the stains with ease. After purchasing similar products that did not work, this product was recommended to us and it surpassed our expectations. I highly recommend this if your looking for something to remove tough cooking stains - it does the job.
