review/text: The tabs worked great. My dishes were clean and shiny, with no water marks at all, which I appreciated, but the excessive amount of packaging will lead me to not purchase these. The detergent I used prior to this (a mid-priced powder) left the dishes looking and feeling just as clean when properly measured, and without 20 individually wrapped plastic packages.I do not, however, have hard water at my house, so those needing a detergent that claims to really take care of that issue with dishes may be willing to deal with the extra packaging. If the company could find a solution to all the plastic wrappers, I would definitely consider purchasing.Note on the scent: if you're seeking a scent, this one doesn't smell like anything. I actually prefer no perfumes added to my cleaning products, so I was happy to not smell oranges, but if you're looking for that you may want to try a different kind.
