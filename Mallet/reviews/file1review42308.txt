review/text: My family has been using this for about 2 years now and I can't say anything negative about it except the taste is hard for some. My first dose I couldn't stand but my taste buds adjusted and now I look forward to the fruity flavored dose. It is a dark green liquid because of all the good stuff in it. The cost is high @ $29.95 however we always buy 4 or 5 bottles on sale at Amazon for $17.95 and free shipping. I haven't found a more complete supplement for the price!
