review/text: Symbiotropin is an essential part of my life. I have taken it for 5 years (according to the recommendations of going off of it every 6 months for 2 weeks - during which I notice changes which make me look forward to taking it again). I am 61 years old and although I practice a healthy life style of whole foods, regular exercise, and take bio-identical hormones, I have noticed that when I take Symbiotropin I recover quicker from my workouts, have more energy, and get better results from workouts (build more muscle and have less fat - as I did when I was younger). I have also noticed that my immune system seems stronger when I am taking it. Although it is difficult to say if it has helped me to look younger, people regularly think that I am 20 years younger than I am. It is a blessing to be aging at a time that Symbiotropin is available to increase the quality of my life. (Before I decided on Symbiotropin I tried about four other cheaper hgH products - none of which worked as well as Symbiotropin.)
