review/text: I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I love it and the only downside is that I have no idea what to do with the other moisturizers I own. I am sold on this product!It is very creamy and a little goes a long way. I start off by dabbing a tiny amount all over my cleansed face and then work it into my skin using circular motions. It blends well and feels really good. The smell is pleasant and doesn't bother me a bit.Overall, I have found that my complexion has evened out and my face has a nice glow to it. I highly recommend this product. It will not work miracles but if you are looking for a bit of a boost and want to avoid harsh chemicals than give this product a try!
