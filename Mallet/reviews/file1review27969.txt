review/text: I had the tropical punch flavor: with water alone, it had a weird taste that I was not partial to. Most water mixed powders I can drink down pretty quickly, but this one I could not drink quickly.Mixed with milk alone, this tasted pretty good. Had a fruit punch milkshake kind of flavor, which while odd was completely stomachable and decent.I also like to make smoothies, and I will say, this mixed with strawberry+banana+yogurt+juice was not great. Using a fruit punch as my juice made it better but Vanilla powder goes so much better in this smoothie. The fruit punch had a strong noticeable flavor and I think other flavors would not be so prevalent.
