review/text: I ordered a Hummingbird flosser to try it as a replacement for the Reach Access Power Flosser I currently use, and it's not even close to be a good alternative.The vibration is considerably weaker than on the Reach model, making it harder to insert between tight teeth. Unlike the Reach, which stays on when turned on, you have to continually press the button on the Oral B to keep it running. Finally, the handle is just too tiny, making it uncomfortable to use, especially when you have to keep pressing the darn button.The description is misleading: when I read "Durable carrying case holds Oral B Flosser and Pick attachments for convenience" I expected a carry case that would hold both the flosser and the attachments. But it's just a little case that holds the attachments (flosser and pick), not the flosser itself.If you're considering this product, or if you've already used it and are disappointed because it's uncomfortable to use, take a look at the Reach model instead. I've been using it daily for years and love it.
