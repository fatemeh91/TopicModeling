review/text: My 20 month daughter is off the charts in terms of being underweight. She will sample food, but doesn't eat anything substantial. All she wants to drink is water. She refuses to drink milk, and won't even take juice or ice cream! She'll drink some soy milk, but not enough hold a candle to her super high metabolism. PediaSure strawberry flavor is the only thing she will chug. Yes, it is quite expensive. But I can't find anything else as delicious and nutritious. And with Amazon Mom plus Subscribe and Save, it's cheaper than BJ's.
