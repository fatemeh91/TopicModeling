review/text: The comb fits alright, but I find that it frequently gets tangled in the thick, curly fur of my dog (cocker/terrier). Bought it for the Oster A5. I find the clipper works much better without the comb. Part of the problem may be that I have the #10 wide blade on my clipper, and the comb is made for the #10 regular width blade.
