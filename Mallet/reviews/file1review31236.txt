review/text: When I first discovered Accu-Check Multiclix lancets at a local drugstore, I thought they were a great idea but also too expensive for everyday use. Later, when I found them on sale at the same store, I bought them to try. They are so quick, painless and convenient to use, I'm glad I did. I have since found them offered for a reasonable price at Amazon. The mail-order products I received were properly packaged in sealed plastic containers, inside unopened boxes.
