review/text: Sorry gang, this is a cheap piece of plastic that is very hard to align over the sore spot and hurts like the dickens when you do. Save yourself the money and slam your back into a door knob. The knob is bigger and would hurt less.CONS:Hard to use - It takes a lot of fumbling to find the sore spot. Think about it, you can't see the sore spot, so you have to find it using this big, awkward device. It's actually harder than you think it is because this thing is curved and huge.Hurts - The same problem with finding the sore spot shows up when trying to press on the sore spot. It's really hard to control how hard you press on the store spot with this huge, clumsy thing. It's far too easy to dig in and really hurt yourself. Instead of hard plastic they should cushion the knobs so it isn't so painful. And even when you press right, it slips off the sore spot and you have to find it again.Cheap plastic - It's made of the same kind of toy plastic you find in dollar stores. Not sure why it costs so much.Design - Some of the reviewers talk about using this in the office. Not my office. The jokes kept coming in my office, and no one could use it with a straight face. It's hard to believe that anyone wouldn't be embarrassed bringing this thing into, much less actually using it in the office.PROS:Amazon has an excellent return policy.Worth a few laughs in the office.
