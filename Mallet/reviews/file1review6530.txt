review/text: I get so tight in my neck and back, and it's hard to massage that away by myself. This thing looks funny, but man, it packs a punch. The pressure points are small, so be careful if you're not into deep tissue. There are pointed spots and more rounded spots, so if you like it on the lighter side, use one of the rounder spots. I use both. I tied a satin sheath over one of the protruding "branches" and that works great for sliding the thing around (over a shirt/blouse), without "sticking" when it comes to the plastic/skin contact. I can get rid of the tension in my neck and back very well with this thing. It sometimes hurts the day afterward, and I don't care. I just use it again, and the muscles are loose again.If you like it gentle, be careful with this. If you're like me, and aren't that delicate, then get this thing. It's well worth the $20.
