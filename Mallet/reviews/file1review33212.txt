review/text: If I take this product at the VERY FIRST sign of a cold I do not get sick. However, if I ignore my initial symptoms for whatever reason and take the capsules when I feel worse, I will generally get that cold. Personally I take vitamins regularly but not the Wellness which I use only when I feel "out of balance" - in other words when I feel a scratchy throat, sinus drainage or some other mild precursor to a cold. There's no question in my mind that this works for me and I highly recommend the Wellness capsules. My husband and son have also had positive results.
