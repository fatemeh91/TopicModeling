review/text: I think my symptoms may be more problematic than normal, as nothing seems to help. And I don't know if this product would help or not because it's such a pain to use that I haven't been able to stick with it.The big problem is how horribly it dissolves in liquid. It's a big production of having to mix it just so - you have to, essentially, mix as you are pouring in the liquid, hot or cold, with a fork (a spoon doesn't seem to work well), otherwise it doesn't really dissolve at all, just gums up. Even doing it as instructed it still doesn't dissolve easily. It says to wait a few seconds, and then restir until all is dissolved.I found it takes a few stirrings over a few minutes to get it to dissolve even when done as instructed. Try to vary from the instructions and you're likely to get gummy chunks that don't dissolve at all.Most powders meant to dissolve in liquids aren't even close to being this finicky.I'm guessing it would help to some degree, but it's just too much of a hassle, and I never noticed any improvement even when I did use it.
