review/text: I love Little Sprouts products but I hate this cream. It is thick which I love, but the smell is very overwhelming. It really stinks. If you like strong perfumed scents for your little one then this is the product for you! However, not all Little Sprouts products have a scent like this one. So don't judge all of Little Sprouts products by this one.
