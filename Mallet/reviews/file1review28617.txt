review/text: This is about as good of a product as you will find for the price! I switched to this protein powder a couple of years ago, and for me it's a perfect supplement for increasing lean muscle mass with proper exercise and diet. I was blessed pretty good genetics and a high metabolism (I gradually lose weight when I quit working out for an extended period of time), so this helps me rebuild more quickly after taking long breaks. For those trying to shed the pounds, this is still a superb supplement because it's low calorie and isn't filled with a bunch of junk that your body doesn't need.
