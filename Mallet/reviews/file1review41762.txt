review/text: If you started with Battery operated 5.99 Toothbrushes ,this is the way to go .I found this Toothbrush to be highly effective on ridding your mouth of bleeding gums, I use Metadent toothpaste.The 9400 works great , Get The dentist clean mouth feeling.Very good design and engineering ,easy to use and Quiet.I also recommend ordering additional brush heads, they are designed to give you 3 months, inspect the wear indicator on the head.
