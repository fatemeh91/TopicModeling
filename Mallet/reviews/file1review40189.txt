review/text: Consumer Reports ranked as best so I started using it. I am very happy with the results. Dollar General and Walmart sell it for $1. I would not have tried it without Consumers Reports recommendation. A $1.00 price strikes me as suspicious especially since most toothpastes are $3 to $5. One of the few cases where a low price is nota tip off to a bad product.Ultra Brite Advanced Whitening Anticavity Fluoride Toothpaste, Clean Mint, 6 oz (170 g)
