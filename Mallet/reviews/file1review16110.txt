review/text: I bought the Ultra-Lightweight Rainbow Reacher for my grandmother and she told me that it was hard to use. She stated that the grabber end barley opens and the suction cups do not pick up much of anything. Cosmetic Solutions is not a company I would buy from again. They never sent a shipment confirmation and Amazon had to cancel the order. I bought my grandmother a replacement grabber, the PikStik Pro Aluminum Reacher, from Amazon and my grandmother was very satisfied with this reacher. She stated that the PikStik Pro Aluminum Reacher was easier to grip and picked up all the smaller objects (such as the TV remote) that she need to reach.
