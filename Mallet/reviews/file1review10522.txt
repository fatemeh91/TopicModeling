review/text: Not only does this supplement work great to promote regularity, it contains flax seed, a good source of omega-3, glutamine, a preferred nutrient of intestinal cells (according to my dietitian friends), and probiotics to recharge the gut with healthy bacteria. I am a pharmacist, and recommend this product over the conventional fiber supplements sold in regular stores, because it's more natural. Have used this for years; it's a great supplement.
