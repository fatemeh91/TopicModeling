review/text: First, the building quality is perfect, very soft and easy to clean. It takes you to heaven in less the 10 minutes. The velocity control is great but the rotation system is a little bit too loud so I require careful when use it. If you live with your parents or share the house with someone else, I suggest to use something to cover the noise or use when you're all alone. Its amazing! I recommended it to all girls and couples who wants to spice it their love life. And the price was good too.
