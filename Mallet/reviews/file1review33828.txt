review/text: I needed an adult stethoscope but did not want to spend a lot due to the tendency for them to "walk" and never return. I did some research and after reading the reviews, I decided to go with this one because of the price. I must say, I was impressed from the beginning as I opened the package. The product had a definite feel of quality and did not appear or feel cheap at all. Using it in the acute care setting has shown me that this stethoscope performs just as well as brands five times more expensive. I have no complaints with the stethoscope itself. The only complaint and disappointment is the name tag was extremely cheap and fell off within the first hour of use. But I feel that is a small price to pay for such good quality regarding performance. I fixed the tag and haven't had any issues since. Great product, great price!!!
