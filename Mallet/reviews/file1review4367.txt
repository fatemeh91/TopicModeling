review/text: The Gillette Fusion replacement cartridges work extremely well. While on the expensive side (best price found was on this site), they do the job better and longer without changing than any other blade I've used. They provide a close shave and the extra blade for trimming and sideburns does its job very well. No complaints whatsoever with performance....only concern is what happens to the plastic shell if the razor is dropped. Would have gotten 5 stars if more reasonably priced.
