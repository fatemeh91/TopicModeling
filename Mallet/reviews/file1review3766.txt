review/text: As soon as I received the product I started taking it the next day. The bottle says to take 5 pills before bedtime and that is what I did. What I did not know is that I would be going to the bathroom quite a bit. I am going to reduce my dosage and see how it works. I had about 80 ounces of water and I guess the water helped with the flush. I heard about this product from JJSmithonline and I would highly recommend these for anyone who wants to clean their colon!
