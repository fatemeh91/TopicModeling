review/text: I purchased this to replace my old Remington PG-360 trimmer. I like how the adjustable guard is built in, yet still removable for easy cleaning without having to change the entire head (i.e.- different sized blades). The battery life is AWESOME! I bought this, charged it initially for 24 hours, and then used it 4-5 times over almost a month before it died. I used it to trim my beard and also my whole head, so one usage was maybe 5-7 minutes straight. It's also great for deployed locations when you don't have a barber and additionally to keep your "relaxed" grooming standards from growing too wild. Overall, once again Remington produces a great product that is also fit for the AOR.
