review/text: Like so many other reviewers here, I had several stubborn warts (both on my hands and bottom of my feet). I had nine sessions of cryotherapy with my doctor, which included paring the wart down to the root and a treatment of liquid nitrogen. This treatment had little to no effect on my more than two dozen warts.I tried liquid salicylic acid for weeks upon weeks, and it was successful on the smaller or weaker warts.I finally tried this wart stick on my most stubborn warts. After about 3-4 weeks of consistent--practically religious--use, I had great success. You should be aware that this 40% strength product will irritate healthy skin. But I tried to limit the wart stick to just the wart, and I used it every day for about 30 days (and using 10 cheap nail files to file the dead skin away). At a certain point, the warts just became so soft that I could file away chunks at a time.I can definitely recommend this product. But like any product that affects your body, take care when using it.
