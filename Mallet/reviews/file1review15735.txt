review/text: I am not a pen nut. I just like one that works. I had no idea a pen like this existed. For ME to drop $30 on a pen is just something those who know me wouldn't believe. But to have black and red ink along WITH a pencil all in one.....I just had to have it. It was a little tricky figuring out the pencil, and wondering why was there a 2nd top included, but after that it was all good. Less stuff on my desk, and a pen that is like me....deceptive in looks....so much more than you expected. *:)
