review/text: These are the best dry eye drops I've found. I use them at night before I go to sleep. This is when my eyes are driest. I keep them on my bed sied table and use them as needed during the night. They do not leave my eyes sticky like the gels, do not sting like other dry eye drops and you can use them as often as you need since they do not have harsh chemicales. Also Amazon offers them at a great price. I was buying them at a health food store for about $10. I recommed them.
