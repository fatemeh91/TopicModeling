review/text: Bought to replace mb-300 with dying battery, the ergonomic design remains the same, but the plastic used for the variable length comb mechanism is cheap and flimsy. It lacks the pop up detail function of the mb-300. Quality of construction has deteriorated considerably. It's serviceable, but not worth the cost.
