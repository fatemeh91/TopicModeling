review/text: This stuff is great for post workout or a healthy bridge in between meals. Tastes pretty good. The Double Chocolate is a good balance - not too sweet like the Extreme Chocolate. It mixes great in water and even better in milk. Goes down good and my stomach agrees with it. I have definitely added some lean mass since I began using this product 4 months ago. The 5 pound tub lasts me right at a month. I have no reservations when it comes time to pony up the $53 for another one. Best whey protein I've used.-Legend
