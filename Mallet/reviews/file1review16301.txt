review/text: Used it and it works well, doesnt leave a nasty smell, buildup on anything and doesnt do anything weird in your dishwasher. I do not like heavy smelling cleaners and this isnt heavy smelling. It cleans and works just like it says it will. I will continue using these in the future as well. Sometimes I needed to put more then one tablet in the washer to get the dishes clean and you only need one of these!
