review/text: I love the product I actually prefer the tubular rose but I like the lavendar as well. What I didn't like was the packagaing. both times it came the bottle came open and there was body wash all over the box. Amazon needs to figure out a better way to ship it, they did however let me keep both bottles as opposed to shipping it back which would have been impossible.
