review/text: This is really a great protein. It gives you exactly what you need whether you're trying to pack on some mass or jsut keep a healthy source of protein without any other junk.Pros-absolutely delicious (powder smells like a box of thin mints)-easily digestible for fast absorption rates-cheap (I got 2lbs of it here for $15 after I saved 15% for the subscribe and save-mixes easily into milk or water-most reliable brand for proteinCons-Not as high quality as the Platinum HydroWhey (for the price its worth it)I recommend it
