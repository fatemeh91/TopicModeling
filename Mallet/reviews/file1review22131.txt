review/text: But now when I needed it again I turned it on it came on fine but it would not read the my daughters temperature. I tryed it on myself and still it just kept blinking a &quot;7&quot;. I am going to write to the manufacturer and see what they can do. My daughter is only 4 months old I figured this would last longer then four months and 2 trys.
