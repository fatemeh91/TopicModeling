review/text: That's what I thought when I read the review about the batteries not charging, where the charge light came on for about 15 minutes before turning off again and the batteries never charged. That's almost exactly what happened to me, though. I say 'almost', because after the first time, the lights never came on again...not the red light nor the green.To be honest, I expect it could have had something to do with using a voltage converter while in another country, but one would hope that the manufacturer had allowed for such bizarre occurences as one leaving the United States and wanting to charge batteries while abroad for more than a week.One upside of this is that I can still use the batteries themselves so long as I get them charged in another charger. In fact, these batteries have lasted longer on their first charge than the batteries that came with my camera. If I could give a separate review of the batteries, I'd give them 5 stars, but the charger will remain the subject of any new invective I can dream up for the next few weeks. Buyer beware!
