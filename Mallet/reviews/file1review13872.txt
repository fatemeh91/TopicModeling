review/text: I bought a pair for my wife, heated them up and she wore them onnce in bed. She never put any pressure on them other than pulling them over her skinny size 9 feet to put them on. Never took a single step with them. When she removed them, one had a torn seam and was un-fixable. I put a little pressure on the other slipper in the same spot and it easily separated as well. Amazon's return policy came through for me though. Thanks Amazon!So far, the Happy Company gloves and headband I bought seem fine though.
