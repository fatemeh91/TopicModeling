review/text: I really wanted these to work. They clean the steel, however, what they leave behind is sometimes worse. On my refrigerator, they leave streaks and oil droplets. On my stove, they leave very noticeable dust particles, where I have to clean between knobs. Additionally, they have left scratches around the knobs of my stove, even though I was very careful to clean with the lightest touch. I am going back to the spray cleaner and microcloth. It is not as convenient, but does a much better job and won't scratch my appliances as easily.
