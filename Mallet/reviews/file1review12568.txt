review/text: I was really excited about getting this product based on other people's reviews. It doesn't seem quite as effective for me. If I take two pills I don't end up going at all (without them I usually move at least once). If I take 3, things are too loose and I get bloated. I made sure to dring a lot of water as other reviewers suggested. I also supplemented with hcl pills thinking that maybe was an issue. Neither seemed to make a difference. However, I did notice my body liked these better than herbal pills. I was hoping this would make me more consistently regular but I think I'll have to reserve it only for times when I'm constipated. You may be one of the people it works really well for though.
