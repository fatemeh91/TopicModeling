review/text: With others, I followed the directions exactly and used it under supervision of the nurses at cardiac rehab. Tried everything to make the readings consistent or correct. The readings were wildly higher than BPs taken by professionals. And they weren't even consistent. Systolic varied, diastolic varied. Not a good product and as others have pointed out, outright *dangerous* because doctors and patients make medical decisions on the basis of the readings.
