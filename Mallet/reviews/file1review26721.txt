review/text: I've tried my fair share of protein supplements, and ON's Gold Standard 100% Whey is the best by far. Not only does it supply you with high quality protein, it mixes better, tastes better (I prefer chocolate), rinses easier, and has better value than any other protein shake I've tried to date. A+ for quality and cost.
