review/text: I have a leather planner, a leather purse, leather shoes, etc. This product never lets me down. It cleans well and seems to condition even before I add the Apple conditioner, which really ads a shine :D I've used lots of cleaners and conditioners, and this one just works. It keeps my leather products looking like new! When I need to, I use with Meltonian cream polish, which I also highly recommend for leather care due to consistency and beauty of MANY colors.
