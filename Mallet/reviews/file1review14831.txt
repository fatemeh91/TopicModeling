review/text: This protein powder makes for a great meal replacement/supplement and has a big advantage over many of its competitors: it is actually edible. Some others might brag that they have 2 or 3 more grams of protein, but you would rather eat a big bag of hair than drink them. MET-Rx has a good size serving of protein and doesn't taste half bad.
