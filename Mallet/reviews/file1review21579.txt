review/text: I just got one of these (at a discount price) and it's okay. It really only massages your neck. If that's all you want, it is great for that because it really does feel like kneading fingers. I had hoped for more, but I'm not sure that I'll find it. I would like a massager that kneads both neck and shoulders and can move up and down a bit. I've found those for the back, but not one that includes the neck. This massager is rather large and heavy also. You have to prop yourself up with pillows to get the best angle and move a lot to get different areas of the neck.
