review/text: I've never owned a sex toy before, let alone a vibrator, but I'm sorry I waited so long to purchase one. I found this exact model at Ambiance for twice the price, so you're getting a really good value buying it here. All I can say about the delivery is that I paid extra to have it over-nighted and it came two days later (oh well, it wasn't an emergency..). I've only had it a few days but it has worked every time, so I feel good about the money I spent on it, however I will probably buy another one eventually with a few different things in mind. I don't really care for the rotating beads- I used them the first couple of times and then just started turning them off because they were distracting and didn't really add any pleasure. I feel like I couldn't get it deep enough or the ears would overshoot my clit. I still liked having the penetration though, so I would probably get one of the models that does its own thrusting or curves upwards for the g-spot or something. Other than that, it's nice and quiet and has worked every time for me. I'm really glad I saved the money by buying it here.
