review/text: I started taking these pills over a year ago after I saw Dr. Oz talking about what they do to your memory. It took about 2 months for them to start working. I started noticing that I was remembering things I know I would have forgotten or not remembered. The other day in the store someone said hi to me, I knew I new her it took a few minutes but then I remembered who she was and where I knew her from I even remembered her name even though when we worked in the same building 5 years earlier we never even had a conversation....for me that was just another in a long list of confirmations of how great this product works. I recommend them to anyone who says they have a memory problem. My brother-in-law starting taking them a few months back and called me the other day to say they started working! If forgetfulness is your problem they these and wait a couple of months.
