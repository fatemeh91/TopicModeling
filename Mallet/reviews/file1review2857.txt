review/text: The short: Avoid this shaver because it only runs off the battery, which will go bad years before the shaver itself will probably need to be replaced.I was very happy with my previous inexpensive Remington electric shaver (a line now sadly discontinued) so had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, when they designed this one they made it so that it runs on the battery only, even if it is plugged into the wall. I was lucky in that my battery died in the first week so I was able to return the unit for a refund (Remington reimburses sellers for returns up to one month) but I am sure many people buy this, only to have the battery die a few months into its use. My last Remington had a bad battery, too, but since it could run when plugged in, it was not a big problem. This one, if the battery is down, it will not run even if it is plugged into the wall. Charge time according the the manual is 16 hours. Mine needed recharging after only two shaves. Eight hours of charging per shave? Thankfully the seller took it back with no questions or problems.
