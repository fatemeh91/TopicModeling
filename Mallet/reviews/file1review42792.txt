review/text: My doctor first recommended this product for me after a heavy round of antibiotics. I used it sporadically at first, but when I realized I was battling an entrenched yeast infection I realized I needed to use it daily. I then recommeded it to my son-in-law. He was eliminating more and more foods from his diet because they caused stomach pain and diarrhea. He was so happy when the condition improved. This is not a cure-all, but it really helps.
