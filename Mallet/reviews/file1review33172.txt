review/text: I started taking Wellness Formula capsules andGood N' Natural Olive Leaf Extract + Echinacea Goldenseal Drops (1 oz) With FREE Vitamin C Powder 100 Gramsearlier this year in order to boost my immune system before a trip to Europe. It seems like every time I travel to a different country I end up getting really sick. I took the preventative dose every day before I traveled, during the trip, and didn't come close to getting sick at all. I just personally love it.Being leery about the flu shot, as it has made me sick all three times I've gotten it, I continue to take these supplements per day and the one cold I've managed to catch all year was very mild and short lived compared to the ones I've had in the past. I really recommend this products because it really helps boost your immune system.
