review/text: I've been taking Primal Defense for a year and a half and it has made a huge difference in my life. I used to have chronic constipation and intense food allergies. Within two months I noticed a big difference (you really need to take at least three tablets a day or more to have good results). I didn't want to spend so much for something that I knew I'd have to take for the rest of my life but now I'm happy to pay for it, I've seen so many benefits. After two months I noticed that my body was purging all kinds of gunk, I was shocked at what was coming out of me, basically a lot more than I was putting in. I had read that that could happen but it was strange to actually experience it. This went on for about 6 months but it wasn't a horrible experience at all and I felt sooooo much better afterwards. My food allergies went away completely and so did my constipation. I also have absolutely no problems when I travel. My hair, skin and nails look amazing too. I think that is because my body can actually absorb the vitamins and minerals better. Primal Defense and OmegaZyme are amazing products and, although they may seem pricey, making this investment can actually change your life!
