review/text: I am very far from my girlfriend and thus unable to help with many basic chores.. this belt has proven very useful in supporting her back in long walks and random tasks of cleaning, rearranging, and just her general mobility around the house and abroad. I'm sure she could make a much better review than I could, but, for me, it's enough to say that she hasn't been complaining of back troubles nearly as much (if at all) since receiving this product.
