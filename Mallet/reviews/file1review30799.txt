review/text: I have been using the G-U-M Protect toothbrush for some time and find it to bethe best I have ever tried. The design of the handle makes it very comfortable to hold and maneuver the brush head to contact all of the tooth surfaces. I wish that I could find someone who carries this item. I'm not sure it is available anymore.
