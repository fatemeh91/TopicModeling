review/text: I took these vitamins for 1 year before my first pregnancy, 9 months of pregnancy, and then two years after my pregnancy. They did not make me feel nauseous. They are large and can be difficult to take for that reason, but other than that no issues. However, the FDA confirmed in 2009 that these vitamins contain lead, which you can read more about on their website. For that reason I would never take (nor recommend) these vitamins again.
