review/text: Some days this scale will read the same WHATEVER you put on it.I can step on it with or without shoes, holding books, with wet hair: it reads exactly the same. The next day the same conditions will produce an eight pound increase or a five pound decrease.I think I'd get more accurate results by pulling a number out of a hat!Please don't waste your money.I am on [...] today, because I am shopping for a different scale. You should too....
