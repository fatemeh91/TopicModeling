review/text: I have taken quite a few different types of fat burners and have NEVER had the bad reaction this stuff gave me. When I would take it, yes, it did all the stuff it said (weight loss I dont know, but I wasnt hungry, had more energy, etc.) But my face and neck and hands would turn blotchy red and start burning and itching. When the effects of the pills wore off my skin would go back to normal. As horrible as this sounds I thought it was just something my body had to get used to so I continued taking it and it continued to have these crazy effects. WOULD NOT USE AGAIN.
