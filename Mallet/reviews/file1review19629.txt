review/text: We bought this for our 22 month old who had been using 2 different all-in-one potty's for a while. he is taller (95%) so these other seats were kind of tight. He took to this sea immediately, and fits on it much more comfortably. The guard is large and the one-piece construction makes it all easy to clean- it's even dishwasher safe! all in all a great seat (we bought the bb step stool too).
