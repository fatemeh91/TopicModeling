review/text: I ordered the small based on the recommended neck measurements. What the description doesn't tell you is that there is a velcro strip approx 4-5 inches long that will scratch your neck if it isn't covered by the other side of the collar, so order with that in mind! Otherwise it's fine, your basic cervical collar...
