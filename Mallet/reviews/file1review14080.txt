review/text: I tried every which way to mount this organizer. I tried the loops, the velcro, and the straps. No matter what I tried, the organizer didn't keep its shape. The wipe container was normal size, but the whole thing sagged from the weight, and the shelves just kept slanting so stuff fell out. The only thing that stayed in were the diapers, but I was hoping to fit a little of everything in it. I finally gave up and got a dresser top organizer which was much easier for me.
