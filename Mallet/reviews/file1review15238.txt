review/text: I've tried numerous ""power"" type bars, but the Balance Bar is by far the best I've had. They were moist and had a wonderful flavor to them. They arrived during a very stressful week for me. I felt I had more energy while eating them and they helped me to maintain my alertness during this time. I would highly recommend them to my family and friends. They're fairly inexpensive compared to many of the bars on the market.
