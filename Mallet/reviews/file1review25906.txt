review/text: I bought this from Amazon for Christmas 2009 to accompany the digital camera I was giving my wife. The non-rechargable batteries we put in the camera lasted until April. Then, I plugged in the charger with the so-called rechargable batteries. When the light showed green, I unplugged the charger and batteries. The next day, I put the batteries in the camera which immediately reported "battery exhausted". I feel like I wasted the money I spent.
