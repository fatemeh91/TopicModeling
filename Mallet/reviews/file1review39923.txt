review/text: I purchased this powder after reading about all the heavy metals found in most of the other protein powders like muscle milk and myoplex. Apparently this stuff received high marks and wasn't found to contain heavy metals. Unfortunately the stuff tastes really terrible which is surprising given the pleasant smell of the powder. I made the first 8 oz serving with just powder and water...I had to hold my nose and chug it down, then deal with the terrible after-taste and rolling stomach for the next half hour. Next batch mixing with milk was a little better but still not good enough to drink without holding my nose. So far I've had the best luck by mixing 1 scoop with 8 oz low fat milk, about an ounce or 2 of half and half, and some hersheys syrup. Needless to say its disappointing to add some less than healthy stuff to a nutritional drink, but its better than drinking arsenic and lead.
