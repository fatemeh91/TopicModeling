review/text: This product serves it's intended purpose well. It is easy to use, unlike other similar products, it can hold onto object of unusual shape relatively firmly, with out danger of oversqueezing them. If you wanted to, you could pick up eggs without fear. That being said, the rubber suction cups which are one part of the design that makes it work so well, are also it's weakest link. They tend to loosen up and fall of, where you do not notice them. We have lost a few now. There does not seem to be any way to order spare parts, so that compounds the problem. If you are willing to check the tightness of the screws that hold the cups on, each time before you use this product, I would recommend it, otherwise, it will be usefull for only a short time.Addendum Nov. 15, 2011Concerning the issue of the suction cups falling off:I went to the local Ace Hardware store and bought suction cups there which have the threaded stud molded into the rubber cup, and nuts then thread onto those. This has worked out well as they are just as functional, but have never fallen off like the original ones have. So if you have or buy one of these, there is a cure.
