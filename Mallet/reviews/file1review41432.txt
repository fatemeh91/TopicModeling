review/text: Briefly, this was one of two products similar in nature and price which were recommended by my eye doctor for eyes producing insufficient tears due to the aging process. When I do not forget to carry one with me during the day they do reduce considerably the burning sensation which they are intended to relieve, I feel confident in supporting my physicians recommendation. I should note that I cannot testify as to whether the less expensive products also available over the counter will or will not do as well for other sets of eyes. When it comes to the eyes, I am prepared to pay the price to follow my doctor's advice. Compared to the average prescription drug of which we elderly are such great consumers, it is a small price indeed.
