review/text: This is one of the protein brands that I trust. There are many out there but who knows what they actually mix in their jars. The only thing to watch out is that if you mix this with water..you'll need to give the shaker a violent twirl for about a minute, otherwise you end up with lumps in your mouth. My favorite is Rocky Rad...but I'm trying out chocolate now..not as good. Thumbs up for this product. However amazon took 15 days to get it to me..!!!!! first time that happened.
