review/text: I didn't really look at the product description, I just fixated on "weekender" thinking that would be the size I wanted. I got a medical pack that much larger than I intended to buy. I bought a second AMK that was the size I wanted, but I did so at REI where I could see it when I bought it.I've used AMK for over a decade now, mostly in Search and Rescue work. In comparison, this medical pack is quite tiny compared to what I'm used too (and it's missing things like a surgical stapler, and a dental filling kit), but I think it is much larger than a weekend.In summary: AMK is good stuff, but pay attention to the kit sizes and think hard about just how much you need.
