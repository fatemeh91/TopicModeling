review/text: I was looking to purchase a deodorant without all the toxic ingredents - that really works for my body.Aubrey's Organics hair conditioner work wonderfully. But this Deodorant didn't, it did not protect me at all. My daughter also tried it and didn't work for her neither... I'll keep searching........
