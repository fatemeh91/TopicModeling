review/text: I have owned other epilators before, and this one is definitely the best. It does the job twice as fast as any other. I usually took me about 20 minutes, and I did it in less than 10. I gave it only four stars because the shape is not all that great. It is somewhat difficult to hold because it is so different from other epilators. But eventually you probably get used to it. Also, the packaging is too much, and it is not easy to put the cord away, and it is not portable. I wish it came in a zipped pouch like most of the others do. But overall, I am very happy wiht the way it performs. It is the best epilator I have owned.
