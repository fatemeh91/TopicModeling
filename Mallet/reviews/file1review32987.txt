review/text: I gave 1 star not because of the product itself. The product is absolutely great. We have Miele W4802. This detergent works very well as advertised. I heard that Tide HE works well too but some customer reviews out there are saying it's hard to get all powder off the cloth - so we went for Persil. We are happy.The problem IS:As soon as I placed the order, I realized that our local Miele store has the same product that actually costs a little less. We can get it right away instead of waiting for shipping. i immediately tried to contact the seller from Amazon website. There is no phone number and only email is made avalaible. I sent them 2-3 emails asking for cancellation but they NEVER responded!!! In a few days, the product arrived.I think it is totally iresponsble if you allow customers to contact you and you don't intend to respond to our requests. At least, I would like to get a response saying something. No, never heard a word from them. I hope Amazon can monitor these sellers and give them feedback if these sellers don't live up to their promise.Be aware of this problem. I don't think there is a way that customer can cancel an order with this seller.
