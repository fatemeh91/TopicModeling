review/text: This is a terrible lightning rod. It seems to be constructed from some sort of insulating material, so it doesn't conduct well. If you place it in an elevated position during during a thunderstorm and expect it to attract any stray lightning bolts you're going to be disappointed. Also, it is shaped disturbingly like a phallus.On the plus side, it glows in the dark, which is pretty cool.
