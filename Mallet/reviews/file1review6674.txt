review/text: I bought both the backknobber and this unit. I use the backknobber at work, because it can break down into smaller size and looks clean. However, the backknobber will come apart if you press really hard for deep tissue action (it unlatches itself and shoots 1-half across the room).This is where this unit will accel and you don't have to worry about blowing it up. Another thing I like about this unit is the more aggressive cone-point on one end, oppsed to a ball-point.-1 star: This thing is UGLY omg, it looks like a sex toy and I do not want to be seen in public with it. I know 100% that other dudes will be ripping on my way more than the normal looking backknobber.
