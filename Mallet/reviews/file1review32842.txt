review/text: I like to make shakes with this in the morning. I usually add a banana, frozen strawberries, yogurt, and 2% milk. When doing it just alone with milk some may find the taste can be a little cloying/sweet but I don't mind it. Obviously you can use whatever fruits you want or have handy, luckily you can use a lot of frozen fruit and then you wan't have to add ice to make the shake and frozen fruits are available year round. ;)Gets a little tough to have this for both breakfast and lunch but makes for a great breakfast when you're on the go instead of a bagel or bacon and egg sandwich.
