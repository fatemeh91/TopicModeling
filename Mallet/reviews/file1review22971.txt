review/text: This sweeper works better on the carpet than regular floors.I used it in the kitchen, but it really doesn't work.It is really noisy when you moving itThen one I saw half piece of peanut on the floor, i sweep it, it doesn't work.and you have to touch the bottom of sweeper to open the dust tray.So i suggest use these money to buy a good normal sweeper.
