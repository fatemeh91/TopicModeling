review/text: I have been taking these vitamins for a long time now and about a month ago ran out, so I went to the health store to buy some but they were out of them, so I tried another multi, what a mistake. I didn't feel like I had very much energy and also felt out of sorts. Now I will never run out of these again. they are the best.
