review/text: I use this product on my two pugs' eyes as pugs are infamous for eye issues. One of my pugs is a stray with dry eyes as his eyes were not properly taken care of by his previous owner. I think the gel works very well and it is incredibly easy to apply, especially to a squirming dog. :) It was highly recommended by our vet for daily use and the price is better online than in the store for the dual pack ($19 at CVS).
