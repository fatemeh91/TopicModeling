review/text: I'll have to agree with E. Winkeldude. There were quite a few tabs in my box that were either spoiled brown or rotten black goo. As far as effectiveness in muscle grouth, I don't think I saw anything (but I only did one cycle). The taste was okay but you need nearly frozen water to drink it. I could say between this and some other things I was taking at the same time, I slept all right and my muscles felt well rested for the most part (even after hitting the gym every day). However, I won't buy it again. It's way too expensive to get the little result that I got.
