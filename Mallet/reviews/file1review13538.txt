review/text: I have worked foodservice for more years than I care to remember. Tweleve hour days in this industry are the norm and being on your feet for the majority of those hours is a given. The worst way to spend those hours is with sore or aching feet. This product cushions the heel and arch of your foot making standing & walking a more pleasurable experience. The smartsole helps to correct your posture. Good posture helps to alleviate back pain. Do not hesitate to buy this product, you will not regret it.Ann Partlow DTRBlanchester, OH
