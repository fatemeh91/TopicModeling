review/text: Having a very bad back, I need constant lumbar support where ever I go and taking this handy, convenient pillow with me provides that no matter what kind of seat I sit in. It is especially helpful in church pews and the straight back wood pews play havoc with my back. Having the pillow allows me to sit in relative comfort.
