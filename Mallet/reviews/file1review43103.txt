review/text: When I purchased this item, I thought surely there is at least a T-Shirt I'd be able to wear on top and not have it show... well no, the top criss-cross straps are so close to the neck that the white of the straps shows no matter what you have on. They also show under all my summer dresses, many of which follow the same kind of cut. I cannot wear this at work. Would only be able to wear it around the house, and even so would be embarrassed should someone come knocking at the door. As a working pregnant person, that does not at all fit my needs. Not until my back is REALLY killing me.I'm 33weeks, 5"7 and 193lb (a M before pregnancy) and the L seems like the right size, though there are only three size settings very far apart (not velcro, but hooks) and none fits just right... So it's not great on sizing either. The belt area itself is narrower than I expected - about 3 " all around.---Edited per comment I received: my pain was not to a point where I'd be willing to suffer a wardrobe malfunction, and the belt did not make a noticeable difference. I ended up getting the black velcro belt that just wraps around your hips, and it was fantastic.
