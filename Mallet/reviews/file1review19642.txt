review/text: I've bought 2 other toilet training seats prior to this one and neither fit my elongated toilet seat (high step Kohler elongated toilet). The BabyBjorn fits my toilet seat perfectly due to the adjusting dial you turn to &#34;lock&#34; the seat in position. There are no holes or scary spots showing with this seat so my twin toddlers feel confident getting up on this seat. I have boy/girl twins and this seat fits both nicely. My boy is not as ready to potty train as my girl so I'm not 100% on how well the raised guard will work for stopping urine splashes from him. Happy I spent the extra money to have a seat that fits and is comfortable for them both!
