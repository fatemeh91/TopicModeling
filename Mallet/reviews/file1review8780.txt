review/text: I love this stuff! I give it to my kids in the morning mixed with a little orange juice and they all drink it! It makes me feel better that they're getting lots of vitamins they need when I struggle to get the daily veggies into them. I'll even make berry smoothies with it and once they get past the green look, they're fine. I really do think it helps them behave better, and not crave so much junk since their body is getting what it needs.
