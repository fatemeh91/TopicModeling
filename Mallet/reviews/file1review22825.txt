review/text: I will be giving updates daily and eventually weekly for my experience with this product. My initial rating is neutral (3 stars) as nothing bad, nor nothing noticeably better than any other fat burner I've tried.Day 1) It took about 30 minutes to consume all 9 pills in the 1st pack. 2 Hours later no jitters, no outrageous heart rate or none of the negative side effects described by some of the other users. I feel alert and energized, I took them on a full stomach.
