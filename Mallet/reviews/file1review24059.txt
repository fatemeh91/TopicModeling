review/text: I was a little nervous to purchase, because I have to be on Probiotics for some time, maybe even the rest of my life because of some FDA drugs that really destroyed my internal body. I read all I could on here about these, and took the risk. These say you don't need to refrigerate, which was the only reason I didn't want to buy because all of the ones I purchased prior were always refrigerated. Works just as well as ones you buy in a health food place, just less expensive. Great purchase. I need to switch off probiotics, (advice from my acupuncturist) but will definately come back to these in circulation!
