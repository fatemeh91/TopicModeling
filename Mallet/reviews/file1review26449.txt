review/text: The three beads on the tip pisses me off. I can never hit the clit on the right spot. It's 3/4 width just doesn't make sense when it's built to vibrate a very small organ.I learned that it needs to be dried off very well. I washed it and left it aside to air dry. A few weeks later the beads started to rust. I've tried washing it again but it was permanent.Simple, vibrating is strong. But it's easily corrosive.
