review/text: Dip-it is the best stuff for cleaning a thermos. Just put a table spoon in the thermos and fill it with boiling water. All the scum and stains that I couldn't get out with a brush and soap comes floating to the surface. This stuff appears to have disappeared from the grocery store shelves. I guess it is too caustic for most modern coffee makers. I think the stuff was created for the old percolator coffee makers, which have pretty much disappeared. The only place I've been able to buy this product is on the Internet.
