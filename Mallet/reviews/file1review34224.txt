review/text: I was searching for a treatment that would work on my problem, caused by chemotherapy after colon cancer. The medication did a real number on most of the nerve endings in my body, especially my fingers and my ...you know what. I couldn't stand the constant itching and/or burning. Then I found this stuff.I don't like to buy outside of the USA, especially things from China. But this ointment is unbelievable. I have found that just "a little dab 'll do ya" and I do that after every movement, which is when my symptoms are at their worst. At first, it feels like an ice cube, ahhhhhh, so refreshing! Then, that dies down and there is no itching or burning whatsoever. A miracle if ever there was one.And don't worry about the unusual smell. Where this stuff is going, does it really matter??If you have any problems in this regard, GET THIS PRODUCT. It works, it really, really does!
