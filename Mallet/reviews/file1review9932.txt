review/text: Tweezerman is not the perfection (i gave it 8 out of 10)The problem with Tweezerman that whenever you start using it, you will get addicted to use it in such a way you destroy your facial looking somehowbut in general, it is way better than the normal tweezersThe shipment delivery was fast (about 1 week - 10 days) to Sweden, which is away faster than the ones on ebaythe shipment fees is really expensive relative to other couriers on other websites, like ebay
