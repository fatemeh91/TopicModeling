review/text: I'm really happy i went to shaving with this "method" using the old style razor. It's more fun for me. It's hyped up a lot, but rationally though it's nice to have this kind of quality even if it's old school. These blades are pretty straight forwrd and definitely cheap compared to newer style razor blades.I believe you can use these for a while, if you keep them dry and free of debris after shaving.
