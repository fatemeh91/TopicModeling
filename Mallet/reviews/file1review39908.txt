review/text: I have tried and tried to find these in the stores and could not find them. I was so glad to be able to find them on Amazon. A dentist gave me one several years ago and I have been using it for a long time until it broke at one end. I like the fact that it has a brush on each end. I use a small brush on one end and a larger brush on the other end. A great product.
