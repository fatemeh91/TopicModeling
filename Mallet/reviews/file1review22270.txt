review/text: I can't live without this floss. It actually works to get the plaque out. You can visibly see the difference. It gets stuff that other flosses leave behind. As a test, I flossed with Glide and then flossed with Tom's afterwards. The Tom's got plaque and food that Glide missed. The evidence is on the floss. The Tom's floss is gritier so it can scrape the food off your teeth whereas Glide just glides passed everything. On the Tom's floss, you could see the food or plaque that came out from my teeth and onto the floss.
