review/text: Use this foot cream daily and at night, and feet stay baby soft! I don't know why Neutrogena stopped making the cracked heel lotion and their severely cracked heel lotion. I would give those A+ and the current foot cream anA-. Still, it's better than any other brands of foot lotions or creams that are available.
