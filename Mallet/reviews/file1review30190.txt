review/text: I liked this little dust buster so much that I bought a second one! It has amazing suction for such a little vacuum. I use it to clean up the area around my cat's litter box and for grabbing little bits of dust and hair from the corners of the room. I keep another one in my office at work and use it to tidy up my desk and vacuum out my air filter. My only complaint is that it is loud. If you don't mind the noise, you will be very happy with this product.
