review/text: My husband got one of these trimmers about 4 years ago and it finally broke. He has since purchased a couple different trimmers and was very disappointed in them. I went on line and started looking for yet another trimmer and found this one. Oh Happy Day! I purchased it and he is very happy again. I considered purchasing a couple of them in case he needs another one in the distant future!!
