review/text: I am another surprised and pleased purchaser of this amazing little sweeper.My new office has dark green carpet that shows every tiny bit of dust and lint. No way was I going to get out the big upright vacuum after each client. With this little device it takes seconds to pick up the dirt on my carpet.Just for fun I ran it down the ceramic tiled entry way and it picked up everything I could see, from construction muddy footprints to almost invisible pieces of thread. Cleaning the two carpeted steps leading down to my office is a snap.And the cost. With the free shipping I should buy a bunch to give out as gifts. I know everyone would love it.
