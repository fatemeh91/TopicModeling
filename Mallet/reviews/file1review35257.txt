review/text: I love this product!! My son had terrible cradle cap and after switching to this product, it was nearly gone within a week!! We love the fragrance and the fact that it doesn't have all that nasty stuff in it that other "baby" washes have. We have also gotten the California Baby lotions and sprays - we love them as well!
