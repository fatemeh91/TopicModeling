review/text: While the broom itself works fairly well, the dust pan doesn't lie flush with the floor. This means it's impossible to get fine particles into the pan. I continue to sweep and there's always a fine line of cat litter on the floor. Since that's the main thing I purchased it for, it's a complete waste for me. I'm now off to search for a stand up broom and dustpan instead...hopefully one that will pick up traces of cat litter. If only I could train my cats not to track litter or to sweep up after themselves...
