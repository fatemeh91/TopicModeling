review/text: Chose this as my first whey after reading a ton of different reviews. The Double Rich Chocolate flavor is weak with water and slightly better in milk. Clean nutritional profile, though. 1g fat, 1g carbs, and 24g protein a scoop. At a rate of two scoops per day, the 2lb jug will last half a month. Plan accordingly.Summary: Cheap, clean whey with mediocre taste.
