review/text: I had been anxious to try a ""whitening"" toothpaste, and had high hopes. However, I didn't feel this product lived up to my expectations. While my teeth felt clean, I didn't experience any noticeable difference in their coloring. This product also didn't leave my mouth as ""fresh"" as other Aquafresh products that I've used in the past. In fact, my husband even commented that it seemed almost ""salty."" I did see a commercial that said they've come out with a new ""fresher"" version. I would probably not purchase this product again.
