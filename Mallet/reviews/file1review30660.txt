review/text: Just finished my first shave with this razor and no cuts, no razor burn, and the closest smoothest shave I've ever had.Granted, you have to pay a little bit more attention to what you are doing with this razor - also, you have to do it right with a badger brush and shaving soap (I used the $13 badger brush form Amazon and Col. conk's shaving soap).It's all about patience - short, careful strokes with almost no pressure (let the weight of the razor do the work) and after the first pass, re-lather and make a second pass.It took me a little bit longer to shave, but this is easily the best shave I've ever had - it beats my Norelco Reflex to shreds, and is also better than the venerable Gilette Mach 3.I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone wanting a better shaving experience. But you just have to remember to be careful and go slowly. If you want to rush through shaving and just get it over with then stick with an electric that can't take your face off like this thing can :-)
