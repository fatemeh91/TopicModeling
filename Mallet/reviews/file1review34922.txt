review/text: I bought these mainly because I keep hearing about how they can make you have vivid/lucid dreams and also for those times when I'm having a hard time falling asleep (which is often). Unfortunately though they really didn't help with either sleeping or lucid dreams. Ive took them 3 nights in a row and I don't really plan on taking them again.The first night I took the recommended 3mg and I can't honestly say I slept any better, I think I might of even slept worst and my ability to recall my dreams was greatly diminished. When I woke up after eight hours I feel like the pills were still affecting me and I did not want to get out of bed my eyes felt really dry and sensitive to light. I spent the rest of the day feeling like this and just "out of it" kind of like when I don't get enough sleep. Day 2 was a repeat of day one. Day 3 I increased the dose to two pills and didn't notice any real improvement in the quality of my sleep or dreams.In conclusion, I was able to sleep with these pills but the way I felt after waking up is not worth taking them. I was also hoping they would have assisted me in lucid dreaming but they didn't. If you do decide to try these be careful because as stated on the bottle these pills can leave you feeling groggy/drowsy after waking up which can be dangerous for somebody who is required to be alert/focused for difficult/dangerous activities.
