review/text: This may work better in a small area but I have it set up on top of our rabbit hutch in large living room. You can smell it when u walk by it when fan is going, I like the citrus scent best so far and I tried outdoor scent as well. Wish they would make holiday scents for this or more scents in general, I tend to love warm rich scents, and these don't seem to be very awesome...
