review/text: Now I know how it is that the Alaskan Indians for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years comfortably surviving in that impossible climate. They are smarter than us.As one example, they developed this outrageously splendid kitchen tool that most of us still have not learned to appreciate. My wife bought ours fifteen years ago while we were visiting that fantastic State and I thought she was insane but since a disability prevents her continuing to cook I have learned to treasure it. It has an amazing number of uses and is almost fun to rock back and forth and see things happen. I have kept it diamond sharp with a few strokes on a steel after every use--that may be excessive, I did not do it the first couple of years I used it--but after learning to love it I want to make sure to preserve it. And to conclude, I ought a bunch to use as minor gifts and now am living in the loving glow of my kids and friends appreciation. (P.S. Super superb for people with arthritis)
