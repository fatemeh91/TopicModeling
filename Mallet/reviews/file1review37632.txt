review/text: The one feature I liked best about the Secret deodorant was the ""going on clear"" feature, since there wasn't any flakiness. I didn't particularly care for the scent, though, and was aware of it throughout the day. I normally use an unscented product and really prefer that. I also experienced a bit of stickiness at times during the day, which doesn't happen with the product I regularly use. I would suggest that friends try it if they like the scent, since the ""on clear"" feature is nice. I just happen to not like scented deodorant for myself.
