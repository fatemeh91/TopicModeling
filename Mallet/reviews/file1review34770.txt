review/text: I've tried a few other natural deodorants over the years, but this one works the best. It smells nice, and doesn't wear off during a normal day. I've noticed that it sometimes doesn't even wear off after I've done moderate to intense physical activity like running.It won't keep you from sweating, but really, no deodorant or antiperspirant ever truly kept me from sweating. When I used Secret or Dove before I switched, I'd just end up with nasty pit stains on my clothes, which I don't get anymore.I've used E Plus High C for three years now and I adore it. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an effective natural deodorant!
