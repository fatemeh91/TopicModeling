review/text: I am a rookie when it comes to sex toys and have never owned or tried one. Needless to say, The Rabbit works like a dream!I'm glad The Rabbit was my first choice, however, The size was intimidating but once I got over that aspect of it, the width seemed integral. The rabbit ears are phenominal! The 3 speeds are great for working your way up. The rotation is not that great but there is still good movement. The only bad thing I can think of is that funny burned rubber smell. I am more than pleased with the shipping. I selected the the 5-8 days and literally the product arrived the next day. Call this gal "one satisfied customer."California Exotics Waterproof Jack Rabbit
