review/text: My husband and I have been reading health books since he bacame ill with an "incurable" disease over 30 years ago . After much painstaking research through hundreds of health books, we finally found "natural" ways to help him heal. Now in Kevin Trudeau's book, we have found a one stop shop for everything you need to know/do for a healtier you. The information in this book is equivelant to the hundreds of health books in our library. If you can set aside the negative media coverage and take the time to read and see for yourself if this works for you, you will be blessed with a healthy more vibrant life.
