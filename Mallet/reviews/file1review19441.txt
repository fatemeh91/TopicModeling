review/text: I really like this stethoscope - it's easy to hear out of, it has a nice solid feel, the ear tips feel nice in my ears and seal out environmental noise well, and the price is a bit cheaper than comparable scopes on the market (Littmann, I'm looking at you!). The scope also comes with extra ear tips and a diaphragm membrane, plus it has a parts-for life- program where you can get the parts replaced for free. I also like that it has non-chill rims on both ends of the head. Finally, it even came with a name tag, which is a nice touch. I also like that it is a bit lighter in weight around the neck than a double-tube Sprague - nice for long shifts. I highly recommend this stethoscope!
