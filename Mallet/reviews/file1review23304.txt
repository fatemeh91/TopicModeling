review/text: This is a hard-working little carpet cleaner. Not too heavy and construction is pretty good. The only fault is with the handle which comes in sections so that it can be shipped. They screw on and can come loose. But, I just screw them back on and keep sweeping. I don't know if screwing them on tightly would ruin the threads, but maybe not. I just haven't tried that yet. I found the product well worth the money.
