review/text: Try something else unless you have children to wash with this soap. This stuff just really doesn't get you clean. Period. My husband smells just as bad as he did before he got into the shower after using this stuff and has to do it all over again. If you have kids in sports, try Old Spice or Safeguard. This stuff just won't do the job.
