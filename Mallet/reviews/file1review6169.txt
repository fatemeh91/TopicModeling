review/text: Irwin Natural's "Ginkgo Smart" has many healthful ingredients, including a fish oil base, but contains Vinpocetine, which is a periwinkle extract that might induce side effects such as reduced immune function and depleted catecholamine levels leading to depression (see wikipedia's Vinpocetine article).For a standardized extract containing both the 24% Ginkgo Flavonglycosides and the 6% Terpene Lactones, along with other brain nutrients, one might investigate Karuna's "MemoRegen", or Source Natural's "Ginkgo-24", or Allergy Research's "Complex-M w/ Ginkgo", or Life Extension's "Super Booster".GINKGO REVIEWED...THE BAD: In clinical studies published in 1997 and 2008 in the Journal of the AMA, Ginkgo was NOT shown to aid persons with dementia caused by Alzheimer's or stoke. Another 2008 study published in the journal, Neurology, also indicated that Ginkgo does not relieve memory or dementia symptoms, yet does increase the likelihood of stroke. But note, a study of mice also published in 2008 by Johns Hopkins researchers in the journal, Stroke, indicated Ginkgo may reduce the neurological damage by 50% if a stroke does occur from whatever cause.THE GOOD: In 1992, the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology published that Ginkgo DOES aide persons with Cerebral Insufficiency. In the article, 8 out of 40 clinical trials were found to be properly administered and thereby reach credible conclusions. At least 2 of the studies demonstrated significant results for patients suffering from Cerebro-vascular Insufficiency, a condition of decreased blood flow to the brain which may cause dementia-like symptoms or stroke. Dementia-like symptoms of Cerebral Insufficiency claimed to have been relieved include, "difficulties of concentration and memory, being absent minded, being confused, lack of energy, tiredness, decrease of physical performance, depressive mood, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, and headaches." Ginkgo may work by:* improving blood circulation to the extremities, including the brain;* relieving neurotransmitter disturbances;* effecting neuron metabolism;* neutralizing free radicals.
