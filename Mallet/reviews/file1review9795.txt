review/text: I have been using these tweezers for a number of years now, and continue to be pleased. They are all one could want in tweezers. Their precision is incredible. The tweezers come to a very fine point, and are capable of pulling anything from small eyebrow hairs to splinters, and anything in between.The only caveat is that you need to be careful with the tip. They are precisely cut, and if dropped on the point it will break or at the very least bend. There is a protective cap, but I think you're most likely to drop them while your hands are wet, possibly just out of the shower. But, even with that one point I would recommend these to anyone looking for tweezers.
