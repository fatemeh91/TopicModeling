review/text: The good:I am sleeping better and deeper.The mask blocks light effectively.Good value.The bad:The overlap on the velcro strap hurts the back of my head (I am a back sleeper). I wake up with a discomfort where I slept on it.My eyelashes touch the material and I wake up with extra itchy eyes, and uncomfortable eyelashes. The material is not very pliable/soft.The strap hurts the top of my ears also upon waking.*My friend said I looked like I was wearing a mini-bra on my head. And its hilarious because this eye mask does have... cups..
