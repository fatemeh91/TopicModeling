review/text: I purchased this cream and the Psorzema lotion. After having tried "everything on the market" for my kids' severely dry, sensitive skin and eczema, I can honestly say this line was the least-irritating. Most products cause burning/itching for my children. Of the entire time they had this cream applied (say, 20 days), only a couple days did one say that it caused them irritation. That's a big deal for us. While I don't think it moisturized any longer than other products we've tried, at least it didn't do anymore damage. Not sure if we'll buy the cream again, but definitely the lotion, which is a little more practical for kids who don't sit still very long.
