review/text: I use latex gloves for gluing, staining, painting, mudding(drywall) you get the picture. But what i hate is one size does not fit all and that you rip out the palms of the gloves out just getting them on. The Microflex gloves are great, that they get on without ripping and last without cutting the blood off to your hands from being 'one size fits all.'For Amazon: give us a choose if we wont one box or a case. Thanks
