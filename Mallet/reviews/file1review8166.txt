review/text: I feel like this actually cleans well vs some brushes that seem as if they are not cleaning thoroughly. It seems to scrub the entire surface to be cleaned without missing spots. Good concentration of bristles and good length of bristles as well as handle length. Stiff enough to do the job but flexible enough to handle varied shapes. This is a new item, so I can't comment on durability, but I have no reason to expect that it won't hold up well.
