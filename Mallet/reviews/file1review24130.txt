review/text: I began ordering the Solaray formulation when I became pregnant because I wasn't eating enough eggs. I tried a few different brands and settled on this one as the effects seem to last longer with this formulation than with others. I ran out once for a week and even my husband commented on how foggy-headed I seemed. This vitamin really helps keep the mommy-brain (scatter-brained inability to remember things or complete sentences) away!
