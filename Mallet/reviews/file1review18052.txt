review/text: After using the soft padded sleep masks from Earth Therapeutics for many years and being somewhat dissatisfied with them, I decided to give these foam masks a try. The one thing thing I disliked about the soft ones is that while they were comfortable, they pressed against my eyes too much. When I got up in the morning, my formerly long eyelashes were curled back inwards. I hated that. With these foam masks, it's made so that the mask blocks out light, but doesn't put any pressure on my eyes. The reason that I've given this mask 4 instead of 5 stars is that it can be hot sometimes b/c of the material it's made from. Overall, it's an excellent purchase for troubled sleepers like me.
