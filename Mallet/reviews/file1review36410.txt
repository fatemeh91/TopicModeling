review/text: Bought this for my husband and he hates it and says it is uncomfortable and the pad slips up and down. He tried to use it on a chair, but you'd be hard pressed to find a comfortable chair, ie recliner, which this would fit on. It's being sold in our next yard sale. Maybe someone else would like it. In my opinian it's a piece of junk.
