review/text: Each soft gel contains 500mg of NKO (Neptune Krill Oil). The fatty acid profile was designed to aid recognition by the body based on its resemblance to the human brain's own phospholipids. Each gel also contains vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid. A statement on the bottle claims they are PCP and toxic metal free.
