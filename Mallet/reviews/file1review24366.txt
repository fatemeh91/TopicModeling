review/text: If you have never used this type of product, it is to fuel longer workouts, where your body is too busy running/biking/canoeing/whatevering to use a lot of resources on digestion. You need something easy to transport, easy to consume and easy to digest. Hammer Gel does this better than any other gel I have tried and it tastes better than the others, too. I have used it for everything from bike rides of an hour or two, to one of my fuels for adventure races up to 72 hours.Hammer Gel is primarily maltodextrin, a complex carb that breaks down easily. That makes it very easy to digest, even when you are on the move. It is very low in simple sugars. A touch of electrolytes. Multiple flavors. I personally think that apple cinnamon is great. (As a teammate exclaimed when I introduced her to it: "Oh my gosh! That tastes like pie!") The tropical and espresso flavors have caffeine.Hammer Nutrition makes healthy, effective products and they support them all the way.
