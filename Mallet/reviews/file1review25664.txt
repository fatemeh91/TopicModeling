review/text: I just got this model as an 'upgrade' for my tired old ER112, which has been my trusty companion for a few years now. One of the first things I noticed with the new ER411 was that I got an occasional sting from it. As a previous poster mentioned, it felt like a burn. The unit isn't getting hot, so it's certainly the result of an occasional sensitive hair being yanked.I slowly built up some trust until the unit managed to grab up some of my nose lining (yes, it hurt and bled a lot). From now on, the ER411 is for ears only. My old ER112 has never grabbed any skin and is the tool of choice for getting in the darker recesses of this bird's beak.
