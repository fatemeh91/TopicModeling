review/text: My wife and I have been taking this every day for the last 2 weeks. I think our skin looks better. We sleep better. We are a little less moody and seem to handle stress better. It will keep you regular. It tastes awful. My wife chugs it in juice. I choose not to. I sprinkle it over a mashed banana and add some honey to the concoction. Overall, for us, this is a safe supplement that gives us enough of a positive effect that we will continue to buy it and take it. I think it beats taking a multivitamin by a long shot. It is a good mental "carrot" too. I'll think of eating something unhealthy and then I think but if I ate that my Green Vibrance wouldn't work as well and I'm paying for that. Yeah. It does that too. I'd recommend it to most people though yes it is a shotgun approach. I just think it is funny when I'm listening to the herb guy on the radio do his show and he'll start talking about something and I'll look at my wife and say hey isn't that in that stuff we are taking? More than half the time it is.
