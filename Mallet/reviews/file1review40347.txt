review/text: I've tried a few of the Gaia Herbs products and feel that they are helpful. I'm not 100% sold on this one yet. It can be hard to evaluate something which is more geared towards being 'preventative.' Still, I think the product has been helpful when it was taken at the onset of symptoms. So, cautiously, I would say, yes it is effective. I would want to try it again a couple of times before declaring for certain that it works. I do think it was helpful.
