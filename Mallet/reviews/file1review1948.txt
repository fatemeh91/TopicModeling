review/text: I used this product to make Gold, Frankencense and Myrrh soap to give as small gifts at Christmas. It worked great. Delivery was fast, product was well packaged and in perfect condition. Met and exceeded expectations. The soap was really supposed to be for display, but many people said it lathered beautifully and they loved the fragrance and wanted more!! It has an earthy, relaxing aroma, reminiscent of patchouli , although much more subtle. Not a fruity or flowery smell. The oil is primarily almond oil and Shea butter, not thick or sticky. It has a very smooth feel and is good for massage or as a moisturizer. although the scent may be a little strong for some, it could easily be cut with additional unscented massage or almond oil. It was worth it. I am happy with this purchase.
