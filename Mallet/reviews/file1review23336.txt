review/text: The scent of this shaving soap is wonderful! The bay rum smell is nicely balanced in that it is not overpowering. Really makes you enjoy using it while you are shaving, almost like aromatherapy. However, the smell does not stay with you very long once you are done shaving. This could be good or bad, depending on if you want the smell to stay with you or not. If you are looking to have the bay rum smell for awhile after you shave, then this may not be the soap for you. If you just want a nice and enjoyable bay rum smell while you are shaving, then I would recommend this.It is also not very difficult to make a lather with this soap. To load the brush, simply swirl it gently over the soap until you begin to build lather on the soap, and this is usually the key to know your brush is loaded with enough soap and ready to be moved to your face or mug to build the lather. I've found that (depending on how much water you have in your brush) you may need to add additional water while building the lather. Hard to give any definite recommendations when it comes to this as there are a lot of factors that vary, but in general I've had no problem building lather. Definitely lasts a long time, seems like you're using no soap at all! Good value! At the time of writing this review, this product is NOT available on amazon, but I would definitely look elsewhere for it. It's available on the Burt's Bees website for only $6.00.Also, it's 99.87% natural! Really feels nice. Ingredients: vegetable soap, bay oil, orange oil, lemon oil, cinnamon oil, fir needle oil, lavandin oil, cedarwood oil, patchouli oil, clove oil, sage oil, bay leaf, clove powder, cinnamon powder, aloe vera.
