review/text: The lighter seems to be loosing it's lighter fluid. When I fill the lighter with name brand zippo lighter fluid it works wonderfully the first couple of days, then a week later all the fluid has dissipated. When I fill it again, completely saturating the cotton reservoir and the same thing happen, with only 3 or 4 uses it runs out of fluid. I've tried under and over filling it and have done this a few times with no sustainable luck. The only thing I can think of is that this is a factory defect and it's leaking. BTW I have plenty of zippos that work just fine. I don't leave it in a car on a hot day. It is stored safely in my room. Guess I just got a bad one.
