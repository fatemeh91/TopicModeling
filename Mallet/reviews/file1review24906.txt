review/text: Was really excited when I came across this product from baby forums and everything. My husband and I are TTC and I went off the pill in February. Since then my period was kinda screwy the second month off the pill (1 week late) so about 1.5 months ago I decided to buy FertilAid (bought 3 months worth). Couldn't hurt, right? ha! I haven't gotten a period since I started taking this pill... Should have gotten it over 3 weeks ago. Although I've had PMS symptoms pretty much all the time which is super fun... Definately not pregnant, have had blood tests and all. I've decided to stop taking this and hope that I get my period back and am going to see if I can return the one unopened bottle for a refund. And yes of course there is the chance that the product isn't what is causing my missing period problem, but I've never missed a period in my life so I'm not taking any chances at this point.
