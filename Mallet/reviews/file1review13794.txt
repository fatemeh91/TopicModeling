review/text: This is a great tool for relaxation and pain relief.However be aware that as it heats it does get damp and it does from time to time have a 'burnt smell. The smell occurs even with just a few minutes.I tend to check and "fluff" it often while heating it and I still get the smell. The smell is not overly unpleasant and it does tend to quickly fade.Even with the smell I think it is a great product.
