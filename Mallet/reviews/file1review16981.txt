review/text: According to the Amazon description, this charger works either corded or cordless. According to the manual, the cord only works to recharge the battery. If the battery is dead, you can't use it even with the cord.Also according to the Amazon description, this has a washable design. According to the manual, you must not rinse the cutter assembly under water.But once you charge it up, and keep it clean with the enclosed brush, it does an okay job of trimming.
