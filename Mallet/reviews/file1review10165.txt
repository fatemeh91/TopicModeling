review/text: Ok so not everyone will get this but if you are looking for a great Shabbos or Yom Tov lip-gloss, this is it. Its not too thick and sticky, has a pleasant taste, its got SPF, and I am pretty sure none of the ingredients present a kashrus concern (but obviously you should find that part out from your LOR.) I use the Blistex Lip Medex everyday during the week but since its not a gloss I can't use it on the weekends. I used to use the costmetic type of roll ons on Shabbos but my lips would get SO dry. This is perfect. Totally worth it to buy the 12 pack, keep one in your Shabbos travel bag, gift them to friends, etc.I highly recommend.
