review/text: Wow. This product is marketed and the instructions are for use on athlete's foot, but obviously Jock Itch is the same type of fungal infection. I was having trouble with recurring infections, even though I kept curing them with Lotrimin. They kept coming back. But this soap works amazing. It cleared up any fungal / bacterial nonsense that was still cooking down there, and now I use it every time I shower. It's basically a male douche haha. Smells like Pine Sol, and it has peppermint oil in it so it cools the skin with an icy sensation. Also if your skin is already red and angry, you should expect this product to burn when you apply it to the affected skin. But it's not too bad as long as you're expecting it.
