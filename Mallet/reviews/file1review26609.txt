review/text: I am pretty thin so when I sit in an airplane seat there is usually an inch or two of space between the small of my back and the back of the airplane seat. This fills the space, and gives the seat a more cushioned feel altogether. For long flights, this is a must for me and makes the flight pleasant... without it I am in pain only an hour into the flight.
