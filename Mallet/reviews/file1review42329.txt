review/text: I have been using this item and the entire line of Aloe Vista products in the Rehab center where I am recovering from a broken ankle and a sprained ankle. These products are great! I have very sensitive skin and many allergies and this stuff didn't irritate my skin at all.The body wash cleanses well, yet doesn't need to be rinsed. And you feel clean when you use it. There is a barely there clean smell. Nothing at all like antiseptic.The lotion is nice and actually works. The skin protectant is great to prevent skin breakdown. The perineal cleanser works well and is easy to use.I would recommend these products for anyone who is unable to take a shower or bath. Great for nursing home residents, people recovering from accidents, surgery, etc. This is a really great product line and I'm so glad I found it. My life is so much easier right now!
