review/text: Gold standard is incrediable, great tasting, and reasonably priced, the blend of strawberries and bananas works well it was a nice change from the chocolate varities I normally bought. I usually make a shake out of it add a few more bananas to it and low fat frozen yogurt. some ppl like to mix it with water me personally I go for soy milk (silk)it comes out just like a milk shape taste great and this is one brand you dont have to hold your nose to swallow. because it desolves to well its easy to take right to the gym as long as you have a shaker. I would recommend this flavor to anyone..FYI if your not sure what flavor you want if your looking for a new one everyones taste is different try the packettes..different varities for one use only this way you can rule out the ones you dont like when your purchasing larger sizes this way you wont waste your money learned that lesson the hard way.
