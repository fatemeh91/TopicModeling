review/text: This is truly the best kid and adult hair care products out there. I used this line throughout my pregnancy and then have used the shampoo for my daughter since she was born. She loves it and better yet I love it!! My husband loves it too. I haven't used any other shampoo/gel for myself since. I am totally addicted to it. I also bought 6 of the trio for girlfriends to try as shower gifts. I can't say enough positive things about it!!
