review/text: I've been using the Oral B Triumph for a few months now. I've probably had half a dozen electric toothbrushes over the years. It does a good job. It is a little heavier and more wieldy than most, but nothing near enough to keep me from buying it again. I really like how it gives a short buzz after each 30 seconds, alerting me to move on to the next quadrant, and a longer buzz after two minutes.What I don't like is that this is by far the messiest toothbrush I've ever owned. For the first time in my life I have occasional little projectile bits of toothpaste/saliva flying out of my mouth. Not attractive. And I inevitably have to wipe a few of them out of my long dark hair when I'm done. And I've learned the hard way not to put on a dark colored shirt before I brush my teeth. Yuck. Even more annoying is that the brush and handle are hard to keep clean. Prior to this, I always just rinsed my toothbrush then gave the handle a quick swipe with a handtowel. Never had any problems. This one, even when I take extra care to wipe it, still leaves little toothpaste rings on the counter and toothpaste trails down the handle. Gross.Overall, it's a great toothbrush but quite frankly, so are most electric toothbrushes except the real cheapos. Would I pay an extra $50 again just to be reminded to switch quadrants every 30 seconds? Probably not. I'd rather have a clean sink. :-)
