review/text: I have been using thermaphore's for years because of back problems. This is the only product to buy for moiste heat and the on/off button is mandatory to avoid burns. It is not the cheapest &#34;heating pad&#34; but it is the best moiste pad and with proper care it will last quite a long time.
