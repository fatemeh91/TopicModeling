review/text: The brush I received does not look like this. The one I had before was just like it, and was much better. The old one had a larger brush, better handle with softer area to place your fingers, and overall much better. I will keep this one that has smaller brush area, with blue bristles around the edges, but am disappointed in the change from what I thought I was getting.
