review/text: I have been using Tom's products for a long time and have been especially happy with the Baking Soda Fluoride toothpaste. I started buying it on Amazon since it seems to be more and more difficult to get this product in the Supermarket "natural food" area. Vitamin Shoppe was the provider and their service is excellent. If you haven't used this product before, you may be a little surprised since there is no sweetener and as many of us have been conditioned to the awful over-sweetened typical toothpastes, it might be a bit of a shock. Conversely, I have tried other "natural" toothpastes on the market and many of those have their own problems including consistency, taste, and ability to actually clean. Tom's is by far the best, and the Baking Soda Fluoride will leave you with clean teeth and the strong peppermint is great for the breath.
