review/text: I have used Art of Shaving shave cream and now Truefitt and Hill and I have to say Truefitt wins the contest. Shave cream ultimately protects the face from the razor and to do that lubricity needs to be added between your face and the razor so burns and cuts are eliminated or minimized (depending on how wild you are when you shave). Truefitt does this extremely well! It is, price per ounce, a better buy than other competitors products and does an exceptional job. With any of the shave creams you do want to mix them in a porcelain cup prior to applying to your face. I find that Truefitt does a great job in allowing the razor to glide over my face!
