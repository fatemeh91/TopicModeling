review/text: I unpackaged it all put it together (really easy),.. threw out the box and waited to use it. When I finally used it it barely picked up anything. I really had to keep going over the same crumbs and dust bunnies to get it to sweep it. I think that the bristles don't reach the floor enough to do the job. I was really disappointed in this product but for what it would cost to return it it wasn't worth it. I also might add that if you have a really thick carpet it might work better for you, I was looking primarily for a bare tile, floor item that would pick up crumbs etc. However a sweeper is a sweeper and it should to the same job that a broom would do. My Grandmother had one many years ago and it was like magic! This one is cheaply made also. Hope that this helps.
