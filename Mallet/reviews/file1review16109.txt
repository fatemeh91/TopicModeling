review/text: This reacher may work, but I wouldn't know. It came in a 23" size instead of the 16" size I ordered and needed as it is for a ver short person and the 23" size is too long. Over a month ago, I was told it would be picked up by UPS and a new one shippped. So far, nothing. I called again 2 days ago, had to leave voice mail message. Still no response. So, I'm out my money and do not have the product I need.
