review/text: I live in an area that has REALLY hard water. It is so hard that it just eats the water softener and spits it out. It is death on pipes and all appliances that utilize water. I thought my dishwasher was dead and a new one was in order, but the repairman suggested I try THIS particular product to dissolve the hard water build up before I popped for a new one. I initially ran two of these through the dishwasher and that restored my status to "being among those with a working dishwasher". Now, I run one through on a monthly basis. One of these years, the hard water will still get the machine, but for now, it is working like new thanks to Dishwasher Magic...Oh and the repair man who told me to get it.
