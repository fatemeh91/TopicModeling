review/text: This brush is the best especially to clean out small mouthed bottles of all kinds & pitchers. To me the best part of this brush is it's flexibility to reach places that normal plain brushes can't reach like unreachable cracks, crevices & bends & curved glass. This thing rocks & I am very very happy that I purchased it & I will be telling a lot of people about it because it makes cleaning pitchers, water bottles, jars & any think a breeze to clean & I most definitely am extremely satisfied with this wonderful product & wonderful seller that packaged my product so well. Go get one you will be very happy that you did so.
