review/text: So I am not one to base a review of a protein on just taste. I gave this 4 starts because the protein powder itself is great! At a great price per serving it also packs high protein with low sugar and low fat which is excellent and what mostly everyone is looking for. I do Crossfit and Dymatize was actually recommended by my coaches (I just got off the vegan wagon!) I bought the berry blast because my brother told me the taste was very good I guess I could blame my brother instead lol)Anyway, the berry was disgusting. I tried mixing it with a banana and some other stuff to make it better and that acidic taste just wouldnt go away.I would highly recommend getting this product jsut dont get berry blast unless you are already a fan of it. Stick to the simple vanilla which tastes great!
