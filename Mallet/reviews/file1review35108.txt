review/text: These is the best vegetarian Calcium supplement I have tried and it does not upset my stomach like Calcium & Magnesium tablets and taste great so you can give to children and they would like it comes in a couple of flavors. As a Semi-veggie it is important to find and use vegetarian supplements.
