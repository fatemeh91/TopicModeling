review/text: Like many others, I absolutely adore this toothbrush. I ordered it based on a review my cousin gave on it. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth...all day. I've never used any type of electric toothbrush, but was told by my Dentist that I should, so I made the investment. I brush my teeth in quarters. I like that this one beeps as an indicator to move onto the next quarter. Who knew it should take 2 minutes to brush your teeth ? I also like the three speeds it offers. At first, I was a bit sloppy with the brush, but after two weeks, I have mastered it, and look forward to brushing. I highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone wanting a clean, smooth feel in their mouth all day..
