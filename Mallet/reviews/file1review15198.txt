review/text: I really like to eat breakfast on my way to work so I usually grab a protein bar and banana. It is hard to find a protein bar that is easy to eat in the morning because most of them contain chocolate and that's not what I like in the morning. The bars taste just like real peanut butter and has a peanut butter consistency as well. I would def recommend!
