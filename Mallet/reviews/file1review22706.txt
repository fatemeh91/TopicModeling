review/text: We use Rescue Remedy often. It takes the edge off of life's little stressors: my 15 year old's first date (what do I wear!), the 10 year olds test anxieties, when I have a big presentation or have to go to the dentist (I hate that :)). It is gentle enough that it simply stops the thoughts from spinning too quickly and we can think clearly and get things done. As a homeopath, I recommend Bachs rescue remedy to all my clients. Try it.
