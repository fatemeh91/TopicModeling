review/text: (4.27.09) Still using it. Works great all this time later. Loving the results!I did not find this product to be painful at all. I had sensitivity around the ankles, but nothing that made me want to stop using it. You have you use it a few times before you have the full effect of hair removal. But after I used it only twice, I loved the difference that I felt. Very effective! It looks and sounds very scary/intimidating, but it is really a fantastic product. I am reccommending it to all of the women in my life.
