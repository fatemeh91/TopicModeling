review/text: I have no idea if a lesser model would be as good. I love this thing. Why didn't all our friends tell us how great it was to get an electric toothbrush. I want to shout at every dentist I do marketing for - hey why didn't you tell me how great electric toothbrushes are. The 2 minute timer, the cleaner mouth, the noticable whiter teeth, all the brush heads - hello we love this thing.And if you are considering an electric toothbrush for the first time, ask yourself if keeping your teeth - your own teeth for life is worth $50-$135? And just try to get your manual toothbrush to oscilate and turn and manuever like these.
