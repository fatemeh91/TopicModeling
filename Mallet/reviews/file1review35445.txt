review/text: Finally. In three different locations, over the past four years, I have seen a dishwasher clean dishes perfectly, only to smell of fishbowl after steady use. I tried all the recommended stuff--cleaned the bottom of the appliance, checked to see for any clogged material, everything. Finally, I stumbled upon this product--saved!One of these should be enough, though the product suggests that some washers will need two run-throughs (meaning purchasing two). It has a slight scent that you'll detect when washing, similar to the lemon scent in dish-washing detergent. Best of all, it works! Since using the product, no fish smell, not even a hint. I'm sure it'll return with time, but "Dishwasher Magic" suggests monthly use to maintain the benefits. Give it a try, and good luck!
