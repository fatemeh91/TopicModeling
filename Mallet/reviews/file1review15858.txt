review/text: I did a lot of research on supplements after hearing from a friend who runs that glucosamine and chondroitin helps with joint problems. My knees were starting to really suffer after long runs. While I don't think my knees will ever be perfect, if you take these regularly it really does help. I did a lot of brand research and many of them have lower doses of the ingredients. This is one of the best brands, two caplets has the full recommended dose of MSM/chondroitin and glucosamine. Make sure you take them regularly and hydrate well! These will help cushion your joints. Good for a runner!
