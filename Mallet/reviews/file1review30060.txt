review/text: After reading the reviews I thought this tea will work for me but I was wrong. It did not work for me, I didn't experience any stomach cramps or help control my appetites. I drank 2 cups per day but it still won't work. I think it depend on individual's body. It may not work for me but it may work for you. The taste is not bad so just try it and see if it will work for you.
