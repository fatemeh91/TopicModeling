review/text: Battery has never held a charge more than a day or two. I have had it for about two months. Last week it would not hold a charge for more than a couple hours. Went to trim my beard today, after having trimmer plugged in overnight, and the trimmer died within a minute. Big PIT to have a section of beard shorter than the rest. I should have returned this to amazon within the 30 days, my fault.
