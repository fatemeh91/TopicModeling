review/text: These work, no doubt about it. When I think about the years I suffered through plantar fasciitis before I heard about these, I start hurting all over again. Actually, it was my doctor (an internist) who told me about these. He said he wears them, too. He wrote me a prescription, and my insurance bought my first pair. I've been wearing them for better than a decade, now. There is a small downside, though-- if I stop wearing them, even for just a day, the old pain comes right back. I used to buy them on Ebay, but recently found better prices on Amazon.com. Just one store carries them in my town, and charges the full shot. I've tried both the full and 3/4 sizes, and found I prefer the 3/4's with their better toe room, even if they slip around more inside shoes.
