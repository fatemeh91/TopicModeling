review/text: My Father in Law has recently lost his vision. Wanting to give him the perfect gift, I searched my local stores with no success. I spent hours on the web trying to find someone who sold talking watches that are resonably priced. As I was about to give up and send him the usual baked goods I stumbled across this watch on amazon.com. I liked the looks of it and decided to purhase it for him. I recieved the watch within days to my surprise. I am pleased with the quality and ease of use. I am sure this watch will give him years of timely enjoyment. I also recieved with the watch a catalog of other products. Now my shopping wil be much easier. It is hard to find great gifts for the blind in our sighted world. I thank Maxi Aids for making life easier for both the blind and the sighted. Happy Holidays to all.
