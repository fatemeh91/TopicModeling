review/text: Not impressed with the stiffness of the bristles, it literally feels like I am brushing my teeth with a wire brush meant for cleaning a BBQ. NO JOKE. Ick! Design is nice, if not HUGE, but I just can't get past the bristles. I bought these to replace my Brooks brand toothbrush (http://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Pearwood-Boars-Bristle-Toothbrush/dp/B000VUYQOA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330245229&sr=8-1)which was perfect and was not so stiff but I think I will be going back to them after all (I actually found them on another website for much cheaper but I cant remember the name of the site so will have to go searching for it again I guess.) My only real regret is I bought one for each in my family. Unless I want my kids to be scarred for life I will not be giving these to them or they might avoid tooth brushing forever. OY, live and learn....
