review/text: I can see why people claim this vitamin tastes good. Compared to other liquid vitamins on the market, it's a huge improvement! I like this vitamin, but they add ginseng, which is a stimulant. When I first started taking it, I didn't feel the need to have extra caffeine throughout the day, but then I couldn't get to sleep at night! My head was buzzing from the ginseng long into the night. I've been taking the red versionSource Of Life Red Mixed Berry 30 oz Liquidconsistently for a while now and I find that the over-stimulating effect of the ginseng wears off after about a week.The red version tastes better!
