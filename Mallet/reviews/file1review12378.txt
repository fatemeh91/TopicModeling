review/text: I'm amazed that not many people know about this product and it's companion Sonne's Number 9.I was introduced to these two products through a programme that used these two items as a way to clear out toxins before re-supplementing with essential fatty acids, probiotics etc. I started using number 7, felt so good after two weeks that I added number 9. They're both really easy to take and will evacuate your entire intestines along with all the toxins that you will have accumulated over the years.Even though I don't need to take these neither number 7 nor number 9 as part of my programme, I still do because it's so good for me.Recommended!
