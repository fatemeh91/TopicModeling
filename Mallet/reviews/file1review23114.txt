review/text: In order to not wake the baby I was using a Swiffer but didn't like it and then tried a dust mop after she went to bed. BUT, neither works on rugs, physically picks up crumbs, cat litter or pieces of anything. They are good for dusting though but that's not my need. Also, we live in an old bungalow where every room has a threshold (where there were previously doors) so I'd have to pick up piles of dust and cat hair in e-v-e-r-y room before proceeding to the next. Why not just vacuum then? Noise, and it's not good for quick pick up.I remembered my grandmother using one of these and picked it up a few months ago. I LOVE IT! Yes, I still vacuum and mop my floors once a week but the cats and toddler make it necessary to clean every night. This thing picks up cat litter, crumbs, fur, even small pieces of food tossed on the floor by the baby, and holds it all in a container so I can carry it from room to room. True it doesn't get in the corners but it does do a nice job with area rugs, under furniture and on the rest of the hardwood floors. Plus it's small so you can just park it in any room if you're interrupted. It's easy to dump the dirt and you don't have to bend down to do it like you do with a broom.Because there's nothing electrical here, I hose it down once in awhile to get all the dust out. It's a really convenient little tool. The toddler also loves to move it around the house so bonus for Mommy.The one thing I will say is get out duct tape as soon as you purchase it (buy black if you're picky) and tape the seams of the handle. It gets loose after awhile and pops out sometimes. Annoying at first, then I just taped it together. That's the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. The mechanism itself is great so buy it.
