review/text: I fly from the US to the UK at least once a year. For years I flew and accepted, very reluctantly, the jet lag that came with it. I seemed to do ok flying east, although my sleep pattern was certainly affected, but flying west was a nightmare. I would have a rough time for at least a week, sometimes longer.I came across 'No Jet Lag' in 2003 at REI, and as I was flying from the UK to New Zealand, I thought I would give them a go. They really worked. I was tired for a couple of days after landing in Christchurch, but then I was great. I could not believe how well I felt.Since then, every time I fly from Seattle to the UK, I use them. It really helps. I am on a regular schedule the day after arrival, and after the return flight, I feel great, and a different person. They have made a huge difference and cannot recommend them enough.I should also add that I have an issue with things that taste bad. These are pleasant and easy to chew. You chew one with each take off and every 2hrs thereafter. If you fall asleep, you just take one when you wake up.Take my word for it, they are worth it!
