review/text: I bought this at a local health herbal store to try on my then 2 1/2 year old who has suffered from motion sickness since she was 15 months old. Her m/s has gotten progressively worse as she gotten older (she's four now) and she can't even make a five minute to the closest store and back w/out gagging. She usually gets physically sick after about twenty mins. or more in the car. We tried this product to see if we could get her to a friend's house about an hour away. She made it thirty mins. before she started vomiting. We had to turn around and come home b/c she couldn't stop being sick, she even got sick while she was asleep. Her pediatrician says she has a severe problem that needs to be looked at by an ear, nose and throat specialist. I don't know if this product just didn't help her b/c of the severity of her sickness or it just doesn't work. But I need to rate it according to the fact that it didn't help my daughter. I have tried it a couple of times since then on shorter trips and she still ends up gagging, even if she doesn't actually physically vomit. So I'm thinking it doesn't work for her and I wish it did, b/c she really can't go anywhere w/out being miserable.
