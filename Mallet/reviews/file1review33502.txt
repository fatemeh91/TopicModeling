review/text: I bought the Water Flosser after my original Waterpik (model 100) died after six or seven years of usage. This model looks much better than the older models, but it's a piece of garbage. The first one I purchased died after four weeks. Figuring that I must have gotten a defective one, I sent it back and got another one. Well, would you believe the second one lasted about two and a half weeks? Both did the same thing - the motor starts sounding louder, like it's vibrating or something. Within a day or two, water is no longer coming out of the stupid thing. Waterpik will be getting a complaint letter from me. It's a shame that the company is still selling these obviously defective units. Don't waste your money.
