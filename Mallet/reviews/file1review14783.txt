review/text: i get living calcium from spirulina and wheatgrass but i needed something xtra to supplement this stuff is fantastic i mix a little in orange juice or whatever it has no taste i feel it working and neutralizing body acids and help nerves relax and sleep improve i dont consume any dairy which has calcium but the acidity it creates depletes calcium to alkalinize the body and flush out the acid so dairy is a poor choice for bone health this fills the gap and of course lots of raw greens and wheatgrass for living calcium!!
