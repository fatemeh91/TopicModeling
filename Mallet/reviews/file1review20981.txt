review/text: I tried the Jason shaving lotion because I've been looking for an effective, hypoallergenic shaving lotion that doesn't squirt out of an aerosol can. This product smells strongly of chamomile and an incense-like smell. That may be okay for a hand soap, but I don't want that smell on my face. Most shaving creams and even natural hand soaps lubricate better than this product. The lotion doesn't rinse off as easily as most shaving creams or liquid soaps. Almost any hand soap or leave-in hair-and-skin conditioner (such asPaul Mitchell Tea Tree Hair and Body Moisturizer 10.14 Oz) would be a better alternative.
