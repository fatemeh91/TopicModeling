review/text: I got this bullet with myTantus Omega Vibrator, Pink Pearl. Otherwise I wouldn't own it. It came with 3 cell batteries, which can be expensive. They are also very hard to get out of the bullet. The button does not work. Vibrations are strong, but stop at times. In order to turn it off, I have to pry out the batteries. Just simply dropping the batteries in turns it on. Save your money for a better bullet!
