review/text: Web site showed item as available. Bought for someone that needed this product. It didn't ship right away as indicated on web site and not one form of communication from this company. Poor and unacceptable service. Price is good but if they can't supply the product what good are they. Find somewhere else to buy. If you buy here you are just wasting time and energy as you will have to fight to undo the order. Their web site now says the order will ship in 7 - 10 days more so the order can't be canceled. How fair is this... order a product because it is available... never receive notice that the product won't ship... and then when checking with the Amazon sponsored vendor there is a notice that the order cannot be canceled. Poor and unprofessional garage shop operation.
