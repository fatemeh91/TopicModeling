review/text: After reading other reviews that different vendors had different versions I decided to order from Amazon and I received the 10.3 version (same as the one at wholefoods). I am really active and notice how much more I sweat during workouts while taking this product I also notice a major difference in how my skin looks. The taste is pretty grassy but I do not mind it.
