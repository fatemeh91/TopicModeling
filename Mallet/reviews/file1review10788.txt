review/text: I got this little pond thinking it would be a good way to "get my feet wet" in the water garden hobby. Quality wise the item is just fine, but in practice it just doesn't work well. The small water volume and un-insulated sides with it above ground cause the pond to get way too warm in summer, killing any plants and fish. Also, if you have pets or wildlife, forget it. Water gardens attract animals, and birds land on the edge and collapse the pond, bunnies lean on it and collapse the pond, your dog takes a drink and collapses the pond....you get the picture.You could line the edges with retaining wall stones, but at that point cost wise you may as well have bought a little rigid pond. But, if you only want it for use in your hoe, and you have no pets, it's probably a 5 star product.
