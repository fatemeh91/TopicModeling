review/text: I'm a comparison nut on shaving... I had been using the Sensor Excel since it came out- I tried the Mach3 when it came out and was disappointed, so I stuck with the Excel. I tried both the Fusion Power and the manual Fusion. I liked the manual Fusion better than the power version. I did the half-face comparison on the Excel and the Fusion for a week. It was close with occasional nicks from the Excel, never from the Fusion. The Fusion WINS! I now use only the Fusion with Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel and a shower mirror in the shower - The best combination for a shave at any price. The downside is that the Fusion blades are inexcusably pricey, but they last seven shaves or more.
