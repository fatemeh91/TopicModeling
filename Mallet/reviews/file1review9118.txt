review/text: I noticed more energy within a week of taking it. After two weeks my body was on a regular schedule(no need to go into details). After three weeks I noticed my nails growing fast and strong-including my hair. I just felt great all over. While everyone was getting sick with colds, I never got sick. I felt mentally and physically balanced. Then I ran out and was running low on funds and stopped cold turkey. I started feeling sluggish and completely out of wack! I didn't think it was because I was missing the Green vibrance. I chucked it to being stressed out at work. Once I stepped back and thought about it, it clicked. I'm now back on the band wagon and feeling fresh! I will be honest it taste like crap and it took awhile for me to figure out how to make it work. The secret is bananas! Ok, fine....you need to make a smoothie with strawberries or other berries, yogurt and at least half of a banana and its sooo yummy. Ive tried it with no banana and it was just yucky. Hope this helps some of you! Enjoy! Oh, they also sell this at Super Supplement Stores for a good price.
