review/text: This wrap fits the neck very well. It is soft. The velcro flap in front jabs my chin no matter how I move it but a small towel as a liner fixed that. I like that it can be hot and cold. Very nice. It also heats up very quickly. It's just that if youussut used it hot you'll need back up cold packs as it will take time to freeze. Also, I have been afraid to take it out of the freezer and directly microwave for fear of damaging it, so if its cold and I want hot then... My arsenal now is this combined with the Carex Bed Buddy, Body Wrap, also heated, then all the pain points are covered. I get ACE large ice packs and keep them frozen. I fold them to fit my neck/head better. I have to keep them in gallon plastic bags because they begin to leak from the seams in a short time. I'm not sure if this is a product defect (it is has happened with three of them in a row) or the folding I do. I highly recommend the elasto-gel collar and I also recommend the Carex Bed Buddy, Body Wrap too.
