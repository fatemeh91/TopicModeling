review/text: I was septical when my doctor recommended this product however when i first took it i felt instantly better & was amazed. Its so hard to give any kind of cold medicine to your kids (especially mine) they both have special needs and i had no problem giving them this medicine because it has no yucky taste to it. I now tell everyone i know how great this product is on the flu.
