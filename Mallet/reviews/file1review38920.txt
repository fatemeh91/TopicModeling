review/text: I've used single blade razors for years. NO more after using these razors. I used to get razor burned, with nicks and cuts everywhere and a great burn after putting aftershave on. These razors cut smoothly and without grabbing my skin. They don't ""clog"" up either. With a simple pass under running water, its cleaned right out. I'm very happy with these razors. They make shaving a nice, comfortable thing to do.
