review/text: I looked at the neck pillow, the back pillow and the conair roll pillow. The Back pillow was the best! You could use it for neck, back and feet! A 2 speed massage setting also helps. I tried the neck pillow but it shook too much around my ears. And the conair pillow was too hard to be comfortable. The back pillow also works well as a travel pillow.I bought 10 of these for my co-workers Christmas gifts. They all loved them, too!I went back to get more of these pillows and could not find them anywhere! I hope they come back in stock after christmas!
