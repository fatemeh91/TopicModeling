review/text: Great, has a turn-dial on the underside that widens or narrows to fit your toilet seat. I have a standard, small toilet and it fits with the dial in the narrowest position. THE BEST THING IS: you can bleach wipe this thing, throw it in a tote bag and bring it places if your child is afraid of the big, public potties. Just turn the dial on the bottom and it will fit any small or large public potty (I THINK SO, I HAVE NOT BROUGHT IT OUT YET, BUT I CAN TELL). The colored ring around the edge is non-slip.I also bought some summer infant potty covers that will stick either on top of this or under it so that your child is not gripping the PUBLIC POTTY toilet rim, but rather, the potty cover which shields it.The splash shield is good for my girl because it does not poke her or come up to high, although she is only 2 and still needs me to lift her on and off.GOOD STUFF!The downside: $25! and I even waited until the price dropped.
