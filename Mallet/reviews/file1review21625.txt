review/text: I love this bath tub! We were not happy with my son's infant bath tub, so we were anxious to move into this one! It fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs. When you're done with it, it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry. The best part is that we'll be able to deflate it and store it easily. It's also great for traveling!
