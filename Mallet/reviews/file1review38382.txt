review/text: I love this little machine, yes its hard to hold but not impossible. But what i really love about it is that it removes all the hairs and quickly. It worked great on my arms and under arms.I'm spanish so I have dark hair in my arms and it removed them completely and I can go 2 weeks with out having to go over it. On my legs I did get hair bumps but I'm going to try it couple more times to see if that stops. It didn't hurt at all on my legs, arms. stomach and underarms. But in the bikini line there was some pain but it wasn't unbearable. I'd def recommended this product. Try if it doesn't work for you return it but like I said in my title for me it exceeded all my expectations!*****UPDATE******I've been using this for a while now and in my opinion it works the best on fine hair. My arms were never shaved so I had fine hair therefore I had the best results on my arms. I've given up on legs, I get the worst hair bumps whenever I use this machine and it takes a while for my legs to look good again. Also I really hate the design I've dropped this machine several times because it just slipps off my hands. Last time I used it I dropped it and it's been slow if it dies I won't be replacing it. I dont need to use it on my arm pits and bikini line anymore because I've been getting laser treatments.Overall I'll give it a 3 * because I got great results on my arms.
