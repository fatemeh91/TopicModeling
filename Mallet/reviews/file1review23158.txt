review/text: We have two long hair dogs that shed a lot. This is a God send!!! Cleans up pet hair very quickly. Works well on loose dirt etc on carpet tends to be not as good picking up heavier objects on wood floors. Handel needs to be glued together so it won't come apart. I would NEVER want to be without one while owning pets! Great value! I am giving them as gifts to friends who have pets.
