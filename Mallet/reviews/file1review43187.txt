review/text: Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!
