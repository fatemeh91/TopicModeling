review/text: I recently started back shaving. I do have senstive skin, and years back when I shaved, I basically did it incorrectly and from there I got the unpleasant razor bumps. Simply because I wanted to save money by decreasing my trips to the barber shop and I wanted to shave my head (bald) and face, I purchased this Gillette Fusion Manual Razor, as well as other products like Bump Patrol and some traditional Gillette shaving cream. To make a long explanation short, this razor is tremendous, and it gets the job done in every way. When it comes to shaving my head completely bald and shaving my face (and under my chin), it delivers a very close shave and the results speak for themselves. Shaving every night has become a routine procedure now (thanks to advice from a close friend and Bump Patrol) and I'm fully satisfied with this Gillette Fusion Razor. Highly recommended!!!!!
