review/text: I have been on the Herbalife plan since July. I have dropped alot of weight and I feel amazing. I have been on MANY different diets throughout the years and so has my husband, and we both agree that this one makes us feel the best.I was really nervous to try this shake mix. I had no idea what it would taste like, and I am not a fan of Diet shakes at all. I was amazed at how many recipes can be used with this shake mix. Vanilla is so versitile, and this one if my favorite of all of the Herbalife shake mixes because you can make any kind of shake with it. My favorite is white recess, YUMMMM!What shocked me the most about this was the fact that my picky kids even love it as well. If you drink it plain with skim milk it will taste like crap, in my opinion, and you WILL have the diet shake flavor, but when you add things like fruits, sugar free pudding mixes, powdered peanut butter, spices, sugar free davinci's syrups, flavored yogurts, etc...you can create really healthy & AWESOME tasting shakes.Some might be skeptical wondering if drinking the shakes will be enough to keep you satisfied. Will you be hungry and therefore binge during the day? I felt like I was hungry the first couple of days because I was use to eating so much more and gorging myself at almost every meal. I use the protein powder from Herbalife and add one scoop to my shake mix because I require more protein.I found that the free fruits & veggies throughout the day along with the protein snacks really help alot as well. My favorite Herbalife products to use with this shake mix is Herbalifes Total Control which gives me lots of energy and the Celluloss which got rid of my excess fluids.I want to make it clear that I do not sell Herbalife, this is an honest review from someone who is using the products. THEY WORK!
