review/text: As I was preparing to order this little gem of wart removal, I found an old one that I had used 3-4 years ago on an aggravating wart in my hair on the back of my head that I cannot see and keeps coming back every few years. I cannot use the Dura Film without a great deal of discomfort involving double mirrors. I once had it removed by a dermatologist who told me about this stuff which is no longer to be found in the drug stores I've searched. To the rescue is Amazon and their army of Sellers. I'm thrilled to find it here and am saving it and using up the old one which has nearly done it's job. I can feel my way through my hair with my fingers, using both hands, one to hold the hair back and place a finger exactly where I need it and the other hand to rub on the magic 40% salicylic acid potion in a wax compound. Using a couple of times a day will usually do the trick in about a week. Highly recommend.
