review/text: My husband recently developed severe osteoarthritis knee pain, making it impossible to bend his knee enough to put on his sock. Suddenly, he was no longer independent, but had to rely upon me for many things, but especially to help him get dressed in the morning.While I love my husband, it isn't good for any of us to have to count on someone else, and this was a very frustrating period for us.Then, amazingly, a friend who had hip surgery introduced us to the "Sock Aid." Hers was similar to this, and she happily demonstrated. We have Prime, so the next day, our Sock Aid arrived.We chose it because it had the flexible opening on the end, which makes it easier to put the sock on - hers was a firm end. The inside makes it easy for the foot to slide, and the terrycloth exterior easily pulled up the sock. It has a firm plastic interior, which holds it open for slipping your foot into it. Even more, it says it is washable. It works so great, I might buy one for myself ;-)Anyway, Hubby is happy and independent again, and I am happy that he can be free from my "mothering."Edited -Within 2 weeks, this wonderful aid began to unravel and come apart. I am now purchasing another brand to replace it ... I have changed my stars from 5 to 1, since it should NOT come apart. (Note, it was never washed, it simply came apart from pulling socks onto the foot.Edit ... We tried theCarex Sock Aid, however the size ran small, and it didn't fit my husband's foot.Edit ... After several different tries, we finally settled onEssential Medical Supply Everyday Essentials Deluxe Hard Plastic Sock Aid. It wasn't perfect, with the handle, it kept ending up on the wrong side of the foot - so my husband cut the handle ... and now it works perfectly. :-) Finally, problem permanently solved (I hope).
