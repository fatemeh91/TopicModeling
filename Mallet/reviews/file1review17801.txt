review/text: This Lobob ESC cleaner works great. I've used it for several years now on my rigid gas permeable lenses. I use it 2x a week. The other days I use Boston Advance cleaner. It takes off other deposits that that the Boston cleaner doesn't seem to work well on. And it doesn't cause any allergic reactions in my eyes. Only gave it 4 stars since the seller sent me product that were out of the packaging. Not sure why. The ESC cleaners still had the safety seal on, so I'm using them anyway.
