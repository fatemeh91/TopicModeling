review/text: This is the best blood pressure monitor I have ever used. I took it to my doctor's office to check it against theirs, and even they were impressed. It makes the process of taking your blood pressure a breeze. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that needs to check their blood pressure regularly.As to the Amazon ordering process, once again it was simple. I ordered and they shipped before the expected ship date. They kept me informed of my order during the whole process. I order a lot of items through Amazon every year and their prices are great and the service is outstanding.I will continue to use Amazon as they have always performed well for me. Their business model stresses customer service and it shows!Great product! Great price! Great service. God, I wish the rest of my life was this easy.
