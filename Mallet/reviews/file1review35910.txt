review/text: I am a personal trainer, and my clients who are trying to lose weight are always looking for a magic pill (as am I haha). This has a GREAT balance of the Hoodia and Green Tea--taken at the right time(s) during the day can REALLY make a difference in keeping your diet on track and keeping your energy levels up. I have found that if I (or my clients) take it and then stay away from food for at least 20 minutes to an hour, then it helps to curb the appetite. If you take it and then eat within that window, though, I have heard people's reports saying that it makes them hungrier than normal. I haven't found this to be the case with me, per se, but I have heard more than a handful of clients report that if you eat too soon, you will be ravenous.So, take it, and wait before eating. I recommend that you take 1/2 of the recommended dose (2 capsules) at first--especially if you are not a coffee drinker. I'm not a fan of the jitters, and assume that it bugs others, too :) You can take a second dose in the early afternoon, but be careful about taking it too close to dinnertime because you might end up having trouble sleeping.I have paid upwards of 40 dollars for a month's supply, and am always happy to find it cheaper--and when I bought this from Amazon, they were on special so I stocked up.
