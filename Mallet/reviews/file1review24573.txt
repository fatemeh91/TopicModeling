review/text: I have a different situation. I have been in a phase of bulimia for three weeks. Desperate, nothing I could do would stop my ravenous need to binge, then purge out of fear and guilt. I thought if a pill could simply curb my cravings, maybe I could use the crutch to change. Lo and behold, the first day on this was my first day of no bulimic behavior. In three days, 3 pounds back to my normal wt (which isn't high--but was going up). I haven't been hyper, no insomnia, just some shakes the first few minutes. I purchased a high end bottle on line, and it is completely below the effectiveness of what I picked up at my Walgreens. I feel human again, and in control of how I eat, my health and body.
