review/text: My chiropractor advised me to apply heat on my tense neck and shoulders, but until now the only heat that worked came from a hot shower.Since I bought this product I use it first thing in the morning while preparing lunch boxes (it is amazing how it stays perfectly in place when walking or bending) and at night while watching a TV program. I noticed a big difference after a few days. Also I put it sideways when I am sitting down since my problem is mainly on my left shoulder and even backwards to release the tension from the front muscles of my neck.
