review/text: It arrived at a decent time and the package was small. Comes with all the parts to repair a glass. I had two missing screws and the screws fits really well. The only complains I have is that the nose pad with the hole is a little long but still fits well and when the package arrived the screws were out of the holes and all over the place, it was hard to tell which was paired with which.
