review/text: So let's start with why I purchased this little baby. I'd had a generic version for approximately 5 years that recently died on me out of nowhere. I had never heard of Doc Johnson but when I read that this was the &#34;original&#34; pocket rocket I simply HAD to purchase it. I thought mine was pretty bombtastic and it lasted a hell of a long time so I knew that this guy would seriously outrank any achievements it made in its short life span.Uhm... this is probably the best vibrator I have ever experienced. I dunno if it's the battery that comes in it or just the sheer awesome radiating out of its little shell, but it's one powerful beast. I don't even have time to catch a breath after an explosive moment because another one is right behind it. I was hesitant about the price at first because I had bought my other one for around $5, but this product is well worth the money put into it. I'm sure I'll get at least ten years out of this bad boy, and that's with consistent use.The ONLY reason I didn't rate this product a 5 is because it's not as quiet as it claims to be. This thing could easily wake up your significant other lying next to you. Now, I'm not one to choose a toy over the real thing but when I have some me time with Doc here, that's exactly what I want. ME time. So quiet is a highly appreciated feature. For now however, I'll settle with sneaking into the living room to get my rocks off. This thing is fantastic, period.
