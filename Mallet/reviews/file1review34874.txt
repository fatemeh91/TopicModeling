review/text: This product did increase my lido...I could feel pulsation in that area...it was great!! I took two at a time twice a day. That seemed to work best for me. I haven't had any side effects since I started taking this about a week ago. It does make sex more enjoyable my husband loves the way it makes me feel..although he has no clue that, that's the reason I'm taking it,,,he just thinks I'm horny..lol and he LOVES that. I heard this is great for men too...maybe I should test it on my husband!!!
