review/text: I had horrible stomach cramps and constipation for about a week. I suspected the balance of 'flora and fauna' in my GI tract was off so I went to my local health food store looking for something. After one pill the stomach cramps were gone. Constipation disappeared after the second pill. This is great stuff for stomach problems.
