review/text: I have been using the same Sonicare Elite toothbrush for the last 6 years. I loved it! However, in the last few months I have noticed that my teeth haven't felt as clean and my last dentist cleaning took a little longer. My dentist recommended the Oral B Triumph. I was ready for a change and went ahead and purchased one. So here is my comparison between the two. The Triumph feels much larger in the mouth, the neck of the actual brush is wider. The handle is also much larger and a little uncomfortable to hold in comparison to the Elite. However, I really like the Triumph brush head because I feel like I have more control and can get in tighter places with it- I feel like the backs of my front teeth are cleaner then they ever have been. The Triumph is a lot louder then the Elite. I do feel like the Triumph is a little more "rough and tough" and does a better job at cleaning. They are both good products but I am happy with my Triumph purchase and I recommend it to others.
