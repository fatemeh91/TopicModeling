review/text: My husband is a retired massage therapist. He suggested we purchase the Jeanie Rub because he thought it would be great! However, it is not. Not only is the unit extremely loud, but it's heavy and uncomfortable. Basically, it doesn't do much. You can barely feel anything and the attachment package does not help. It's a pain to unscrew the screws for the attachments, also. For the price, I expected something I could use with certain points. This thing vibrates so much, it hurts my hands to hold it.
