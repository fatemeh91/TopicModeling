review/text: I liked that almost 170 people wrote something about these prenatal vitamins. It is always good to get different points of view.This is my first pregnancy and I want everything to go well. So, I did my homework trying to make the best decision on which prenatal vitamins to choose...so many out there! I read the pros and cons regarding Rainbow Light and decided to try them for myself. My decision was based on the amount of good reviews, the fact that they were vegan and food based. I took them at night with dinner and wasn't nauseated, no heartburn, but within an hour I did have a terrible stomach ache with terrible gas!!!! I felt sorry for my husband. My apologies for being so graphic but I think women should know that this might be a potential side effect for them as well. I decided to give them another day thinking I needed to get used to the pills or perhaps I had eaten something bad. Same thing the second time around. Therefore, I have stopped taking them and am back to doing my homework. Remember....every woman is different. These pills may work for some and be a nightmare for others. It's all about trial and error....unfortunately! For now, I am trying One-a-day prenatals because it meets all recommended doses of vitamins and minerals. So far, so good!
