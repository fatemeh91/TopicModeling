review/text: THESE GLOVES ARE GREAT, I'VE BEEN BUYING THEM FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS NOW AND WILL CONTINUE BUYING THEM AS LONG AS THEY EXIST, ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT IS THAT, IF YOU TAKE THE GLOVES OFF AND WANT TO PUT THE NEW ONES ON THEY WILL NOT MAKE IT EASY ON YOU. OTHER THAN THAT, THEY ARE GREAT.THANKS DIAMOND GRIP.
