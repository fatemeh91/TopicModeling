review/text: I have used other ON protein products with success - I don't care for the flavor of artificial sweeteners, but have learned to deal with it. I have tried this product only 6 times since purchasing 6 months ago. I didn't want to believe that it was causing stomach upset, but today's use has confirmed that it is this product and not a cold or some other food. Not good when you use right before going to the gym. I did some research and found that a number of people have stomach upset with this product - it could be that it is just spoiled, but there is no way to really tell. Recommend buying a small size if you have not used before. I am stuck with 5lbs of whey.
