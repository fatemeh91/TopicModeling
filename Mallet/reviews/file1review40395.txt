review/text: Boy, do these work! I had a horrific sore throat and these just did the job in no time flat. The taste great and last for quite some time. If you're miserable with the flu or a cold, be sure to have these on hand. I couldn't have survived without them for awhile! A great new product and I'm glad to have found them. They do what they say and they really work!
