review/text: Holy Sh--! That's all I gotta say. It's as if I had nothing on. I usually put a condom on just before I about to "finish", but since I have tried these, I use them from beginning to end. You don't have to get a 100 count, you can get the least amount to try for yourself. It wasn't until I read a few reviews of this condom and the fact that it's been considered #1 for quite some time now that I ordered so many. But I am grateful I did, and the were WAY cheaper then buying the $9.99 12 pack of Lifestyle SKYN that I formerly used. Try a few and see for yourself, you'll swear it's not there.Oh and by the way, this is my wife's account that I use to order from as well. So, don't think this review is coming from a female. That would be really weird!
