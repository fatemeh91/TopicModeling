review/text: I have tried to drink the recommended serving (2T.) in a large glass of water, oh boy, no go! I have gone to drinking 1 T in a glass of water with a serving of chocolate protein powder, much more palatable. I try to eat well but am very busy and on the days that I just don't find time to get my greens in, this is a great alternative.
