review/text: I LOVE this stuff!!!!! I did not buy on here, got it from Walmart....much cheaper. I used it for my daughter's cloth diapers. We have EXTREMELY hard water and I've used everything under the sun: borax, oxiclean, Rockin green, washing soda, I've even stripped her diapers almost every wash. The whole time I thought it was the detergent or the way I'm washing them and was literally just about to give up on the cloth diapers. I tried it last night and for the first time in 7 months, her diapers actually smell clean!!!!! I could not believe how good this stuff cleaned up my water so it could clean up her diapers. I really am impressed, and so impressed, I will be using this for all our laundry. Calgon, take me away!!!
