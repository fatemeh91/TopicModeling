review/text: I've been using this brand of liquid stevia for a couple years, and it is by far my favorite. I have not used it in baking, but use it in tea, coffee, smoothies, and even soup when a little sweetening is needed. It tastes good and is not detrimental to my health like artificial sweeteners.
