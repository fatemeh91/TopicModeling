review/text: I love to soak my feet at the end of a long day of walking. I owned a Homedic's foot bath previously, which was nice but the water became unpleasantly cool in a few minutes if I turned it on. Turning on the heat function only got lukewarm water. And even if I just used it as a big bowl, the water still cooled down much too fast. The Brookstone foot bath solved the problem!While many foot baths claim to have a heat function, the Brookstone foot bath is the only one I've found that truly does. The heat function keeps the water like a little sauna, complete with water jets. The jets and bubbles run on separate controls, so you don't have to have them on at the same time, and you can control the air pressure. The jets are re-positionable. There are massage wheels on the bottom that feel great on your feet! Water can be drained from a spigot in the back, so you don't have to flip the whole thing over to empty it. Overall, a fantastic product! Homedics should learn from Brookstone.The only con--and it's not much of one--is that this thing is almost twice the size of your average foot bath. This has to do with the way it heats the water: like a hot tub, it pulls water through vents, heats it beneath the pool, then sends the hot water back up. The constant circulation of water is one of the things I like about this model, but it does make for a larger device. That said, I have no trouble carrying it even when it's full of water.Again, I think this is a great product! I liked it so much that I brought it over the last time I gave my mom a pedicure, and I didn't think she was ever going to take her feet out! If you really enjoy foot baths, this thing is worth the investment! Get a 3yr warranty with SquareTrade (mine was $15), and have reliable coverage against accidents and mechanical failure, too.End all: I absolutely recommend the Brookstone Foot Bath.
