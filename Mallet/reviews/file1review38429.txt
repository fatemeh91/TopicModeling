review/text: This is by far the best method of body hair-removal I've found (I've tried shaving, waxing, depilitory creams, etc.) It has the advantages of things like Nads--you get a smooth, non-prickly feel for days, but much faster and less messy. Also, you only need a little bit of hair length for it to work (In fact, the shorter the hair, the better). If you haven't shaved an area recently, do a quick shave over it first to minimize the pain. Also, do NOT try to use it on your face (serious ingrown hairs).
