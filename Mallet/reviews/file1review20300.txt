review/text: I'm cloth diapering my newborn, so my sister-in-law bought the baby some of these. When I opened the pack, i said to myself, "what the heck is this thin thing?" Well, they're never my first choice as far as diapering, but when all the other ones are dirty, i just use one as a diaper and fold up on as an absorbent pad- works just fine. Sometimes I use them as doublers with my prefolds as well. Other than not being able to use them by themselves, they're fine.
