review/text: I hate to buck the prevailing tide; however, I must be honest. This is NOT one of Method's great products: it just doesn't clean without several "go-overs" ...and it didn't matter what kind of a cloth or paper I used. I have several glass-topped tables in my home and it is now taking me double the time--and rubbing effort--to clean them. I have used paper towels, micro-cloths (which should not be used with anything but water), and turkish towels or bar cloths. I have exhausted myself "polishing" my tables, mirrors and windows, only to have to go over them yet again. Don't even think about using it on car windows; it is not a pretty sight! I do love the fragrance; it just isn't enough to compensate for the lack of cleaning power. I have canceled my product subscription and I am currently handing out the remaining bottles to friends and family with the warning that it doesn't clean well, but it smells great!Nearly forgot to mention the sprayer. My first bottle of window cleaner is now sporting an old Windex sprayer since the one Method uses gave out when the bottle was 1/3 gone. Oh..., and the second bottle I started on before finding my old bottle of Windex--same sprayer problem.P.S. I do love some of the other Method products; however, not this one.
