review/text: I'm a first time mother, and no one told me about using cloth diapers for just about everything (apparently all mothers know this). My friend bought me a pack for my shower, and I now use them for burp cloths, lap pads, covering my son when changing him (another mother's secret--to prevent being urinated on), etc. Apparently they make great dust rags when baby grows up!!
