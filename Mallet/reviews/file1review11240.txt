review/text: This has been prescribed to us, after years of constipation. The gastro dr finally realized that my son is having muscle confusion problems. He still takes two caps of miralax a day and then one dropper of this. He is finally regular!!! Yay!I think this stuff smells terrible and it stains my sons teeth and tongue... Yuk... But he loves it. He says it tastes like chocolate rootbeer. Lol... He looks forward to it every day..
