review/text: Tonight I found this product under my sink, it was left by the previous house owners. We never needed a plunger so I opted to use this product on a clogged sink. I found myself quickly looking over the directions for a double sink, passed up the fact that you should hold the stop on the opposite sink you are using plumb away. I also didn't care to read the fact that you should have the whole plastic lid submerged... I gave it a good push and KABOOM!!! All the crap from the drain was now in my face, the blinds, the cupboards, the floor, everywhere in a 10 foot radius. I haven't laughed that hard in years!! What can't say... This stuff really really works.
