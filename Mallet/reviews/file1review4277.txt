review/text: I recently purchased the gillette fusion power cartriages on amazon although they were sent by a private source to my home. These blades were not or near store bought quality,after trying several blades i gave up it was like shaving with sandpaper. the product was pachaged properly, and sealed and did not appear to be knockoffs, i dont know what the problem was but they were not the same as sore bought.I have e-mailed procter and gamble and they acknowleged my e-mail and will get back to me
