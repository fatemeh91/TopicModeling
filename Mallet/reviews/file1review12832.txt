review/text: My husband loves this mask. He always used to have the rice bags that heated in the microwave, which is great, except you cant lay on your side and not have them fall off. I was so happy to find this mask. He uses heat for head/eye strain, while I use it cold. I love that we can both use this mask. It fits great on him and the adjustable head strap sealed the deal. I didnt have to buy two different sizes for us both to enjoy its benefits. He also stated how well it works for him as a comfortable eye mask just to keep out light. My only complaint is that I think my face is just a little too small for the contour of the mask. Some days I just cant find that sweet spot. Otherwise, this is a great mask and we love it.
