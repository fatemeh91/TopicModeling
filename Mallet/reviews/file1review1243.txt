review/text: I bought this stuff with hesitation but the price was so good I figured it was worth a try. I did check reviews on Amazon before I used it and after reading mostly positive I decided to go for it. I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. I made sure my face was clean of all lotions, etc and was conservative w/ the placement for the first try - and wow - it worked nicely. Just follow the directions and it should work for you. Needless to say the shapers they have may not match your eyebrow shape exactly so you might have to shape the strips yourself a bit w/ scissors or just be careful in your placement on the brow.
