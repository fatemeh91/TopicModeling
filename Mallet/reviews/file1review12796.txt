review/text: This is my first time having to wear compression stockings. I purchased them to wear after sclerotherapy. Although they are somewhat difficult to get on at first, they are very comfortable and soft once they're on. I have very sensitive skin and they weren't itchy or irritating. My only complaint is that they stretched out quite a bit, and did not shrink back after washing. I actually had to purchase a smaller size because they were falling down (which pulled down my pants and bunched at the knee), although I fell within the measurements of the medium and large when I measured. Overall I did find them to be very comfortable when they were fitting properly.
