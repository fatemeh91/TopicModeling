review/text: The Hem-629 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor is as good as advertised. I'm very happy with this purchase. The monitor is fast, accurate,and easy to use. It comes with a portable carrying case for protection, easy storage, and transportation. It can store 60 readings to memory with time and date stamp. It also provides an average. One negetative thing is that I don't think it can separtely record the results for more than one.
