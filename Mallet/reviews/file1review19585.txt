review/text: This seat is not for a boy who is 1st learning to potty by sitting. In the picture it looks as though the built in deflector is fairly large, though it is not, it does not do it's job. I love the contour of the seat. But if I pay $29.99 for a potty seat I don't want to clean the bathroom everytime after he goes potty-what a mess. I have found a potty that I love and that works, it is much cheaper as well. I'm wandering if this potty might be worth holding onto until my son is handling more than one buisness in the potty, (if you know what I mean). Until then this is not the potty for me, if I had a girl maybe. But I have a boy, so please think about this before you buy. I did read one review somewhere that also had this complaint, I wish I who have listened. They need to make the deflector better or make one for boys and one for girls.
