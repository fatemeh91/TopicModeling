review/text: I work 3rd shift and being a morning person, I really struggle with sleeping during the day. I bought this after hearing others say how great it works. While I do believe it helps me fall asleep, it does not help me stay asleep. I still wake up after just a few hours. Though, unlike some sleep aids, it does not leave me feeling groggy.
