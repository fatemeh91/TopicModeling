review/text: This product is a great idea in theory, and it was just what I needed. But the construction is very very poor. The shelves don't stay horizontal once you start putting items. I put a pack of wipes in the top middle, a small purell on the top left and a Desitin on the top right, and the thing is already coming apart. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
