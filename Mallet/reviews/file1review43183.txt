review/text: Read: "perFUME". Perfumey, baby-powdery, cloying, and the smell hangs on the the walls in my house like molasses (even after my bathroom fan has run for 6 or more hours). Nothing like ylang-ylang. I don't particularly like ylang-ylang so I was a bit hesitant to try it, but I was willing for 2 reasons: 1) I heard it worked well; 2) I have very much liked other Method scents (despite their strength) when I smelled their products in other people's houses. This non-ylang-ylang smell however is absolutely horrendous. I will never buy this again. What a shame, since it does work well.I can't understand for the life of me why Method would continue to make this product in this scent. There are so many other excellent "natural" (in quotes because this is a partially synthetic fragrance) fragrances that would appeal to more people, and I'm hard pressed to understand how any one of them would affect this product's ability to work. (Though my hunch is that the heavy fragrance is meant to cover any trace of chemically smell.) Method could easily capture a much larger audience with this product if it didn't send half of buyers sprinting away from the fragrance.I really can't tolerate chemically smells; but I tried the Martha Stewart bathroom cleaner (label indicates it can be used as a shower cleaner if rinsed off), which reeks of citric acid and makes me very nauseous; but I gotta say that I'd take the citric acid smell & the extra work of rinsing over the "ylang-ylang" anytime. (I think the Martha Stewart product works better too.)I'm off to try to the Mrs. Meyer's version, as well as my own concoction.
