review/text: I had been looking through all of the Rx prenatals my Dr. had recommended and couldn't find a vegan one. Someone recommended I look into Rainbow Light and I am SO glad that I did! They go down easily with a glass of water and leave no aftertaste. They don't bother my stomach at all, which is amazing because I have an extremely delicate constitution. They also give me a huge energy boost! I have more energy than I know what to do with! I am not pregnant yet so I can't speak for how they affect me in pregnancy, but for right now I feel amazing!
