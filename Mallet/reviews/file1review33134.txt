review/text: I love these supplements...they work! But I will warn you to be aware of whether you purchase capsules or tablets. I started with the tablets. These are pretty stinky, but I found them to be easy to swallow and digest. The smell (which is heavy on the garlic) is intense, but didn't bother me once I took them.However, I purchased the capsules by accident. I figured it would be no big difference. But I ended up returning the capsules. I immediately started burping up garlic and smelling that smell...and it tasted bad too. They also made me nauseous and repeated on me ALL DAY. I could feel them in my stomach. I just returned them after trying to take them for the past three weeks. I started to dread taking them.Get the tablets!
