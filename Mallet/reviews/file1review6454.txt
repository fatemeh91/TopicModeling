review/text: I've been having pains in my upper back for over a year now, primarily due to the frequent typing/sedentary activities that engage in throughout the day. I've tried all sorts of therapies and medications, all with very limited success. Massaging is definitely one of the best things that help with my pain, but it is not always easy to find someone to give you a massage, especially the kind that involves very specific trigger points. When my doctor first introduced me to TheraCane, I was totally sold on the idea. This was exactly the kind of tool that I was looking for. I looked around for the best combination of features/price, and decided to try out Body Back Buddy. It seemed to be even more functional than TheraCane, and even though I don't necessarily need all the options right now I think it is a worthwhile investment down the road.The feature of the Body Back Buddy that I like the most are the dual "hooks," each with its own spacing and a set of knobs of various shapes and sizes. I use the blunt knob for the more diffuse massaging, and the pointed one of the precise application of pressure. I use this massaging tool many times throughout the day, every time I feel the painful tension in my back. So far it has lived to its promise, and I am extremely satisfied with it.Body Back Buddy is sturdy and well built. At first it seemed too light and I was wondering if it could withstand various degrees of pressure, but it turned out to be more than fine. Its lightweight build also makes it ideal for traveling. Overall, a very well designed and useful product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get an easy and effective self-massaging tool.
