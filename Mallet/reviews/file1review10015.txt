review/text: I just got this thing and I'm happy with it in general, but there is a reference to an "IMPROVE YOUR MEASURING SKILLS" guide that is not included. It is impossible to get reliable results with this tool without a diagram of where to get the measurements. Just saying chest, abdomen, thigh is ridiculously unclear.It is also somewhat difficult to learn how to pinch fat only. The first few times you are likely to get crazy results.I was able to find this manual page on the internet:http://www.accufitness.com/products/fattrack_pro_manual2.htmlIt cleared up most of my issues.--brian
