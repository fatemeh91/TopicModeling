review/text: Having never cut a single hair my entire life, I was a bit skeptical of actually giving my 2-year old son a haircut. But I watched the DVD (very helpful) and then went to work. It was really easy, and the results look pretty darn good, despite the fact that I cut his hair WHILE HE WAS ASLEEP!The actual cutter was a lot quieter than I thought it would be. It glided easily thru the hair, with no tugging or pulling. The company has been around for quite some time, so I feel confident that these clippers will also be around for many years to come. Lots of cutting attachments for different lengths, which is really a bonus.One downfall....the "cape" is nothing more than a garbage bag with ties. Totally worthless. Go to your local Sally Beauty Supply and get a real cape for a couple of bucks.
