review/text: I was surprised at the quick delivery from Florida to Washington state. I was expecting a bottle of capsules, but instead the 60 capsules were packaged in a zip type bag with a label, heat sealed for shipment. I might have done more research about how many capsules for my money, as for the money I expected 100 capsules, but quantity was not listed in the description. The quality of the root seems to be fine.
