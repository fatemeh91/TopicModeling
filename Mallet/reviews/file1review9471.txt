review/text: I'm convinced now that Truefitt & Hill is one of the best luxury shaving creams out there. I've tried most of the top English shaving creams and all of The Art of Shaving, but, Truefitt's selection as a whole is a little more "richer" in regards to ingredients. This cream whips up very thick into a meringue like substance with a silver tip badger hair brush and some hot water. I shave after a nice hot shower. The only complaint I have is you might need to use Truefitt's Ultimate Comfort pre-shave oil before you apply this cream as it's not as moisturizing as their other scents (i.e. Rose, West Indian Limes, etc.).It's expensive shaving cream, yes - but, even if you shave daily this tub will last at least six months or longer.If you are still on the fence and can't decide, I strongly advise you go directly to Truefitt's website and order a sample pack. You'll love it!
