review/text: I decided to try these prenatals after having difficulty keeping down other OTC brands. I also liked the fact that they are all natural with no nasty added chemicals that neither I nor my growing baby need. They are gentle on your stomach, I've never had a problem taking them and would highly recommend them to any pregnant or soon to be pregnant woman wanting a natural and gentle alternative to other brands.
