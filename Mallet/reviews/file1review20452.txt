review/text: Sitting for over 3 hours in the car or plane became very, very uncomfortable. I have no health issues that would cause this, but simply wanted a more comfortable ride. This works like a charm. I am only 5'4" and it elevates me a noticable amount; so if you are tall, beware of this issue. It slides into the outer section of my large suitcase, so I just pull it out when checking my luggage and slide it back in at my destination. Otherwise, I just keep it in the car. It does not cause any problems getting in or out of the car.
