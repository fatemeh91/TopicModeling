review/text: Nivea's Shave Balm is great for after shaving, and it also lasts a long time too. I have been impressed with how far it goes and how well it performs.I have used it to help shaving the head, and it has been excellent to aid in touching up the shave for an extra close shave there. It may sound weird, but it works well as a touch-up shaving cream. It really allows the razor to get close when you run against the hair on the head.Beyond that, the product is excellent, and leaves a very fresh and invigorating feeling on the skin. Totally cool stuff from Nivea here.
