review/text: I purchased this product after trying it out at my sister's house. It has a tart flavor with a definite iron-like aftertaste, but I actually like it straight from the bottle. My kids, however, hold their noses when drinking it and think it's disgusting. The quantity of nutiritional benefits appear to be excellent and the product is decently priced. I wish it came in a larger bottle or a 2-pack, though. Since my kids and I both take it daily, a single bottle goes fast. I am hoping to supplement my 9-year old's diet due to her aversion to veggies. So far, so good...
