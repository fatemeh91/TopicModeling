review/text: After my Norelco beard/mustache trimmer recently died on me (after about two years), I of course needed a new one. The dead model wasn't fantastic, but it got the job done and it did have the added benefit of teaching me what I do and don't want in a trimmer. Browsing through the many brands and models available on Amazon, I was able to settle on this Remington unit. I didn't want a combo beard trimmer and nose hair trimmer...this one is a purpose-built beard groomer. I didn't want one that had a recharging cradle that gets constantly steamed up in the bathroom when the shower runs (that leads to corrosion on the charging leads)...this one just has a plug in charger. I didn't want a trimmer with 10 different detachable guides that you constantly have to change with the type of trimming you're doing...this one has one guide with selectable lengths. I DID want a trimmer that has the potential to last a very long time so I won't have to go through this whole process again any time soon, and the reviews on this Remington suggest it'll do just that. Used it twice so far, and find myself a very satisfied customer.
