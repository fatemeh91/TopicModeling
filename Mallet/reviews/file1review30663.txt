review/text: The Merkur classic 178 is my first safety razor. My father turned me onto double edged razor shaving, and once again, the old man proves wise. I read the reviews before ordering this model, and the only negative ones that I read had to do with it's length. Granted, it is short, but the length provides accuracy I believe. The weight of this instrument is great in the hand, and the build is impeccable. The German's really know how to craft a piece of steel, and I doubt it will ever wear out. Upon my first shave with this razor I was a little skeptical that I would be able to get a "barber" style shave with it, being an absolute novice with the handling of it. For the most part, I just let it slide, with it's own weight on my face and the rest is history. I went with the grain of the whiskers first, reapplied some shaving soap, with a boar brush, and then against the grain for the second pass. Wow, how close and clean this razor performs!! It takes almost no effort at all to be honest. It does take a little more time though. I will never go back to the disposable, plastic monstrosities that are on the market today. The Merkur products are very cost effective, long lasting, and well made, plus the razor blades costs about 1.7 cents a piece. Much cheaper than the cartridge type. Buy this razor, you will thank yourself....
