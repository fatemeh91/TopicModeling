review/text: I am a pediatric physical therapist who suffered whiplash when rear-ended in a car accident. This sounded like a great product. Ordered it and was disappointed. My frozen bag of peas does a better job. It doesn't get cold enough to numb the back of my neck. Will be paying to send this back but it's a waste of money.
