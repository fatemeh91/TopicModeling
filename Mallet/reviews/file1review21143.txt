review/text: I returned this heating pad because I was very unhappy with its performance. However, I would like to say upfront that MedexSupply was a pleasure to deal with - they were efficient and very helpful in dealing with my concerrns. First of all, this is not a muff - it is a flat heating pad with velcro straps that can be used to wrap the pad around hands (or whatever). I see that it is now described on Amazon as a pad, but I believe it was described as a muff when I made the purchase. Although I was surprised it was not a hand muff per se, that was a fairly minor matter to me. The reason I returned this heating pad is that there is no temperature setting on the control - the options are On, Pause and Off! The pad gets very hot quickly - the accompanying booklet says it will do this, so that was not unexpected. Once it is hot enough (and it rapidly gets quite hot), you have to take your hand out of the muff you've made with the pad and push the pause button on the control. Then, once it has cooled down too much, you have to again take a hand out to push the button to restart the heating cycle. The constant need to manually adjust the temperature made the experience frantic rather than soothing. MedexSupply did refund the purchase price of $45.87, but they did not cover the $8.75 I had paid for shipping (again, a minor issue, but....).
