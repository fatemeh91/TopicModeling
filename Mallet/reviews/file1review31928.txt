review/text: Yes, it does look and taste pretty disgusting. BUT you aren't drinking it for taste and if you're using this you've probably tried some pretty weird things before. I like it for how it makes me feel and am already seeing some benefits in my digestive system. I mix mine with a small amount of juice (6-8oz) and chugged it all down at once. Apple juice is good but my new favorite is to mix it with an all natural raspberry lemonade. I tried it with water and had to pour it out. Definitely try it with the juice!
