review/text: I did not like to floss because using fingers or tooth pick like floss was yucky and cumbersome. My boyfriend who flosses every night using a holder told me once that it was much easier and effective. I did not believe him. Recently I broke his holders by accident and wanted to replace them. So I odered one for myself too. My hygenist was impressed when I saw her last week.
