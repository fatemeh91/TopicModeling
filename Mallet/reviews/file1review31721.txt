review/text: My daughter has left the roost and like most Dads I worry about her safety. After reading the glowing review from Don Rearic.com and the info from Doug Ritters Equipped to Survive website, I bought this to include in the survival kit I've made for her car. Added a small folding blade knife, a surplus ECW sleeping bag, 3 days worth of emergency water packets and survival rations, an emergency 120 hour candle/matches and a small bucket of kitty litter. I feel much better knowing she has the basics in case she gets stranded in her car here in North Dakota
