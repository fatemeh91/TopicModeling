review/text: I have so much pain & bloating without Benefiber--I have tried the "Equate" brand which causes me to feel even more bloated and worse than before I took it!However, I started taking Benefiber and as soon as I started feeling like normal again, (I havn't felt normal in years!)I cannot find this anywhere! If you do happen to find it, they want a ridiculous price for it (because the Vendor knows there is a shortage of it)Honestly, who on earth could pay $100 for a 16.7oz container of it!!!I hope the manufacturer gets started and works double shifts to process this stuff--or, unfortunately I will have to go back to feeling pressure, pain & bloating on a regular basis :( which SUX!!!
