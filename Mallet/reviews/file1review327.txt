review/text: I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working. Thought this one was affordable. Very Very cheaply made and not much power. Smells very bad, so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one. Invest in one a little nicer.
