review/text: Over the last 15 years I have tried a ton of natural based deodorants, most have had little to no effect. I found this brand at Target and it was inexpensive so I figured "Why not". This is truly the most effective natural product I've used by far. Most products just try to cover the odor, this eliminates it on a chemical level using the lichen extract. It actually neutralizes the odor. I have even had people ask me what fragrance am I wearing when I don't even wear cologne. When I could no longer find this brand locally I was very happy to find it online and bought a six month supply. For anyone who has tried other brands and been disappointed, give this a go.
