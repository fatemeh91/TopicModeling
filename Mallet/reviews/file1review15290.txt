review/text: I usually don't buy chocolate-flavored protein bars because 1) I tend to eat them for breakfast, so I prefer more fruit-type flavors, and 2) I find that the chocolate bars tend to be more artificial tasting. However, I saw one of these bars on sale, and because I absolutely love mocha, I decided to give it a try.Taste-wise, this bar is excellent. It is rich, chocolate-y, and has a very good, distinct mocha flavor too. It was pleasantly chewy without having the overly nougat-like consistency that some protein bars have. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this bar, and from a flavor perspective, I would not hesitate to buy it again.The reason I gave this bar 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the nutritional profile. At 200 calories, it is about what you would expect from a protein bar; I was fine with that. But both the fat content (7 grams, including 3.5 grams saturated) and the sugar content (17 grams, or over 3 teaspoons) were a little on the high side to me. Some bars include fiber; this one has &lt;1 gram. It does have 15 grams of protein, which was a big plus.So, in the end, I probably will buy this bar again, but I will limit myself to using it occasionally rather than as a more regular, healthy part of my diet.
