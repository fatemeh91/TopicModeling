review/text: When my Emjoi Gently Gold Caress broke (after years of use - I whole-heartedly give it five stars), I bought this, thinking more expensive means better. This was unfortunately a bad assumption and I really wish I'd just bought another Gold Caress.The Optima doesn't fit well in my hand and the cord often comes out while I'm using it on my legs since my hand is brushing up against the spot where the cord is attached to the epilator (if you're going to make a non-cordless epilator, make the cord permanently attached!!!). Also, because it's a bit uncomfortable to hold, I am not always able to hold the skin of my underarm taut and the skin gets pinched (one time it drew blood).In the end, I do still use it and it is better than the Braun I bought in between the two, but I wish I had the Gold Caress instead. It fit well in my hand and because it is cordless I could use it without an outlet nearby.
