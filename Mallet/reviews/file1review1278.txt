review/text: I bought this originally for my mom and she loves it! It is easy to use, large, and the two sides help smoothing the skin even more! it's best to use after soaking your feet a little so the skin is not too tough. The file is very sharp so you don't need a lot of effort to get those extra skin off! Great product!
