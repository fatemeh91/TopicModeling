review/text: We love using these to bathe our two month old son but they're really expensive!!! We found something similar at Babies R Us (store brand) and they were about $3 per box. They're not as soft as these, but they're still soft and work great. Unfortunately we will not be buying again unless the price comes down. Awesome product, though.
