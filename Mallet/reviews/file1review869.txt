review/text: I turned 50 in February! I didn't know that some months later I would be bombarded with hot flashes. The hot flashes have made my life miserable and almost unbearable. Taking hormones are not an option for me; so I got on line to see what I could possibly take that was natural, that might help. While visiting Amazon site, I came across the NOW FOODS SUPER PRIMROSE. I read the reviews and decided to try them. Let me make it very clear that I don't write reviews, but I do read them. This product forced me to write this review in an effort to help some other women who are experiencing the hot flashes. I started using them exactly 18 days ago. My hot flashes have decreased substantially. I take two in the morning and two in the evening and feel like myself again. My plan is to do this for another week and then reduce to two soft gels per day. Otherwise, I will have to purchase a bottle per month. Ladies, they have helped me so much! I still have some hot flashes but not nearly as frequent or severe. It's worth a try if you are as miserable as I was! Now, I don't always look like someone has thrown a bucket of water on me. LOLSigned,SINCERELY GRATEFUL FOR THIS PRODUCT
