review/text: This stuff is the good old real thing -- NH3OH -- and it will cut grease like nobody's business. I keep a small container of this in every room of the house, along with paper towels and gloves, so that I can immediately jump on any sort of stain or spill and clean it right up. This works well on windows too, and won't streak. The only drawback I've encountered is that guests say my house constantly smells like ammonia, but I've gotten so accustomed to the fine aroma that I just don't notice it any more. To me, it's a lovely boquet.
