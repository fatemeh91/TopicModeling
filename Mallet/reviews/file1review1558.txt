review/text: I had a wart on my finger for years now and have tried at home wart treatment, Dr. Scholl's freezing, the doctor's office freezing, and it got so stubborn, it's core has changed into a dark color. Then one day I looked on Amazon to see what people say works out there, and found PediFix Wart Stick. Since it was a verys tubborn wart, it had to take off 4 layers before the wart is completely gone. Each layer took about 4days to come off. I am amazed at how effective this little stick is. Now, I am wart free!
