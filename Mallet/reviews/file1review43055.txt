review/text: I was 140 pounds at 6 months and decided to get size small as it can supposedly accommodate up to 150 pounds. Well, when it arrived, I had to use the last set of hooks and it was already super tight! So I gave mine to a friend and ordered the medium.The cradle supports your tummy but for some reason, it also makes the sides of my back sore after a while. It helps, but you won't ever "forget that you're wearing it" and as many of the reviewers have mentioned, the straps really do peek out even in conservative necklined-shirts.All in all though, it does help when you're carrying heavy, like I am with twins.Update:I'm now 8 months along and discovered a new problem: the 3 sets of hooks are too far apart! I can't hook them at the middle as it is already much too tight and if I use the last set of hooks, there is absolutely no support as it is too loose. They should have 5 sets of hooks instead to place in-between.Now I have to resort to using the 'velcro' type maternity belt. In short, just when I needed belly support the most, this prenatal cradle let me down.
