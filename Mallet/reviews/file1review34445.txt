review/text: I wasn't expecting a BIG bottle of this lube. This will last for a good while. I really enjoy the slippery feeling of this product.Some people think that it is too thin but that is the point. Who wants to feel thick globs of lube? I would much rather feel my partner's skin. You can use this product for almost all of your lubrication needs. 5 minute quickie? Sure...but it is going to linger much longer then that. ;-) An Hour of fun? You BET!!! After an hour you might want to reapply. Also I don't think this lube, by itself, is good for anal sex. It does much better as a blend in that situation. My sweetie LOVES this lubrication when I use my hand on him. He says it gives a good sensuous gliding feeling with every stroke.
