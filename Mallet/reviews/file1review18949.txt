review/text: I received my knee brace and have been using it for a week now. I was having so much pain I was taking almost a full bottle of ibuprofen a week with a few vicodin as well. With this brace the instability and pain in my knee is almost back to normal. I now only take 2-3 a night when I have to work, outside of that I have very little pain at all. This knee brace has allowed me to get a big part of my life back. If I could give it 10 stars I would in a heart beat.
