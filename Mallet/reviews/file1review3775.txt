review/text: I rarely review a product and certainly not so soon after starting to use it. But I have tried everything on God's green earth, including natural laxitives of all kinds and forms, may different fibers, prescription meds, etc. Most recently, I've gone back to harsh laxitives because nothing else has been working. Well...just three days after starting Mag 07, I have lost 4 lbs, much of my bloating is gone and my bowels are working again. The amazing part is I have not had any stomach cramps...just relief. I'm so excited to have potentially found a product that will help me. I can only hope it continues to work in the same way.
