review/text: This is a great product and has excellent quality control. I recommend this to anyone looking fo a great multi-vitamin. Check out the vitamins and minerals listed on the product. It is all first rate. One quick way to tell if a vitamin company is passing inferior stuff is to see what kind of Vitamin E they include in the product. If is says &#34;dl-&#34; in the leading edge of the type, it spins left-handed and won't react in your body ... so it is just for looks .... These people use the best in all their products as far is I have tired them.
