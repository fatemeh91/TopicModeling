review/text: I tried it, loved the taste, but the effects of the whey protein made me so violently sick I pitched the rest of the can. If you cannot tolerate Whey or milk proteins in any form, then the best advice is to Fuggedaboutit. I suggest Sun Warrior ORMUS Organically grown Super Greens and the new Sun Warrior vegetarian source protein drink instead. People who cannot tolerate milk, or are vegetarian and do not eat meat or products from animals like milk or eggs will find the Sun Warrior Protein Drink just perfect. Nope, I am not a representative for Sun Warrior, just an avid fan of such a incredibly rich and wholesome, organic source as Sun Warrior. I do not trust any of these Whey products because they do not tell you if they come from hormone fed cattle, or what. Certainly most are not organic.
