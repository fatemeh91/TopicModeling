review/text: A rep-off!!! you pay a lot of money to get a bad quality blades. I have tried all the products Gillette produces and unfortunately they all are bad quality so expensive blades. Eventually, I went old school, safety razors are the best you'll every get. try it and you'll say GOD how didn't know about these razors!
