review/text: I ordered this cream anticipating some results to fade dark marks on my face. I have used almost the entire jar and my skin hasn't shown any improvement thus far. One thing for sure, it helped to make my skin smooth. Evidently, it has a great moisturizer because my skin never feels dry.
