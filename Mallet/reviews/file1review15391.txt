review/text: I had great hopes for this product because Cetyl Myristoleate in small capsules or softgels is really hard to find. Unfortunately, the tube-shaped capsules in this product are too hard to swallow, so the CetylPure product fails (for me). Cetyl Myristoleate in smaller softgels is available in other brands, but hard to find.
