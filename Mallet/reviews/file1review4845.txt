review/text: As long as you don't mind a little gritty texture there really aren't any issues with this product. I like it fine with water but it tastes pretty good with different juices. I like to drink it in the morning to feel like I'm nourishing my body when I have to wait a while until I get to eat food. I just put a scoop in my blender bottle with slightly watered down juice and I'm good to go first thing in the morning.Good for busy people on the go or anyone that just wants a little boost.When I run out I will repurchase.
