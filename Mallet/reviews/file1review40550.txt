review/text: I highly recommend this product to anyone. It contains calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D, all of which are great for optimum health. The liquid form goes to work much quicker than a pill. It's also much easier to swallow than a large, chalky tablet. The lemon flavor is excellent. It tastes like lemon cream pie. Great product!
