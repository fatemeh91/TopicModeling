review/text: I used to use mouthwash regularly until I realized I was swallowing too much of it.My choice was always Listerine. With such an awful taste you know it's got to be good. And it is. Listerine is a very good mouthwash.But mouthwash is not meant for human consumption. Inevitably, we'll swallow some every now and then. Oral pore absorption is also to be considered.I pondered alternatives. One stood out: vodka.Now, alcohol has never appealed to me. Even most wines taste like turpentine to me. However, vodka you can swallow; mouthwash you should not. This one difference was enough to make me switch.I chose Smirnoff vodka for two good reasons: (1) It was nearest the door and (2) it was on sale. I bought a bottle of 80 proof. It also comes in 90 and 100 proof bottles, suitable for those equipped with tougher tongues than mine.According to my dentist, Dr. Teplitsky, vodka kills germs and cleans the mouth. It heals small sores and eliminates plaque. If swallowed accidentally it's not a problem. "Just don't report me to the AMA," he said."No problem, doc. How about the KGB?"Vodka has helped me overcome sore throats. A once a day gargle/rinse seems to suffice. Of course, this could be extended to twice a day if necessary.True, it is an added expense, but I don't pinch pennies where health is concerned--especially during those cold winter months. And I remain unperturbed when accidentally some goes down.
