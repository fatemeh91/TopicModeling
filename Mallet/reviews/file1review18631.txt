review/text: My place is mostly hardwood floors with some area rugs. I got sick of dragging a canister behind me, banging into stuff, tipping over, etc. This fits on my shoulder, and with the long cord, it makes vacuuming so much easier. I kept my big vacuum for occasional beater bar cleaning of my rugs, but I routinely vacuum the rugs with this little gem as well. I really like this vacuum -- it does a great job and is a real time saver.I don't know why the tag says "Maytag." It's a Hoover, and it's been around for a long time.Pros:- Great suction- Sturdy but lightweight metal wands that don't accidentally come apart- Attachments that don't fall off the wands- Really long cord -- I can vacuum my entire condo from the same outlet- Reusable and washable bag with an option for using paper bagsCons:- No cord reel -- adding one would make the unit bigger and heavier -- they give you a handy strap to hold the cord on the vacuum for storage- No on-board attachment storage -- again, adding one would make the unit bigger and heavier -- I just keep my attachments in a small tote bag- 1970's styling -- this is either a "pro" or a "con" depending on how you look at it.
