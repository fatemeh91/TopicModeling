review/text: I bought this as a surprise for my husband for Fathers Day. It was very easy to put together. He absolutely loves it and takes time out at the computer for his "massage" a couple times a day. It's amazing how comfortable the chair is and varied the massage programs are for such a reasonable price. At first he had to get used to how it tilts back as compared to his regular office chair, but in a couple days he adjusted and is very content with it. He especially likes the high back.
