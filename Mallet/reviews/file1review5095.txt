review/text: Iron Tek 'vanilla cake' protein supplement is an affordable, versatile protein supplement with a more than decent taste - getting a bump of protein using water is quick and tasty, and when mixed with lean milk it is a great topper for bran flakes for a great snack with complex carbs, lean protein and high fiber.The 'vanilla cake' flavor is good all by itself, but it allows you to add a teaspoon of chocolate or instant coffee for a change of pace.Even though a shake mixer works better than a spoon and cup, the mix is smooth and never gritty.Each spring at the Arnold Expo in Columbus Ohio, I pick up a huge variety of protein supplement samples, but when I have to spend my money on protein, I keep coming back to Iron Tek.
