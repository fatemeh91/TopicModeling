review/text: Writing a review on a pill is difficult, but here goes. I purchased this item about a month ago (2nd time) because of the valued price on Amazon.com and the fact that I feel it does help my tired old mind to focus a little better. I only take five pills per week.I had brain surgery a couple of years ago and I felt that I was coming back too slowly. All my doctors said that I had no damage to the brain cells and I should not worry. Easy for them to say. After reading some health and medical reviews on this problem I decided to try Korean red ginseng believing it would be a waste of money.Now after using it for several months I feel that it has helped in my healing process. Being an old guy I know my mind is not as quick and sharp as it was 40 years ago, but I feel as if the Ginseng has definitely cleared my head to some extent. I am still thankful for spell check on the computer. Ginseng is good but, it won't cure the your inability to spell, this is why windows has a spell checker included in it's programs. When this bottle of ginseng is finished I will definitely purchase another.BTW: My writing skills never were anything to brag about, but they have improved in the past year.
