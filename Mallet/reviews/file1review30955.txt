review/text: Used to get this at the supermarket. Usually was a good price on account of buy 1 get 1 free. Looked for some today, I didn't see a 2 for 1 deal, looked kind of expensive, so I thought, geez, why don't I just buy this stuff on the internet?Well, I see that you can indeed by it on Amazon at an attractive price.As to the stuff itself: I learned I had arthritis in 2001. Not too long after I started taking this stuff. I don't know how people can judge if it helps them because how do you know how you would have been if you hadn't taken it? While the cartilage degeneration associated with arthritis is considered to not be reversible, the symptoms of arthritis clearly can get better over time, whether due to taking this stuff or excercising or whatever.I exercise like a madman since I got that diagnosis as well.Weight also has a huge impact on arthritis.So how can anyone tell if this stuff is doing them good or not? I take it just to play it safe, since it appears there is no harm in taking it long-term unless perhaps you have some specific medical condition that it is not compatible with.Also out of laziness I dropped down to taking 1 per day instead of 2. It seems like it is still a pretty hefty dose.So, in conclusion, I HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THIS STUFF DOES ME ANY GOOD, and I doubt very many other people do either. But if you have arthritis, why not take it? It seems to me the risk of losing out on potential benefit outweighs possible side effects, unless you have some specific adverse reaction to this stuff.
