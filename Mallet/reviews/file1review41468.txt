review/text: I was side-lined for several months because of intense metatarsal pain (metatasalgia). The high metatarsal pad on this product is unlike any other and was very helpful in helping me to heal from the pain. They are expensive and not very soft, but I have not found anything like them on the market. Now I am back to my high intensity running (street and treadmill), and I'm back at Barry's Bootcamp -- so I am grateful.
