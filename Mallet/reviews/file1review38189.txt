review/text: Band-Aid Water Block Plus Adhesive Bandages really shields out the water. I cook for 10+ people every meal so I wash my hands often. There's nothing like working in the kitchen and having your bandage falling off. It stayed in place really nice with the adhesive. The pad didn't stick to my cut which is a added bonus. I feel that for the price it's a good value for peace of mind.
