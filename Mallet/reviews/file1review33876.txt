review/text: I got this stethoscope while in my CNA class since I couldn't learn to do blood pressures with the crappy classroom ones.The frosted glacier doesn't really have any blue in it and is just clear. I thought it would set me apart from others since it was different, but people tend to think it's a crappy one because it's clear for some reason.The black name tag snap on piece of plastic rattles and makes it hard to separate important noises from periphery.I only like the feel of the earbuds that came originally attached and not either of the extras.Great for the price!
