review/text: I have been using this cleaner for a couple of years and loved it until I received my latest order. The bottle shape was different and claims to be a new formula. Terrible! The odor is awful and the spray is irritating to my nasal passages. The scent which I used to really like is now an overpowering urine smell. The cleaner now leaves streaks on my shower glass. Please go back to the old formula or I will have to find a new product.
