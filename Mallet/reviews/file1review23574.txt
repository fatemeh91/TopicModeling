review/text: So this is a nice looking mirror that is very sensitive to touch (ie: You will accidently turn it on or off often if you are not careful). The lighting itself is not super bright but it serves it's purpose. I used this mirror every day for about 2 years before the lighting stopped working. Just so you know, the light battery inside will die after about 2 years if not sooner.
