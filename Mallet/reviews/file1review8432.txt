review/text: I LOVE this! I use it mainly to clean my stainless steel water bottles which are a pain to clean without this brush! The bristles are very soft so they won't scratch whatever you're using them on and the brush end bends to make it easy to clean those hard to reach corners! I've used this brush quite a bit and the bristles are still in great shape!!
