review/text: I recently bought two of these, one as a gift and one for my cabin. I already owned one of these brushes and was very happy with it, which is precisely why I bought two more. I believe the quality is not the same as it was and the bristles which seem thinner actually pull out pretty easily. So far only a few bristles have pulled out, but it's a disappointment none the less. I like the brushes feel and it's great for washing glasses, coffee cups and pots, and large mouth bottles. Unfortunately the quality has gone down. Maybe that is why Beds Bath and Beyond doesn't stock them anymore. I really wanted to continue being happy with these brushes.
