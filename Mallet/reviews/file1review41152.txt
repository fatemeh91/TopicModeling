review/text: After trying a variety of different probiotics (and spending a lot of $), I'm sold on Daily-Dophilus. Two pills in the morning and two pills at night help keeping things *ahem* moving along smoothly for me. My husband just uses one pill each for am/pm, and says it works great for him.The price on Amazon is cheaper than any place else I've found it, even when on sale. Definitely a keeper!
