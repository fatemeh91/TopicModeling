review/text: I use the Vanilla Creme protein powder in oatmeal in the mornings and in smoothies sometimes. Drinking this with water is less appetizing, as the drink will foam up a lot and it tastes pretty synthetic. Not bad, just not outstanding. I use the Extreme Milk Chocolate, which tastes great, for drinking after workouts or throughout the day. The chocolate is not as good for mixing with other foods, however.
