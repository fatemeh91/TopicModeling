review/text: I have tried many whey proteins in my lifetime, and ON is the brand I've settled on, not only for cost, but the lactase allows even the lactose intolerant to drink it with milk, and the "instantized" feature allows it to mix without any granules to choke down! However, if you have not tried any flavors, the chocolate mint falls second to the rocky road which is the best tasting pure whey protein around.
