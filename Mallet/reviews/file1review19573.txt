review/text: We're struggling with potty training our 3yo boy and these potty seats have been great! They are all one piece so there aren't any cracks and crevices that you have to clean, and they are contoured perfect for his little bottom. There is a handle on the back so it's very easy for adults and kids to lift it off of the toilet, and then you just drop it back into place when your little one needs to go potty. My sister recommended them to me (she's already trained two kiddos) and we've been truly impressed - as impressed as one can be with a potty trainint seat that is! (wink)
