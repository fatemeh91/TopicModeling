review/text: I purchased this product from my Podiatrist at a much higher price. It helped me immenseley with lower back pain, due to fallen arches. I was so impressed that I ordered a pair for my son for half the price! He is thankful, because he believes it has helped his lower back problem.Orthotic 3/4-Length Arch Supports RX
