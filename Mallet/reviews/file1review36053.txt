review/text: I started taking this supplement 3 days ago and am truly hoping to see the benefits within a week. The only way I can describe the taste is its like drinking pure death. I equate it to taking a a week old dead animal off the side of the road, liquefying it in a blender and swigging in cold water. God help me it's awful
