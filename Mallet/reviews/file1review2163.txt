review/text: If you are like me and hate your foot slipping to the front of the shoe, this product is for you. It also provides extra cushioning and works with pumps, peep toe, sandals, boots and sneakers mary jane style. I've used it for years and so far no complaints!!!! This product is available at drug stores but a much higher price (between $6.99 and $10.99). For me the affordability offered through Amazon is the cherry on top!! I recommend this product!!
