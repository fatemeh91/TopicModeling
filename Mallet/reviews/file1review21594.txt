review/text: As I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease, which plays havoc on the small bowel, I read that a probiotic would help. I picked this product because of the 13 billion bacteria and the variety of types. I found the price reasonable and the delivery charge minimal. I have found that it does even things out and quieten down the activity in the bowel. My husband has started to take it and and has found the same. I do believe that a sluggish bowel can allow the overgrowth of bad bacteria and a surpressed immune system cannot fight back alone.
