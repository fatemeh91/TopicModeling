review/text: I'm sure.I think there's nothing better at this price.I use orthotic insoles with my workboot and I have tried different kind of insoles.Some of them are really very good but very expensive.Others are inexpensive but not very comfortable and less durable.This insoles offers a good arch support (medium) , a soft base and ,very important, a long life.Don't forget the bargain price.very recommended!
