review/text: The Sweeper arrived two days ago and it is easy to use and it picks up very well on low pile carpet, I would not recommend that this be used on shag carpeting at all. It is compact in size, easy to assemble and no batteries to recharge and is ready to use as soon as you assemble the handles to it. I like the product very well.
