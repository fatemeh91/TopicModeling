review/text: Since I've gotten the Hummingbird, flossing has become less of a chore. I used to have the greatest difficulty getting floss between my teeth -especially in the back of my mouth where floss would start hurting my fingers. With the Hummingbird, it's a breeze (or close enough anyhow).Admittedly, I was worried about the waste created by the disposable flosser units. I actually spoke to a hygienist about it. She suggested reusing it, it's what she does! When I thought more about it, it made sense. I mean, we reuse the same toothbrush head for three months. Because the floss starts to fall apart sooner, I just rinse and use till replacement is needed. I read a reviewer for the replacements say they just recycle the plastic of the flosser, and I'm not sure it's recyclable, but it's definitely worth the try.The reason I only give 4 stars is twofold. First, the waste is still incredible, especially if it really isn't recyclable. Second, I don't find the use of the vibrating particularly helpful. I just don't use it, but some people think it works wonders. I find it more wasteful because of the addition. Why did I get this instead of a unit used just for its "reaching" capabilities? Why, the Hummingbird is so compact and ergonomic! I can take it anywhere!Really, overall the Hummingbird is worth it. Your dental and heart health is worth it. Just stick to the three R's (that would be reduce, reuse, and recycle) to try and help what effects you have on our planet.
