review/text: My mother and sister both have severe arthritis and have required total knee replacements. They have difficulty getting in and out of any vehicle. I ordered the CarCaddie (and the "Handybar" also available from Amazon.com) for my car to see if it would help them. My 82 year old mother said it was the easiest she'd gotten out of a car in years. We liked them so much that I then ordered another of each for my mother's car and the CarCaddie for my sister's (her car lacks the "U" shaped striker plate in the door frame to accomodate the Handybar.) Now I don't have to transfer them back and forth between vehicles. Your car must have a metal frame over the top of the window when you open your car door for this to attach to.
