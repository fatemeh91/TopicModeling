review/text: FROM A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR OVER 25 YEARSFOR A EXPENSIVE, PEN THIS IS NOT WORTH $10.00. THE QUALITY IS SO BAD YOU WOULD THINK MR. WHALEN (C.E.O.) AT A.T. CROSS IN LINCOLN, RI, HAD THE CHINESE SHUT THEIR EYES WHEN PENS CAME THROUGH QUALITY CONTROL. THE GOLD PLATING IS SO BAD IT WOULD NOT EVEN PASS FOR A GOOD KNOCK OFF. THEIR WEBSITE SAID IT'S MANUFACTURED THE SAME WAY FOR THE PAST 158 YEARS ONE AT A TIME BY HAND, SAME QUAILITY?(SEE THEIR WEBSITE). SOMEONE IS REALLY LAUGHING IN LINCOLN - ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOOD AT CROSS IS THEIR STOCK (ATX) AMEX. BECAUSE FOOLS, LIKE MYSELF BELEIVE THEIR RUBBISH.I WANTED TO BUY A GOOD QUAILITY WRITING INSTRUMENT MADE IN THE U.S.A - I GOT A SURPRISE!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME, A GOOD QUAILTY FOUNTAIN PEN CAN BE PURCHASED FROM JAPAN AND FRANCE AND IT WON'T SAY CHINA ALL OVER IT.
