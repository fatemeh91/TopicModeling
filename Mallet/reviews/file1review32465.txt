review/text: I have to say that I love this cooler bag. I leave it attached to my stroller and don't remove it ever. I can fold up the stroller with items still in the cooler without any problems. It is a small cooler, but that's the way it's described and it works for me. I normally just put half frozen water bottles in the bag. The only downside, is that as things melt, the cooler may leak some, but it's not a big issue. I've also used the cooler bag to put extra items in it just for more space when we were sight seeing last year.
