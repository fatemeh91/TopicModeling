review/text: I bought this from the pharmacy when we ran out of Blue Goo. It does seem to help my tennis elbow somewhat, but no where near as well as Blue Goo. Blue Goo is the absolute best (way better than Icy Hot or other menthol creams out there). There is something about emu oil, MSM, and menthol that really seems to do the trick. Australian Dream doesn't have the menthol.
