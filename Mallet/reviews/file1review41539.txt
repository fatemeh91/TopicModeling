review/text: When someone suggested this product to me I thought he was just trying to make a sale (it was my dentist) but I went to work and a few of my co-workers said they had it and liked it very much. Again I was somewhat skepitcal, but I did order it. I can't tell you how much I love this product. My teeth feel like I have just come from the dentist office and had my teeth cleaned EVERYDAY. You know when you have your teeth cleaned you come out of the appointment and keep running your tongue over your teeth because they feel so good.............it feels that way everyday and it has helped my gums as well. I love it!!!!!!
