review/text: I am a little disapointed as the BPM readings are far different from the doctors monitor. I purchased one as I have been suffering from high blood pressure. As I live a considerable way from the doctors I wanted to keep a check myself. I checked my BP at home before going to the doctors and then had it taken at the doctors but the difference was considerable. So I can only assume that the one I purchased doesn't give a good reading.Patti
