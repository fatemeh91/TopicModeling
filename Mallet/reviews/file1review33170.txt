review/text: Many many years ago I used to get colds two or three times a year. A friend mentioned Wellness Formula and her successful experience with it. So I tried it. Whenver I first sense the beginnings of a cold - tickle in my nose or throat, itchy eyes, etc., I immediately take two Wellness. A few hours later, if the symptoms persist, I take a couple more. Doing that has allowed me to avoid colds almost completely; almost because sometimes I don't pick up on the warning signs or there are none. As a result, I get colds only once every three or four years. I swear by the stuff. My family swears by the stuff as do all my friends. Many of us take one a day during the winter as a preventive medicine. I cannot recommend the product highly enough and finding it for such a reasonable price on Amazon is a bonus.
