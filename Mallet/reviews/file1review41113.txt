review/text: I tried these out since they are alot of foojoy teas in this one store i frequent but the teas have no flavor cause it all seeps out since the teabags aren't aluminum sealed. The sampler teas they have were sealed and have way superior flavor. I suggest people look at the Yamamotoyama brand instead since they do seal their teabags.
