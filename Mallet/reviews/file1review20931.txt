review/text: Have owned a Braun Activator razor for less than 1 year, and have gone through 3 foils that have torn during normal use. You simply cannot replace just the foil, but you have to buy the entire shaving block along with the foil which gets expensive. During use, this razor did not give a close shave as advertised. I spent twice as much time shaving with the Braun than I did with my old Norelco just to get a half way decent shave. Nicks and cuts were commonplace which I found amazing with an electric shaver! I wish I would have never purchased this product.Lesson learned, I am running back to Norelco.
