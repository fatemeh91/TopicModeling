review/text: i bought this because it was rechargeable and on sale.. it was larger than i thought (i was thinking a 4" bullet from the picture; my fault for not researching better)... but that's not the problem... the problem is the base separated from the rest of the unit when i took it out of the charger the first time - it was very poorly manufactured and i will never buy this brand again
