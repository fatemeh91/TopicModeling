review/text: I was hoping for the strong aromatic fragrance of burning opium incense. There was the faintest scent of the usual opium incense, however it was extremely weak and nearly unrecognizable. The overall scent was pleasant enough and the sticks did have a nice slow burn which is always a good sign. This incense is better than most of the cheap store bought stuff that is passed off for incense. I think the manufacturers of this particular incense attempted to cut to many corners or use substitute inferior products which weakened the scent, mixed in with the pleasant scent, was a pungent unpleasant mystery Oder that surfaced almost subliminally minimizing the olfactory pleasure. Overall this incense is not for the aficionado, but for every day home use in small quantities for some one that is not to picky about their background incense, it is acceptable.
