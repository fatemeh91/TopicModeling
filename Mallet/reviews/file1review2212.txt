review/text: I ordered this looking for a calcium supplement. This came with Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, and some other crap. First of all, I already take magnesium so now I CANNOT take this or I will be super loading on magnesium. BUT the bigger issue is the inclusion of zinc. Zinc, when taken with Calcium, is NOT absorbed. This is a waste of zinc.
