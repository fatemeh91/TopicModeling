review/text: The Higher Mind formula has a lot of great ingredients both for the mind, particularly recall, and for relaxation. Some formulas for the mind have caffeine and will make you feel more wide alert, awake and full of energy. The Higher Mind formula is more likely to make you feel relaxed. It may put you in a meditative state - alpha or theta or if you're not used to it, you may feel like having a nap at first. That's how it worked for me, perhaps because it has a good dose of GABA, Ashwagandha and vitamin B6 and magnesium.As a hypnotist, I'd say that those relaxing ingredients are in a way hypnotic, as they induce in you that hypnotic state of mind - alpha state or theta state - which helps to make your subconscious mind more receptive to suggestions and new learnings. You may find that in that state of mind you are naturally able to absorb much more information.You may not notice anything special happening while you're focusing or learning things, however sooner or later you may find yourself surprised at how much better your recall is. I believe this to be mainly due to Huperzine A and Vinpocetine. You may also discover your thinking in general gets better.The Higher Mind formula has a lot of potent ingredients and while the directions recommend to take 1 - 4 tablets with meal, it is wise to start with just 1 and let your body get used to the ingredients.
