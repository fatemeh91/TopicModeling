review/text: I looked locally for a support belt that would relieve the severe tail bone and pelvic pain from my pregnancy. This one was cheaper yet the same style my doctor recommended. I am a size 20-22 per-pregnancy so I was a little concerned about fit but this belt fits fine with plenty of room for my ever growing belly. I can wear it all day and it greatly improved the pain I was in. I do recommend wearing a tank underneath to keep the elastic from rubbing against your skin. Overall worth the money for the relief it gave me!
