review/text: i absolutely love these tweezers. they are extremely sharp which allows for precision removal of splinters and ingrown hairs. i also use it for eyebrow grooming because the fine point allows for single lash removal. (helps prevent pulling out too many at a time and creating a disaster) I have just ordered my third pair of these tweezers because I can't live without them!as stated below, the tweezers do not come with instructions. Thank goodness my education prepared me for the complicated task of using this tool... If you don't know how to use tweezers, you should probably stay away from this product. it is extremely sharp!
