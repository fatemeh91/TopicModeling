review/text: I bought 4 of these after knee surgery in Vale, Colorado 15 years ago at the Steadman-Hawkins clinic at their recommendation. They are absolutely fantastic. Expensive, YES, but they are worth every penny. I have had a dozen athletic injuries and as many surgeries, You will not find a better product to ice and injury or surgery.They will not burn your skin and will last about 40 minutes which is all you want per session. Throw them in the freezer and they are ready to go again in about 2 hours. Buy 2 or 3 so you have fresh ones at all times. I've had neighbors and friends want to pay me $20 because I let them have them for a week.Make sure you get the right size. I have the 8" x 20" which is a "LARGE" and works for knees, arms etc but they make speciality products for shoulders etc. Mine are in the freezer at all times. Buy um you'll loveum.
