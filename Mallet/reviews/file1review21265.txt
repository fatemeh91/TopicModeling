review/text: I have 4 of s-200, one s-320 for my father now. My wife, son and me use one at home, I have one at work. I bought them on Ebay for less than half the retail price, so I can buy more to save the trouble to switch heads. This unit is better than original sonicare in almost very way. It cleans teeth at least as good as sonicare, but the design does not require you clean the root of the tooth brush head regularly like sonicare does. The brush head has a better quality than sonicare, after 2 years of regular use, the head cleans almost as new. Although oral-b recommends you to replace it for very 3 month, I found it is only necessary for manual teeth brush, fast vibrating cleaning action preserve the brush cleaning power much much better, it does not bend the brush that much.I had the first s-200 for more than 5 years now, it still charges very well and cleans strong. The German really did a wonderful engineering job. My first two sonicare only lasted two years in comparison for their batteries to reach the end life.
