review/text: I have to say I am complete disappointed with this trimmer. It does a good job trimming. Where it falls absolutely flat on its face is on the depth adjustment. It is completely worthless. This trimmer only has one depth setting - because if you don't hold the thing at the right angle, you will trim your beard way too short. Also, there is no good way of getting under your nose with this thing. The depth guard will be up your nostril before your hair even comes close to the trimming blade!
