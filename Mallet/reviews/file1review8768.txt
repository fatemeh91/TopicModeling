review/text: Rosie O'Donnell mentioned this product on Dr. Oz, so I had to try it. I've used it now for about six months, and I feel great! Between this product, Rhasberry Ketone, green tea, CLA, flaxseed supplements and sunflower seeds (saltless) - 3 teaspoons, no more than that as they become fattening after that, I feel wonderful and even though I'm 54, I run circles around the younger agents at the major airline I work for! I'd recommend this to any one who wants to live a healthy livestyle (I don't even work out) and have energy! I like it best mixed in Silk Mango and Strawberry or Banana fruit drink that you can buy from Wal-Mart and have even started putting it in my coffee when I run out of that product! I know my insides are thanking me and I've lost over 16 lbs! (I'd hit 158 lbs for my 5' 10" frame and I couldn't seem to lose any weight. I finally got down to 145 and seemed to plateau, however, this morning I weighed 142! - something I haven't done since high school!) I'm also tickled to be able to buy a two-month's supply for $50 because the one-month supply I've been buying from a health food store for $50 was getting to be a little harder to purchase each month - so I was tickled to purchase it online, shipping, tax and all for the same amount of money, only double the amount of product! And it arrived within days! Amazon - you're absolutely terrific! Ginger in Texas
