review/text: This product worked great for my 10 year old daughter. We tried many remedies including doctor's visits for freezing the planter warts without much success. The PediFix began to work he first night and within 7-10 days the wart was completely gone. I do agree with the other reviews, this product is strong. You want to concentrate on placing the product only where it's needed. I was skeptical but this stuff really works. Another word of caution, the package closely resembles chap-stick. Keep it away from smaller kids.
