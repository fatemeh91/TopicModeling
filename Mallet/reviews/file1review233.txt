review/text: This item broke after a very short time of use. It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower. The next day it was dead, and water kept leaking from it. So now it's dead.It is very big, way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert. It is not flexible or pliable, so it is not adjustable to people's bodies or preferences! The bullet function actually burns, so it is not pleasant. Also when it is first opened a very very very strong rubber smell comes out, and it definitely does not go away.It's not high quality, it broke very fast.
