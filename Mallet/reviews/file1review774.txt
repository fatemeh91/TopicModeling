review/text: I have only been using this product a week. I did research like the person above. A trainer said it wasn't effective alone but put with a thermogenic there was a slight increased effect. I also read that it was better at the thyroid than the fat loss.I have been taking it with cayenne fruit (supposed metabolism support) and I can say that together Ive felt an increase in heat, like Im sitting right now feeling warmer. I just ate and I think that helps. I take the guggul (1) at night before bed but Im not sure if that does anything, and I can't say that Ive lost any fat in this first week. Im also taking Fast Action Hoodia Diet by Irwin Naturals which is great to stop hunger and it has a high caffiene so along with the guggul I hope eventually after taking all three and intense exercise it all works.I think though I would by the NOW version of the guggul, it's slightly cheaper and I think there might be more count per bottle, but Id have to do research.This is a good product but I would try to put it with another thermo, like cayenne fruit which is a cheap (3-5$ for 90) no stimulant natural product, just a thought.
