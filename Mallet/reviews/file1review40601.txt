review/text: I completely renovated my Kitchen less than a year ago and installed a quality integrated dishwasher. I've tried several dishwashing detergents and tried this a few months ago because I try to use environmentally friendly products. As soon as I switched to this product my dishes came out with food stuck on them, residue and feeling dirty. Not all dishes/glasses/silverware were unclean but I had to inspect and then re-wash a lot of dishes.Even after pre-rinsing, not overfilling the dishwasher and running the sink faucet on hot for 15 seconds to get the hot water immediately into the dishwasher this product still did not perform.I have never had a product that performed this poorly. Its not earth friendly because I have to waste more water when I re-wash the dishes this product didn't clean properly.
