review/text: I got this as soon as I realized I had a bunion, even though I didn't have any alignment problems. Still, I notice a major difference after I wear this overnight. It's actually fairly comfortable and I can sleep very well with it on. The only possible negative is that it's made of plastic and thus a little unsteady. You can't get up and walk around with it in the middle of the night. But it's not made for that so it's OK.
