review/text: These diapers were the primary ones I used for my son and various foster children. While others have complained that are NOT useful as a diaper, I found them to be the MOST perfect for this use! Especially with babies in different sizes at the same time, I did not have to worry about assuring I have enough of any given size - and they fit great into the diaper covers I was using (Bumkins covers) - for the littlest ones I folded one way, for the middle children I folded another - for the biggest children, I would use two and fold them the same as I folded for the middle children.Now that I am not caring for other people's children, I still have many of these diapers and we still use for cleaning cloths around the house and elsewhere. Over the years, very few have fallen apart (pretty much just the one's my mother washed with bleach, which should never be used on an item that will be pressed against a baby's most sensitive area....).I thought and still think they are great, so I am very surprised to hear from others that they do NOT work for all the purposes that I used them for :)
