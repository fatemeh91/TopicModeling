review/text: I've used the product for a month now, and can't tell much of a difference. It's quite expensive, and I bought a 6 month supply. It's supposed to help your joints, but can find so little information written about the product. Very little was sent with the shipment. It's all very vague at this point. I will give you a six month update. The second time you purchase, it is cheaper. If I do not feel any positive changes, I won't reorder.
