review/text: It's a shame how Gillette keeps trying to grab more money from its loyal clientele especially with this piece of garbage. I got a free Fusion razor in the mail and hated it from the first day. The blade and the so called "lubricating strip" were literally worn out by day 3. With the cost of replacement blades, even purchased in bulk, what it costs to use this thing would require most people to get a second job! Stick to Sensor or Sensor Excel, does a better job and is MUCH cheaper.
