review/text: I really love the Mrs. Meyer's products (I'm running out of that fabulous gingerbread holiday kit) and this shower cleaner is no exception. It will clean all the tile and porcelain surfaces in your bathroom, not only the shower and leaves a nice clean, not overpowering lavender scent. It actually makes cleaning up enjoyable.
