review/text: This battery works for the Vicks Speedread Digital Thermometer and most stores do not have a replacement battery in stock or even available. I went online to find a replacement battery for our family's Vicks Digital Thermometer and stumbled on this seller. It's A LOT cheaper to purchase this battery (and it's free shipping) and replace the dead battery in your thermometer rather than buy a new thermometer for anywhere starting at $10 at the store. The thermometer works like a charm with this new battery.
