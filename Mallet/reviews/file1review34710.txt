review/text: These B Complex vitamins are nutritionally balance, unlike many others. (It is very important not to take too much vitamin B6.) Solaray is known for purity and accuracy, so these are higher quality than many vitamins on the market. The B vitamins are very important for many bodily functions, including optimal brain functioning (memory,emotions,alertness,etc.) Another example is if the body does not receive enough B vitamins when under prolonged stress, it will deplete the adrenal glands - leading to serious fatigue problems and an inability to properly handle stress. I have even seen people with anxiety attacks improve dramatically with proper daily doses of quality B vitamins, and not need anti-anxiety medication. This product is one of the best B Complex products available.
