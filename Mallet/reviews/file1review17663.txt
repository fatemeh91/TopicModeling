review/text: This trimmer looks good. However, it does not hold a battery charge beyond 2 trimmings.The charger cannot be used to operate the trimmer. Therefore, you must wait 14-16 hours to use the trimmer if it is not fully charged.This is the worst trimmer that I have ever used and I have had a beard for over 25 years.
