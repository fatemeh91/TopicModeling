review/text: We're using 2 of these pads to help potty train our daughter at night. Unlike all the other pads we have tried, these have a much softer surface. Because of that, our daughter is able to sleep directly on top of a pad, so we never have to wash the bedding under her when she has an accident. In addition, the large size helps make sure she's always on top of it, even if she rolls around her bed at night.
