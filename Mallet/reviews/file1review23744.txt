review/text: I have extremely flat feet. My podiatrist recommended these orthotics last time I had an office visit, instead of paying alot of money for custom orthotics. He sold me a pair of Spencos, and they were SIGNIFICANTLY more than what I paid on Amazon a few weeks later. I ordered a few sets from Amazon, and they're great. . . and the same exact product my podiatrist sells.At first, they take a little getting used to. After about two days, I forget I'm wearing them but I remember as soon as I put on shoes without them. My feet feel much better when I wear shoes with these orthotics. I ordered several pairs so I don't need to keep switching them between shoes. For dress shoes with a smaller toe box, the 3/4 length work well. For athletic shoes, I prefer the full length. I'm 6'4" and 300 lbs, and I wear these on a daily basis. After several months, they still have the same structure under the arch they did on day one. For me, there is no comparison between these and the ones they sell at various drug stores.
