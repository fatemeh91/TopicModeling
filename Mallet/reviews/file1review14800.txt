review/text: This product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for. They Both were made in the citrate form. Unfortunately, I am unable to absorb properly for my system. Although the instructions say to take 2 level teaspoons per serving, I tried 1 teaspoon and soon after, had cramps and had to run to the bathroom. I tried this more than once and the same thing happened. I also do not like the way it does not dissolve in liquids easily. It is gritty and if left in the glass for a few seconds, falls to the bottom.Anyway, thought this would be a good product for me, but is not. I guess I may have to get a softgel or capsule type.
