review/text: I bought this to clean my glasses and various electronics and it works great for that. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Microfiber Cloth this is a nice little cheap product. It looks to be about 6 inches by 6 inches so it's a decent size for just about everything. Although, I wasn't thinking. This product doesn't come with the spray so that's the only thing I didn't like about this certain product. Other than that all is well.
