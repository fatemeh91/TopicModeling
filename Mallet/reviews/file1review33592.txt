review/text: I have problems flossing my teeth in the back so my peridonticssuggested a water pik. It really helps me to clean food from that area and refreshmy mouth. Because I have sensitive gums there are enough speeds so I can adjust the water flow.I am happy I purchased it. It is well worth the money.
