review/text: I drink this brand of Jasmine Green Tea every single day at work. The lower level of caffeine eases me awake as opposed to giving me coffee-jitters. Green tea is extremely good for you and also happens to taste amazing! I recommend this to anyone. It also makes a great iced tea for a different twist.
