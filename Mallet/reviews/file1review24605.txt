review/text: I LOVE this product and highly recommend it to anyone. I've been using it for 3 years now. My normal weight is about 110-115 and my senior year in highschool I started to put on weight and got up to about 140 (not too heavy....but I'm very short and small framed) I started to work out and change my eating habits but I couldn't get below 130. Zantrex helped me kick the last 15-20 lbs. You still need to watch your diet and stay active but it helps give you a boost. I lost it all in about 2 months....I was very happy with my results. My only suggestion is that you drink A LOT of water with it or it will make you extra jittery and sometimes you will feel sick. These side effects go away after a couple of months of using it...and it's worth it.
