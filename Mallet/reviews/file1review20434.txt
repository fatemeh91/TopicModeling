review/text: I had fallen off my mountain bike and hurt my tailbone. Since I avoided the doctor for 6 months, my tailbone really hurt when sitting for a long time. The doctor recommended I sit on this all the time for several months. No pain! It looks large, but it fit in airplane and car seats. Several people in my life, who had no pain or sitting issues, tried it and thought they should be sitting on it too. It pitches your body slightly forward, so it's usually comfortable. It makes it a little hard on your back on a long airplane ride, so I would recommend lying back on a book or scrunched up sweatshirt for some lumbar support.
