review/text: My husband has pretty large arms and was unable to share my Omron digital blood pressure monitor until now. This cuff accommodates his MIGHTY PYTHONS and allows him to keep track of his blood pressure. Really great for anyone who does not have the average size arm. I would recommend that you measure your arm first before buying it to ensure that you are within 13-17'. This cuff should not be used by anyone who has a smaller arm since you will not obtain accurate bp readings.
