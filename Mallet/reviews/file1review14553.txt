review/text: I purchased this foot cream a few months ago in a red tube and package. I have to buy it online because I can't find it in stores, so I ordered it again. While the website still had the red package picture, it had a notice saying that packaging had recently changed. That turned out to be true, it's now a white and blue box and tube.Unfortunately, they also watered down the lotion when they changed packaging. The previous packaging read the lotion "delivers a full day's moisturization". The new package reads "over 17 hours of moisturization", but otherwise reads the same. I compared my old lotion with the new and the difference is readily apparent. After a few days of using the new lotion, I find that I can no longer get away with just 1 use per day, I have to use it at least twice, sometimes 3 times. It also doesn't penetrate as well, so it's not as good for the really rough, dry spots I experience on one foot. The previous tube kept me from getting cracks in this one trouble spot, but I noticed tonight I'm getting a crack in the foot despite using the new Neutrogena.This was so disappointing for me. I searched for years to find a good foot lotion and the old Neutrogena was it. This new stuff is only marginally better than the kinds you can find at any drugstore, and at $5 or more for 2 ounces plus having to use it more times per day, it's just not worth it anymore. Hope it was worth it to Neutrogena.
