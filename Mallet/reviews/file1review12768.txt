review/text: This inexpensive faux SAM splint is very soft and the aluminum is about 3/4 inch inside the foam all the way around to eliminate the aluminum wearing the foam. It seems more flexible than SAM splints and does not have any kind of directions with it, but if you know how to use one, this is good to go for an inexpensive splint to add to your pack.
