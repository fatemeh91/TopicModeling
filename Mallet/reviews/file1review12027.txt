review/text: My insurance does not cover prenatal vitamins, so on the hunt for something I could afford I purchased these. I liked that they were natural, included ginger extract, and were one a day.But surely they can make a vitamin that tastes better than this? I've tried a range of other vitamins, and never have I had anything that tastes this bad. I don't understand the folks who said this doesn't taste bad - did they get different pills? Are their taste buds dead? Even the smell in opening the bottle is overwhelming. My current method is trying to cover the pungent taste (and aftertaste) with milk. Doesn't quite work, but anything to take the edge off.I do take them with the Mommy's Bliss Omega-3 DHA supplements, and those are quite nice.
