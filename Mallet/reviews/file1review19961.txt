review/text: Favorite seat for my son who is going through potty training now. He used to complain about toilet training, never liked any of the small toddler toilets I bought, and never cared for any of the other seats like this that fit on the full sized toilet. This one he likes a lot, he uses this as often as he uses the toddler urinal I also got him (if you have a boy, those are awesome, they just love using it and they go much easier on them than any normal toilet). Very comfortable for a toddler's bottom. Splash guard could've been concave a bit in case of splashback, but teaching them to pay attention to where they're pointed compensates enough that it's not a detraction.
