review/text: This claims to be Irvin's "advanced" formula which contains huperzine 50 mg, (which sets it apart from maximum gingko smart). False description.I ordered (6) six bottles of advanced, and the invoice in the box stated advanced. The bottles were NOT advanced formula. No huperzine, and the bottle label is not for advanced either.I called vitamin shoppe, and it was difficult to convince them of the fact. Eventually, being an RN, and transfering to a supervisor re no huperzine, she agreed to have UPS pick it up.This is a major error on the part of vitamin shoppe, misrepresenting it on Amazon.com. The picture of the label is also misrepresented from what I received. It was not a matter of mixing up the two formulations, as they only carry one kind of Irvin's ginko smart.
