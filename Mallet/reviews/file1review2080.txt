review/text: I received a sample of these in the mail from Pampers and used it the very same day while feeding my 8 month old. I must say I was skeptical. Mainly because I had no problem with using cloth bibs and secondly because of the cost. As many 8 month olds are, mine was very interesting in tearing apart the bibster and eating it! After I distracted his attention away from it I fed him and as soon as I removed it, I noticed it had leaked through on the backside, leaving it cold and damp.I would not purchase these for everyday use. Maybe if I were travelling, but even then for the price I think I would just bring along several cloth bibs.
