review/text: I've researched the benefits of omega 3 fatty acids (of which fish oil is a good source), and from what I've read it seems like some good stuff. Especially for the average person in the US, in which we generally consume a higher amount of omega 6 fatty acids (especially from vegetable oil, most of which is bad for us...olive oil being one exception). A high consumption of omega 6 fatty acids and and a significantly lower consumption of omega 3 fatty acids is not a good thing.So I wanted to include more omega 3's into my sons diet. I discovered my son doesn't like swallowing fish oil pills, so I had to finish a bottle of those myself. Then I found another lemon flavored liquid brand, but he wasn't very fond of the taste when I gave it to him straight, so I had to mix it in his grape juice. While the grape juice was bearable, I often surmised that he wasn't getting all of the fish oil when he drank the juice. I'm thinking that no matter how well I mixed the grape juice and fish oil, some of that expensive liquid was being rinsed down the drain when I washed the cup.Then I found this product. He'll drink this straight, so I give him the recommended serving size in a little medicine cup.However, as I tell my son, usually the best nutrition doesn't come in a pill or bottle. So I also make a point to make him scrambled eggs in the morning using eggs high in omega 3 fatty acids. And we usually eat two servings of fish (salmon and sardines because they are usually lower in mercury) per week to further increase our omega 3 intake.Difficult to say what affect the higher omega 3 intake has on my son. To be honest, he has always been a great kid (wild and rambunctious at times, but so was I as a boy!). I just want to do my best to ensure he receives the best nutrition possible (within my budget), which is something I didn't have growing up.
