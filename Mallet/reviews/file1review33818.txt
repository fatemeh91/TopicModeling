review/text: We are parents, not medical professionals. My kid has aggravated respiratory syndrome (similar to asthma but without being full on asthma) and I got tired of using my ear to chest to try to discern between chest congestion from a cold/allergies and asthmatic problems.Since we are not using this for cardiovascular reasons, our review probably does not help the nursing student, but I will say this seems to be a really high quality set. Comes in a sturdy box with foam, extra foam ear insert, and 1 spare diaphram circle piece.
