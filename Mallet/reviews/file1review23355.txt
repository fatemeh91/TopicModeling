review/text: This little unit does what it they say it does. It oxygenates water and oil in 30 minute increments.A note about the seller: The first unit was DOA. I immediately contacted the seller and was given instructions on how to replace it. The replacement came from another company, so it was rather confusing, but the replacement works beautifully.
