review/text: The product started to work but since I moved I lost the cream and didn't use it. But it worked for me, I have dry skin, brown (almost caramel) skin, and the spot was on my neck was dark chocolate brown in color, because of a facial burn at a salon. -.- However, I used this for a month or two and I felt a slow yet gradual change. However, since I lost the cream when I moved to a new place, I never re-ordered it. Its worth it a try.
