review/text: I just purchased this razor and made my first foray into old-fashioned wet shaving. I spent a good while researching the different types of razors available, and pondered long and hard on whether to get this one or Merkur's "Heavy Duty" razor. I'm glad I went with this one, as the weight of the head is just right and I got a nice, easy shave out of it the first time I tried. I prefer the shorter-handle because it encourages me to hold the razor properly and the balance feels a little better than the long-handled ones, but that's all personal preference. On the whole, I love this razor and would buy it again in an instant; I'm not sure why it took me 15 years to try a DE razor, but I'm sure glad I finally did. My Gillette Fusion ProGlide is going back into the medicine cabinet, never to return.
