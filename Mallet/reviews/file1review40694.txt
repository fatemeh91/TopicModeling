review/text: i really like this as a pillow... but the massage action is disappointing. i was hoping it would be more intense.also, the motor on the thing is is very loud, especially on the higher setting. i suppose the noise isn't that much of an issue if you plan to use it on your back, but i hoped to also use it for my neck. anyway, even when using it on my back, it's not the sort of thing i could use in bed without disturbing my partner.
