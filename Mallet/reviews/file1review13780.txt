review/text: I received the product [ OWL LITE ]and found the light that makes the magnifier an "OWL LIGHT" was inoperative. I sent an email to retailer. Their comment was to ask if twisting the card helped [ they were very familiar with the product ] and of course it did not work and why should you twist a credit card light when it was made to use with one hand ?????I sent the product back and it was refused by the retailer.I am now familiar with this particular product and after trying several at a nearby retailer, found they ALL did not light.POOR PRODUCT. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
