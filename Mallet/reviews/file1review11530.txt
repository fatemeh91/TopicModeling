review/text: When used daily, these batteries work fantastic. The downside is how shockingly quick they discharge if let sitting, even for only a couple of days. When I vacation, I take lots of pictures & video. The batteries last me all day and into night. I never once got a low battery warning. Of course, they get rotated out daily & hit the charger nightly. I also bought a 4 pack for my bearcat scanner. I get about 15 hours of continuous on time from the batteries. They too get rotated out, and hit the charger nightly. But the fast self discharge rate bothers me. I am starting to also see that ok, I'll charge them the night before I use them only to find that the useage time has also gotten shorter. The ability to restore to its original capacity seems to be taking a dive. Not good. I have experienced that I have to buy new batteries for my cameras every 6 months. The lower draining portable scanner lasts longer than 6 months. In reading reviews for other similar batteries, It seems to be the nature of batteries of this type. So the bottom line "seems" to be, the more you use them, the more you get out of them. Use them occasionally, and......who knows. I urge all battery makers to start listening to the people who keep them in business.
