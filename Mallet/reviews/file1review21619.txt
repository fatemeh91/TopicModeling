review/text: I purchased this tub in June 2011 and in January 2012 the seams started to fail. I have to blow up the tub each time I want to use it. I temporarily fixed the seam with crazy glue but now it's hopeless. However, the six months that it latest was great...this is a perfect tub for an infant who has learned to sit up by themselves. My daughter is 16 months now and she still loves the tub.
