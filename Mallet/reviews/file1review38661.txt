review/text: I discovered Aubrey Organics just recently and feel in love with their products right away! I try to use only organic products, because they are active, full of goodness, and don't have that nasty petroleum which prevents your skin from regeneration. This mask smells of earth and plants in a good way, it has some particles in it sort of like a scrub, but I try not to rub my skin too hard when applying it because I just had a microdermabrasion done. My aesthetician told me to use hydrating mask, so bought this one. It absorbs really well, after I wash it off, I feel like it has left some sort of protecting layer on my skin, which feels very soft and supple. It doesn't irritate me in the least, even though I am very sensitive.Because I use tonic, eye cream, moisturizer, soothing mask and cleanser - all from Aubrey Organics, I can't tell exactly which product really helps, but I do see very nice improvements of my skin. It looks fresh and firm.
