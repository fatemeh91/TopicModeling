review/text: I'm very happy with the cleaning power of this machine, which I have installed in a shower stall. (So I can't speak for coverage in a larger bathtub area.) I started with a clean shower about a year and a half ago, and using this after every shower has kept it clean. The only trace of mold is down at the very bottom of the shower, a small line of it and not enough to be worried about. The replacement bottles are expensive, but worth it given that I'm *not* buying other cleaners to keep the shower clean, and that I'm doing no work whatever.The only reason I'm taking off a point is because of the battery situation. Another reviewer commented that the shower cleaner eats up batteries quickly. I'm not sure if that's the case. The problem I've had is that the batteries easily become unseated in their compartment, so that a contact isn't made. And it is in fact very difficult when replacing batteries to get them in just right so that they'll work. I've found that tilting the machine in one direction or another when replacing the batteries is sometimes enough to get them lined up just right, but of course it's not something consumers should have to worry about.Otherwise, a great product. I'd definitely recommend.
