review/text: We spend alot of money keeping ourselves entertained with little discs. CDs, DVDs, CD-ROM, PlayStation...so it makes sense that we want to keep all these discs working at top performance.The "Maxell CD Cleaning Cloths" are a safe(lint-free and non-abrasive), easy and econimcal way to keep them dirt and smudge free,insuring a better quality playback.One gentle wipe of your disc may help to eliminate mistracks or sound distortion.The price here, for the quanity is the best I have found. I was paying much more by buying them at my local video store.Although, Amazon's price at this time is just a little higher than some of the merchants here,but when you consider there is free shipping from Amazon, it works out pretty good.And... Don't forget about the CD and DVD players themselves...cleaning the lenses occassionally also helps to improve perfomance. I use and recommend the Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens Cleaner. It does a good job, is reusable,performs optimazation tests(that checks your system), and is a very reasonable price as well.So throw these in your cart, the next time you need just that little extra for the free shipping..and don't forget... always clean your CDs in an outward motion starting from the center(never circular)reviewer update 3/1/11 - These cloths no longer offered direct by Amamzon, can still be found by checking the outside sellers - see upper right on product detail page - to see which ones are now "fulfilled by Amazon" and therefore are eligible for the free shipping option with qualifying amount total($25.00 at this time)Go for it....Laurie
