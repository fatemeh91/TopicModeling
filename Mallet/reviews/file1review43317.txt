review/text: On January 22, 2009 I wrote the following:This is a fabulous product. I had been using the "name brand" blue window cleaner and wanted to switch to an eco-friendly product, so I picked Method's Glass Cleaner. Initially, I sprayed the same amount of cleaner on my windows and glass-topped tables. Way too much! It appears that I need about 50% less product to produce crystal clear, steak-free glass. Saving the environment just a bit means saving money with this product. It works better than the name brand and smells great!I have used 48 bottles of Method Window Cleaner since then. The first 40 were fabulous.Then between my order of November 2010 and my next order in May, 2011 Method changed its formulation. Streaks beyond my imagination! The new formila does not clean! I bought a bottle of Windex -- my old brand -- and my tables and windows were clean again. Then I found a part bottle of the old formulation in a car and brought it in to clean my glass topped table that was streaking with the new formulation.Clean, streak-free glass again!Whatever Method did in re-formulation has changed this product from 5 star to one star.Until Method goes back to the old formulation, I would avoid this product.
