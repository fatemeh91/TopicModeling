review/text: The taste of peroxide was a little bit too evident in the toothpaste and it took a day or two to get used to it. This, however, wouldn't stop me from buying the toothpaste. The toothpaste actually felt like it was cleaning my teeth, even more so than other Colgate toothpastes. It also seems to keep your breath fresher longer than many other toothpastes.
