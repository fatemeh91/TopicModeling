review/text: I have the previous model which seems to be pretty much the same other than for the cosmetics.Mine is at least three years old and gets used at least once a week. I tend to keep my beard short (about a #5 on the adjustment scale) and this trimmer does the job just fine. It cuts evenly and quickly and holds a charge for quite a while.One thing to be aware of is the need to lubricate the blades. I generally do a lube after two uses and I think that this is partially responsable for the reliability. It's also important to flip up the trimmer head and clean out the comparment underneath. A single drop of oil on the motor shaft helps here too. I use Wahl brand trimmer oil and a bottle will last the average user for years.The popup trimmer is a great feature when trimming my moustache as it lets me get into smaller spaces than the main cutter will.I keep wanting to "upgrade" to a more powerful trimmer, but this thing doesn't want to quit.
