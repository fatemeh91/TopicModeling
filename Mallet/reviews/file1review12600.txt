review/text: This product is advertised to be a colon cleanser. Yet when I received the bottle it says it is for constipation. This is not one of my problems. I took the product and then became what I thought was constipated. (loose stools). I called the company and was told this is normal and to stick with it. Well, I took all these capsules, and did not feel more energetic, do not believe my colon could possibly have been any cleaner, did not lose one ounce, felt bloated. The company person said it works for 98% of the people. IF this is so, I am one of the 2% that it absolute did not work for. An absolute waste of time and money, and this is from a person who has used other colon cleansers and eats fresh, wholesome, foods, no meat and exercises regularly. It took me about four days to get back "regular" after trying this product. I cannot recommend this product.
