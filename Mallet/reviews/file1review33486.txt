review/text: I have used variations of this Waterpik product for over 40 years and most last years before needing to be replaced. In the past two months I have replaced two and am on my third. The motor slows then stalls never to start again. Of course, they are within warranty but I can't be without the oral irrigation for the length of time required by repair. It's sad to see what had been such a good product deteriorate so terribly.
