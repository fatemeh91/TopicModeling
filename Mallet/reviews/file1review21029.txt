review/text: I have used these capsules for years and they have helped me immensely. My problem with dry eyes started when I was practicing law and spending long hours staring at the Code of Federal Regulations. A thrill for anyone. At that time I took one capsule a day and did fine. As I have gotten older, I now take 3 per day and need them in order to have comfort when reading. I also have great cholesterol readings despite a family history of heart problems. I think the fish oils in these capsules have helped my cholesterol and I know they have helped my eyes.No supplement works for everyone. I try something and then quit. If I see no difference, I stop taking that one. These make a difference for me and I make sure I am not without them. If you have dry eyes, they are definitely worth trying. You never know. You might see no difference, so you move on to another treatment. You might be like me and become a lifelong devotee.
