review/text: This is the kit you want to buy for hunting, hiking, and any real outdoor activity i haven't had a chance to use it thank god but still its nice to know its there when my uncle went hunting with a buddy a log fell on his leg, don't know how, but it broke his leg in 2 and he had one of these kit to stop the pain, do an emergency tourniquet, and reduce the swelling for a while he told me that after 30 min he could stop the swelling because it was just to much. when he got to the hospital the doctor told my uncle that he pretty much saved his friends leg. thats why i choose this kit from that story he told me and i hope never to use it but i rather be safe then sorry. he was ok by the way but it was the last day he ever went hunting again but still loves to go camping and takes a kit with him every time.
