review/text: Pros: Supper Long battery life, adjustable guardCons: Didn't know I could take the guard all the way off at firstI love this beard trimmer. It does not have a bunch of different guards that I always end up breaking or losing when swapping them out. The one adjustable guard makes using the trimmer quick and easy. Also I was surprised by the battery life of this trimmer. I have had it for over 6 months and only have only charged it a few times with pretty regular use. Love it!
