review/text: I have alway bought Tweezerman brand but I thought I would buy a S*** brand which is more money. I was really disappointed. It did not grab the hair but slid right off each time. So I had found this yellow Tweezerman at amazon~so I figured I'd give it a try. It works every time. I like the precision of it even better than the straight or the slanted tweezer which I also own. Nothing to get in the way of seeing what you are extracting. You do not have to press excessively to get results, just gentle pressure. It is not just for ingrown hair it is an all purpose tweezer tool for wife and me. Will always buy this one and happy it was way less money, too!
