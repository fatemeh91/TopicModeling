review/text: The Jeanie Rub variable speed model is POWERFUL! The post mounted accessories are important; so too is the variable speed option. Ok, so they cost a few more bucks but they do more than vibrate a flat surface - they penetrate deeper. Be careful and don't overdo it too soon. Gentle applications at first and the soreness began to disappear. Over the period of a week and my lower back pain diminished to just a minor annoyance. The 'U' shaped attachment did wonders for my stiff neck and acheing shoulders. I could rattle on but if you aren't convinced by now - sorry.
