review/text: My wife and I got turned on to the 38g packs (meal replacements). Our trainer told us the story of the Met-Rx company and the Metamyosyn protein formula. We totally enjoyed this product but were looking for lower carbs (and VERY low sugar). This product is it. You cannot beat the Metamyosyn formula if you're looking to add protein to your diet. We take one scoop in the morning, one at lunch, one after workout and sometimes one scoop before bed time.This product isn't nearly as "tasty" as the meal replacement. But I simply add a pinch of Stevia sweetener to this to make it more enjoyable.For a cold treat: I add two or three frozen strawberries to 10-12oz of cold filtered water (the more strawberries used the more water needed) in the blender and run it on Ice Crush mode first. Then add one or two scoops on blend mode and a pinch of stevia to sweeten for a delicious after-workout treat.To start my day: same recipe as above but add a half of a (ripe) banana!This will expand a little as air is whipped into the drink therefore it's best to add the powder last.(for extra chocolate... add a half teaspoon of coca powder.. still sugar free!)&lt;-watch out for the extra caffeine in this recipe.Enjoy!
