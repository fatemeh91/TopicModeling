review/summary: not for a gummy texture lover review/text: My son prefers gummy vitamins & this is proving to be difficult for him to "swallow". I read the reviews & researched vitamin ingredients, etc. & hoped this one could be the one, but it's only been a few weeks.... HIS initial comment after tasting it was "This is yucky, I don't like it."
