review/text: We found this to be an effective and inexpensive option. Our daughter feels secure on it, which is the most important thing, and it's easy to clean. This actually was our second one, for the downstairs bathroom, after the first one worked so well. Get the stool w/ it--it's lightweight yet she feels very steady and secure on it, she takes it w/ her all over the house.
