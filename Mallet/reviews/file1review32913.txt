review/text: SmoothMove accomplishes its purpose, but after only five uses over 6-8 weeks my large intestine feels irritated and my usually efficient digestive process has been thoroughly disrupted. The nurse who recommended it didn't warn me to try brewing it only five minutes or less at first try; I didn't find that out until it was too late. BTW, I had to take this because of hydrocodon side effects. Be very cautious about using this product: senna is nothing to fool around with.
