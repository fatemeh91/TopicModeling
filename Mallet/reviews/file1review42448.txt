review/text: I've been using Probios for years on a variety of pets and livestock on my farm. The quality of the product is excellent, and I appreciate the two-ended scoop that gives me dosing options.I like to order items in bulk, but unfortunately need to purchase this in smaller lots than I like because of the packaging. The jar doesn't seal well and doesn't come with a moisture-absorbing pouch, so the powder quickly cakes up if there's any ambient humidity at all, making it unusable after a short period of time. I would encourage the manufacturer to both make the lid on the jar more airtight and include a moisture-absorber in the jar.This is a five-star product but is getting a four-star review from me because of the packaging issues and the loss of product I have experienced because of the packaging. I shouldn't have to throw out what would otherwise be fresh product or find my own moisture-absorbing pouch to put in a product I pay a premium price for.
