review/text: Do not love anything about this product other than the smell and the bottle. The spray doesn't wipe up like windex and takes forever to actually dry. Don't see any impressive results to make the aggravation while cleaning actually worth it. I really wanted to love this because I love that it smells like mint, love the bottle and love method products. But, I am going to keep the bottle and buy the windex refill to use in it. :)
