review/text: I have bought orthotic insoles by Phaze 4 in the past and was happy with them. These "new and improved" models are terrible...The arch is so high I cannot wear them in any of the shoes I have without being terrible painful...I can stand the arch, but they make my shoes too tight...The older model I bought was nearly identical to the more expensive ones I had bought at the Good Feet Store. The new model is completely different, and not in a good way.
