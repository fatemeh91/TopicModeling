review/text: As 'NLee the Engineer' noted: "[These batteries] long term self-discharge rate is disappointing."That's exactly my experience. I purchased these for using with Wii remotes, and they become discharged within a couple weeks of light use. The remote sensor on battery life also cannot give an accurate reading with these, which leads me to believe that they cannot maintain a proper voltage... perhaps there's still juice left, but if the batteries are unable to maintain a stable and proper voltage, then the cannot run many devices that require AA batteries.I've found these to be on par with much cheaper rechargeable batteries that I've purchased. I won't buy Sony batteries again.
