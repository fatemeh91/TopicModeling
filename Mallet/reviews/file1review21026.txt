review/text: I bought my first aroma neck wrap in the Westchester Mall from a vendor in a booth. The product was made in Israel and we have enjoyed using it for years. Now the market is filled with cheap imitations that don't quite measure up. These are just OK, not wonderful. They don't seem well sewn or properly filled. But, for $20 you get exactly what you pay for.
