review/text: This funny looking apparatus does work. It will reach the trigger points in your back and there is no doubt when you hit them. To use it properly you need to also get a book on Trigger Point Therapy. I have the one by Clair Davies and while technical,it tells you what you need to do. I also have the small theracane but it can't compare to what this unit can do. Overall it is well worth the price at half the cost of one massage.
