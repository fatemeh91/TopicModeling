review/text: In my clinical experience I have used many different types of stethoscopes and the Ad-scope has the best sound quality and versatility of any of them. The only problem I have is that the bell is so heavily made to last that it's not balanced around my neck and tends to hang down and fall off while I'm performing my duties. That being said, I still find the quality of the product to outweigh any of the downfalls it may have. The selection of ear pieces helps me find just the right fit for my needs. I will always pick this brand even above the more expensive litman scopes.
