review/text: This is my first time using a power toothbrush, but I'm definitely glad I spent a little extra to get this one. It's a great toothbrush! My teeth feel very clean and look better than ever, and the floss action power heads work amazingly well (though I still floss). The 30 second timer for each zone is actually very handy. The polisher works wonders as well. I use the polisher in the morning and the floss action at night.As for cons, I have one beef: the battery. Why do companies insist on making products with rechargable batteries that can't be replaced, as if they have an infinite lifetime? The manual comes right out and says the product life-cycle for this is 2 years, so I expect 2 years from this battery. If not, I expect them to replace the brush/battery.At any rate, I didn't find this brush bulky, hard to use, or heavy. I'd highly recommend it.
