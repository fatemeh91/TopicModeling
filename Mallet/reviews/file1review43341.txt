review/text: I use this product in combination with a stainless steel microfiber cloth and it works perfectly. In fact, my seven year old cleaned all of our stainless appliances this morning in less than 15 minutes. Little elbow grease required. I have tried using a cotton cloth and it does not work as well. Spend five bucks on the stainless microfiber cloth Method sells. Worth it!
