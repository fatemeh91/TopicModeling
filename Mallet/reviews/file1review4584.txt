review/text: NOT HAPPY AT ALL with the Fusion! I thought it would be the best razor ever (based on the quality and reputation of the Gillette brand and all that advertising). Did not give me a close shave at all and found the razor catridges to be duller than previous models (like the MACH5 and Turbo). The ONLY good feature was the single blade on the reverse side - great for evening out side-burns, but other than that I do NOT reccommend. I switced back to the MACH5!!!
