review/text: We bought a $3K GE Cafe professional drop in stove in stainless steel - I was worried about keeping the burners clean since our last stove was a nightmare to clean. The stove came with a 2 oz trial size Cerama Bryte cleaner, which was amazing! Even being careful, I am still not used to the high boil burners on this stove and had boiled potatoes spill over, and some really nasty BBQ sauce from a boiled chicken dish--really looked nasty, burnt on greasy, and no hope of cleaning. I waited until the cooktop cooled off, applied a little of the cleaner and scrubbed gently with a wet paper towel - gone, clean, good as new! I still can't believe how good this stuff works and how good my new stove looks. I'm ordering a large bottle but keeping my 2 oz size to keep near the stove for cleaning. If you have a stainless cooktop, you have to try this--it's amazing!
