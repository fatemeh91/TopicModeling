review/text: This thing worked fine when I first got it. However, it quit working when I dropped it in the sink once. The drop wasn't more than a couple of feet from the medicine cabinet into the sink (and WITH the cover on), but much to my surprise, the darn thing just stopped working completely. It's too bad since I did like it while it worked. Like another reviewer said, for the price I paid, it's not worth the hassle of returning it or trying to fix it. In fact, I did already spend some time trying to see what went wrong, but it's still messed up. I would stay away from it, or at least, drop test it a couple of times before you decide to keep it.
