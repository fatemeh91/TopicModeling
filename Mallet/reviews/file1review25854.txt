review/text: I feel a little ridiculous writing a review about a shaver; even so, this is the best electronic appliance I've bought in YEARS. I compare this shaver to my first Microwave oven and my first color TV set.Like a lot of guys, I figured my choice was (1) put up with blood spewing from nicks and cuts, esp. around my chin and nose; or (2) razor burns from electric shavers that would leave broad patches of beard unshaven.This razor rocks! I use it wet, with either soap or what's left of my canned shave cream. I use it daily, and use it like a grid (across and then up and down, or visa versa --it' morning and I don't give a damn). From day 1 I got a decent shave, and only once (day 3) I got carried away and drew a few pricks of blood. It never happened again.I love this product. I hated shaving, but hated the itchiness of a beard even more (not to mention the comparisons of me to Jesus Christ, which is even more disturbing to a secular humanist like myself). This shaver does the job,isn't noisy, won't burn your skin and no longer does the water run red.Next, I want a 1/2 inch deep color monitor, 40 x 60 feet, without any loss of color or depth perception.
