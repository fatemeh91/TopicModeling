review/text: I was being recommended by my dentist to get this type of dental floss holder to floss my rear bottom teeth which I had been having problem with. Typical floss pick which is short cannot effectively clean those rear bottom teeth. I was trying to search around my neighborhood for such a design but unfortunately did not manage to find any. Amazon.com offer this with free shipping which I think it is a good deal for a set of clean teeth.
