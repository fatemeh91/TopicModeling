review/text: I bought Omron HEM-711AC after reading all the good reviews. My only test if the unit is good is to check the blood pressure in both arms. If you get consistent results most of the time then you can believe the unit. In this case most of the time the reading were not consistent. Even the manafacturer recommends that you average out your last 3 readings.On any rate I returned it after testing it with all of my family memberes.
