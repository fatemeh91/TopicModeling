review/text: I like this deodorant because it's all natural. It don't have anything harmful in it like the other brands that are out there on the market. The smell seems kinda feminine, I guess that's the aloe that I'm smelling? Just something I will just have to get used to because I'm not switching back to the other brands.Also, this is not really waterproof, a little bit of water will take it off. So don't go around shooting super soakers and expect to still smell like a princess :P
