review/text: When these first came out, I thought they were great. In fact, I couldn't believe how well they got stains out. I was very impressed. I always carried one in my purse as I spill stuff on my shirt DAILY. Yes, daily. I'm that messy.However, not too long into their production cycle, I noticed they changed the material of the tips of these pens. Initially, they were a kind of felt material. A tad absorbent. Now they are hard plastic and I feel this is the reason these no longer work for me. Ever since they changed the tip material, I have been really disappointed with how these pens perform. What I'm left with now every time I try and get a stain out is a two-tiered stain; the larger stain where the Tide liquid expanded to and the original stain itself. Hard to know which is worse - my now larger-in-size and faded two-tiered stain or the original stain itself. Think about it: when you get a stain on something, using something absorbent really helps blot out the stain. With this plastic tip, all you're doing is spreading the stain out to a larger area. I remember when I first used these, the tip would get slightly off-colored...it was absorbing the stain.Until they switch back to a felt tip, I'm done with these. They are a huge waste of money and succeed only in lightening the stain a little and creating a larger, off-colored surrounding stain.
