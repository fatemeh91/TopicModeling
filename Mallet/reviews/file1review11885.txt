review/text: We have been purchasing this product from our local Vitamin Shoppe for the past year. Just this week when I went to purchase, I was informed they were no longer stocking it in their stores. It has been a very reliable product in aiding mild colon disorder's from irritable bowel syndrome. Has been far more superior than any prescription agent or alternative supplement's on the market. No cramping, abdominal discomfort or bowel urgency associated with this product. 1 tea bag at night before bedtime is how we use it.
