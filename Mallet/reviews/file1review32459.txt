review/text: Unfortunately this "universal" cooler from BJ is not designed to work with their City Select model. I ordered it anyway and have found that if you are using the brackets for the 2nd seat attachment you can attach it backwards to those and the cooler bag will be stable, accessible and outside the storage basket. It's not the way it was designed but it works good enough.BJ really needs to modify the design to fit the City Select as it is an awesome stroller.
