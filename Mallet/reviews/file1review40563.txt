review/text: This whole black seed was no longer available although it didn't say so when I ordered it and they sent me two bottles of the ground instead of one ground and one whole. I am using these to replace cumin in cooking and was upset. The bottles are HUGE. I will not use up even one bottle of the ground before it loses its flavor. The supplier was very accommodating and returned the purchase price for the one bottle of the whole seed I didn't get in the order. Nor did I have to send back one of the bottles of ground black seed. Overall it was a good experience but feel they should remove the whole seed from the web if it is no longer being made.
