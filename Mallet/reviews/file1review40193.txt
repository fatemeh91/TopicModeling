review/text: In general, I liked this toothpaste. It had a nice mint flavor and was very mild on my sensitive teeth. It left my teeth feeling smooth and clean after use, but didn't leave a fresh aftertaste that other brands leave. The mint flavor seemed to just disappear after rinsing and left really no taste at all. I think after a week's use my teeth are a little brighter, but not really noticeably whiter -- although, that may come with longer use. I'd recommend this product for someone with sensitive teeth or gums. Just use a little mouthwash after brushing for a fresh tasting mouth!
