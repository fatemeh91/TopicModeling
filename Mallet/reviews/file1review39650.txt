review/text: Great device for getting between tight teeth using the floss of your choice, such as Glide.I hated flossing before because I could never get at my molars without apparently using feet of Glide around my fingers to prevent slippage and placing my ever present thumbs in the way to work it between the teeth. That's in the past now.TeethNThings carry good dental products at reasonable prices. Keep up the good work.
