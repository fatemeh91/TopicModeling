review/text: I bought the toothbrush refill to replace the head a few months after I bought the Sonic complete brush. So my comments are not just for the head. In fact, it is the toothbrush that matters. The sonic complete toothbrush is very efficient and comfortable to use and keep my teeth cleaner than regular toothbrush. The toothbrush feels like the sonicating cleaning.
