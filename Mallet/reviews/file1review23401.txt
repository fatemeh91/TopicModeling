review/text: I ordered this stethoscope through Amazon and was very happy with it for two weeks. (I am a Respiratory Therapist) Then one day I placed the CLEAR RED HEART on a patient's chest to listen to breath sounds and my eyes saw a terribly chipped and cracked RED HEART. I had no idea how it had been damaged. I contacted Amazon & sent it back and they had a brand new one back in my hands in less than a week. Three days later, I was cleaning it off with alcohol after a "CODE-BLUE" and the RED HEART chipped and cracked right infront of my eyes with red flakes popping off the surface of the HEART and several deep cracks penatrating half way through the entire heart. The plastic must not be tolerant to alcohol. I returned it to Amazon for a refund.Prestige Medical Clear Sound Heart Stethoscope, Black
