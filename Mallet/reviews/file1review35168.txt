review/text: Seriously. It's like eating a real candy bar. It is so rich and satisfying that I can sometimes get away with just half a bar as a snack. I say sometimes, because having half a bar this tasty just sitting there is usually too much temptation. The mini bars are better for that.Here's a little "trick" that will make each bar last longer and leave you feeling fuller. Drink at least 8 oz of water, hot water works better, and then have your bar or half a bar. Repeat in 1-2 hours.There is no chalky or artificial taste and no aftertaste - none. These are even better than the regular power bars that are not low sugar or artificially sweetened.I don't know how they are for moderating blood sugar levels as they claim, but I felt more satisfied and less hungry for longer than with other bars, including real candy bars.Here's the nutritional breakdown of the ones I've tried so far. Sod-sodium, Pot=potassium. . Oz . Cal/Fat . . Sod . . . Pot . . . . Flavor. 0.70 . 060/25 . 060mg . 050mg . Chocolate peanut mini bar. 2.04 . 210/50 . 085mg . 210mg . Chocolate chunk bar. 1/41 . 150/35 . 150mg . 080mg . Chocolate caramel snack barMy preferences are in order:Chocolate Chunk: A slightly crunchy texture that's a little like a Rice Crispies treat. I think the crunchiness comes from something they call "soy protein nuggets. This is my favorite. Just like a really good candy bar.Chocolate Peanut: Very nice combination of chocolate and peanut, chewy and crunchy. This is a close second.Chocolate Caramel: A crunchy texture that is much more like a Rice Crispies treat. This one has "crisp soy nuggets". It has a strong caramel flavor, which is not my favorite, but I bet caramel lovers will like it.Variety Pack: Only two flavors: Chocolate Peanut and Chocolate Caramel. Not much variety and all chocolate. It would have been nice to have gotten a box of blueberry, oatmeal raisin, and/or cinnamon bun
