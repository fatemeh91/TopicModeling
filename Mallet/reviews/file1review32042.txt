review/text: At the time I ordered my first set of these, I'd been suffering from painful plantar fasciitis symptoms for some time and had already tried a variety of solutions to no avail. I had read that that shoe inserts like this might not help the problem, so they weren't my first option. But finally, I went with my intuition and decided to give them a try despite the conflicting information I'd been seeing online.My feet started feeling better within a month or two. And here I am, three years later, ordering another pair. Just to be clear, that first set lasted me three years.
