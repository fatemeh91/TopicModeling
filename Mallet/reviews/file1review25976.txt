review/text: I am about to purchase my 3rd mask in 8 years. They have evolved over time and the one now is better than the original one I had - now the plastic is less brittle than the old ones.I am surprised that the other reviewers say that it is not designed to fit their faces, as I know several people who use them and we all have different shaped faces and we all love them.Especially good for those early summer mornings, or if you want to take a good afternoon nap, or if you are trying to sleep on a plane.I particularly like the way the foam is cut out for the eyes, so you can open your eyes without them being squashed like other masks do.
