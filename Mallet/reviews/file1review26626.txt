review/text: Got this to help with air travel after a tough back surgery. The product worked perfectly for me. Easy to inflate, but also easy to adjust. Inflate to a little more than needed and then lean back on the cushion and squeeze the air valve to release air until the support feels comfortable. Folds up into a small bundle and stows easily in the supplied storage bag. Great value for the money.
