review/text: I bought the cloth to clean my Oakley sunglasses which I am paranoid as hell about scratching. I have used many cloths that don't work all that well and that I would never trusted to clean my sunglasses. Until now I have only trusted Oakley's own cleaning cloths. The cloth has a very fine, almost silky feel to it that works great and doesn't pick up dirt or anything large that would cause the lenses to get scratched. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
