review/text: I have been using this product for several years (still TTC, keeping the faith)... and the vitamins are top quality. I love everything about this product. Unfortunately, this most recent order was placed in January and it is now February 8th... and still hasn't been shipped to me. The company says it's on backorder, but that was only after I had emailed them with my concerns. They did not initiate contact to let me know of the delay ahead of time. Now I have only 3 vitamins left, and they tell me they will not be shipping until next week. Not happy with this seller.
