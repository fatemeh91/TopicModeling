review/text: The product description says "Glucosamine 1500 mg, Chondroitin 800 mg, MSM 750mg Caplets" & "each tablet containing 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine and 800 milligrams of chrondroitin". I am looking at the bottle I just got, and it says each caplet contains: 750 mg of glucosamine, 145 mg of chrondroitin and NO MSM. It does, however, have 5 mg of Hyaluronic Acid per caplet. It seems to be a different product than advertised.
