review/text: The deodorant I received had a expiration date of October 2012. I ordered the product in November 2012. I'm still going to keep and use it. It probably will still work. I like this deodorant, it works for me where the newer kind that say clear do not. I was not able to get to Target, which is where I usually buy it. I guess this is the price you pay for convenience.
