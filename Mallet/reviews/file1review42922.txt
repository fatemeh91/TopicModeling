review/text: The thing I like best about this cleaner is that it doesn't scratch surfaces like most cleansers do. I can use it on my glass cooktop stove without harming the surface, or in my sink or shower stall without worrying about it damaging the tile. Their website says they are "made with a naturally safe ash and oxygen bleach for use on tile, stainless steel, professional cookware, porcelain fixtures and more". I know that oxygen bleach or sodium percarbonate does a great job of cleaning and isn't toxic and I use it in other products for laundry and carpet cleaning and that it's safe for the environment. That's probably why this stuff cleans so well. This powdered scrub is a fine granulation.The other thing I like about this surface scrub is the fragrance. It's fairly strong, but not over the top like a few of their other products. While I like the scent of their geranium counter spray, it's just way too strong when you're doing a lot of cleaning in a room. The fragrance of this scrub is pleasant, kind of like basil but also some type of floral scent in it. If I hadn't seen the label I don't know if I would have guessed that it would be called basil, but whatever it is, I like it. The product is kind of expensive for what it is, but I find that I don't have to use much, a little goes a long way. And anything that can make house cleaning more pleasant is worth it in my book.
