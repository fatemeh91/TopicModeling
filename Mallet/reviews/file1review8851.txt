review/text: The taste of Green Vibrance is far superior to the other major green powder that I had been using. Also I like the fact that they detail the ingredients and amount of each in the product. Also you can actually read the label. The other drink I was using had print so small you could barely read it with a magnifying glass and they did not detail the ingredients other than listing the ingredients (but without precise measurements of each). I will stick with Green Vibrance from now on.
