review/text: I have recent decided to grow out my beard and need something to clean it up a little. This product was on sell for 15 bucks or something like that and already had great reviews. I have also used this to trim the hair over my 4 year old's ear in between hair cuts. The guard that is part of the unit doesn't slip off like other models i have used and I feel comfortable using it on my face and my sons hair. There are 9 levels that the trimmer can be set to as well. Great Product for someone looking to maintain a nice clean beard.
