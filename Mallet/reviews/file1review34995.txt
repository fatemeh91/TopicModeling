review/text: I have always had a little indigestion, and as I get older it seems to have gotten worse. Up to now I have used ant-acid tablets like Digel or Tums for acid-reflux. I finally decided to seek out medical help and after several tests my Doctor prescribed a powerful medication, Nexium, for what I felt was a minor discomfort. After reading the side effects of such and expensive drug, I decided to seek out other alternatives. My wife seen DGL Ultra on the Doctor Oz Show. I thought, for the price I wanted to see what it did for me. My doctor told me to keep an eye on my blood pressure to see if it increased. After a month of use I have not noticed any change. The directions for the product are simple enough. Just take 20 minutes before meal time. I like the fact that you take it before a meal, instead of afterwards when you are having problems. I like the taste and it had a positive effect not only on my stomach but my entire digestive system. If you are having issues with indigestion, I would highly recommend you try this product. It&#8217;s way cheaper than the Doctor and all the testing I went through. If it doesn&#8217;t help, then spend big bucks on the exams and Nexium. Good luck.
