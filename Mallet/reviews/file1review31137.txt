review/text: As another review said, it is too good to be true.I got one and everything they said is true. The batteries are hard to remove. It doesn't turn off and the cap needs to be unscrewed to turn it off. The 7-speed functions don't work, it's either on or off.I thought it might just have a glitch and tried to work on it, but it is such a piece of junk there is no fixing it.I definitely recommend you spend a couple more dollars and get something better.
