review/text: I've bought more of these blue-packaged Crown condoms from other suppliers since this particular purchase, and all of them have been fantastic. Every one has "made in Thailand" on the package even though I've read reviews saying the ones made there (instead of Japan) were really bad. I've never had the Japanese-made type, so maybe I'm naive, but these are much thinner than anything I've tried before, only lightly lubed (tip: supply your own, condom burns hurt) and have not broken once. They are tight (especially at the base) for an above-average dude, but not terribly uncomfortable. From a female perspective, it's very close to nothing at all. We tested out a few different condoms and these are our favorite, hands-down.
