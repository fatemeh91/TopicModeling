review/text: My son's dog is the ideal dog with one exception. He sheds like crazy! I can vacuum the wood floor but the furniture turns into a furry mess when he rubs against it. I've bought every gadget that I could find to try to deal with this with no avail. This vacuum pulls the hair from the fabric with little time and effort. The rubber nubs instead of bristles on the brush really do the trick. I hope that larger vacuums will follow with this concept.
