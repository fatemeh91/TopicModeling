review/text: I bought this unit because another reviewer said it gave consistent readings and was of good quality. Unfortunately, neither is the case with mine.Readings vary considerably from test to test, and a level of 0.000 has been returned more than once after a drink or two, so I have little confidence in its accuracy.Not only that, but it's fashioned from flimsy plastic which doesn't hold itself together well enough for the battery cover to stay on by itself. The "CE" logo looks fake, and the whole item feels very cheaply made indeed.Could be I just got unlucky. Either way, a waste of a hundred bucks.
