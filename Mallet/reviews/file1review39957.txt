review/text: I like the Solgar and the Jay Robb whey products a lot. The Solgar, however, is a much better price. This is a very clean protein with some nice extras like L-Glutamine and BCAAs. It isn't inexpensive but it is worth it simply because of the high quality.I disagree with the folks slamming the new formulation for containing soy. It contains less than 1% of Soy Lecithin - lecithin being good in and of itself. They clearly aren't "cutting" the nice pure whey protein with cheaper soy protein.Also, I don't know why anyone would say that they are using artificial sweeteners - the only flavorings are "natural vanilla and caramel flavors". This is one of the best-tasting whey products on the market and is very delicious without being sweet.
