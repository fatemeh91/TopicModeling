review/text: I got it because it was cheap and heck why not. I went from a 48inch around the stomach to 35inches by taking these pills as directed, working out 4 times a week (45-60min at a time) and eating more veggies (but still having some sweets regardless. Haven't taken them in a while but also haven't seen much of an increase in my stomach girth, which is nice.
