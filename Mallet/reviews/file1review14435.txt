review/text: This is really cool. Very good carving. My wish is that it came painted like the second picture shown. But that was apparently done by the consumer. I sometimes stand in front of a mirror wielding it and yell something like "I SUMMON DEMONS" or "SMITE MY ENEMIES". I guess I play to many RPGs.I have 2 minor complaints. First there is a definite line showing that the head and shaft where carved from different pieces of wood. Second, if you NEED a cane for walking comfort, the head has rough, kinda sharp edges that can be uncomfortable to the hand if you need to put weight on it. However, the description states that it is not for "medical use", so it's really designed to be a set piece.
