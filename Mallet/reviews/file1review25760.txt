review/text: What a terrific little product! The ER411NC is a compact little groomer that does what you want it to do quickly and painlessly. The blades are sharp, but never bind or hurt. The cap fits snugly and includes air holes on top (the unit is immersible, so this allows it to dry). The cap also keeps the switch from accidentally turning on and running the battery down if it gets bounced around in your luggage or a drawer. As I get older, hair seems to pop out everywhere (except the top of my head ;-), and this little tool keeps it trimmed better than any shaver can. I'm not prone to giving out 5 stars, but I truly consider this Panasonic to be perfect in every way!
