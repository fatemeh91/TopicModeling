review/text: My previous mode of hair removal was through waxing....waxing, though painless on my hands and legs, used to be a literal torture on my underarms. Also due to the pain could never do it on my own so used to shave...but the results were not the same and also you have to shave every other day. I was on the lookout for an alternate, cheaper, and less painful method of hair removal, especially for my underarms and came across Braun 3370. I must say I am very very happy with the results. The results are way better than shaving; as good as waxing, without the hassles. I am also delighted by the fact that the pain is much lower than waxing and the occasional bleeding that used to occur does not happen and I can do my underarms all by myself (Though it did help that 2 weeks before I used the epilator I had waxed my undearms; so the growth was not as thick and coarse as it is with a razor). Needless to say its great on my hands and legs; quite pain free. I used the pain decreasing attachment only the first time...then stopped it...felt it wasn't necessary...In fact it was much better without it at the higher speed...On a side note, I have noticed that though it plucks out most of the hair, it does tend to clip some of them. Hence, its not as good as waxing in the sense that you do it once and forget about it for 3 weeks. I am right now epilating my underarms once in 10 days...but I am not complaining sure beats the pains of waxing and the lousy results of shaving!!
