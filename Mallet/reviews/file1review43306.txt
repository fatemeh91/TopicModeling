review/text: Trying to go green and use earth friendly things. So I thought I'd try this window cleaner. UPS delievered it yesterday and I started cleaning shortly after. Works great! I started on the outside windows as those are the dirtiest. This stuff even cleaned the white caulk around our replacement windows. I don't have streaks and I used cheap paper towels.The bottle is made from 100% recycled bottles. Oh and the smell...to me it smells just like Scope mouthwash.I would highly recommend Method Window Cleaner. I'm going to try their furniture polish next.
