review/text: My friend, Ruth Mast, gave me a bottle of these. Being on the end of alternative medicine, I was not skeptical. However, I did know that the doctor had said that my pain would be chronic. I've had loss of energy and chronic pain since a bad car wreck almost two years ago. After an hour and a half of taking ONE CAPSULE, I was cleaning my house and had the zest that I had once had. I do not that I am still having sciatic pain while sitting here, so I will see what happens after taking the capsules for a month.
