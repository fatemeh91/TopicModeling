review/text: Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Protein is without a doubt, the BEST protein supplement on the market! I have tried both the vanilla and chocolate flavors, each being superbly delicious in their own fashions.The vanilla is rather smooth and creamy when mixed with milk and also does very well when mixed with smoothies. However, the chocolate is my favorite of the two. It is surprisingly rich and flavorful that makes you craving for more!Overall, you cannot go wrong with this product. With 23 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs per serving, this is the ultimate protein supplement drink on the market today.
