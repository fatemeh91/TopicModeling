review/text: I have had my Emjoi AP99 for about a year now and it is the best investment I ever made! I was shaving almost everyday and would have stubble within hours. Now I use it probably once a month and when the hair grows back its so soft that you will NEVER feel prickly stubble again. In fact, I cant even tell when I need to shave except by looking because you cant feel the hair on your legs. This product really works as good as it says it does. The shape makes it a little difficult to hold without it slipping once in a while but once you get used to it its fine. As far as pain, yes, it does hurt the first few times you use it but after that its not bad at all. I suggest doing little spots at a time and holding the skin tight, it helps. Once you use it a few times it doesnt hurt. I have graduated to the bikini & underarms and its not painful at all. This is a great product and worth every penny!
