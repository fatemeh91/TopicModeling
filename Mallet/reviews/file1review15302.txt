review/text: My vet prescribed digestive enzymes for my 8-year-old cat Bert, who suffers from irritable bowel disease. We tried many different feline enzymes (and spent a lot of money on them) before finding one Bert would actually eat mixed in with his food. The white powder is completely odorless and apparently tasteless, and it is the only enzyme product I am able to get into him. It has helped him a great deal. He's slowly started gaining back some weight, and his digestive upset episodes are much less frequent. There are other quality cat enzymes available, but I highly recommend Dr. Goodpet Feline Enzymes if you are having trouble getting your taste-sensitive cat to eat his enzymes. I should also mention that all 3 of my cats will eat it in their food, a true testament to its being pallitable!
