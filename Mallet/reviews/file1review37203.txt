review/text: The thermoskin material is wonderful for compression needed, but the gloves do not fit across the hand very well to give compression all over, were it's needed. I cut all the fingers off, and use them that way. The fingers also work on the toes. I would not buy them again, due to the fact they are to expensive!!! Customer service is horrible! I would NOT recommend buying these
