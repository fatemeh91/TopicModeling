review/text: this is the best tasting protein shake I've had thus far. It is on the more expensive side. But it taste great. Only 3grams of sugar 41grams of protein. What makes it different from other protein shakes is that it contains fat burners. Great for gastric bypass patients. Befor and after surgery. Worth the money. Banana cream is the best. FYI if you want to use your blender bottle for the best results put the wire ball in the bottle add the protein powder then add about 2-3 oz of hot water just from the tap is hot enough then shake the add 10 oz more or less depending on how thick u want it then shake. Your shake will be smooth and fluffy. Still the electric blender is better but this is a quick fix may still have some lumps but. Not as many. Happy slimming
