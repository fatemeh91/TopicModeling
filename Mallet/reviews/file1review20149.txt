review/text: I take DIM for endometriosis and estrogen dominance, and after trying five or six supplements, I've discovered that this is the best one, here's why: If you look carefully, you'll see that you have to take 8 Nature's Way DIM capsules per day to get 100mg of DIM (2 of their capsules are 100mg, 25% (25mg) of which is DIM = 8 capsules = 100mg DIM). I found I had to take anywhere from 2-10 capsules of other brands to get the amount I needed, and not all of them were as potent or effective as this brand. This supplement is 1 pill = 100mg of potent DIM. Saves money and pill-swallowing!
