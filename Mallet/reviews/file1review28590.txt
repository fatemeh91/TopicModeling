review/text: So many reviewers discussed the ingredients and benefits in detail, so I won't rehash that.Bottom line: I like the taste of this product. If you like Nestles Quick, you'll probably like this. I mix it in a shaker cup using low fat milk. No lumps, no grit, no odd aftertaste. I will purchase the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor again.
