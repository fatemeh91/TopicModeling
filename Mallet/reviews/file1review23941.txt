review/text: I purchased two secondary brand batteries for my Olympus C5060 camera. The price was very good and I thought I was getting a good deal. These batteries lasted one month and then started to indicate low battery after two shots.I have purchased an Olympus BLM-01 and I am getting very good performance.Beware sometimes the deal that looks too good to be true usually isn't
