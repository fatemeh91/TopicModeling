review/text: The short version: Awesome, buy it.The long version: I had another Oral-B electric that was a few years old and finally bit the dust. I had seen the SonicCare brush at my dentist's office and originally intended to buy that. However after some browsing I noticed that the Oral-B has just as many vibrations/cycles per minute as the SonicCare. Based on the great job my old Oral-B did, and the new, faster speed it was a no brainer.I also recommend the "floss action" brush heads, they're nice.
