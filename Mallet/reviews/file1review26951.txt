review/text: This isn't a review for the Coffee flavoured protein powder (though I'd really LOVE to try it sometime!) but I'm too excited to put this anywhere else right now lolz.I received my On OP Chocolate Mint Whey Protein powder and it's my favourite flavour so far! I've been using the Gold Standard On Protein products on and off for years and they've ALWAYS tasted amazing. I want to have a range of flavours at my disposal (of course, will need to taste some first before committing).I just recently started a workout regimen once again, this time seriously, and I've come back to On. I've amassed my first stack - Opti-Men multivitamin, OP Chocolate mint and Double Rich Chocolate Whey Protein powders, and French Vanilla Casein. Very proud of it, too! I mix my shakes with water instead of milk because I certainly don't need the extra calories; trying to lose fat as well as build muscle. The On products are a safe, delicious, not to mention effective, way to go. No need to look elsewhere! :)
