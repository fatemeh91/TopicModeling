review/text: As a dentist, I know that the key to success in tooth whitening is to have a properly made custom-fitted tray, and the right concentration of bleaching gel.This product markets a 20% Carbamide-Peroxide bleaching gel. The 20% concentration is considered strong in comparison to the concentrations available. Most at-home systems use a 10-15% concentration of Carbamide Peroxide.The MAJOR drawback to this system is that it assumes that you have a custom-moulded bleaching tray, which is essential to using this product correctly and safely. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CUSTOM-MOULDED MOUTH TRAY, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. A custom-moulded tray must fit the teeth precisely and must not allow the bleaching gel to leak from the tray. A properly moulded tray will have a reservior for the gel, and a contoured scalloped border that prevents the gel from coming into contact with the gum tissues. (Sustained contact of the bleaching gel with gum tissues will result in a white chemical burn).Since this product does not have a custom tray, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it therefore giving it an overall score of 2-stars. However, if you have a custom-moulded tray (not an at-home heat moulded (boiled) system), this is an effective product if used in moderation and according to instructions (in that case I give it 3 stars). I actually think that a 20% bleaching solution is too strong to be used unsupervised. A 20% solution will likely cause tooth sensitivity and has the additional likelihood of causing chemical burns of the gums. It must be used with caution and restraint.Keep in mind that Crest and others offer a tray-less system (no gel), as the gel is impregnated in the adhesive strip that is applied to the teeth. These systems work well and are fairly cheap to use. The advantage with the custom-made tray system is that you can use a variety of different bleaching gel strengths, some of which are much stronger than the adherant strip systems.Jim "Konedog" Koenig (dentist)
