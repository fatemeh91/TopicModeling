review/text: Great product! I highly recommend over the pills due to the amount of pills you have to take to get the same amount of L-Arginiine. I have noticed a definite muscle strength effect and my workouts are somewhat easier then before. Took approximately 1 week taking everyday for me to start to see results.I got this product along with L-Citrulline to help with a muscle weakness problem. The taste reminds me of Alka-Seltzer (if you've ever tasted the tablets that aren't fully dissolved). Not nearly as bad as some of the reviews led me to believe. I was very apprehensive after reading them and before I even tried it. I suggest you take it with really cold water. Get you one of the mixer cups that will swirl it around for you right before you chug it down. Also, if you don't want to taste at all, hold breath while drinking down really fast. Then, while still not breathing drink a couple of mouthfuls of cold water to was down residual powder and the aftertaste. Then breathe! You won't taste it at all. Don't take with anything containing sugar - research shows this negates the effect of the L-Arginine. Make sure you take on an empty stomach and at bedtime if you are using to help build muscle strength or help with muscle problems. Good luck!
