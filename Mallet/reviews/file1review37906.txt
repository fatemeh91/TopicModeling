review/text: I had such bad carpal tunnel syndrome that I couldn't sleep at night because my hand went very uncomfortable numb. After one night using this brace I was sleeping easier and after a few nights, my CTS was better during the day as well! I am a nanny to a 7 year old, 3 year old, and 3 month old. I also bring my 7 month old with me so there is A LOT of lifting/arm&wrist; usage and this brace definitely helped with my performance.It's sturdy, very well made, excellent velcroe, and makes my wrist/hand feel soooo goood!!I am very lucky, however, that I ordered the correct size and wish they had a better guide to knowing what size you should order as you cannot return the brace if opened.
