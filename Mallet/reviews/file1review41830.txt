review/text: I'm an RDH and *this* is the recommend power toothbrush we sell (at no commission and for very little profit) in our office. It is better than the lower priced versions of the other Oral-B power brushes, though I would heartily recommend most Oral-B products because of their superior quality and longevity.The Triumph is different. Yes, they all have two minute timers, but the Triumph skips every 30 seconds so you get to divide your mouth equally into four parts. And while the floss head does work on different models it doesn't work as effectively, still, I urge my patients to switch over to using the Triumph brush heads regardless of the model they own. The rubber tips on the floss head brush is extremely effective at getting in-between the teeth.I usually recommend the slower mode but you do have even more than those two options, you also have a massage (for your gums)and a polishing (which is very valuable when you are in the process of bleaching your teeth.) So, that extra brush head really is useful!It is also terribly easy (read the manual!!) to program the Triumph to notify you when it is time to change the main brush head and this applies to more than one person. The device knows the difference between the two (or three, ect.) My only suggestion (with any power toothbrush more than one person is using) is too write your name in permant ink on the brush itself. The color rings just never stay on.Having been a hygienist for over 25 years and used practically every power toothbrush on the market, this is something I was very excited to share with my patients. It is by far the most effective and versatile power toothbrush I've ever utilized and couldn't possibly be a greater advocate for this product.
