review/text: First, I haven't had to use the survival equipment, and hope I never do. That said, this product could easily save your life. The most important items in the kit are the whistle, fire starter and tinder, signal mirror and the survival brochure. These alone are worth more than the whole kit if bought separately. With this kit, a pocket knife, a flashlight, a first aid kit and an emergency blanket, you'll be ready for just about anything mother nature or circumstance can dish out on land (sorry, a life raft is not included).The package is very small. I can easily fit it into the back pocket of my Levi's. It nearly fits into my shirt pocket. In a pack, you won't know it's even there. But the pouch is big enough that you won't have any problem removing the contents. Just the right size for a slightly expensive stocking stuffer.When you send your kids off into the world, make sure they have one of these in their glove box. Yours too.Happy trails!
