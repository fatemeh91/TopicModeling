review/text: **Upfront advice:I guess I'll have to be one of the few voices of dissent about this product. This is a nice shaving cream, but for me, it didn't live up to the expectations I got from reading all the glowing reviews. Shavers with tough beards and sensitive skin, beware.**Positives:TH Ultimate Comfort lathers well. Using a Simpson Commodore 3x brush I can whip up a mighty lather in no time. The smell is pleasant, a very light lavender that I can detect only while shaving.**Negatives:TH does not provide adequate razor glide and protection for me, especially for multiple passes. I shave with a Merkur Futur at setting 3 to 4 using Feather blades. By two passes after the first I can feel the blade begin to drag and irritate my skin. This no doubt has something to do with the fact that, while TH gives a big lather, that lather begins to flatten and thin rather quickly. Decreasing the amount of water to form a denser lather helps somewhat depending on where on my face I'm shaving, but means I must use a little more product to get enough lather for a shave. Even making the lather quite dense, the sensitive skin on my neck is visibly irritated after I shave with TH. I'm also more prone to cuts using this cream.To compare, Musgo Real, my current favorite cream, gives me three reliably comfortable passes after the first, and the irritation on my neck is considerably less. Likewise, I cut myself less using Musgo.**Bottom line:I wanted to like this cream, but it just doesn't provide enough protection for my skin.
