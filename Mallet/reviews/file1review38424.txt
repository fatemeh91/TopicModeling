review/text: This epilator is the only one I have tried. It does well on the bikini area, but the legs is where it's not great for me. It seems to break a lot of the hair off rather than remove it from the root. I don't know if the hair needs to be longer before I remove it, but if it has to get THAT long then what's the point??
