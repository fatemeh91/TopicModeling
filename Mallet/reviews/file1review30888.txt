review/text: This is the second time I buy this supplement for my auntie. She is currently being treated with parkinsonian meds and her doctor recommended her to take 1200mg daily twice a day. The highest dose of CoQ10 that We could find in Venezuela and Australia was 100mg so you can imagine the challenge of having to take 12 pills each time she needed to take the supplement. Fortunately, we could find this product in Amazon for a reasonable price. You also can imagine how happy she is now that she doesn't have to take 24 pills of CoQ10 daily (in addition to all of the meds and supplements that she needs to take) but 4!!; not to mention the improvement in her health. We have NOW products in Venezuela and I don't know why we don't have the CoQ10 600mg presentation but 100mg only. It would be great to have it, not only for my auntie but also for all of the people out there who are in the same condition as She was
