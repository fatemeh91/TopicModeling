review/text: This stuff seemed to work great for camping up on Mt. St. Helens in Washington. Where ever I sprayed seem to keep the mosquitoes away. And wherever is really the key with this stuff. I noticed on the second day where I didn't make sure to coat my body head to toe, that mosquitoes were still landing on me and biting me, but only in the areas I hadn't sprayed like my lower legs, or the back of my hands. If you want to keep them off, you really got to spray everything, including your clothing. But it's not so bad. This stuff doesn't really smell all that much and has a much lighter sent than actual bug bands do. And it's not super greasy or anything, so you don't really feel it on you.Also, it's Deet free, so I don't feel like I'm taking a toxic bath as I spray myself down, or get so worried about eating food with the stuff on my hands.While it kept the mosquitoes away, I can't say the same for flys or bees (or maybe they were just the kind of flys that look like bees. Not sure) I didn't have a day with it off to tell if it was the spray attracting them or something else, when ever I was walking I seemed to have one or the other hovering around me. They didn't seem to land on me as so much as constantly buzz me. So if you're looking to keep those away too, then I'm not sure if this is the stuff. But it is for mosquitoes.The only bites I got are the first day when I got out of the car before spraying myself where I got several in minutes and then the second day when I hadn't coated myself so well. After coating, not a bite it seems like.
