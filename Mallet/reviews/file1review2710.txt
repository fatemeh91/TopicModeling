review/text: While the package is marked 'Factory Serviced Unit', I can't tell it from a new shaver. It's a little noisy and the trimmer control is easy to accidentally engage, but it shaves great. I've just been using an electric shaver for a few months and this one is shaves much faster and closer than others I've tried.
