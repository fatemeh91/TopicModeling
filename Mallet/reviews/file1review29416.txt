review/text: I really enjoy this product. I use it at least 2 or 3 times a day, every day to monitor my blood pressure. I have hypertension, and I needed a portable product that was convenient and a no-brainer to use. I recommend it to anyone who wants to monitor his or her blood pressure, even if they don't have hypertension.
