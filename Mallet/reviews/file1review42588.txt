review/text: Ok, let me start by saying that i am NOT a lean, mean bodybuilder. Only bought this because I got fed up of eating meat (chicken, beef , lamb, seafood). Also, mainly purchased Dymatize because of its low calorie and high protein content. Recommender by a friend and trust me..this stuff tastes great!Only disadvantage is that you may have to use a blender as spoon mixing clumps it. Strongly recommend mixing it with milk though because tastes rather chalky with water (even added Nesquick to reinforce the taste but no luck).However other flavours may taste better than this one.
