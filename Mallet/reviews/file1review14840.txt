review/text: It's a reasonably convenient, effective and tasty way of supplementing ones protein intake. I'm a somewhat rigerous fitness-nut and am interested in maintaining a well balanced diet; one that includes the additional protein my routine requires (weightlifting, biking, running). METRX provides protein from a source other than lean meats such as chicken/turkey breast, top round beef, etc., all of which I eat enough of. METRX (vanilla) tastes fine, not too sweet, at least for me. They keep sugar and total carbs nicely in-check. Personally, I'd prefer a consistency that's more like EASs 'Myoplex Deluxe' (now discontinued); one that's more fluid and less shake-like in thickness. Even with 20oz of milk mixed in, its a bit too much... too each his own.
