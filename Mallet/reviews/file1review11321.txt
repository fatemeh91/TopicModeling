review/text: This stuff is utterly amazing. I've got terrible insomnia so I'm never quite asleep, and never quite awake, but when I really need to get my head straight, a bottle of this does the trick. Only 30 calories and 6g of sugar so I don't feel like garbage, like after any more typical energy drink that delivers about the same punch. No jitters, just concentration and awesome. This really can't be beat, I'm just waiting on a higher availability.
