review/text: We just got a second Remington beard trimmer for my hirsute husband. He loves the original one (which still works great) but wanted another so he didn't have to take it back and forth to our vacation place. This is a great value, easy to use without all the separate little trimmer heads that will only get misplaced someday. The selector dial is easy to use, and he can select what length he wants for each part of his face "on the go". The price is certainly right for such a quality item. I bought a Wahl trimmer at almost 3X the price, which was very well-made and solid, but he just didn't like all the little doodads that had to be changed each time he wanted a different length. The Remington trimmer also feels very solid, and not like cheap plastic. He has been using his older version of this trimmer for several years, and it still works great...this one should be the same.
