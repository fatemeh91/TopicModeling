review/text: Ok, I used to get a respiratory infection once a month for pretty much most of my life. That is over 20 years. I have tried all sorts of different products to help me fight against getting sick, nothing, I repeat, nothing has worked for me except for this product. I am truly a believer. I recommend that you take 3 tablets daily to maintain health and the minute you feel like you may be getting run down, begin taking 3 tablets every three hours. Also, if you know that you are about to go through a hectic period or the flu season is coming on, begin to increase dosage. Those who a CFIDS or Fibromyalgia sufferers may find a great benefit from using this product as well. I am not easily impressed, but this sure has impressed me. Cheers to health!
