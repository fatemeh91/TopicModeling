review/text: This is a nice little starter kit of oils if you want to try different types of oils without making a big investment or having large bottles of oil hanging around that you don't like. I found I liked two of the oils a lot, but the other three were just "eh"--just my personal preference--but I'm glad I didn't end up with a lot of waste on the oils I probably won't use. Also, be aware that once opened, these bottle DO leak. I anticipated that and stored them not only in the plastic bag they came in, but placed the whole package in another plastic bag as well. It saved my clothing that was in the same overnight bag with the oils.
