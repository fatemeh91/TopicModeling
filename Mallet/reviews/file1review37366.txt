review/text: I searched for the latest Braun epilator and bought this last month. This is exellent. Ive tried everything shaving, tweezing, waxing and epilating. I'll tell you Braun 3370 is really efficient. Its fast, doesnt leave a hair behind, and is far less pain.I should tell you, Ive used an older model of Braun Silk epil. I bought it in July 1998 and had been using that till last month. To tell you the truth it was painful but bearable (Hey! pullilng hair at root is supposed to be painful). another glich was it cant pick up very small hairs, but it was the best thing when I bought it. I have pulled 6yrs out of it and that was one of the reason why I was looking for another Braun epilator.This 3370 is really good theyve over come all the negatives in their older models. I would say its very very very less pain than I expected and it pulls out even the shortest hairs and the extra shaver head is exellent. Im sure Ill be happy I bought this for another 6yrs or more.If you have decided on buying an Epilator, Id say Look no more! This is THE ONE
