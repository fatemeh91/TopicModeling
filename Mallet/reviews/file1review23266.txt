review/text: Great price and works as advertised. The handle works perfect for me, and i'm sure for you too if you follow the directions, meaning you have to put the handle on a hard surface vertically after assemblage and knock on it a few times with a hammer to really have them firmly attached together. Really easy and simple, people are just too lazy or not paying attention to the assembly instructions.It makes a guy like me wouldn't mind sweeping the bathroom and kitchen floor.
