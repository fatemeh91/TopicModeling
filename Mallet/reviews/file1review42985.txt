review/text: Unlike the picture on the Amazon website, these bags are NOT clear. They are white frosted bags. The outside of the box that they came shipped in also says they are clear. As a result, these bags can not be used in jurisdictions that require that recycled waste, newspapers, etc., must be in clear plastic bags. You can not see through these bags. These bags are being returned. This is the second time this has happened, but with a different vendor. I don't understand how some vendors can market and advertise an item without first examining the item. This results in wasted shipping costs and wasted time.
