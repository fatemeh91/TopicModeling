review/text: I have been taking Liv-a-Tox for 5 years - every time I quit for a while I notice more pain (have Rheumatoid Arthritis) and tiredness. I noticed a huge lift when I first used it - I took 3 tablets before going to an amusement park - I had tons of energy all day, less pain, and had a great time. Normally I would be dragging doing something like that. Since then, I use it to lift my energy - 2 per day in the morning. This doesn't make me nauseated if I take on an empty stomach either. I'm sure it is really helping my liver detox and regenerate as well - without all the detox symptoms. I love this product!
