review/text: Some years ago I used what was then called the Crown Skinless Skin condom, which are now sold with the simple moniker of Crown Condoms. I was very pleased with this original product. It's thin, strong structure held up under some of the most strenuous "loads" that I could produce and contributed to the advertised "feels like you're wearing nothing" experience. Light lubrication and a skin-toned color only contributed to this adage.What I received from my recent order was not the same condom, even if it was advertised as such. At first, these condoms seemed to promise the same feeling, but all I can say is that they were not "lightly" lubricated - they were practically not lubricated at all. And that would be fine (I happen to like non-lubricated condoms) but for some reason this condom was no easier to apply than one drenched in lubrication.During use I found it somewhat constrictive. It did not contribute to a comfortable experience. When I finally DID manage to reach my climax, I realized the only reason that was possible was because the condom broke! Thankfully my partner is on birth control so no surprises were in store for us.The only truly positive aspect of this condom? It's VERY inexpensive when bought in numbers. My math makes my purchase work out to about 8 cents per condom. Can't beat that.
