review/text: I'm very sorry but I don't know of a nice way to say this: I hated the ""Almond Brownie Balance Bar"". To me, it was terrible tasting, not just not good, but terrible. I know I'm supposed to give an honest opinion in Test Drive, and I'm afraid this is it. I would never buy any for myself and I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
