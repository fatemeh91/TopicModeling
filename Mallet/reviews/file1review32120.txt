review/text: When these do work right, they work great. But they don't often work right. And additional things are usually needed. I generally will not use this alone. The solution seems good at preventing stains from setting in. So I usually will apply this and then blot with a damp paper towel. The damp paper towel will help remove the stain and the solution does seem to help prevent it from becoming permanent once washed later. That said, without blotting it with a damp towel, it will often leave a stain of it's own. I gave it 3 stars because while it does help in some way, it doesn't help in the way it's advertised to. And it certainly does not work in the way the commercials make it seem to. They stain will not just disappear with application.
