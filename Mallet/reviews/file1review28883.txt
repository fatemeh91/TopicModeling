review/text: This was my first time using a protein supplement and I have to say I was very pleased. I noticed a difference in just a couple of weeks. I ran out sooner than I anticipated so I purchased another protein powder and that is when I learned how much I enjoyed the ON Gold Standard Whey. This other protein powder did not mix well, taste good and it gave me some real bad diarrhea (TMI).It gave me a real appreciation for the quality and results of the Gold Standard Whey.
