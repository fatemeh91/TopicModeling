review/text: I have very high arches and problematic calves-- surgery-related nerve and vascular damage have made it necessary to use some sort of orthotic in my shoes. I have a pair of super expensive podiatrist-made orthotics that I use most days. However, the cost of replacement forced me consider an over-the-counter orthotic for use in my garden/ work-site shoes. I first bought this Spenco 3/4 length orthotic several years ago at Wal-mart, I think. My existing pair was very comfortable, and performed most like my prescription orthotics, but was a tad too big for my aforementioned cruddy work shoes. I couldn't find Spenco orthotics anywhere in town, and the others shoe inserts I tried just didn't offer the same comfort and support. Amazon was pretty much the only seller I could find that carried the 3/4 length in a size 5-6. They took a while longer than anticipated to arrive, but are identical in quality/comfort/support to the Spenco orthotics I bought years ago. As I write this, I'm almost tempted to buy a spare pair for future use in fear that they may not be available when the time comes.
