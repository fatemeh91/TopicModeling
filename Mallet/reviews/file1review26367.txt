review/text: I ordered Elastikon, which is a name brand of a product by Johnson and Johnson Company.Instead I got a different type of elastic tape which does not compare to Elastikon. I didn't return it because I needed it at the time. The tape does the job, but curls up after you cut a piece and is very difficult to work with. It doesn't hold up as well as the real Elastikon does.This product should not be sold as "Elastikon" as it is not Elastikon.
