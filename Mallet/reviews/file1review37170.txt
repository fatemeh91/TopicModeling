review/text: I'm a young woman with all-over joint pain. It is most severe in my hands, and I purchased these gloves hoping to get some relief from the compression and warmth so that I can go about my normal daily activities.Pros:Good compression in the hand and wristKeep hands warmDiscreet enough to be worn in public (and you'll want to, I hardly take mine off).Cons:The fingers are not quite tight enough to provide adequate compression to my finger joints, but they do a good job keeping the fingers warm.Overall, I really love them!
