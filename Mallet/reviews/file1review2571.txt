review/text: I waited for this toy with baited breath and am sorry to say that after all the hype for this model, it was a dissapointment. The ears split and don't "hit the mark" and the shaft has no vibrate setting, only a rather phlegmatic rotation setting. Will keep searching for the right solo toy. Wish I had spent the money on something more classic. This "new impoved" model was neither.
