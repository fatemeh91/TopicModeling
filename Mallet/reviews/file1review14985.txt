review/text: When I first started taking this product it messed up my stomach so bad. It had me running back and forth to the bathroom and feeling sick. After a couple of days it went away. But I still have being using the bathroom frequently. It's been three weeks and I haven't noticed a difference yet. I'll repost in a month.
