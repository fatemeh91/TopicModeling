review/text: I purchased the first one through an outside vendor. I really loved that it was light-weight & contoured to my eyes.But after 2 months the inside lining separated from the mask itself.I phoned Bucky inquiring as to the issue. They were extremely helpful and said there was a small batch that did this.I purchased a second one through them directly.The problem is, they only have a 30 money back. Now, the 2nd pair has separated after only 3 months! So sad, to be on the market for yet another one that actually works and is built to last!
