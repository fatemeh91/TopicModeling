review/text: Green? Check! Foamy? Check! Got a frog on the bottle? Check! The kids love this stuff. It cleans them up and leaves a light fruity scent behind. Makes it really easy to know when the kids washed their hands!The only bad thing about this soap is the residue. If the kids get a little overzealous with the pump, the cool foam becomes a sticky mess. Luckily, if you catch it in time it is really easy to clean up. And leaves your counter smelling nice, too!The refills are great! The first bottle you buy comes with a removable pump and you can just move it from refill to refill. Easy and saves a couple of bucks over time.
