review/text: I have both the Philips Avent nursing pads and the Bravado and they each have their plusses and minuses. The Avent seems more absorbent and also dries faster when I wash them, but they are about 1/2 inch smaller in diameter than the Bravado and when the pads slide around at night, sometimes they end up not covering the nipple. What I found works for me is to double them up with one Avent and one Bravado for both coverage and absorbancy.
