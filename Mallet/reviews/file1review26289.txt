review/text: Wow, got 2 of these free yesterday for me and my partner at the supermarket with free coupons. Good thing I did not spend anything. Once we bit into them we both looked at each other in shock. How can this taste so bad. And they are small thin bars. Would need 3 to get filled up. Lara-Bars and 1000 times better and more natural and moist. These are dry and taste like cardboard.
