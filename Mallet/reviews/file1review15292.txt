review/text: I enjoyed the Almond Brownie Balance Bar. The taste was much richer than other nutrition bars I've used previously. They kept well in my pocket and weren't too crumbly or excessively chewy. I used them as an alternative to breakfast several times when I was running late (a normal occurrence). I also brought them along on several day hikes as a quick pick-me-up snack. I would recommend this product, especially if you like rich chocolately tastes.
