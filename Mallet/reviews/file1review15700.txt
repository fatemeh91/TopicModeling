review/text: I have used these cloths for many years and bought them for the first time on Amazon after no longer being able to get them at Bed, Bath, & Beyond. I use them wet in the kitchen on my counters and appliances - they rinse out easily and squeeze very dry so they leave no streaks. They are great dry for dusting and do not stick to your fingers the way many cheaper microfiber cloths do.This past summer I learned that they really do work like miracle cloths when I used them to clean the vinyl siding on my house. They cleaned without a lot of pressure and got all of the dirt out of the textured siding.I throw them in the washer and dryer. The only negative I have to offer is that tomato stains really are tough and usually impossible to remove.
