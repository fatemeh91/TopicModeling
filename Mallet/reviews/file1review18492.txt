review/text: I got this product without the straps. The picture shows nice straps that can be used to hold the splint in place. The description also mentions the straps. They were MISSING in the final shipment. It was a nightmare trying to put it up with tape.The seller and amazon were actually nice about the whole thing and made the refund process very easy. I would give 4 stars to the seller, but the product itself was totally useless to me.
