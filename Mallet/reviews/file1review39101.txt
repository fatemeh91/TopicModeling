review/text: The wahl 24 piece deluxe clipper kit is a great bargain, my only gripe is the inability of the trimmer to cut to close to the scalp! If you want a close all around cut with a bit of fuzz this is the trimmer for you, If you want a smooth close cut get the andis 11 piece set (also sold on amazon).
