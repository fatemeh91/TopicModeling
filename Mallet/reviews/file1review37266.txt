review/text: My mother's hands are always cold and achy from diabetic neuropathy, and these gloves make her much more comfortable. Not only does the neoprene lining keep her hands warmer, the mild compression relieves some of the nerve pain.She gets lots of compliments on her fashionable gloves. The hand specialist who was fascinated to learn about the gloves. He'd never seen anything like them before.She's been wearing them almost daily for almost three years and one seam is beginning to split, so I'm ordering another pair. Glad Amazon still stocks them.By the way, I tried the equivalent product for feet and discovered that they don't come in pairs. Ridiculous! Thermoskin should be ashamed.
