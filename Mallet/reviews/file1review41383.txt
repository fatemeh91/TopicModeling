review/text: The quick description next to the product photo reads: Comfort your feet in high heels. Anatomical heel cup and arched shape help reduce possible blisters, pump bumps and knee pain. The reviews speak to increasing comfort with high heels. However, the box I received was for "Women's Flats". I went back to carefully read the full product description in the middle of the page to find that it states they are for "low volume" shoes, ending with "Recommended footwear: Loafers, lace-ups and casuals shoes without removable insoles." I don't think they sent me the wrong box because the inserts I received match the ones in the photo for this product. If you go to Superfeet's website and look at the product for high heels, the inserts are much longer and curved differently. Be sure you request the correct product. I'm sure these insoles will feel great in flats, but I'm rating the product low for incorrect statement regarding high heels in the quick description. Wasted my money for something I didn't need.
