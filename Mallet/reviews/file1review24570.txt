review/text: I chose this rating because I threw the bottle away after 4 dys of use. I am not sensitive to caffeine or products with high caffeine content but I had terrible headaches during my 4 dys of use! They started on first day of use and stopped once I discontinued use. I prefer green teas pills but thought I would try something new, bad choice.
