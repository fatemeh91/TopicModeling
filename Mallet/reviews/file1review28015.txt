review/text: ON always makes a good quality product. I personally like the vanilla ice cream flavor because it is more dynamic of a flavor. You can get sugar free cocoa and mix it in to make it chocolate, adding good flavor and fiber. I recommend buying from "Hamilton Shop". They have super fast shipping and great customer support, they even gave me a sample packet of another ON product which is awesome.
