review/text: I purchased this tub while I was visiting relatives for the holidays. We had the big bulky plastic tub at home and I didn't want to bring it. Unfortunatley, my 11 month old daughter wasn't yet ready for the &quot;Big Tub&quot; and we ran into a crisis. I was torn on what to get. There are so many tubs out there. We bought this one because it can deflate. I knew we could carry it back home with us when we went. It turned out to be wonderfull!! She's not scared. It's cushioned for comfort. It even has a high back so you can lean them back and rinse their hair. It is just too easy. I came home and threw the other one away.
