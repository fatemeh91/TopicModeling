review/text: For some reason this nail cutter is listed under toys. So when it came to rating, of course I am going to say this toy is not much fun and does not have educational value. Must be an Amazon error.Other than that, I love to cut my baby's fingernails and toenails with this. It is simple and makes cutting nails painless. The price is also something I love. I don't know why parents use the metal nail clippers when baby scissors are so much safer and easier to handle.My only complaint is that the finger hole is a bit small for men's fingers, if daddy wanted to cut baby's nails.
