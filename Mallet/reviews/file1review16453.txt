review/text: Note, this is not an antiperspirant and won't keep you dry. But it also has no aluminum. Sweating is natural, and this does keep you from getting sweat odor. I prefer deodorant to antiperspirant, and it's darn hard to find in the local drugstore so I am glad Tom's makes this product. It has a nice feminine scent.
