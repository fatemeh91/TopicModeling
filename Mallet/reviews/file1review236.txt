review/text: The reviews were right about it being VERY large in girth. It was a bit uncomfortable, and I didn't love the bumps on the back (that you can't see in the picture or in the description), and the "head" of it has quite an edge.When you take it out of the package, it has an overwhelming smell of plastic, so it probably contains those carcinogens that everyone is talking about.The exterior piece is VERY powerful and would be great if it was on another toy. The tickler is also fairly rigid and difficult to place exactly.I wouldn't recommend it because I think you can do better. And I also think it's worth it to spend more money on a toy without phthaylenes (or however you spell it).
