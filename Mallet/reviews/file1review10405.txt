review/text: LL is a great cleanser but be aware that when it goes to work you should be near a facility. I find it a bit harsh and prefer Mirolax which is tasteless and has a much milder effect...at least for me. However, the first time I used LL, I lost 5 pounds in 3 days. Everyone is different so don't take that as &#34;your&#34; baseline. Can't hurt to try. I usually mix it with a flavored tea (berry, peach, orange etc.) as the taste alone leaves a bit to be desired for my pallet.
