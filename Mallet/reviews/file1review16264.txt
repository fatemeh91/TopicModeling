review/text: We took a chance on these Jaya Biodegradable (and compostable) Spoons based on the positive reviews and they more than meet my expectations. These are surprising good quality and hold up as well, or better, than disposable plastic spoons. We have used these for both hot (soup) and cold (milk in cereal), with good results.Physically they look like most plastic spoons, with a nice wide surface and "ribbing" underneath the handle for strength. The only odd thing about these is the "starchy" smell when opening the packaging, but it does not impart any flavor into foods.I also like that these are better for the environment than regular plastic spoons since they will breakdown over time.Highly Recommended!
