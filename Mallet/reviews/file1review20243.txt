review/text: I read the reviews and was prepared for these to be thin. But "thin" is an understatement. They're more like sheer curtains. They don't absorb anything because there isn't enough cloth. I thought about folding them up and using them as burb clothes, but they're too rough for infants. Don't waste your money.
