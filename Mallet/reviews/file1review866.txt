review/text: Primrose oil is excellent for peri-menopausal symptoms. I was experiencing the beginning of hot flashes and an irregular heartbeat (a little known symptom of menopause). Within a week of taking primrose oil the hot flashes ceased. Soon after, I no longer had the irregular heartbeat. A side benefit is I no longer have cramps during my period!! I wish I had known about this long ago!Highly recommended for peri-menopausal symptoms - an excellent and simple solution in the maze of peri-menopausal products. Note: Borage oil, which also contains omega 6, is great for skin, but does not positively effect hot flashes.The NOW brand is more effective than other brands I've tried.
