review/text: The ON whey protein shakes are great. I just wanted to leave a review about the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor in particular since a lot of people have been praising it. Its really not that great. Not even good I would say. The strawberry and chocolate flavors are better. I'm going to finish out this tub of Vanilla Ice Cream but I don't think I will be buying this flavor again.
