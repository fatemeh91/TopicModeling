review/text: I purchased the pen and began using it and was quickly disappointed. Shortly after I began using it the pen began leaking everywhere. I could do very little without getting ink on what I was working on or my hands. Since this seemed like a manufacturing problem I sent it back to Cross. I called 2 weeks later to inquire about the pen and was rudely told that it would be 6 weeks before I could expect any information and that surely the pen had not been even looked at yet. I found this rather disappointing because I am a brand new customer who purchased a pen that was faulty from the start.
