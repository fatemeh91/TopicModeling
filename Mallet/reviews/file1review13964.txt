review/text: These are just generic sport teeth guards, had I realized that to begin with I might have purchased them at a local store. They work okay.... I don't feel like my teeth have the right contact with the trays that they need to get the full effect of the bleech. You dip them in hot water then put them in your mouth and they shrink a little to fit your mouth, but not realy your teeth, just your mouth. If your going to spend the $$$ on bleech, its probably a good idea to spend the $$$ on better trays than these ones. (I ruined the first one, by putting it in boiling water for 6 seconds instead of 2-3 seconds like the directions said. So if you do get these take the directions seriousley. :)
