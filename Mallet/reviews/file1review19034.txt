review/text: Yes, it is fiber and you could benefit with a diet of 25 to 35 grams of FIBER per day says the American Dietetic Association.(Benefit how? they do not tell us on the label)But, look close; benefiber gives you 3 grams of Fiber per dose.If you use a digital scale as I have you will to your surprise discover that one heaping teaspoon actually weighs 3.5 grams.AND, they are telling you to use two tsp which is actually a double dose, right in their supplement facts, printed right on the label.The dose on the package states 2 tsp or (3.5 grams)But to my surprise my digital scale 3.5 grams is not 2 tsps it is only one heaping tsp.Supplies you with 3 grams of fiber they claim.But you might be actually taking a double dose and not knowing it, but paying for it.Think about it one good tasting bran muffin could supply you with 9 grams of dietary fiber. And a bran muffin taste better too! (that is triple the fiber of one single benefiber dose)So the price of Benefiber is actually very expensive.Too expensive but, Nice Clear Fiber!IMHO of course
