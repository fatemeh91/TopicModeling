review/text: If you have a feeble dishwasher that leaves grit on the so-called "clean" dishes at the end of the cycle, here is the answer. Uncap Dishwasher Magic according to the directions on the label, place it in solitary splendor on the bottom level of an otherwise-empty dishwasher, and run it through your machine's hottest, longest cycle. And there you have it. No more grit. No expensive service call. Not even a trip to the hardware store.
