review/text: I first smelled a beanpod candle at my mother's house a few years ago. It was the cranberry clove scent, and I finally purchased one for myself recently. It isn't a scent I would have chosen based on its name alone because I would have feared that the clove smell would dominate. It doesn't at all. I don't really know how to describe the smell, but it's a perfect scent for chilly weather. A couple of my favorite Yankee Candle scents are McIntosh and Harvest (just to give you an idea of my tastes). I know some reviewers have had quality issues, but I haven't had any problems
