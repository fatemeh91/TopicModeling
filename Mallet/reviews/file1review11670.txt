review/text: The title clearly states that this offer is for a four count case of 1 gallon Windex bottles from this vendor. What arrived is a single gallon bottle in a box from Sam's Club. This is out and out fraud. I am so angry I can barely type. This better be a monumental screw up or I want somebody in handcuffs. Don't people understand that wire fraud is a felony?
