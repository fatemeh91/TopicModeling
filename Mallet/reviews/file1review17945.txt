review/text: Fiber is SOOOOOO good for you, there are no negatives to higher fiber intake. Fiber Choice is the best chewable there is ! The flavor and texture are second to none. Don't wait until you 'need' fiber to start upping your fiber intake. There are so many benefits, and this is the easy way to get all the fiber you need.
