review/text: I have a SlimFast shake every day for breakfast. It does keep me full for four hours and gets me to lunch time without unnecessary munching. I have a piece of fruit mid morning just because I'm suppose to eat every 3 hours. I mix 1 scoop of the SlimFast with 12 oz of milk. Then the shake is easier to drink. Using only 8 oz make the shake too thick.
