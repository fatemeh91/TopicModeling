review/text: This is my first product review but I was so impressed with the product packaging I thought I would write one. I have had the razor for a while and have been happy. But when I saw the Frustration Free Packaging I thought I would give it a try. One of my biggest complaints is trying to open the traditional packages. You traditionally need a sharp object to open the package and it is just kind of a pain. In this case it was just a small box &#8211; paper that I was able to open using my thumb.Good Stuff!
