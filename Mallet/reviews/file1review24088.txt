review/text: The thumbfit helps in a small way by restricting movements, reminding others not to squeeze your hand too hard when shaking it, and somehow much of the pain goes away. I would order another one, if needed. Because hands perspire, this gets a "gamey smell quickly. Washing it with baby shampoo and warm water works well.
