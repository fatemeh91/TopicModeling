review/text: The table is easy to set up and sturdy enough to easily put 2 or 3 people on at once. The foam is extremely comfortable, but the reason why I chose this table was the heating feature. That's where it disappoints. It takes 20-30 minutes for the table to get slightly warm, and even on the highest setting, is only slightly warm. To me, the extra money spent for this feature definitely wasn't worth it because the effects were minimal. Besides for that, it's exactly what the specs say: it's a light, comfortable, folding massage table.
