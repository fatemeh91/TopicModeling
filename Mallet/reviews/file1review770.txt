review/text: I used these along time ago and could not find them anywhere. I then found them at my church when I was cleaning, and had a name to research. I looked on Amazon and there there were, they are great for all types of dishes and pots and pans. Do not scrub too hard on plastic as there will be scarring, but they clean and do not get smelly. Highly recommend.!!!!!
