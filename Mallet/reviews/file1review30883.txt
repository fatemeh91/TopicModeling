review/text: I take 600mg CoQ10 with fish oil (2 big gel capsules) and vitamin B for familial tremors, as recommended by a neurologist. If you have similar tremors, check with your doctor about this vitamin regime.Finding a cheap source of CoQ10 has been challenging. Amazon has the best prices available. Even my doctor could not find a lower-priced source.I take NOW vitamins because I have had no problems with them. Once I bought some B2 from CVS, because they were on sale. After two days, I was feeling very jittery. Going back to NOW B2s solved the jitters.
