review/text: Like many women, I suffer from the 10 lb. winter weight gain. I had high hopes for this supplement just to get enough energy back to work out, and hopefully suppress appetite to wean myself off the sugary winter goodies I had been consuming. This supplement had neither effect. In fact, taking it made me even more lethargic and bloated. Instead of dropping 2 pant sizes, like they claim, my pants became much tighter. I quit taking it after a 3-week trial.
