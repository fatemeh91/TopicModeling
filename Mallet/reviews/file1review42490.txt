review/text: I have used this Elite protein for a couple years now. I like the gourmet vanilla mixed in with a fruit smoothie the best! I also drink it after workouts with a glass of milk/water mixed up in a shaker cup. Sometimes I'll get a chocolate protein as well and combine them to make a chocolate/vanilla mixture that is also great tasting!It mixes very well...I use a shaker cup or a blender...and I hardly ever see clumps of it left behind.Amazon had a better deal than my local discount drug store...you can't beat it for the price!
