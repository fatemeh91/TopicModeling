review/text: got this for my friend (especially for when she lets my dog ride around in her ride). she loves it. kinda prefer the ones that have a bottle you can add oil to, but i though this might be more simple for her. she can surely just add a few drops to the felt diffuser tabs - or buy more. she said she likes the scent and it quickly engulfed her whole SUV (tho it still smelled a lil like dog - oh well)
