review/text: Good Qualities: 1. Covers a lot of area. Bad Qualities: 1. Gets stuck on one side often 2. Nozzle gets clogged. 3. Found it difficult to put hose in place. 4. The lower the pressure, the less likely the sprinkler will move, back and forth. Personal Difficulties: I had carried by the sprinkler and did not grab the hose to move it and the plastic nozzle part snapped so easily. Very Cheap in my opinion. Overall did not like this product had more bad and difficult problems then good. Would not buy again.
