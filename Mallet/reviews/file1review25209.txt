review/text: It's pretty hard to write a review of a battery; it either works or it doesn't. This one does. It also fits the unit for which it was intended. So that's two points right there.If you have a set of Senns, and the batteries that come with it aren't enough to keep you going (I actually find that they last closer to five hours than the four advertised), then this is the product for you. You might even want a recharging unit too, since they take at least fourteen hours to recharge, and the headset stand only holds two batteries. The spare battery can be crucial if you're like me, and often use the headset all day at work! Go for it!
