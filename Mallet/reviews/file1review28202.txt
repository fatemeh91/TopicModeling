review/text: i was taking the one from walmart but then i read up on this one and it comes out a little more expensive then walmarts but the taste is really good i tried double chocolate and vanilla ice cream i was taking it with water but now i take it with one banana, ice, soy milk and a little creatine and wow its really good. Any way i am 35 years old i am 5'8 200 pounds i been working out exactly 3 months to this day and been taking this protein for like 2 full months i am on my third 5 pounder. so one 5 pound last me a month. when i started lifting i was only benching the bar and a 25 on each side and today 8/01/2011 i maxed at 250 : ) yey. i been working hard for it and give credit to this protein. i take it with creating from same company.
