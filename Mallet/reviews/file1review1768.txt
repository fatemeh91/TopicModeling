review/text: I really like that not only did this product help with my little "fungus problem" but it also makes a great everyday cleanser! The only problem I have with Tea Tree Ultimates FungaSoap Cleansing Wash is that you can't use it for shampooing--why? why? Why have the gods of convenience forsaken me?
