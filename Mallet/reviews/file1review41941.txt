review/text: I bought this after reading so much about how it helps wrinkles and how Oprah's beauty editor uses it. So far, so good! I can see a slight improvement already. It stings a bit when putting it on but that goes away after a few seconds. I use it every other night, the other nights I use the Retin-A prescription Tretinoin cream.
