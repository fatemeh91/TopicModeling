review/text: My son has terrible eczema, and has since shortly after birth. We have tried everything suggested to us by our pediatrician and dermatologist, and while some things helped, nothing could consistantly get rid of the all over rash or do much for the really bad patches. We finally tried this and after 2 days of rubbing it in once per day, the all over rash was GONE. The patches even disappeared! This stuff is amazing and I wish I had known about it the first year of his life! We are due with our next soon, and am planning to use it on both of our sons to prevent eczema.
