review/text: these insoles were recommended by my doctor. They felt funny ( walking with them in my shoes) at first but after a week not only did my feet feel better, so did my calves and knees! Also an unexpected bonus that probable will not effect anyone else, I thought I was just becoming uncoordinated as I grew older. I was always having my feet roll on me and kind of trip me up on the smallest of incline or hole. these supports somehow prevent my feet/ankles from twisting or rolling. Who knew! ... well I guess my doctor did.
