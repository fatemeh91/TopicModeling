review/text: These are the best razors for guys by far. They are the most expensive out there but it is well worth the price. They last for a long time. This 8 pack for my power fussion lasts for me about 6 months. The price on Amazon is great becasue these razors almost never go on sale and if you get the subscription delivery you can get even more of a discount.
