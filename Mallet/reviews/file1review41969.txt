review/text: My first KAVA KAVA was taken before a funeral of a dear relative. I've taken valium several times in my lifetime and know how addictive they can become. My cousin, a natural/organic nutricianist, offered me the KAVA KAVA. I took two and was so relaxed, functioned OK, so I only need 1 capsule, a lightweight! I think KAVA KAVA works differently on each person - someone else may need to take 2 at a time. Don't get discouraged, determine your own tolerance level. WHAT I LOVE about this supplement is that you can function, think clearly and even drive. Valium, you can't! I call it the Chill Pill. I frequently suffer from social anxiety and KK is my solution. Also, on nights when I can't sleep or need to sleep well, I'll take one pill and within 20 minutes, I'm ready for the pillow - sleeping well all night. Wake up WITHOUT grogginess, unlike Tylenol PM. My doctor knows I take it and is fine with it. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, I've tried many different brands, even bought the organic powder to fill my own capsules. Before buying this brand 2 months ago, I researched and read reviews of MANY brands - I chose Natural Balance. This brand works better than any other I've used. Highly recommend.
