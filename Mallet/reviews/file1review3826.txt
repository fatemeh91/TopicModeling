review/text: This tea is amazing for stress relief. Just one cup and I am very "chill". I have this tea in the reserves for particularly tough days. It has a rather pleasant taste and while I can fall asleep after drinking it, I can still stay awake enough to accomplish tasks. Though, for best use of stress relief plan to just lie down and do something calming.
