review/text: I've tried a few protein powders over the course of 10 years, slowly loosing weight, always had the same problem after the workout. I'd had enough of the 'the runs' and threw in with Optimum. The difference was night and day, not only dose it fend off 'the shakes', but the next day I was far less sore, plus one other perk, it actually tastes good.I'll never go back to the cheap Wal-mart crap again, my friends....this is it!
