review/text: I have 2 bulged disks and 2 herniated disks in my neck. I have a pinched nerve which leaves my finger tips numb and my arm at about 20% strength. Besides the pain, the weakness in my arm and the possibility of permanent nerve damage is scary. I have tried acupuncture, chiropractors, Pain management/shots, I have been to orthopedic and neurosurgeons. Physical Therapy is the last step before surgery where they will remove 2 disk and replace it with a dead persons bone and fuse it with a steel plate. I have tried other traction devices such as the over the door and other inflatable's this is by far the best I have tried and I am hopeful that this may relieve the pressure on the nerve. Other reviews on Amazon suggest a petroleum smell, this product I use today doesn't have that issue. I will update the post later with any improvements etc.
