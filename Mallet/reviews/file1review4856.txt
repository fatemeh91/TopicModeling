review/text: I started using this product a few days ago, and my energy has gone through the roof and a lot of my cravings for 'bad' food are out the window. After the late shift at work, my first instinct is to go right to the fast food places and order hamburgers and fries. By using this stuff, it is easier to resist those cravings as before it was harder. Kind of like the nicorette for the food industry in avoiding cravings for fast food and garbagy foods. I hope to lose a lot of weight on this and am content in knowing that I am getting my optimal servings of veggies and fruits whereas, before I was getting about two servings a day, and that was mostly from fruit and not veggies. I need less sleep, and feel much healthier.
