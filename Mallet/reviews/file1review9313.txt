review/text: I really wanted to love these because I take medication twice a day and it's important that I not overdose myself and also important that I not forget if I've taken it already. Often I found myself worried I hadn't taken it because I couldn't remember if I had or not. We have a two year old (thus the forgetful mommy brain stuff) and I needed a good solution for remembering pills everyday. I was so disappointed to find that these are not child proof. If I have to put these away and totally out of reach and out of sight -- I'll forget to take my medication! I don't see why they couldn't make a childproof version. I suppose they're marketing to older individuals who may have a hard time opening the boxes. However, older folks also have grandchildren or little ones around their homes and it seems to me they should be able to come up with a solution to meet both needs. Oh well. This will be given away to a charitable donation group for someone in a child-free home to use.
