review/text: I went through tons of reviews here about this product before I decided to buy it. Some raised the issue of the trimmer not being able to hold a charge or even work when plugged in. Since the overall rating of the trimmer was good (about 4.5 out of 5 stars) I ended up discounting these criticisms as flukes. I bought the trimmer and, for the first month or so it worked great. The trimmer itself is actually pretty good, which I think is the reason it has mostly positive reviews - most people reviewed it as soon as they got it, long before problems with the charge developed. But after a month or so it got progressively worse in holding a charge. Today, two and a half months after I bought it the thing not only barely holds a charge, now it won't even charge at all! Plugging it in now does nothing, rendering it absolutely useless. Unlike some of the reviewers who blamed the problem partially on their own poor maintenance (like leaving it plugged in constantly), I was careful not to leave it plugged in after it had finished charging. Even still, the thing only managed to last a couple of months. Its basically a disposable trimmer. Its just not worth it. Pay more and get a normal trimmer.
