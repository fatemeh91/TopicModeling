review/text: I bought the Gillette Fusion Manual Razor and shaved with the blades it came with and the shave was okay, no better then an Mach3. Then I tried the other Fusion blades, what a revelation.The best shave comes from using the Gillette Power Fusion blades(orange color) with the Manual Razor. When I did this the shave was phenomenal, baby butt smooth. There was no irritation, no razor burn, simply a great shave.Try this combination, you won't be disappointed.
