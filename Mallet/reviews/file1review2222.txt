review/text: This is my first epilator and I think it works pretty well. It's pretty basic but I like the results. Though it isn't the most comfortable sensation, I find it much less painful than waxing or using Nair. I have very sensitive skin and have tried numerous ways to get rid of the hair on my legs. The epilator doesn't leave much of a mark on my skin (what it does leave goes away in about an hour) unlike the redness and pain I get after waxing or using Nair-like products. I do plan on upgrading once this one has worn out, but overall I think it's a good product for the price.*On a side note: The "carrying case" that it comes with fell apart after the first few days.Update:I've been using this product for more than 2 years now and it still works. It gets pretty regular use (a little more than once a month) and I haven't had any problems. It does get a little warm after you've used it for more than a few minutes, but it hasn't gone beyond that. Still happy with my purchase!
