review/text: got it for my girlfriend for when i deploy, and even to use as a couple (at least the vibrator part) and its pretty awesome.pros- its not THAT big, most of the size is the battery compartment anyway (im bigger than it, and thats not just bragging)- its waterproof so far, the few times she has used it so far has been in the tub and its fine- it wasnt dead on arrival- its powerful as all hell, i turned the thing on when it came in the mail just to make sure it worked and it scared the crap outta me- the vibrator is awesome as hell- the rotating beads are awesome as hell- it gets her to climax even quicker than me- very quietcons- none so far, seems like solid construction, simple yet efficient (and DISCRETE) packaging
