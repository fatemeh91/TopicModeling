review/text: I've used several of the Flossaid holders over the past 15 years or so, and tried a number of other makes as well. For me, the Flossaid works better than the rest, good reach and a handle that allows manuevering. It doesn't have to "use a lot of floss" as some other reviews state: simply unwind a couple of turns of floss from the handle and re-string.There is a fatal flaw. This flosser will break after a year or two. The plastic will eventualy crack and break in two where the small brass rivet goes through to hold the wind button as this hole creates a stress point. This doesn't take away from my 5 star rating, as I consider the holder as a consumable - - it's cheap enough and lasts long enough to get good use vs. cost.
