review/text: The watch arrived as promised. My daughter had to set it for me as my eyesight is extremely poor. I found it difficult to understand the computer voice-though I will admit my hearing is not the best. After onlya little more than 2 months however, the watch failed to function. The screen went completely blank and just simply shut down. My daughter tookit to have another battery installed, but it still would not function. Someone needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.
