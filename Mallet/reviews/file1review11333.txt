review/text: This is a great general purpose kit for a variety of situations: to keep in a vehicle, to take on a family outing, for a longer or larger hiking/camping trip, or just to have around the house in case of emergency. It is fairly full, but I did find room to add a few items such asQuikclot Sport Brand Advanced Clotting Sponge ,Stop Bleeding Fast, 50 Gram Package,Adventure Medical Kits GlacierGel Blister and Burn Dressing, 6-Count Package (Pack of 2), and some better bandages (I would recommend 3M, Coverlet, Curad, or similar) as the ones included in the kit did not seal on the edges (nothing worse than having something work itself under the bandage, or the bandage simply fall off because it doesn't have the adhesive on all sides). There is also room for a few other small items if needed (such as matches, extra nitrile gloves, minimal sewing kit, small magnifier, etc) or perhaps, with rearranging, anNew Israeli Battle Dressing, 6-inch Compression Bandagebut that would be pushing the capacity of the bag. Other than the cheap bandages I am happy with the size and versatility of this kit.Ultimately I chose this kit due to its more comprehensive selection mixed with the nice organization it offers (separate pouches for "Wound Care/Burn/Blister", "First Aid Manual, Medication/Instruments", "Fracture, Sprain", and "Bleeding, CPR"). This is not meant to be a overly compact kit though and is far too large for the average hiker, but Adventure Medical Kits does offer kits in a variety of sizes depending on your needs from the very basicAdventure Medical Kits Travel Medic Kit (Pack of 2)for throwing in pocket or purse (also perhaps a more economical way of getting refills of various medication once it expires), the scalableAdventure Medical Kits UltraLight and Watertight(fits in a larger pocket and is great for short excursions where weight is a main consideration), and the surprisingly compactAdventure Medical Kits Day Tripper First Aid Kitwhich I also own and fits very nicely in a backpack for those trips where you may need to be a little more prepared and yet want to keep the size down. Do keep in mind that the medications included in this (or other) medical kit will need to be periodically replaced as it expires (normally about each year or so).Recommended for 1 - 6 people for up to 7 days, according to the manufacturer this kit is 10" x 9.5" x 4" with a weight of 1lb 15 oz.
