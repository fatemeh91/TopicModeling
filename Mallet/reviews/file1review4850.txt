review/text: While I think this is a high quality product and tastes great, it's too strong for me and I experienced reactions to it. For one, my hands and feet felt really cold the days I took it and looked extremely pale. I suspect it is from the horsetail which SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED by those with circulatory problems such as Raynaud's or heart issues. This product is labeled "stimulant-free". Horsetail is used for its silicon content, but contains none other than nicotine which IS a stimulant and constricts blood vessels. Absorption is increased by the inclusion of yucca, which acts as a surfactant. I can't help but wonder if the nicotine is causing some reviewers to claim that they "crave" this product. I hope to exchange it and get Miracle Reds. I have written the developers of this product about it, because I think the horsetail could be replaced by better and safer sources of silicon, like bamboo or oatstraw.
