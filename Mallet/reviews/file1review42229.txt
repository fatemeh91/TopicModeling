review/text: Well, as I most likely will be forced to give out a little more personal info about myself than I would like... please note it will be in order to explain my review.I am fully disabled: hospital bed or electric wheelchair only (also I will give a shout out for Dragon Software that allows me to type this review LOL). With this in mind I have too many pills, too many doses to use the mainstream seven-day dispenser. When I saw this pill dispenser that had 8 bins and the two on the ends were larger bins than the other, I knew I had finally found something I could use.I purchased the item and when it arrived I was able to use a sharpie marker to label each little lid per med/dose. My AM and PM doses do contain more pills than my other med times and pills so that was perfect. Then I have meds that are PRN. Meds I take through-out the day, etc.Sure- you can use this product and the single bins for daily doses of meds but if you are someone (like me) that has to maintain a larger number of pill count and multiple times for doses PER day this is also perfect!We load up the dispenser early evening at the end of each day and I begin that night with that first PM bin (there is a second bin for meds I take just before sleep) and when I wake we begin at the first AM bin and work our way down until we do it all over again that evening.My review? Highly recommended!
