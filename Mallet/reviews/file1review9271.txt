review/text: This is one brilliant and convenient product! I used to have a horrible habit of forgetting to take my daily meds and vitamins. If I'm running late in the mornings I just pop that day's 'bubble' in my purse and take them on the go. It saves so much counter space, too. I no longer have 6 or 7 different pill bottles junking up the limited counter space I have.
