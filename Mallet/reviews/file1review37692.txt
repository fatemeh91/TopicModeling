review/text: I really like Mitchum Deodorant, and this was no exception. The best part is that it doesn't flake and look messy like some deodorants do. In the summer, when you don't always have sleeves on, this is important. The scent is a little odd, but overall I really liked the product. Also, this deodorant takes a little while to dry, so if you are always in a hurry, this might not be the best choice.
