review/text: This review follows the same tone as my "Sinus Mask" review. It fits comfortably and conforms nicely. It is puncture proof and easily adjustable. My only complaint is that it only last about 15 minutes. If you enjoy a cool relaxing feeling you have the right product, as it does not totally freeze and shock your skin. It does not lump up as do most other brands of gel ice packs.
