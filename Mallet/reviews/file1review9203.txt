review/text: I have used the smaller version of this product for a number of years but my pills have overtaken it's ability to hold them all and I still need it when I'm away from home and I still am on the go a great deal. This box has worked great from the minute I filled it. It's still small enough to not take up a great deal of space in my purse or luggage. Most of the time the seal is very good. I do have occasions when it does open in my purse but I assume it's my lack of closing tightly rather than the unit. It's wonderful that I can remove one day's supply and carry it with me as I as most often go on day trips. I recommend to any one that has to take so many blooming pills!!
