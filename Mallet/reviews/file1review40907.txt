review/text: My second one of these razors. My only complaint is that if you accidentally overcharge the battery it ruins it. I cannot figure out how to take it apart to replace the battery, and my request to the mfgr (importer) ignored my request for the information and what kind of battery it takes. But it does give a good, clean shave. However, if I spoil the battery again, I don't think I'd buy a third one.
