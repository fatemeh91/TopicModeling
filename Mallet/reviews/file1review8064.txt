review/text: This came as part of a multi-item order. The box was mangled (rare event), but the scrub brush was the only thing affected. The bristles fell off and would not stay on, no matter what I did. I don't want to pay to return such a small item, but was disappointed. Amazon is usually so reliable. I bought anther brand which works perfectly.
