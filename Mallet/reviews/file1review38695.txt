review/text: This item smells...and I dont mean just an odd oder, I mean it really smells. The smell remains anywhere this item has been. I have washed the sheets, the towels, the sofa cover, and the smell is still there! I came home from work and the whole house smelled! It is really bad. I do not recommend that anyone buys this product. I threw it in the trash.
