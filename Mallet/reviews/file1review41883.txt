review/text: This is the 3rd triumph 9400 that I own. I had a lower model and 2 mid models. I like this one better since it has the rotating rubber tips which help like flossing. The reason I have so many is because it is difficult to find replacement heads even in stores that I bought them from and therefore I ordered a third one. The first one the battery died and I threw it away since I did not know how to get new batteries. The additional ones were for replacement heads and now I have ordered six more replacement heads since they are hard to find in stores. I also use the extra units for my granddaughter. Your mouth and teeth really feel clean upon use and I like the additional attachments. I definitely would recomend this and would never go back to a manual toothbrush again. They are great for travel also. I also own the SONIC toothbrush and bought a replacement again due to the batteries going dead. I like it too and it works differently but I like to alternate during the day.
