review/text: We love this toilet seat because: a- it is SUPER easy to clean. Because it is one piece there is no possibility of debris becoming trapped, unlike other potty toppers with padded seating. b- it's easy to use and adjusts to any toilet shape/size. C- the splash guard is perfect for boys, but would not be an inconvenience for girls. The child can easily get on and off the seat with a little assistance. This is well worth the price, we are very happy with this product.
