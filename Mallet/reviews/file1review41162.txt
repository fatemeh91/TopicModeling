review/text: This is a good product. I initially used them for my god-sister who had Alzheimer's. This was one of the few products that was absorbent enough. I purchase them now for my aunt because I know they are a good product, plus they are one of the few that I can find in an extra small.I've tried many different brands of disposable underwear for family members who have Alzheimer's and are incontinent. In my opinion, Tranquility is one of the best available.
