review/text: KY Intrigue Heat was the previous best. But in their infinite wisdom they discontinued it, so Wet Platinum is hands down the best. It is super slippery, just the perfect consistency. It doesn't feel too watery like some do, and it doesn't feel sticky like others. It never dries out, and even just a thin layer feels smooth and silky. It's good for massage, penetration, etc, and it's safe with latex condoms. It also has very little taste, though I would pref not using it for oral sex. However, if you have already used it for other purposes and then want to engage in oral sex at least it doesn't have a bad flavor.If they could improve the product, it would be to have a Wet Platinum HOT version.
