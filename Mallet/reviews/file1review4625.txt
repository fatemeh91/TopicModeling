review/text: Surprisingly good; definitely better than the Mach 3. On the plus side it really hugs your face, shaves cleanly with a single pass, and doesn't nick or abrade the skin. Even the edges under the jaw line came clean. I hate shaving and often skip weekends yet find that it works quite well on one, two, or even three day's worth of growth. Haven't gone longer than that so I couldn't say for sure but seems like it'd do okay for another day or two. Any longer and it would take a pass with an electric trimmer to shorten things up first. The handle is nicely ergonomic too, easy to grip and control when wet. On the minus side the single trim blade doesn't work horribly well, at least not for me. I've got to even up my sideburns and trim around my goatee and this just doesn't do the trick. Considering what they cost, the blades don't last as long as I'd like either. I've used it regularly for about three weeks and it's just starting to dull enough to consider changing the blade. Might be able to stretch it another week but that might be pushing it. Considering that I can go a year with an electric model (Braun) on a single blade/screen set I'd think they could make a manual that lasts more than a month...Despite the downside, it's the best manual razor I've used so far. Quick, clean, comfortable shave... Got one as a free promotion and liked it enough to pick up a pack of refill cartridges. They are a bit pricey but not overmuch. I expect to continue using it for some time to come.
