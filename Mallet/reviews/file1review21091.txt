review/text: Wonderful product--how did I ever live without it? The large size covers more body area at one time. The moist heat feature (without using water) is even better than I had hoped for--it feels very much like the hot packs in the physical therapist's office.The heating pad cover is wonderfully soft and can be washed. The safety on/off switch is somewhat inconvenient, but since I've fallen asleep more than once with the heating pad in use, I can appreciate it as a safety feature. The heating pad gets hot fast and can get hotter than typical heating pads. I can't say enough good things about the Thermophore Moist Heating Pad.Thermophore Moist Heating Pads - Manual Safety Switch - Standard Size - 14" x 27"
