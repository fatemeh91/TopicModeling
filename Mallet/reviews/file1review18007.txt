review/text: Bucky 40 winks sleep mask is very light weight and comfortable. It is the best sleeping mask I have ever purchased. I can breathe comfortably and the mask stays in place when I sleep. I am so glad I purchased more than one. I highly recommend. After 6 months of use the fabric seperated from the bottom by your cheeks. This hasn't diminished the comfort or quality of the sleep mask.
