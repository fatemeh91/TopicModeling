review/text: One thing I absolutely will not tolerate in a battery is one that leaks. I've lost a lot of expensive electronics from leaking batteries, remote controls, clocks, blood-pressure testers, radios, etc. These are items that don't use a lot of electricity, so the battery never actually stops working. I lost the remote control to an almost new High-Def TV due to a leaky battery and had to replace it at substantial cost.I remember when Alkaline Batteries were first introduced. Finally, I said, a battery that doesn't leak. I've used Energizers exclusively for over 20 years without a single one leaking, until about 5 years ago. Then something changed. Suddenly batteries that still measured good and had years left before the expiration date were leaking. At first I thought it was a fluke. But soon it began to be a regular occurrence. I had to resort to checking all my batteries every 6 months to try to catch the leaky ones, before they caused any damage. This is inexcusable.Could this be some bizarre new marketing campaign? I noticed Everyready claims their new Lithium batteries "Do not leak". Why would anyone claim batteries don't leak - if none of them leak? Could they know they have a problem - and don't care - to motivate us to buy the more-expensive "premium" batteries? Take this all with a grain of salt. What do I know? I'm just some dumb consumer that only wants to buy batteries that don't leak. Now where did I put that bottle of whiskey?
