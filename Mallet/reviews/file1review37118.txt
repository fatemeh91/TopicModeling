review/text: Anything that makes flossing easy is wonderful. I plan to keep my teeth into old age and beyond and this will help. It is especially good for me for those pesky back molars and wisdom teeth. No more fumbling around and wondering if I did a good enough job. Considering that there is a correlation between gum disease and heart disease, I'll keep on flossing in whichever way makes it easy and is effective. Want to save the earth? Have one less kid. That should cancel out about 100,000,000,000,000 people's flossing discards.
