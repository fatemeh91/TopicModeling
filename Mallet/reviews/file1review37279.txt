review/text: A search recently of Cosmeticsdatabase (if they can be believed, but at least they do seem to have a lot of information) seems to list this product or a similar product as being "Low Hazard": the listing at that dot-com is:"Speed Stick Anti-Perspirant Deodorant Unscented".(You too can go there and do the search.)In contrast, i suspect various other such products being sold on Amazon are listed in Cosmeticsdatabase as "Moderate Hazard" or even "High Hazard".Also, this product seems to be reasonably effective.
