review/text: this pouch is basic, but fulfills its function just fine, especially on a smaller size wheelchair, with limited space on arms and from arms to wheel. Other styles either did not fit or got snagged in the wheel. The only difficulty is it tends to creep backwards, would benefit from some sort of stop - not sure how to design that. I bought this for my 91 year old mother with alzheimers, and she manages to use it as well as can be expected. The price is great, much better than other, unnecessarily complicated bags.
