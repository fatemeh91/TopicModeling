review/text: I have been really happy with the Braun Epilator. The first time was a bit uncomfortable but the results were worth it. Once every other week I do a touch-up on my legs that takes just a few minutes but I love not having to shave my legs anymore. It leaves my legs very smooth for weeks! I did my bikini-line as well but it was too uncomfortable to do my armpits. I would recommend this product to anyone that hates shaving and can't afford to have a professional wax job done all the time.
