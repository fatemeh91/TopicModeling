review/text: All the reviews for this product are great and accurate. I completely conquer and find this to be an excellent light-weight kit with a proper book from Dr. Weiss, Stanford med center. You'll notice that all the items in the kit are high quality and best of all it's made in the USA. The only thing you may want to add to this kit is waterproof tape (that just saves the cost of replacing it every time you wash).For example the gauze: ironically the day I got this kit I injured myself in a bizarre manner and ended up with a burn blister and a cut on the end of my thumb that almost sent me into shock. When I applied the gauze from the kit I was impressed by how soft it was and very conducive to wrapping my thumb thoroughly. The Asprin came in handy to ease the pain and my nerves.Also you get better than 'tweezers' with this kit, when you're ready to start seriously dealing with splinters get decent forceps like this kit has (with sharp tips). The only thing that's comparable is using the corner of a Swiss Army knife tweezers which most of us have done enough times to know it doesn't save on pain much at all and you end up having to use the blade anyway. It's easier to be able to get it over and done with one implement and that peace of mind can save you some agony when you get a really bad splinter. Also with tics you do not want to miss getting the head out and completely removing the tic. The smallest black and red hard bodied Dear Tic is the hardest one; and you can get it by the head easiest with sharp tips. This tic is also the one that carries Lyme Disease most prevalently. If you are worried about that or notice symptoms like a bullseye ring around the bite: remove the whole tic and stick it to some tape. You can then send it to a lab to have it tested for Lyme Disease.
