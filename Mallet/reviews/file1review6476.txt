review/text: I've been imagining having something like this for some time, it does reach those unreachable spots very nicely. I am finding it to be like exercise equipment though, it sits on the sideline unused a lot..though it does work, and help a lot when I use it!I bought this one instead of the other brand because it had the extra curve and extra bumps, but I don't think I'll ever use the extra ones because they are so sharply pointed. The rounded end is good enough for me. I'm even thinking a softer/padded add on might be a good option for some people??I'm sure I'll be using this more as I get used to how to use it. It's a good product for pressure points/ trigger points/ foot reflexology, don't expect a "gentle massage" feeling.
