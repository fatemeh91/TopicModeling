review/text: Looking over the reviews for this product makes one believe that two different products were reviewed, one that worked fine and another that was terrible. I am having none of the problems from the negative reviews. My batteries are charging fine and there is no overheating. My guess is the problems came from an earlier version of the product.4-12-2010 - Still working fine. I bought two more sets.6-14-2010 - About the life of the batteries. I found that the batteries are lasting only about 3 hours of use in a point and shoot camera (with the camera set to use this type of battery). Initially they lasted long enough that I didn't notice the life of the charge, but with a fresh charge I get an afternoon of shots before I get a low battery warning. These batteries are about six months old.
