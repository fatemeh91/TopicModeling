review/text: Love this product. I mix w/scoop of Amazing Grass powder, crushed ice, water -- and it's a great nutritional drink. I have tried chocolate (my fav), vanilla (meh, not great alone, but mixed with other things -- and to bump protein in prepared foods like pancakes, oatmeal, etc. it's awesome). I tried the cookies and cream also based on a highly recommended review from a friend -- now THAT truly tasted like the milk left over after a sugar cereal -- i.e. WAAAAAAY TOO SWEET! Haven't tried the other flavors yet so won't comment on those -- but this is a great product in that it mixes well without a blender. Not as substantial (thickness) as the blender drinks, but it's the protein supplement source I'm after and this is my favorite instant product of those I've tried out there (to include muscle milk, and other brands).
