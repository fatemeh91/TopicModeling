review/text: I went for these vitamins because they had a lot of good ingredients and were relatively cheap compared to other vitamins in the market. As noted by other reviewers, the vitamin is very difficult to swallow. I thought I would overcome that problem; however, I dreaded the moment of taking it every morning. On the worst side, it does give constant constipation (I apologize for being graphic), as other reviewers also noticed.I still finished the whole bottle of Rainbow Prenatal so that I would not waste the money spent; however, I went back to the more expensive Oculair 120 VegiCaps (also called Biosyntrx-oculair on Amazon) vitamin that I have been taking for several years prior to trying Rainbow Prenatal. Even though Oculair is more expensive, it's so much easier to swallow having a soft cover of each individual tablet, and I have no side effects from it as I had with Rainbow Prenatal.I hope this helps. Best wishes!
