review/text: We have used this small hand held eye cart more than once to encourage employees to get an eye examination and eye glasses.We have had employees who insist their eyesight is perfect.... but the quality of their detailed work shows us different. When we pass this small eye chart around to other employees to "play with", it quickly becomes obvious who has good sight and who-does-not have good sight. In every instance, the employee who had less than perfect sight with this eye chart chose to go and see an eye doctor..... and they now accept the fact that as you age, you may need eye glasses.
