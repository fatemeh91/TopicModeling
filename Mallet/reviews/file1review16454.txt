review/text: Works well. I bike everywhere I go and I still smell great by the end of the day. wears down a bit but thats the price for all natural.Though plain baking soda works just as well. This product is nice. I perfer woodspice or apricot though. Honeysuckle rose has got such a sweet smell I get a bit sick of it after awhile.
