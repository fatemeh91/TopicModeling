review/text: I had never purchased nor used orthotic inserts before, so I didn't know what to expect. The inserts were as described and pictured, and arrived on time as promised. They are good quality and have been a real benefit to me since I started using them. The price was the best I found either on the internet or in local stores. I will buy more of these from this source again.
