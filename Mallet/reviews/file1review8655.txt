review/text: OXO has made another great scrub brush here with this one for me! I love the ergonomical handle that seems to reduce the fatigue that I would often experience when scrubbing with many of my other scrub brushes, especially in the shower - and it protects your knuckles from the banging that often happens with other brushes as well.I really appreciate the fact that this brush has bristles that are stiff enough to clean and scrub the tiles and grout in the bathroom to get them to a nice sparkle, yet soft enough to feel comfortable to use this on my bathroom vanity countertops without fear of scratching. This brush is the perfect size for so many chores both in and out of the house - in the bathroom, the kitchen, the garage, cleaning tile floors, scrubbing outside windows, etc...This even works excellent for use when washing the cars at home to make the tires on the cars (the black rubber part) come so clean that they look brand new again; spray on a little Armor-All after and they are showroom ready!
