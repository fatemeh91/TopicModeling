review/text: This product is "just like the real thing." I have the girth and the length and this product is just right. If you don't have the girth, consider buying a tighter fit. Easy clean up, was discretely shipped (I had mine shipped to my office) and arrived on time. The bottom cap can be adjusted for suction. I travel often so this will be in my briefcase.
