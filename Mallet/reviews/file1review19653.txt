review/text: Great little toilet seat is adjustable to fit round and oval seats. Such adjustment, along with the rubber ring around it make for a very stable seat. Of course, saving the space in the bathroom by using this is a great benefit to those with small bathrooms. One huge plus that we havent seen a lot of on other training seats, is that there is a raised front to act as a "pee wall" for my clown of a son. :)Bought two we were so impressed.
