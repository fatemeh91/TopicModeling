review/text: none of the reviews or product info listed how much calcium in a dose, which is important to know. so the suggested dosing is 30ml (only 16 doses/bottle) and this contains only 1200mg of calcium. so a reasonable person should be drinking 10ml (2 teaspoons) 3 times a day to maximize the benefit. you body can only maximally absorb up to 500mg of calcium each time.for all of those that mix the 30ml with glass of milk? you're wasting all that calcium.and i don't understand why people said this is good tasting, it's so chalky & weird, i can't stand it.If you don't like swallowing the horse pills, try using chewables (tums, or that chocolate looking ones). or eat a yogurt.I got these for my kids since they are not a fan of milk, but I can't even swallow them, so won't put the kids thru this misery. I could only add this when making certain smoothies, and thinking of adding it into popsicles.for adults, i think it's a waste of money.
