review/text: I admit that I was a bit turned off at first by the first 1 star review posted on this product description. Even so, I think the low price of this product compelled me to make the purchase.I was quite surprised when I received these incense sticks. The scent is not overwhelming and I found these were a lot higher quality than most American incense I have tried in the past. As I said, the scent is not overwhelming, but instead very light. It is subtle while still being very nice. I would compare it to some very light powdery floral. Since I have received the pack I have burnt about 25 sticks of this. It is actually a very excellent incense. Not as good as Blue Box Nag Champa or Satya Fresh Rose, but still very nice. I was pleasantly surprised.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.
