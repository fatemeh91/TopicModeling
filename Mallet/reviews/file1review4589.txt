review/text: My stepdad gave me one of these a few years ago when he got it as a promo in the mail and ever since then, I have been an avid fan of this razor. I used to use disposable razors or swipe my sisters' nicer Venus razors, but I have since fallen in love with the five-blade concept! In fact, I cannot find a woman's razor with more than only four blades.The cost of the razor is okay, the replacement blades are outrageously expensive, but I find that they last a long time. I've noticed that the guys who have reviewed on here have to replace them far more often than I do...it probably has a lot to do with the fact that I'm using them on my legs rather than my face, and my legs are a lot less sensitive than faces are. Still: I used to get horrible razor burn, particularly on my calves and I always nicked myself around my ankles and on my knees. Now I have no problem getting my whole leg smooth with no irritation! I've since gotten used to this convenience, but it certainly made me jump for joy those first few months!!I realize my review might not be so helpful as this is, after all, a man's razor and I am not a man. But I just wanted to comment on how wonderful I find this razor and that it certainly works well for me. I am able to use the razor daily / every other day for a few months! The first month, admittedly, it is the nicest and that little strip up top has the most moisture at that point. Still works great, though, when it starts to wear off.Anyways. I am a very happy customer and will, despite the cost, continues to use this razor!
