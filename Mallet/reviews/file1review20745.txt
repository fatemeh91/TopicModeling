review/text: I gave up on electric shavers years ago. Then, after reading a review of the Braun Activator, I decided to chance it. WOW! Glad I did. I had it 2 weeks when it began to buzz loudly. I emailed Amazon yesterday, they emailed me today that I would have a brand new replacement shaver delivered tomorrow! That is incredible service!!! The only reason I did not give the razor a 5 Star rating is because I have had to have it replaced. But performance alone, for me, definitely a 5 Star. Also, the cleaning system means every morning I shave with a brand new razor as it cleans it meticulously well. I LOVE this razor. Braun just better not stop making it.
