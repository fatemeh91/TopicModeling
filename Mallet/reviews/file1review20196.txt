review/text: I use all the dynamic health juice concentrates.Great way to get the benefits without the sugars. We use to flavor foods like yogurt, make our own flavored water, and the popular "fat flush" program uses the cranberry juice, but some times I'll add another flavor for a slight change sometimes, all the flavored concentrate juices are good and I buy them all.
