review/text: I have been using Resolve Powder carpet cleaner for over 13 years. We live in North East Texas, and I can no longer find it. The largest city closest to us is Tyler over 50 miles, I have checked Brookshire Grocer, Walmart, and Target in Tyler, Brookshire Grocer in Quitman, Walmart in Sulphur Springs, and Mineola Texas, and to no avail. Please tell me where I can get this without having to order it from the net. This is the MOST WONDERFUL Carpet cleaner I have ever used, It will take out most anything. My dog got into the cat food over 10 years ago, He upchucked on the carpet, I used liquid carpet cleaners of every kind, they only made the spot larger. I bought some Resolve Power and the spot disappeared as though through some magic. Please I need some of this cleaner.
