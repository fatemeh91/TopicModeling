review/text: I have just started taking this supplement, so I do not have a change in energy or anything else related to report.....yet. I do, however, have a very difficult time swallowing these because they are absolutely huge. I tried cutting them with the pill cutter but the edges were so sharp it hurt when I swallowed them. It's not possible to cut them and round off edges since they easily crumble. Trying to blend them into a drink is not an option due to the very strong taste.
