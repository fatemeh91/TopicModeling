review/text: I was a little nervous that a D&G deodorant wouldn't hold up to the same standards as the scent blocking power of your rugged everyday grocery store brand, but it does! It smells just like the perfume, goes on clear, and keeps me fresh all day! If you like D&G Blue, you will love this.
