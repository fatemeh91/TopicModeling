review/text: I own 5 brands of NiMh batteries and these were big disappointments. Two seperate sets of 4 AA batteries held very short charges, wore out very quickly, and at least 2 are dead after only a few uses. Duracell alkaline may be amongst the best, but do not buy these. So far my Sanyo have been the highest performers. I use them in everything from cameras, flashes, flashlights, radios... they just are poor in all applications. Others include Eveready, Rayovac, RadioShack, Sanyo. Sanyo eneloop rocks!
