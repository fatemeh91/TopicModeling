review/text: My chiropractor recommended this for my tense muscles & migraines. I usually use it right before my bedtime to help me not grind my teeth as much. Not sure if it really works or if it just makes me feel better thinking it does. But it tastes great (although I dilute it with 3x as much water as they direct.)
