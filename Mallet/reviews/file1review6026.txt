review/text: Had this for nearly a year now and works AOK, matches Doctor's figures so excellent useful item. Not cheap, but a case where paying a little more is a good idea, health control is vital.Took a bit of time to learn how best to work the monitor but since then, easy to use. NOT A TOY, a real quality machine. If you need to check blood pressure regularly at home, this is for YOU!
