review/text: I have rosacea where the little bumps break out on the end of my nose and around it. I know in terms of rosacea sufferers, this is pretty minor -- but it's been distressing to me! In May '09, my mother bought me some of this Miracle of Aloe cream to try. It helped tremendously! It virtually stopped the bump breakouts and reduced the slight redness on my cheeks. On the few occasions I did have a small flare up, I felt as thought it healed quicker and looked less red because of the aloe. Since using this I've had compliments on my skin; I even think it's helped with wrinkles a tad (but I'm not promoting it as anti-wrinkle cream).I would highly recommend trying this product. I will say it's effectiveness is best when used 2-3x a day.
