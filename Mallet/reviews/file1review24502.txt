review/text: I love this. I was skeptical at first but I've worn a full week already and I think it's great. I wear heels to work and usually on the weekends do I needed something to actually help the balls of my feet more than any calluses. This fits right into the area where I put the most pressure. I was able to wear it with open-toe heels, sandals, boots and of course close-toe heels. After about 6 days of wear, it needs to be rinsed (it comes with instructions on how to do this) so that it will continue to stick without slipping from under your foot.
