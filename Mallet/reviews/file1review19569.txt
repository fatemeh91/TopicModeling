review/text: My 21 month old son LOVES to sit on this potty seat. It is so secure on our toilet seat - doesn't move at all because it is fully adjustable.He's not quite ready to be potty trained, but every night before bath I ask him if he wants to sit on his potty and go pee-pee and every night he does. (Nothing actually happens, of course.)We had one of those free standing potty trainers, but I just couldn't imagine having to empty that thing out every time he used it.This was one of my best purchases for my toddler!
