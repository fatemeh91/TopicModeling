review/text: I just recently tried regular Tampax tampons (as in not "Pearl") for the first time and I can't get over how long these guys are. You obviously don't feel the product as you're wearing it (good grief!), but you definitely notice the amazing length when pulling one out. It almost reminds me of the scene in "Mary Poppins" when she pulls the impossibly tall plant out of her bag.
