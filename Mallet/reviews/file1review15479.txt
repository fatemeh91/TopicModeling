review/text: I got the green (medium texture) theraputty for my 5-yr old son who has some sensory issues. He loves playing with it, and I think the consistency is good for the "work" he needs to do with his joints in order to calm his nervous system, i.e. when I put beads in it and he has to fish them out. He usually will work with it for 30 minutes or more. But sometimes he wants to play with it like you would silly putty. My only concern is that it warms up easily and becomes very pliable after a few minutes of playing with it, then it's very gooey. I think I will order the blue (firm texture) next time. And it doesn't stick to most surfaces, but found that it's extremely hard to peel it off of rubber surfaces. Hard, smooth plastic seems to work best if you're hiding things in it.
