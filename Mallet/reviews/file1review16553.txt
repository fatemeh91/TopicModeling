review/text: I was super excited when I ordered the &#34;Zippo Street Chrome &#34; lighter for my son, because the item ad stated that it used &#34;Butane&#34; fuel, and I love the cleaner burn of it over the traditional &#34;Lighter Fluid&#34;. Well, the box arrived in less than 2 days, which was great, but when I opened the lighter & discovered that it in fact used lighter fluid my excitement diminished:( I had specifically searched for &#34;Butane Lighters&#34; and this lighter showed up & clearly states fuel type as butane, so beware of these errors in product description.Other than my disappointment with the fuel issue, overall the lighter is a great quality, works great & most importantly, my son loves it!!!!!
