review/text: I bought this product for side effects I was experiencing when given the DepoDeprovera Shot for birth control. I had begun experiencing hot flashes and hormonal imbalances while on the Depo shot. I began one of the Estroven tabs nightly and slept through the night. Estroven handled all my side effects efficiently and I took it until I was able to be switched off the Depo. I highly recommend it.
