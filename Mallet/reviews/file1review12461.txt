review/text: This product doesn't do the job I was expecting. I can fall asleep with it, which is great, but after about 4 hours I wake up with pain in my little or big toe and have to remove it. I didn't understand the other reviewers that said it gave them pain in their big toe - now I understand. It doesn't seem to have enough bottom support. I'm going to purchase a splint with a flat bottom instead of an elastic band. I use it in the evening if I'm going to be sitting for awhile. It works fine in that situation.
