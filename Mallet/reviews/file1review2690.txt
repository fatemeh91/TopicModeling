review/text: I bought this thinking it might help with friction-based discomfort. Since coming off of birth control, I've had dryness issues and painful sex. This product was not helpful. The feel is silky, yes, but not slick. It took a LOT of the product to get any kind of benefit, and even then it just felt weird. Afterward, it was very difficult to clean off, and left an "after" feel about which neither of us were pleased. I can't imagine wanting to be covered in it for a "massage," either. I don't see the point of this product in any respect.
