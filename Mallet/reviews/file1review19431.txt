review/text: I bought this and found that it is audible and unbearable to my young adult children. My daughter contacted the company, who explained that usually if it is audible, then it is a defective unit, so we wrapped it, bought postage and sent it back. The replacement unit is no better. I cannot say whether it works, since I cannot use it in this house without repelling the humans who live here.
