review/text: Bought two. 'Wish I'd bought none.- One snapped apart at its hose connector within two weeks. It has a very weak, non-durable plastic connector so you have to treat these Very Gently -- not how I'm accustomed to treating gardening tools.- I'm not very happy with the patterns it sprays, but... I don't expect the remaining unit to last long enough for this to matter.Just do yourself a favor and find another product!
