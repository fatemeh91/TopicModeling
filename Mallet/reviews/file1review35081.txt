review/text: I have been using bach rescue remedy for years now. I believe that is does work for me when it comes to stress relief. It could be all in my head, but I like and use it on the regular. amazon.com had it for such a good price that I purchased two bottles. I do not like the drops, the spray is what works for me.Thanks
