review/text: I found instructions online for taking apart a 9-volt battery and getting 8 AAAA batteries out of it. If price is your imperative you can find a how-to for doing this yourself. It drives the price down to about 25cents each. I think I used a Duracell and got 8 batteries for my wife's bluetooth headset.
