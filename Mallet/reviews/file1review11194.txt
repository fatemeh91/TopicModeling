review/text: I am not a mom but am a veterinary student and I love using this thermometer on our patients. The thermometer is very fast, is accurate compared to our hospital's regular digital thermometers and the flex tip is great for both wiggly animals and I'm sure for their comfort. I hate using any other thermometer now.
