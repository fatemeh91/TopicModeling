review/text: I have had my Triumph 9400 for over 3 years.I purchased it on recommendation from my dentist who noticed a difference on my next cleaning and I have been hooked ever since.I travel a lot and was happily surprised to learn that the voltage on the charger is compatible to 220 and therefore all I needed was a plug adaptor and it charges and runs nicely in North America and all of Europe and the Middle East.I do need to replace the heads every 3-4 months - inexpensive if you buy them in multipacks.The travel case is durable and it isn't a struggle to fit into my purse or luggage.
