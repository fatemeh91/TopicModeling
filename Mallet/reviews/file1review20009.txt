review/text: I bought this tub because it folds and easy to store,which I love!!However, you cannot put too much water in it because there will be a lot of water spilling over. In addition,my baby props her feet over as it seems to be getting a bit too small for her and she's just 12lbs. I'll have to purchase a bigger tub soon. It's great for small babies though.
