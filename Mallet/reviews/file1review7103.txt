review/text: Been using these for over 13 years and just got my third one as the battery gave out and the power cord became damaged. Ive tried norelco, braun, and remington as i get them as gifts - nothing comes close at double the cost of my wahl. American made - just hope they can stay in business.The one issue i have noticed is they have been loud. But the one i just got seemed to have a different cutting blade and is very quiet compared to previous versions - looks like they might have tuned the blade to minimize harmonics.S as i go into the store and see shaver prices approaching $200 - i just have to &#34;really?&#34; Thanks wahl for keeping the sanity and providing a great product at a great price.
