review/text: The first batch of these Duracells that I bought were pretty good. Then I bought a bunch more on eBay and they were absolutely crap. I can't even take ONE picture with my little Canon camera. I press the power button and there's not enough power left to retract the lens back into the camera! And all of this done with batteries fully recharged right out from the Duracell 15-minutes charger.I fell cheated. robbed. No more Duracell for me, period.
