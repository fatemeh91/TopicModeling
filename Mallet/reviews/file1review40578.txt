review/text: This works perfectly. Crystal clear glasses and very shiny plates! You do have the follow the directions very precisely and perhaps experiment the first few times to see how it works best in your dishwasher. I do use 1/2 of what I would use for normal dishwashing detergent. I pre-rinse my dishes and I sometimes use vinegar in the rinse-aid tank (but it does not seem to change performance of this product - vinegar was very useful with other products). It can't seem to handle cheese as the directions make clear, so, you need to make sure that is removed. It will overfoam if you try to use it like other detergents.
