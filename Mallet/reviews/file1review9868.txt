review/text: I've owned several slanted tip tweezerman tweezers, and I love every one of them. The design and construction of the tips is not fine, nor rigid enough to provide a solid pinch on a hair, so it doesn't serve the purpose that I purchased it for. It has become more of a craft pair of tweezers for me. Not suitable for ingrown hair.
