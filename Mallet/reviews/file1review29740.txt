review/text: I guess these are for between feedings. While my son is nursing one side ,the other side is completely soaked and it looks as if i have no pad at all. These really did not help me and are a waste of money and time. buy the disposable kind or even better , use sanitary napkins with leak guard. At least they have sticky backs to keep them in place.
