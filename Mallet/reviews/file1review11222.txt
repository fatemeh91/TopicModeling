review/text: This thermometer is accurate and easy. Most importantly it is fast. I have one for my two year old boy and I bought this after trying other thermometers. This was by far, the best one. I couldn't believe how fast it took his temp. Many other digital rectal thermometers take a minute. I highly recommend this over an ear thermometer, etc
