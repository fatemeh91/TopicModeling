review/text: After trying numerous natural cleaners, you begin to realize that many are all-purpose, but some just won't do every task. If you run out of one cleaner, you can't always use another to do the same task. With one bottle of Bi-O-Kleen, you can literally clean everything in your house. This product will even clean mirrors to a streak-free shine. You can use it in the kitchen, bathroom, on walls, for carpet cleaning, to remove laundry stains, clean stainless steel and chrome, shine up plant leaves and even clean toys, RVs, Cars and Boats.Ingredients: Surfactants, wetting agents and degreaser from coconut, grapefruit seed and pulp extracts, cold pressed Valencia orange oil, linear sulfonate and filtered spring water.This is a very safe cleaner and I feel good about using it on the floors and counters. I'm always worried about cleaners being used around my cats, but with this one, I don't have to worry because there are no harsh fumes. I used to have to lock the cats out of the room I was cleaning, but now they happily sit at the open door, watching me work.Added Bonuses:Guilt-Free Cleaning - Won't harm rivers, streams, plants or wildlife.Safety Factor - Won't harm vinyl, stainless steel, painted surfaces, chrome or porcelain.Non-Flammable - unlike other orange cleanersNeutral PHNo Animal TestingI love that I can use this on mirrors! It won't cause you any respiratory problems like other glass cleaners can and I think it cleans glass perfectly.~The Rebecca Review
