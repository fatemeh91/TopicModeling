review/text: I got this soap because a few years back I had gotten a sulfuric face wash from the dermatologist. I am currently unable to see a dermatologist right now and remembered that the main ingredient used was sulfur. So I looked for something similar and saw this, so I thought I'd give it a shot. I still have acne, but not as bad as I did before I used this. This soap does make a difference, but it's not going to clear up my face completely. So I'll use this until I can get to the doctor, but this is a lot better then regular acne face washes that you get at the drugstore.I've been using this soap for months now and it works great! I love how great my face has cleared up. I still have a few zits here and there, but for the most part my face is pretty clear. A big improvement from before. I just bought two more bars of this soap. I want to use one in the shower, maybe it can clear up the rest of my skin. I only use this soap now. Great product!
