review/text: I know this is a more costly seat, but save yourself the hassle of your poor little one falling into the toilette because of an ill-fitting seat. My toilettes are oval, and the cheaper seats were just so unstable, this one is great! It adjusts to the width of the potty, definitely worth the money!!!
