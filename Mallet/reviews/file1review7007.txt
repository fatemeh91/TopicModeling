review/text: In my quest for the perfect shave I ordered this razor having tried Panasonic, Norelco and Remington razors. I currently use a Remington Microsreen MS3-3700. I was intrigued by this shaver because it comes with 3 foils for different levels of closeness. After 2 shaves, one with the closes shave foil, and one with the middle shave foil, I'm sending it back. The close foil did indeed give me a very close shave, on a par with my Remington Microscreen MS3-3700, though with a bit of irritation, but it has the following fatal flaws:1. Vibration is bad. Feels like you're operating heavy equipment.2) Unergonomic. I't fully rectanguler unlike other foils that taper around the area where you hold it. Makes it very hard to use. Btw, the model 400 appears, from pics, to be a more ergonomically shaped model.3. Battery life the worst of any of the 5 shavers I've tried. I'd give it about 20 min on it's first charge. I do realize that after several charge, discharge cyclles the battery capacity increases somewhat, but this is much worse than my experience with other shavers. It uses NiCd batteries, btw.You can do much better with any of the other brands.
