review/text: I have several different products from this company. They are amazing. The first one I purchased I have had for almost 12 years now and it is still in great condition. The only downfall is the bigger ones don't fit as well in my microwave so I have to take them out halfway through and move them around to make sure the entire thing heats well. But they are amazing! I got into a pretty severe car accident and they do wonders for my back and neck problems!! And now they come with covers that you can wash! I LOVE that!
