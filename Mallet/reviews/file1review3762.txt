review/text: I started taking 1, then the next 2 nights took 2, then moved up to 3. After moving to 3 I did not notice much of a change (been constipated for months drinking lots of prune juice just to go) and got a little angry and stopped taking it. Well over the next few days I was going regularly, good formed movements even, I was amazed. So works for me and I don't even have to take it every night. I am sure taking 5 would clean you out completely, I just don't have time to sit on the toilet all day.
