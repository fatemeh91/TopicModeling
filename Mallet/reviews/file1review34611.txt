review/text: I purchased the Vitamin B12 Sublingual 1000mg . As a RN I know exactlyhow sublingual Rx and Vitamins should work. I find this brand of sublingual do not disolve under the tongue appropiately. Takes about one hour to disolve, vs 10 minutes. I question if they are really manufactured as a Sublingual or just given the title.When taking B12 it is important to take sublingual vs tablet or capsule.
