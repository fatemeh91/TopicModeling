review/text: After a couple bad experiences with DigiPower and their battery chargers they sent me the DPS-3000+ as a replacement for my older DPS-1000 unit. This item came with four (4) 2300 mAh AA NiMH batteries. A nice break from their older chargers this one comes with an adapter and a nice long power cable so you no longer need to find a free wall outlet to completely cover with your charger. The unit will charge either AA or AAA batteries and either two (2) or four (4) at a time. It also features an automatic trickle charge feature so batteries remain 'topped off' with no danger of over charging. It's relatively speedy at charging batteries. It is compact enough to fit on the corner of your desk or anywhere convenient. And it doesn't get all that hot like their older chargers used to. I keep two batteries 'fresh' in the charger and two batteries in my camera at all times and it seems to work well for me. All in all it's a good charger for the money. Although DigiPower's customer support leaves something to be desired (long contact delays, misread emails, etc.) they're willing to back their products fully.
