review/text: I purchased this product because I have had Remington's in the past, inexpensive and reliable. However, from the first time I used this razor, the charge only lasts about 20-30 seconds. In that amount of time, I can't really accomplish much. This purchase was a complete waste of money and now I am stuck using the old razor I was attempting to replace. Now I am faced with starting from scratch. BUYERS REMORSE!
