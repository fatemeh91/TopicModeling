review/text: Great product! If you'r wife or girlfriend can hold it long enough it will melt your stressed muscles away! Pays for itself after 2 uses. This machine replaces 2 massage therapists at $100/hr and the 1/2 tank of gas you'll use to get there. Variable speed is great. My wife can only use it on the low speed(tender skin) and complains that it makes her hands numb when she's using it on me. I say &#34;suck it up cupcake&#34;, its my turn to be pampered! Rednecks need pampering too! Just don't tell anyone!
