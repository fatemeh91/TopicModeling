review/text: This item does not work in a car. You cannot use it and have any part of your back touching the actual car seat. It would be good for promoting upright posture so that one can balance a book on one's head while driving, but who wants to do that? The center of a good lumbar support needs to be somewhat concave. I just found really good ones at Walgreens for $5 each!
