review/text: My husband started taking these Livatone capsules about 10 years ago when he had several elevated liver test results. Not only did the Livatone reverse the liver problems but he was no longer having gout attacks. He had suffered severe gout attacks often for several years.He has recommend Livatone to other people he knows with gout and they have had the same results.
