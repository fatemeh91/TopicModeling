review/text: My girlfriend picked this up for me at her work. Personally I'm glad she got the thing on discount. It's no better than the M3 Power razor I have. The difference in closeness of a shave was minimal to nonexistant, more closely bordering the latter I'm afraid. On top of which, the new head design renders shaving with the grain, or the downstroke, completely useless. And the detail trimmer on the back of the head is dull and useless right out of the packaging.The single improvement this razor has over the last generation is that the handle of the blade is more comfortable in the hand and balanced better. The downstroke is useless, the upstroke is the shave. The total shave is overall the same except that I can't use the downstroke at all anymore. And at the jacked up price they're pumping out these beauties at, it's not worth anything at all. I'll stick with my M3 Power. Sorry Gillette. Your new thing just ain't the best a man can get.
