review/text: I received these cartridges by mistake instead of the Mach3's ordered. The idea of 5 blades that are battery operated to vibrate in an orange handle seemed like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. Very gimmicky and overkill and bordering on kitsch. But rather than going through the hassle of returning them I popped in the battery after rolling my eyes at this corporate invented need and gave it a try. As much as I wanted to hate it, I found it to be a definite notch up the shaving food chain. The blades are very sharp and the vibration somehow seems to allow the head to glide more smoothly and evenly over the beard. The shave and closeness were the best I've ever experienced. Even the single blade on the opposing edge for maneuvering in tight crevices like under the nose worked perfectly. All this comes with a cost. When I surfed over to see what the cartridges actually cost I was horrified. Soon they'll need to be locked in a glass container at the grocery store with an armed guard in front of the display. Second, not sure if it's planned obsolescence engineered into the cartridges, but the blades seem to last only a few shaves, making them even more costly. The blades being mounted so close to each other also make them hard to rinse and they clog easily. Buying in larger quantities lowers the cost per unit somewhat. Personally, I'm hoping beards come back into style to create some downward pricing pressure.
