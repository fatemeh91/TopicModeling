review/text: I use this gel when cycling. It delivers on the promise of keeping blood sugar stable. I have type 1 diabetes so that's really important. The taste is pretty good (Espresso). I usually don't consume caffeine so the 50mg per serving is a little high for me, but I switch to the Chocolate flavor halfway through my rides so that's not too much of an issue. I bet those two can be mixed without being disgusting, though I have not tried it yet.I use this with the GoToob Sky Blue Medium 2oz tube by humangear. Works well.
