review/text: I took this with my first pregnancy and by the time I was in labor, my cervix was already 4cm dilated. I had a relatively short labor, but two of my other friends who also used this product, starting at 34 weeks, also had advanced thinning and dilation, so I think this product is a must have. If nothing else, it helps keep healthy circulation and it certainly doesn't hurt!
