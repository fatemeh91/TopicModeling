review/text: Bought one case with bleach and one without. BOTH arrives leaking badly. My UPS guy pretends he doesn't notice and leaves them at my door then leaves as fast as he can! I try to flag him down but he doesn't see me. Anyway, the boxes weren't damaged, I just think it was the heat on the UPS truck. There is a temperature limit on the box. I guess shipping to Florida in the summer via UPS is enough heat to make them pop open or something. Same must be true for Arizona and a lot of places. Aside from leaving a HUGE MESS in my entranceway and aside from the general inconvenience and disappointment...THIS IS A HAZARD! My child slipped and I almost slipped also! This stuff is so concentrated that getting spills up requires a lot of work. I'm still afraid that there may be residue and drips in front of my house, the driveway, etc that may become very slick in the rain. I probably am going to have to hose or pressure wash EVERYTHING out there! Amazon is neglegent for attempting this sale. UPS is neglegent for making my home hazardous. (You can't tell me the delivery guy didn't see and feel and smell the leakage). Obviously I will only buy liquid detergents locally from now on.
