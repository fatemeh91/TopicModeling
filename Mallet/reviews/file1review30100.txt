review/text: The plague known as bad breath facing this country is easily tamed with Altoids latest blockbuster release: the cinnamon strip. Just place a few of these red hot bacteria busters on your tongue and prepare yourself to embark on a wild ride full of plot twists and near-death experiences. The 32 strips contained in this package should last at least a week, but I suck these down faster than my cigarettes, and usually burn through 2 tins a day.Equally as enjoyable on hot summer evenings and cold winter mornings alike, Altoids delivers with the punctuality of a 16 year old kid on his first job interview. Any other breath extermination product is inherently inferior to Altoids (TM).
