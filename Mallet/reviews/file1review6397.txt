review/text: I bought this for my teenage son who works out a lot and has soreness frequently. I myself have scoliosis and have daily back pain, but I am sort of used to it. Anyway, I woke up this morning laying on my back and when I tried to get up I was hit with painful spasms in my back that made it virtually impossible to move. I had to call my husband from the other room to come help me out of bed. Anyone who has experienced spasms knows how painful it is and it is very hard to even find a comfortable sitting or lying position. If you move just wrong, it'll send you back into intense spasms. So I'm on the couch trying to find a comfy way to sit and I thought of this gadget. I had my son bring it to me and started applying very firm pressure to different spots on my back. When I finished, I found that I could move much more freely, without any more spasms. Now, it wasn't a 100% cure, but it made my day much more pleasant and I was able to move around and do everything I needed to. What a relief! I am a believer.
