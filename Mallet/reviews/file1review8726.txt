review/text: I use scrub brushes a lot and I've used a lot of brushes. For around the house, this is my very favorite brush. I keep one outside and one inside. I use the outside brush around 3-5 times a week to scrub out the rubber water bucket in my dog pen and three big cement bird baths we have around the house. Everytime I use it, I am thankful for it. The bristles are firm and tightly bundled, the face of brush is slightly convex (very efficient for getting into the little crevices a flat face doesn't get into so easily) and the handle length provides great leverage. That brush stays outside too, in the rain and sun, and it hasn't lost a bristle in the six months that I've had it. The inside brush does kitchen duty and is great for that as well as for bathtubs and showers but for me it really comes into its own as a general household utility brush. Floors, carpet, furniture, screens, anywhere yuckiness happens this brush can handle it. You don't always need a huge brush to get the job done, just one that works really really well. Like this one!
