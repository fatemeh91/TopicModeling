review/text: This mask is just what my husband and I were looking for. It has an adjustable strap which makes it very comfortable to wear and stays in place. You can fall asleep while you are using it but don't keep it on too long because your eyes will feel strange. Don't worry, though the strange feeling will go away in an hour or so. When you warm it up the heat will stay for approximately 15-20 minutes which is about how long you should keep it on at a time. I would definitely buy another one of these. Also, the shipping was even quicker than expected which was very nice. This is a must buy if you have sinus issues or a cold. It will make you feel better.
