review/text: This three wheeled "walker" is lightweight and extremely easy to handle. It comes with a good sized carry pouch for stowing handbags and other gear. The brakes are excellent but... there is no means of locking the brakes on. If you are on a hillside this can be quite dangerous. This "walker" is suitable for the almost mobile, not for someone who has balance issues.
