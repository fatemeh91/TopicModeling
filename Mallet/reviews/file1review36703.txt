review/text: We used to buy this product from Whole Food Store. Amazon offers a better price on this certain flvored vitamin C (blueberry flavor). The other flavor the peach one is not sold for reduced price. Other than that, they both taste great. My kids are looking forward to their Yummi Bear's gummy multivitamin and Natural Factor's vitamin C every day. It becomes their routine.Sometimes when they start craving for a piece of candy, we offer them a vitamin C tab, they are healthy and taste great. We adults love to take them too. Vitamin C is always a good health booster. I am pleased with the product. It is natural, no artificial colors or flavors as other similar products.
