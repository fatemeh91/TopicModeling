review/text: Have always had trouble getting a really clean shave with electric razors - especially the neck - especially if I skip shaving for a day or two (which I sometimes do on weekends). With this razor, no problems at all, the shave is really superior. It catches hairs other electrics miss. The self cleaning thing is a little over the top for my taste. I'd prefer a less imposing stand with a smaller foodprint and more subtle lights, but hey, it works! Altogether a terrific upgrade on my old Braun, and in another universe compared to my (very) old Norelco.
