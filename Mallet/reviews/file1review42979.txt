review/text: The Fragrance Counter UK shipped this item blazing fast. I didn't know they were based in UK but to my dismay, their item shipped faster than the one I ordered from here within the United States. And, I've to reiterate the aftershave was genuine and the box was totally sealed. I've got few from other vendors whose boxes were not sealed. And, Fragrance Counter UK nicely packaged the stuff. I'll buy from this seller in future for sure despite the demographic boundaries. A definite recommended seller.
