review/text: I picked this up the other day because I wanted something that would not only open up my nasal passages, but would also help reduce my fever, cough & other symptoms. While it did help open my nose up more (making it run more so it could clear out), it didn't really do anything for any of my other symptoms.The box claims that it helps with "Fever & Minor Aches & Pains", but in truth I didn't really feel that it really helped with any of that. Other than helping make my nose run like a faucet, it didn't really do much of anything else. For the price I paid for it, I just didn't really feel like I'd gotten my value over the store brand of Sudafed.
