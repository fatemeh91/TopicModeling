review/text: This was my first replacement for this razor that I was so impressed with when I first tried it almost 2 years ago. It was probably long overdue, but I finally ordered this replacement blades. It was like I just pulled it out of the box new again. Next time I won't wait so long to keep this thing tuned up. FYI - I don't buy the cleaning solution for this. I bought a gallon of denatured alcohol for my local hardware store. When I need new solution, I clean out of reservoir real good and refill with the denatured alcohol. I then add a few drops of my favorite cologne. I change up the fragrance with every refill. Much cheaper and I get a nice variety of scents. Give it a try!
