review/text: I was recommended these many years ago by a health food store. Since then, I've even given them as Christmas gifts. My gifted friends and family swear by these, too. Whenever I start getting run down from my stress-filled job, I start taking them and then, when I feel better, I taper back off. They're the best for a flu or cold. Get them and try them. You won't regret it! Money well spent and best deals through Amazon.
