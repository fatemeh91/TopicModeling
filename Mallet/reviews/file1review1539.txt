review/text: I started using this on the large warts on my hands. One was on my knuckle, one on the inside of my finger and one under my thumbnail. At first the warts got really nasty and looked like they were turning white and puffy. It was also annoying having to keep bandages on all the time, however I learned after a while that it is best to keep the bandage on for most of the day and then take it off around 4pm or so in the evening. Eventually, the trick is to peel off the warts after a couple weeks of using the PediFix Wart Stick. Then apply the stick for another week or so and it should be all but gone. Mine took me a little longer because I wasn't consistent which I'm assuming is what most people will do so don't give up! Also, I never used a Q-tip or duct tape or anything like that to apply the stick although many recommend it. Whatever works for you.
