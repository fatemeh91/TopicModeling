review/text: As a long standing type 1 diabetic, I would experience excruciating leg cramps three to four times a night (diabetic microangiopathy). My diabetologist recommended one 30 mg capsule at bedtime. Since I started taking Pycnogenol over a year ago, I have not had any cramps, not one! To be able to sleep withought painful interruption is a miracle. I highly recommend this product.
