review/text: Ive been using this on my 18 month daughter for a while now...its been very pleasant smelling on her and the texture is so soft....I love bathing my little one now :) IT seems to make her dry skin smooth..though she still needs a good moisturiser after the bath. Got to try their moisturiser too ...three cheers for li'l goat baby wash!!
