review/text: Okay, I've removed hair from large portions of my legs by tweezing the hairs out by hand, one at a time. I assumed the pain from this product would be about the same, but over a larger area. I was wrong. The tweezer, even with the pain softener hurts like heck. I admit, however that I do have quite thick hair and somewhat sensitive skin so it may not hurt you as much. I followed all instructions, went slowly and quickly, used both speeds, and had little success. Then I discovered (and I didn't see this anywhere in the instructions) that pain is GREATLY lessened if you pull the skin you are epilating as taught as possible using your free hand . That's made it bearable although it still hurts me a great deal. I will probably continue using it because it's supposed to get easier after the first few times. The shaver head works very well, but the opti-trim attatchment is bogus. Also, neither the shaver or tweezing heads collect hair very well, so if your hair is long, it may make a mess.
