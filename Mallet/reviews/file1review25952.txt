review/text: We ordered this unit along with a new digital camera, and could not get the batteries to charge at all, so obviously it is useless. The unit is clearly not operating properly. I am in the process of attempting to contact their support department and will follow up more with what transpires, but am disappointed that this unit was not properly tested prior to shipping.
