review/text: This item arrived dead! There was no damage to the box, this item just didn't work. And Amazon doesn't allow exchanges for this item. I called the manufacturer and they told me to return it to the store where I bought it and they would exchange it. Well looks like I'm stuck with trying to have my bank recover my money from Amazon.
