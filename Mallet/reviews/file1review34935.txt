review/text: First I should tell you my previous sleeping habits. It normally takes me 1-2 hours to officially go to sleep. When I wake up, I feel very tired and can barley get up. The last dream I can remember was when I was like 8 and im 19 now. I've tried several pills and they never seemed to work.I stumbled on Melatonin - Time Released. I take one pill at night, i'm asleep within 20 mins. That was what I been looking for, something to help me go to sleep. Laying down with your eyes closed for 1-2 hours is annoying. Sometimes I don't even go to sleep because it takes too long. When using this, I wake up with energy....another plus. I don't stay there laying down, eyes barley open, letting time go away. Im up in 8 hours fresh. These pills work, and i'm happy I found these bad boys. Not only that they are very cheap.About the dreams, Melatonin solved that. I can remember my dreams now, and this helps, being that I want to write movie scripts. I'm so glad that I found these, especially at this time. I'm starting college soon and if I didn't find these my sleeping habits will effect my learning.Try them its cheap, and works.
