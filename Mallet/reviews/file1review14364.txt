review/text: We have a pillow top thick mattress that is 12-inches deep. The fitted corners on this product do not fit a thick mattress, so the corners continually ride up. I have ordered straps to hold it in place, hopefully that will help and it will not tear. It is not excessively noisy when you turn over. I am unsure if it would be to hot in the summer, we have a mattress pad on top of it and it seems comfortable for this time of year.Update on 11-26: I purchased a set of BedBand's from Amazon and they work great at keeping the corners from riding up. I feel the manufacture of this mattress cover should make another model for thicker mattresses, a lot of people now days have a pillow top mattress.
