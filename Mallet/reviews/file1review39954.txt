review/text: The taste of this is great! It smells like cake batter and I have to fight the kids for it.It's made with natural vanilla and no artificial sweeteners (which was hard to find). Sweeten your smoothie with fruit or xylitol or stevia if you choose. This is not bitter and has no aftertaste.It has a good balance of micro-filtered whey protein isolate and ion-exchanged and hydrolyzed whey protein concentrate.It also mixes well, with no waste at the bottom of the cup.(No rBGH either)
