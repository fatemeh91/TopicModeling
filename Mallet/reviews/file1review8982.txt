review/text: I've tried every vitamin and green food out there and this has by far the most effect for me. I've recommended it to so many people I can't count and EVERY SINGLE ONE is still taking it, despite the dollar per day cost. All report more energy and mental clarity. Some report clearer skin, lower blood pressure & other antioxidant benefits. Before taking this I was on daily alpha lipoic acid, green tea, grape seed, CoQ10, and a daily multi but I ditched them all for this & see more positive results with less cash out the door. Highly recommended.
