review/text: I have been very pleased with this powder! It is definitely the best tasting vanilla whey powder I have tried! The label recommends blending it to dissolve the powder, but i found that it dissolved surprisingly easily. Some of the other whey powders i have tried tend to clump and seriously resist dissolving. It also tastes surprisingly good. (I mix it with ice coffee, a splash of almond milk and one packet of splenda). I was also pleased with the nutrition - it's relatively low calorie and the calories come from the protein, not fat or added sugar. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!!
