review/text: After hearing about this candy bar from a UK friend on icanhascheezbuger.com, we ordered a set of 6 bars. The taste of the rea Cadbury chocolate was fantastic (here in the US, the Cadbury chocolate is made by Hershey's - it's just not the same taste). Liked it so much our next purchase was the package of 24 bars. Love the way the bar flakes chocolate off - we leave it in the wrapper to catch the flakes of chocolate. Highly recommended treat to have.
