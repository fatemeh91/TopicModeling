review/text: Just received this today in the mail! Only took two today because I got it after work and didn't want to take them all at once. Shipping was nice, came a day earlier! It comes in a nice size bottle and is sealed nicely. My husband and I are just starting to ttc. But I know that I have irregular cycles. Very long and often don't have periods. I chart my temps for a while now do I know my body and know I am not ovulating. I really hope this will help before going to the doctors! The pills are a big large in size but they are so very easy going down. I don't even feel them and they dont smell. I know when I have took vitamins before as soon as I would open the bottle it would stink and every time I would burp it tasted just like the smell but these pills don't do that! I will do an update if anything happens. :) baby dust to everyone!!
