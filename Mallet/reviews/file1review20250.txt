review/text: Not sure about them for a diaper but I love them for burp rags. The prefold diapers aren't as absorbent as these. For those that open a pack and panic trust me they get better with each washing. I opened them and figured they were useless. I figured they were good for nothing. I am so glad I washed and tried them anyways. They absorb and wipe up so much better than other burp rags that just push the spit up around. The more these rags are washed the better they get. No nursery is complete without a stack of these.
