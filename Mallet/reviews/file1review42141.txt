review/text: My wound care provider uses these as mesh barrier layer on my hard to heal skin ulcers and I have been very pleased with how well they protect my wound without causing skin irritation. I have incredibility sensitive skin and react badly to most dressings and adhesives but this works very well, as does the similarJohnson & Johnson Adaptic Non-Stick Dressings (3 x 3-Inch), 12-Count Dressings (Pack of 2).These have made a significant difference in my wound care treatment, and I am thankful that my insurance covers them!Highly Recommended!CFH
