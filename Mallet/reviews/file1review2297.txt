review/text: If you think vitamins are a waste of time and or money, think again. When I am taking these vitamins regularly, I definitely have more energy and get sick less. Sure enough when I had run out of my VM-75s, I did get the makings of a sinus infection and fought it the way I usually do - with a neti pot and apple cider vinegar routine. Although I was able to keep things at bay, I wasn't really healing. Low and behold, I ordered my vitamins from Amazon, starting taking them and back to normal I was. This is a great vitamin at a very reasonable price. It helps having the reliability and timely delivery of my order from an Amazon merchant standing behind my purchase too. Would definitely go this route again !
