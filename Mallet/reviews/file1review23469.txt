review/text: I LOVED the product when I first received it but after about a month or so of sitting on my dresser untouched the plastic part, the heart, began to crack. However that hasnt affected hearing on this product. It's still a good quality product considering the price. If you're willing to spend the extra money, your money would be much better spent on a Littman.
