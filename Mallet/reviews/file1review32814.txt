review/text: i always had the impression slim fast was an "older person" diet being the only people i ever knew growing up who drank slim fast products were typically all my grandma's age.at 24 after having my daughter i packed on quite a few pounds which resulted in all sorts of depression which led to more pounds.after failing at many other diet attempts, including prescribed pills, i decided to give one final try and make a solid attempt. i stumbled on the slimfast 321 diet and figured it was worth a shot. i ordered the shake mixes and adjusted my eating habits accordingly with a little bit of exercise and after 2 months i have already lost 16lbs. i adjusted the calorie intake to 1400 being i thought what they suggested was a bit low but am still having tons of success and loving it. i feel such a joy inside of me knowing i will have my old body back and i couldnt do it without slimfast. i even have new outlook on slimfast products and that is that EVERYONE with weight issues should try it.
