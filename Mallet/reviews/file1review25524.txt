review/text: This device probably provides the easiest method for trimming long nasal hairs. It works quite well. This Panasonic will definitely trim your hair very quickly and efficiently. And it will certainly do so in a manner that appears much safer than using pointed scissors. However, do not expect it to be a completely comfortable experience. You may experience some hair pulling and slight tugging at times. In fairness, trimming nasal hairs will probably always be an awkward process.The device, like most Panasonic products, is made of good quality materials. The cover to the battery compartment seems to have a fairly good seal. The cutters seem to be made of stainless steel. All of that makes cleaning the unit very convenient. You can actually wash the unit under running water to clean it. A ventilated cover protects the cutters. The ventilation on the cap probably helps prevent moisture from building up on the cutters.The unit measures approximately five inches long. It requires one AA battery in order to function. I do not know how well this unit will function for its other purpose: trimming ear hairs. Thankfully, I do not suffer from that condition.
