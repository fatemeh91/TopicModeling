review/text: This is a very effective product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is in need of a digestive solution. I used this at the recommendation of my doctor for digestive health and was very personally surprised to not need any sort of laxative or other such product in conjunction with the Bromelain even while taking an iron supplement. As a daily addition for anyone with a need to have a little bit of an easier time with digestion and a more comfortable bathroom experience this is a great product.
