review/text: I just received the item in the mail today. I knew it was plastic, but the quality was really below my expectation. The edges around the openings are rough, and the smell of the plastic was really bad (and I am supposed to stick it up my nose!). I was really disappointed, but it's a lesson learned that you get what you pay for. I would return it but it is so not worth the time and paying for the return shipping just to get $6.00 back.
