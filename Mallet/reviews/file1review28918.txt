review/text: I've tried all 17 Optimum flavors and they are NOT the best tasting. I like protein shakes that taste like a dessert with absolutely zero "protein shake" taste. The only flavor I could enjoy a little was "Mocha Cappuccino", because the bitter coffee after taste masked the "protein shake" taste.If you're picky and not liking Optimum either, I suggest trying Wellements Pro-Rate Vanilla Cream. It is the only protein shake I can truly enjoy. Don't get the Wellements chocolate flavor, I only had one scoop of the entire 6lbs bag and had to give it away to my ex-...Yuck.My tongue works very well and yes, I am very picky.
