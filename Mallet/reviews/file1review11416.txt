review/text: I have used night guards of all types for many years. I have paid $500 for the custom fit plastic guards from dentists to $20 for "The Doctor's" boil-to-fit guards (which I could never find a size that quite fit right and several times ruined them in the process of boiling and fitting). All of them usually ended up somewhere besides my mouth within a few hours of going to sleep. Regardless of price, none of them lasted much longer than 1-2 months for me. And, with the boil-to-fit guards, they are such a hassle that I found myself going without.I found this product on sale somewhere for $29 and figured it worth a try. I have been using for two months and have yet to wake up without it still in my mouth. It works great, fits comfortably and has held up reasonably well. Though, I am certain it won't make it the three months they guarantee it for so we'll see how many times they will replace it under warranty. Don't fault this product though - every dentist I've seen says I have the worst grinding problem they have seen. I usually crack their professional versions w/in a week.This would get 5-stars except the price is 2x other over-the-counter offerings and the guaranteed durability for average users is only 3-months. If this was always $29 or closer to $20, definitely a 5-star product.
