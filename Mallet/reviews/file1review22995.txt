review/text: This cream smells amazing and is not overpowering. The lotion is creamy but not heavy or greasy, it almost feels whipped. I slather it all over myself and my baby. It moisturizes all day and doesn't stick to clothing. It also has rosemary in it which is a natural bug repellent so I love to put it on baby when we are outdoors instead of harmful bug sprays.
