review/text: I bought the Bormioli Rocco Sorgente cooler glasses earlier this year - they are lovely but they are narrow glasses and because of their shape, it's very hard to get my hand and sponge down far enough to clean the bottoms. This bottle brush does the trick. Also use it to clean wine glasses.
