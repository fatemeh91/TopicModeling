review/text: I bought this because I like to shave my head in the shower but prefer stubble over the smooth look. I was worried that this little trimmer wouldn't be able to handle the job but it's been great so far. Only issue I've found is that I really have to make sure I rinse the blades under a strong shower stream after each pass, because the hair tends to end up bunching in wet masses under the blades. No big deal. Very comfortable. Great charge life. And surprisingly quiet too. I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a way to shave your head in the shower. I've never used any of the guides/clippers etc. that came with it. Tossed them right in the trash because I just wanted the close blade.
