review/text: Seriously for the price right now, this chair is a steal !I bought this for my home "relax / sleep" mode chair.This chair really helps blood circulate in your back and kinda refreshes oneself. It has good cushion (not so soft) so that the motor/vibrator doesnt poke you. I have seen other chairs and have 3 different leather chairs, but i would rate it the highest for satisfaction and low cost. It has 3 modes, 3 positions and 3 intensity levels.I mean even if one of the vibrator fails (not likely) it is still a sweet leather chair :).I would recommend this for any person who would just like a break from anything u know.One of the best leather chair deals out there .. period.nuff said.
