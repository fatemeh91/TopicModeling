review/text: I've never met anyone in person who didn't like this Therapy Massage Bar. Therapy was one of my first introductions to LUSH products, and it got me hooked. I find the scent to be just lovely, and vaguely reminiscent of chocolate oranges, with a heady, sort of calming and luxurious feel to it. It does smell different out of the package than it will on your skin, so be aware that a first whiff may be misleading. One of my friends used this bar on her growing stomach while pregnant and said that the oils not only helped ease itching, but the scent also helped with her nausea; she includes them now with gifts she brings to baby showers.If over-used, this bar can feel downright oily and pore-clogging, but the key with Therapy is to use it sparingly. I enjoy using mine as a lotion (I do have very dry and sensitive skin, so the extra oils work well for me regardless) by flipping the bar around for a few seconds in my hands and then putting the bar down in its tin and just using the amount left on my fingers to rub onto my skin. If my skin's in bad shape or I've just shaved and need a little extra, I'll swipe the bar up and down my leg once or twice and then put the bar down. In my experience, if you keep rubbing the bar onto your skin until you think you've got enough oil, you'll have more than you really want.One of the things I like most about this bar (and LUSH products in general) is that it's made fresh and doesn't have the chemical fragrances or preservatives so many skin care products contain. I break out very easily with many scented products, so I love having one that I can use with no worries. I do dislike how easily the bar can crumble if you try to use it with any pressure (like one does for a massage!) but that's a minor complaint, and the fragments do make melting a small amount in your hand easier and faster.Overall, I highly recommend this product. It's excellent for use with a partner or solo and, used lightly, will last well.
