review/text: I'm concerned that some reviews here seem to indicate that AEDs require a license or other specialized training to use. Most states require that users take an approved CPR class that includes AED training. Most CPR classes today offer this additional training. If you are concerned, call your local ambulance or fire department. They should have good information about the requirements (if any) in your area.AEDs save lives. They are very, very easy to use. They should be in every home and office in the United States. They are made to be virtually "idiot-proof." It is EXTREMELY unlikely that you could shock someone that didn't need to be shocked. They walk you through just what to do in a cardiac arrest emergency.I have been a career paramedic for nearly a decade. I have managed dozens of cardiac arrests. Of the very few "saves" we have had, almost all of them involved the use of an AED before we arrived. CPR is important, but it's been overrated by TV. The #1 goal when the heart stops -- whether you're in the operating room, emergency room, in an ambulance, or lying on your living room floor -- is to defibrillate that heart in an attempt to get it to beat normally again.An accepted statistic is that the chances of survival decrease by about 10% for every minute the patient is without a pulse. In most places, you're lucky if you can get an ambulance crew into your home in under 8-10 minutes. Factor in the time it takes you to realize what's going on and to call 911. You do the math. Even with CPR, without an AED it's just about hopeless.This is a good product. Anyone who can afford it should purchase it for better peace of mind. You should also take a CPR class and familiarize yourself with the unit.
