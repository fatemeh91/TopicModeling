review/text: I recently stopped using antiperspirants because they were causing me to develop an underarm rash, probably due to the aluminum-based ingredients. Although I would prefer a product that could keep my underarms dry while inhibiting odor, I do like this deodorant.Note, however, that although this deodorant contains propylene glycol (PG), there is another deodorant that does not (Herbal Clear PG-Free) -- but it is a different product made by a different manufacturer. I don't know which product arrived on the market first, and it seems VERY odd that two competing products are allowed to use the exact same name, but the PG-free deodorants with blue labels are separate from the deodorants in yellow containers, which are made by 21st Century HealthCare, Inc.Understandably, having two independent products with identical names on the market at the same time has led to some confusion. I have seen consumer reviews and comments posted on-line by people who think that the PG-free product is a new formulation of this one.
