review/text: I didn't want to be wasteful with all of those disposables, but even with my thickest bra these were visible, and in order to have enough around to always have a clean set available it just seemed silly (I mean, new mom nursing a baby isn't doing laundry very often... unless you're doing cloth diapers I guess, in which case maybe this makes a ton of sense...)
