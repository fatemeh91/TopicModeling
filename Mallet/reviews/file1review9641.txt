review/text: I have horribly dry and cracked feet. I've tried numerous products and nothing has ever worked - until I found Zim's. This stuff is amazing. I think the liquid is much more effective than the cream. I put it on 3 - 4 times a day and wear socks and literally within 2 weeks there wasn't a single crack on my feet. I couldn't believe it. Unfortunately it's getting really hard to find the liquid in the stores now, so I'm resorting to buying it online.
