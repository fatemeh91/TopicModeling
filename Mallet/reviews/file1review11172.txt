review/text: Okay so i purchased this for all my 3 kids ages 6,4,2 i tried it first on my 6 year old who could not breath at night due to a cold, 2 drops in each nostril he blew his nose with boogie wipes and he was asleep within seconds breathing through his nose, iv used it then on my 4 and 2 year old, the 2 year old i will do one drop in each nostril and you really need to do this once i have found once works for us through the night so yesterday my 2 month old had a stuffy nose and nothing was helping him, he is a breast fed baby and would not drink one drop of this on each nostril and he was drinking and fell asleep through the night which he never does im guessing because he could'nt sleep he slept more, i know it says to ask a doctor for the ages of 2 and below however with any medication i am very careful, we dont vaccinate nor give over the counter meds we do more homeopathic caring when someone is sick but this has been a blessing so be careful thats all i can say it works!UPDATE.........WARNING!!!!!!, i posted good feedback on this product yesterday it only took a day to realize that even though i used it on my 2 month old baby and it clearly states on the box NOT FOR UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE UNLESS CONSULTING A DOCTOR, i used it on my 2 month old 12lbs baby anyway, one drop in each nostril cleared his nose and he was asleep in no time HOWEVER that was at about 3 am and all day the baby slept more than usual he would"nt even nose and most of the day i was full!, i and my husband thought perhaps because he did'nt sleep right the night before he was catching up or as i thought perhaps he is changing his sleeping pattern, last night and throughout out the am his little nose became stuffy again but this time i just kept putting saline spray and removing the phlem from his nose with nosefrida which is the best!, this morning and after noon he is back to his normal self of being up for most of the day and nursing and he did'nt even sleep that well last night, i have concluded that this product may have made him sleepy as it does state that will be one of the effects of this nasal decongestion.So BEAWARE! and i only used it once, one drop in each nostril, i would not do more than that and will only use this if really need to where he really cant breathe or is not eating at all due to as stuffy nose but not after the saline spray and nosefrida, also keep this separated from the saline spray from the same brand as they both look similar in packaging except that this product is shorter in size, this morning i told my husband to give me the saline spray and he grabbed this one, the lights were dim just when i was about to spray is when i noticed it was not the saline spray, thank God i looked before spraying!Baby only seems congested at night through out the day he is fine, i am also placing drops of breast milk into his nose it seems to work just as well as the saline.....
