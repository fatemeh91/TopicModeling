review/text: This thing works great for getting dishes clean -- it's sturdy and well-engineered so that you can scrub really hard, and the bristles get into some places a dishrag can't reach.I took off one star because mine leaks a little, whether I store it right side up or upside down. Now I just leave it standing up in the kitchen sink drain, so that doesn't matter.
