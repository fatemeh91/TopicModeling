review/text: I have not previously taken supplements and was recommended this product. Since I was new to supplements I eased my way in, taking just 1 pack a day for the first week. I believe it says that as an option on the label also. I took this product while doing almost only high intensity cardio. I went through one cycle and it was a great way to jumpstart a weight loss plan. Went from 220 to 205.The one negative I did notice was it caused mood swings for me, probably because I never have caffeine. But I only noticed that when I took it after workouts, caused me to be on edge probably because I wasnt moving around enough.Other than that one downfall this was a great product that showed results for me.
