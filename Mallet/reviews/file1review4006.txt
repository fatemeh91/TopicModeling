review/text: I'm curious why the plastic on these blades does not match any of the plastic on my razor or the colors from my other blades purchased at my local convenience store, but since these blades work I'm not (totally) complaining. 5 blades are definitely better than 1. I think the price in general for this brand is out of control, but it's probably the best that I've used.
