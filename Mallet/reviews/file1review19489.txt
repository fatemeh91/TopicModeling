review/text: Started with a BABYBJORN Smart Potty and then upgraded to this when the kid was a little over 2. Wanted to associate the toilet itself with going to the bathroom.There is a know that you can turn to adjust a bracket on the bottom so it will secure itself to the toilet (won't shift laterally but you can still pull it up off the toilet) which is reassuring so you know your kid won't magically fall into the toilet if this trainer is off-center.It works great. Just put the kid on the toilet and wait. YMMV if your kid actually goes to the bathroom but I don't think that's any fault of this product. It works as any toilet seat should, just for your toddler.
