review/text: Smooth Move will do the job. A nurse recommended it to me. Just be close to the toilet when the cramping starts. It really cleanses. I get constipated every so often due to a thyroid problem. It seems like whenever the doctor changes my dosage, I get that way. I really have tried everything over the counter.
