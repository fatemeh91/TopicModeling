review/text: I purchased this cooler bag for our City Mini Double stroller - fits perfectly! Velcros right on to the frame - it doesn't stay level though, tips forward just a bit, but that didn't effect the functionality of it at all. We used it for a day trip to Manhattan - it held 3 juice boxes, 3 milk "juice" boxes, baggie of apples, baggie of sliced peppers, 2 cooling packs. It is a tight fit - would fit 6 soda cans exactly. It didn't get in the way of the undercarriage storage or our feet. I am going to purchase another one for the other side to hold more snacks and something for Mama to drink.
