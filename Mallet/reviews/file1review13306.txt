review/text: I bought two of these because we co-sleep with our 2 y.o. son and he's always wetting the bed; now I can change to my spare if he wets in the middle of the night and I don't have to wash the waterproof cover that fits my king mattress -- THAT always took at least 3 times of running the dryer instead of just once with this pad. A great purchase and very absorbant.
