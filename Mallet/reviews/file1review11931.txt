review/text: I have been taking the Garden of Life prenatals until I went to the store and they were all out. I started taking these instead, and I have to say I'm not impressed. After being on the other prenatals for a year and having no problems this vitamin gave me a metallic taste in my mouth! I now understand why people have trouble with morning sickness. The metallic taste is just awful! I do like that it has digestive enzymes that help it absorb, but I just can't deal with the tangy taste in my mouth all day. Just for anyone who is wondering my daughter is 5 months old, and I'm not pregnant again so there is no other reason for a metallic taste. Plus the taste stopped after I quit taking these pills.
