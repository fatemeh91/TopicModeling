review/text: well i was debating if i wanted to get the white light or the ionic white system. seen both on t.v and figured they should work. well since ionic white was priceier i figurd it will work better, plus i saw the review for white light and they didnt seem to great so i put in the extra 10 bucks and got the ionic. the process is pretty annoying when you have to swish the stuff in your mouth for 7 min every time...you can acumulate alot of spit by that time so its messy. but all in all my teeth are alot whighter. and they were pretty yellow. i like that it comes with a 60 day mouth wash that you have to only do twice a week for 2 min. not to bad for the great results.
