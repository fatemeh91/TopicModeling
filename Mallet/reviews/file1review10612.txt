review/text: I needed a great travel mirror to do my face in hotel bathrooms. Most of the mirrors are too far away for close up makeup application. I had a mirror that broke, re-ordered it from somewhere and it broke again! But this mirror is not only well made but the glass quality is superior! Absolutely worth the money!
