review/text: I have been using the Lansinoh Disposable Nursing Pads, but were given these Medela ones as a gift. They are much more thicker than the disposable ones and very easily seen under my clothes. It was not attractive at all. The Lansinoh disposable Nursing Pads are much more discrete and comfortable than these. These are nice that they are reusable but to thick for my taste.
