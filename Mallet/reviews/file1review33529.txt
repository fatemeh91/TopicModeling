review/text: I use this Waterpik for nasal irrigation, on the lowest setting, along with the Sinu Pulse Tip (separate purchase). It is noisy, but I was expecting this, having had experience with the brand in the past. Be aware of the following statement listed under "Warning" in the product's operation manual: "Do not use this product for more than 5 minutes in each two-hour period. Longer usage can overheat the motor and cause product failure as well as voiding the warranty."
