review/text: I picked up ON 100% Gold Standard Whey Protein Powder just a few days ago and I love it. I got the double rich chocolate and the taste isn't that bad. It isn't as sweet as most other powders but its a no-nonsense powder with no extras. I checked some of the powders I was using and was upset with all the additives such as crystalized taurine and creatine but ON is a straight and to the point powder.One additional thought: If it isn't sweet enough you can do two things, 1) decrease the amount of liquid used, or 2) add a touch of fat free or reduced fat chocolate syrup to add a bit of sweetness without too many calories!
