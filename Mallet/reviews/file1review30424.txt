review/text: This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used. It does not dry out your skin, and my breakouts have been at a minimum since starting this product 2 years ago. I use it along with the toner and moisturizer. It is pricey, but I only have to buy it 2-3 times per year, as a little goes a long way, and I wash my face twice daily.
