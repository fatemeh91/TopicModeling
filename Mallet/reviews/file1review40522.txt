review/text: Having been frustrated for years by the streaks that Windex and similar cleaners leave, and knowing that professionals (and my mother) used vinegar to wash windows, we thought we'd give the Earth Friendly cleaner a try. We've only used it for about a month on the windows in our sun room (where any streaks will be VERY evident when the sun rises) and on car windows. It is MUCH better than Windex at not leaving streaks and smears, but does leave some. However, that may be partly due to my not changing the wipe rag often enough. Regardless, we would definitely chose this cleaner over Windex. Bought in Amazon's 12-pack, the per-bottle cost is about the same as Windex and it's definitely a superior glass cleaner.One thing you have to get used to with it versus Windex is that it does not evaporate nearly as quickly, and therefore requires a longer wipe time (as does a home-made vinegar cleaner). Doesn't bother us, but something to consider if you have arthritis, fibromyalgia or similar affliction.
