review/text: I like this product a lot. The only real problem I have had is that the measurements can vary greatly each time unless you are very careful. The measurements goes off of the amount of pressured applied and when it reaches the right pressure before you set the caliper you could get false result.The measuring tape is awesome, it makes measuring arms, legs and waists a snap. I use this more than the caliper.
