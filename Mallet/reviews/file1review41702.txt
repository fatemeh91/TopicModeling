review/text: Upgraded from my old Vitality to the 9400 because I got a deal on it. I'm not sure if it vibrates faster because it's brand new, but it seems faster than my old one ever was, and my teeth were noticeably cleaner feeling after using it, with the same sensitive head from my old brush. Feels a little more comfortable in the hand because it's a little larger in diameter. Another plus is there's less rubber in the handle though it's not slippery at all, making it less likely to smell as funky at the base as the previous models. The base is harder to clean because you need to disassemble it to thoroughly clean it.
