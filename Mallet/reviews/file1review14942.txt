review/text: The idea about the ring and the bullet is good, however this product is a very low quality one, first there was a problem with the contact between the bullet cable and the battery pack, second when the small bullet is inside the special compartment in the ring it eventually gets wet, and slips out of the compartment, so the idea of reusable vibrating ring is good but this product was a complete deception.
