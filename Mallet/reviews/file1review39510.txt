review/text: I really enjoyed using this product, since it didn't make my legs dry and itchy. I liked that it has aloe in it, was easy to use, and I didn't have to worry about soap drying on my skin. Also, it was good because it was very gentle on my legs, unlike men's shaving cream. It also smelled nice and had a good lather.
