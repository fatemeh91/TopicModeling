review/text: I bought the Nuxe Reve de Miel lip balm because I've seen a bunch of beauty bloggers raving about it and since I'm a lip balm junkie, I had to check it out for myself!It is super thick and rich, so much so that I actually don't really like to wear it during the day unless my lips are feeling particularly dry or I'm in a very cold dry climate. I bet this would be awesome to wear while skiing! My favorite thing to do is just put it on at night and when you wake up it will still be there!! How insane is that? For the guys, this lip balm is also very matte so you won't look like you have lip gloss on. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but a little goes a very long way so I'm sure this little jar will last forever and you will get your moneys worth.
