review/text: I've been fighting a bit of non-itching fungus for a while now on my stomach of all places. I've tried the standard OTC creams and such, and while they'd seem to knock it back immediately you could see the 'spots' coming back in time for the next treatment with 'full bloom' almost immediately once treatment stopped. I started using this product a couple weeks ago now, and while it didn't look like it was doing much at first after about a week the fungus was visibly disappearing. After the 2nd it appears to be gone, and this is just using it once a day as a body wash. In addition, a couple of callouses I hadn't even thought were fungus related dried up / crumbled away to reveal fresh new skin. My skin seems healthier now than it has in a long time.Heh, it's true that using this as a full body wash makes me smell like a tea tree, but I find I like the smell so it's all good. It's also not that strong except when you're applying it. Even if I didn't like the smell I think it would still be worth using since it's effective against what I had.Also, as another reviewer said a little goes a long way. It doesn't take much at all to cover a large area.
