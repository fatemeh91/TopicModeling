review/text: I think I must of had chronic foot fungus and jock itch. My feet were always periodically cracked and scaled from time to time. This wash helped a lot, my feet are no longer scaled, still feel dry sometimes but the cracking and scaling is what I couldn't deal with. As for jock itch, well, it went away!
