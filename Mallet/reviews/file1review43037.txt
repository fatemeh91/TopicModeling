review/text: The small size indicates it fits up to 175 lbs however my daughter weighed 150 when we got this and it was too tight. I would opt for the next size because she is not able to wear it. She is due it January and by the time we return and receive another her pregnancy will be over. She still does not weigh 175 lbs.
