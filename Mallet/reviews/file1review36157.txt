review/text: The Black & Decker Glass & Jar Cleaner is easy to use and works great. The extension just snaps onto the B&D Power Scrubber (PKS150) with ease and extends the reach into average water glass height. It's best to soak glasses before scrubbing, and the battery-powered Power Scrubber is strong enough to attack just about every task. The PKS150 is fully submersible so it can be used for all kinds of cleaning jobs in the kitchen.
