review/text: I bought 2 pairs of these. I have one in my walking shoes (SNEAKERS) and one in my slippers. I have Plantar Faciitis and needed something to give arch support especially in my flat slippers. At first, they were quite painful to use. The pain was mostly in my arch because that's where all my weight was pressing on the WalkFit. They come with three insert heights. I started with the lowest and as the arch pain decreased, I have increased to the highest insert. I still have Plantar pain, but nowhere near what I used to have before the WalkFit. If you have the same foot condition, don't give up on these right away due to pain. They are hard plastic but they need to be to support your arch.
