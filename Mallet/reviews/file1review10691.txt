review/text: My husband was disinterested in his new pill organizer.... til the FIRST time he used it!Says it's the greatest I have ever gotten for him (thru Amazon in Oct, 2011). Our 14 yr olddaughter was showing HER friend his containers and said 'he just picks up todays box of pills,sticks it in his pocket and he's gone! it's great!'. It makes it easier for him not to misshis pills throughout the day. I would highly recommend it.
