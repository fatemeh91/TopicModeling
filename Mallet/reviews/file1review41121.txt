review/text: Sugar-free portable caffeine. What a great idea. Now I don't have to drink a liquid to enjoy the benefits of these caffeinated mints. 1 tin for my briefcase, 1 for my car, 1 for my Uncle Buck the Truck Driver, 1 for my niece Sally in College (finals week!) and maybe a 12-pack for my nephew's company serving in Iraq! 3 pieces of gum have the same amount of caffeine as a cola bevvy.
