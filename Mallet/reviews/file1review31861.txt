review/text: I will say that I am new to the wet shave product line, but I ran across this and started reading the reviews and even went to their website for more information. I think this is a very good product for the price. The pump head is a bit on the small side but nothing that is a problem. The product smells good and the wife also likes it. It is not over powering and is a good compliment to the lavender soap, pre shave oil that I also purchased. It does moisturize well and it is a big improvement from the Gillette, Nivea and other stuff that you get at the store.
