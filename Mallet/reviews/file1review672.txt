review/text: I am truly surprised to see all the 5 star reviews here for these Zoe's Chocolate Delight bars. They just don't taste good at all to me. There is something "off" about the taste. The chocolate doesn't really taste much like chocolate at all -- I'm not sure how to describe it. In addition, there is an aftertaste that other people have mentioned they noticed in Zoe bars. Even taking into account that they are designed to be lower in refined sugar and higher in fiber, they are still quite bland and could use more sweetness. In no way do they taste even close to a candy bar like other protein bars can. I am a major connoisseur of the lower-sugar, lower-calorie, higer-fiber protein bars, and I have to say that Zoe's bars rank last in my opinion. I have had many other bars with the same approximate amount of sugar and number of calories that were all sweeter, more filling, more satisfying, and simply taste way better all around. Three of my favorites that I would recommend: Kashi's Go Lean Rolls, Detour's U-Turn bars, and Balance 100 calorie bars.Of note: I have also tried Zoe's Peanut Butter and Zoe's Chocolate/Peanut Butter bars, and they are slightly better than these, thankfully. But I'd still only give them a (generous) 2 of 5 stars.
