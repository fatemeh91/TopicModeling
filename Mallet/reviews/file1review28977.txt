review/text: I've worn a three-day beard for almost eight years, and this combo shaver has performed extremely well as shaver and trimmer. The design allows for neat beard lines, and the shaver--with multiple passes in heavy beard areas or neck curves--performs solidly. Considering the price, it's nearly a steal.The reason I rated it at four rather than five stars is because I've gone through three of these in eight years--the first one just stopped working after about four years, and the trimmer on the second one broke very recently. Just bought the third (great service again Amazon, BTW). But for roughly 40 bucks, maybe a four-year life in a shaver/trimmer is good these days.
