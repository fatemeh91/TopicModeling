review/text: I bought one of these for a friend who had suffered a DUI and couldn't afford to get another. We use it when we've been out to a party or drinking after work and want to know whether it is safe to drive. There's been more than once that we went back inside to "cool off" for about an hour before driving home because this thing read over the limit. I certainly didn't feel like I was impaired - it is pretty surprising just how low .08 really is. For me, that is about two microbrews and my friend, three. It does make a big difference whether you've eaten much that day as well. I think the people complaining about this device either aren't following the directions, or aren't willing to believe they are over the limit when they really are. I've never gotten a 000 reading after having anything at all to drink, but have tested it without drinking and every time got 000. Follow the simple instructions and it will work for you too.
