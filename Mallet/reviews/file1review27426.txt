review/text: I've had miriads of horrible tasting powders in my days and most are damn irritating to mix as well. This powder is fair priced, easy to blend (I use a high quality immersion blender), and tastes so good I even have it for a healthy dessert sometimes instead of a sweet. Choc Mint fan for life.
