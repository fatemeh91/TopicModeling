review/text: I really like my Braun Activator razor but was thinking about replacing it with a new one when the foil cracked after a year or so of daily use. While researching I decided to try replacing the foil and cutter block as a cheaper alternative. Other than the long delay from the time of my order to actual shipment the order process went smoothly. The replacement parts snapped right in and the razor is back to like-new performance. A bit expensive but worth it.
