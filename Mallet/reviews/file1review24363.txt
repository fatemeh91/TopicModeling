review/text: I love all Hammer Nutrition products. This Gel works perfect for me. It has a good non-flavor and a smooth consistency. GUI's and some Gels flavors cause a gag reflex with me especially after 3 or 4 hours walking in an event. Hammer products work great for me with no cramping side effects.
