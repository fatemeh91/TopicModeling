review/text: This stuff is supposed to be "natural". It has such a strong chemical fragrance that it caused my wife to get a migraine within 2 hours of first applying it. We had a one time use stick of deodorant that went into the trash can. If you are sensitive to chemical fragrances, or are trying to be chemical free - DO NOT BUY THIS.
