review/text: I'd give this product 5 stars but today only 4 because the price just continues to rise. I guess you get what you pay for and overall this is a great product. Limited additives, clean protein, easy to mix and build into your workout regimen. If I had more time to cook MASS amounts of foods and just eat that after working out I would... but I don't, and this makes it easy to get some quality protein after a workout (very important).
