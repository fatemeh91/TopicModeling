review/text: I was tired of using disposables so I wanted to try these...I was so excited because they felt less 'plasticky' than the disposables and claimed to have a boundary to prevent leakage. I didn't mind that they weren't very discrete under my nursing bra/cami and that they shifted around a little. What made them useless was that they let milk get through my bra and shirt after less than a couple hours of use. They didn't actually seem to leak through to the other side, they seem to collect milk and then let it sink down to the rim of the pad where it leaks at the edge of the pad. So much leaked through!I did read some reviews that said reusables aren't good for early nursers...so I will try them again when my milk doesn't really flow as much. Still keeping my review as only 1 star since they leaked when they're not supposed to.
