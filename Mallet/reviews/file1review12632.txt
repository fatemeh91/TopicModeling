review/text: I have dealt with constipation quite a bit so I decided to try a colon cleanser. Sometimes only having a bm once a week! I don't like how laxatives work. So, I bought oxypowder. The first night at 4 pills did nothing the next day, so the second night I increased to 5 pills. I definately was able to go the next day, so the next evening I took the same 5 pills at bedtime. By 4AM I was running to the toilet. Every two hours, uncontrollable urges to go and ended up missing work because of it. I could barely hold it in! AWFUL! doesn't seem right to me for it to be pouring out of me. Think I will go down two pills tonight but if I keep on having this turn out, I will stop. Cant afford to miss work.
