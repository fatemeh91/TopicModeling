review/text: I read several of the reviews for this product, and agree with the vast majority of them, on the other hand some of the other reviews were just ridiculous! I am a paramedic and a firefighter for a medium sized city and we use AEDs on our engine companies. I have probably used an AED in excess of 100 times. While our AEDs have a momitor built in and we can override the AEDs desision, most AEDs do not have this ability and only shock a "shockable" rhythm.Because they are only programed to shock certain rhythms, I would say that it would be pretty much imposable to kill someone with an AED. If someone is in arrest, they are pretty much already dead anyway. If the pads were hooked up incorectly, it would be unable to recognize the rhythm and therfore would not initiate a shock. As for burning a the person because the pads dried out, if I had the choice dying from cardiac arrest or being burned, I would choose being burned any day.As for the individual who seemed to feel that Philips was trying to replace EMS personnel, I've yet to see anyone go from v-fib to walking and talking! In fact, I am guessing that the included video instructs the user to first call 911, as I know the written directions do. I am sure that even the most unsophisticated person could use this product with the training provided with a video or just by looking over the written directions. The AEDs pads show where they should be placed, making it even more difficult to make a mistake. AEDs have been used by non-healthcare profesionals for years in airports, malls, comercial jets, hotels and numerous other public areas for years with positive results. This is just the next logical step.While an AED will not save 89% of the people it is placed on, the fact is that early defibrillation is a major factor in saving viable patients.
