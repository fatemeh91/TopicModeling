review/text: I used to be a soap and razor man but after I obtained this Braun as a gift from one of the kids I changed my mind. I tried them all, 3 heads, straight heads but none shaved like my razor until this Braun. I had tried an earlier Braun model but it didn't compare to this self cleaning shaver system. I replace the heads every 6 months and the cleaning fluid every 2 months and things are smooth if you get my point, lol.
