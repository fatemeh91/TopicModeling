review/text: I've been using Thermaphore (sp)heating units for over 30 years. The only problem I've ever found is that the switches wear out, but as soon as it does, I order another one. Once I sent it back to the factory and they shipped me a new one. I go to sleep every night with the switch in my hand, raising and lowering the temp until I fall asleep. I can hardly stand to go away from home if I forget it. Makes it terribly hard to get to sleep. Guess you could say I'm addicted to this medical aid. I am currently having serious back/spine problems and the Thermaphore is the best medicine. It's a marvelous product.
