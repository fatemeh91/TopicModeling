review/text: I couldn't imagine how this would help get rid of trigger points on my back but decided to give it a try. It is much, much, much better than any electric device. It actually reduces or gets rid of painful knots. I can easily reach them and apply as much or as little pressure as I want. My physical therapist recommended not only manipulating a knot with it but also applying it with a lot of pressure against a trigger point for 15 seconds. The latter technique seems to get rid of the trigger points even faster.
