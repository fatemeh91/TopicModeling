review/text: I've always thought that Windex was just about the best glass cleaner available and also served as a terrific general-purpose cleaner. Well, it seems like a lot of other things have been encroaching on it's market place. Then last time I bought a glass cleaner that came in a spray can. My wife liked it. This time I went back to Windex and picked up a 32-ounce spray bottle of Windex Advanced. Evidently, it's a new, slightly altered formula. Boy, this stuff is terrific. I just did the car windows, inside and out, and it was about the easiest time I can remember. And it left a minimum of those pesky streaks. Plus it did a nice job on the dash board and arm rests. It even gave a nice cleaning to the plastic covers on the headlamps. I'm almost tempted to try it on the whole car! It's just a terrific cleaner!Gary Peterson
