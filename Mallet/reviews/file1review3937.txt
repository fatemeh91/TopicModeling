review/text: Well these strips work great. I'm always skeptical about products like this because I've rarely known a quick-fix product to work for me, and I think alot of the time the results are all in the consumer's head. I also never have the patience to go through the entire duration instructed on the box. However, I've been using this product for two days now, and I already notice a difference, and my friends do too. I can only imagine how white my teeth will be at the end of the week. The fact that it only takes a week is worth it to me, too.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is because it is making my teeth ridiculously sensitive! I've had my mouth closed for an hour now and the pain still hasn't subsided. I might just be a big baby, but it's a very intense tingling, that of which I'm not sure I can handle for the entire week. However, all in all I do recommend this product and I doubt your experience will be as painful as mine.
