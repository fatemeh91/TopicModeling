review/text: Horrible Product, spend the extra money and get a product that will last. This product has numerous flaws that affect both the usability and the longevity of its use:1. You CANNOT use the trimmer unless the battery is charged. I was half an hour late for work today because the battery died mid-trim. I had to wait half an hour before the battery was charged enough to finish the job. There is no battery meter on the product, so the only way to use reliably is too leave it charging 24/7 so that you know it is fully charged when you need it. As you probably know already, leaving it charging all the time is horrible for the battery, meaning that you will probably only get a year or two out of the product before it can't hold enough charge to finish a single trim.2. The adjustable guard is extremely flimsy. If you put even a slight amount of pressure on it, you will end up with an uneven trim3. The part that connects the cutting blades to the base is extremely fragile. After dropping it one time, it broke off, so now I have hold down the top part anytime I want to use it.
