review/text: We all know what electric toothbrushes do. They brush for you. So what does a flosser do when you put a battery and a little motor in it?Well, if you're like me and your teeth are packed pretty tightly together, flossing usually means wrapping floss tightly around your fingers, pressing hard up between your tight teeth in a sawing motion, and finally having that little thread pop through and whip your gums.The hummingbird saves your fingers from strangulation, and the vibration makes the floss slip right through even the tightest spaces.I was skeptical about vibrating razors too, and now hate shaving without one.And honestly, it's insanely cheap, if nothing else, use it to round out a $25 order for free shipping ;)
