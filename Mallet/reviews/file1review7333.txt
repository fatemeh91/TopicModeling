review/text: The Aqua-Jet Foot Spa does have some great qualties. Such as the rotatable aqua jets, which work really well. They only have two in the front where your toes are though. I wish they had something else in the back. Overall the spa does what it says but the massage nodes that help relieve stress are hard too feel when you roll your feet over them. It was kinda of a struggle to do and I had a friend try it and she had said the same. The heater does work well as long as you put luke warm water to start with. If your are looking for a relaxing foot treatment that practically knocks you out from relaxation, this is it. It may just be a little too pricy.
