review/text: These tabs are super convenient when it comes to the dishwasher- you have a pre-measured amount of soap every single time. I have always used powdered soap in the past, and anyone who has ever used it knows that it's easy to add too much or not enough. These tabs definitely help with consistency. As for cleaning, they work very well- my dishes come out clean and have no residue.The only downside is that each tab is individually wrapped. I'm guessing that they would react with humidity, so the packaging is to keep the potency at their max. The wrapping is easy enough to remove, but it's a minor inconvenience. If you are environmentally concerned, the individual packaging would probably not make you happy either!Overall, dishwasher soap in the form of powder is probably a little less expensive overall, but the convenience of these tabs definitely makes them nice to use!
