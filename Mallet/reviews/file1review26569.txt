review/text: I use the inflatable lumbar support every day, but find it is very small and does tend to lose air. It would be more effective if larger and if used in a more rigid chair.I did bring to the attention of the owner, the loss of air, and was sent 2 replacements. Now I have a 2nd one to use in my computer chair.May even deflate when I travel and take it on train or plane, similar to the inflatable neck pillow.Rather than use the strap to affix it to me, I velcro the strap around a pillow before placing it behind my back.
