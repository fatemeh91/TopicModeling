review/text: When I ordered this product, I wasn't sure if it was good value, or a waste of money. There was really only one way to find out for sure, so I took the plunge,and voila! I hit "Pay dirt."This product was delivered faster than "On time" and does exactly what it is advertised to do. I have determined that it is a fair value. If it were a "steal of a deal", something would be wrong, and I probably would have wasted money.Yes, I wish it were less expensive, but the fact is the price is competitive and the company selling it has to make a profit. If they didn't, they would be gone and I couldn't get the product, which gives me good insight into my overall physical condition and susceptibility to medical problems.I am happy with the truthful advertising, fair price and great delivery. I am willing to buy this product again.
