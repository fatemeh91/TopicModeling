review/text: Do you remember the first time that you shaved with a Mach 3 Turbo? You were young, perhaps, and the hair on your face was effeminate and soft. As you slid the cartridge-razor over your youthful, silken face, the hair just seemed to glide away with the razor and you were very happy with that. But as the years went on and your facial hair became the thick forest of black cable that you currently have to fight off with a weedeater to remove, that Mach 3 Turbo slowly lost your faith. Perhaps you've even tried to convert to some other brand, hoping that even more razors crammed into a piece of plastic would do the trick.Not so.Your first shave with this simple, single-blade, stainless steel safety razor from Merkur will not be easy. But it will change your life. Where you may have been forced to use pressure to hold the cartridge-razors of your youth close enough to your skin to actually give you a clean cut, this blade is not some pair of safety scissors - the mere weight of the metal on your skin is enough to close in on even the deepest of furs.Gentlemen, do your adult-face a favor and dump those sissy cartridges. You're a man now, so why not use a man's razor?
