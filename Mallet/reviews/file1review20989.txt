review/text: I have had this unit for two years and have had some mixed results. My first unit lasted 6 months, burned up with a pop and smoke. After returning this unit my next unit is working but I have to be careful to not run it too long. After about 4 to 5 min. it starts to heat up. I Purchased it to be a heavy duty unit at $220.00 sorry to say it is not.
