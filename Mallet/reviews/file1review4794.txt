review/text: For excellent taste, wide spectrum of quality ingredients (many ingredients are Organic) and pricepoint, I always choose the 30 oz. size (90 day supply) of Macro Greens. I purchase it from Amazon for an average price of about $55 with free shipping. To do the best that I am able to under my circumstance, I (gasp!) blend it with another powdered green food (Green Max from Swanson Health, 10.6 oz for $11.99 + shipping).This works well for me. I enjoy quantity, quality and taste all within my budget.
