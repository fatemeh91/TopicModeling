review/text: I just got this beard trimmer about a week ago and I'm in love with it! The razor is comfortable and super easy to use! Although I'm sure this product is only supposed to be used on your beard, I have found that it trims up my side burns and eye brows incredibly well too! I really like the simple yet extremely effective design of this product! One of the smaller features that isn't really mentioned is that fact that the trimmer guard is mutli-directional so you can choose to take your time and go with the direction of your facial hair growth, or if your in a hurry you can go against the grain and still get a great trim. The only con I have found is that I personally would make use of a guard length that was a bit shorter than the smallest one offered. Overall, amazing value for a product that far exceeds its $14 dollar price tag, and that's including shipping!
