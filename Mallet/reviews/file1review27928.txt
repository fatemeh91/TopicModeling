review/text: There isn't much to say here that hasn't already been said. This is a great powder. It mixes very easily. I regularly take three different types of powder and this is the only one I don't need a blender for. It goes down smooth. It tastes great. I buy the Chocolate and mix it with skim milk, but water is okay too.
