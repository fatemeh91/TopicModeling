review/text: I purchased this mask for the cold effect, not for the heat, and I have only tried the cold mask. Personally, I think it's great. I can keep it in the freezer forever (in the provided plastic bag) and not worry about it until I need it. I use the mask to soothe my eyes when they feel fatigued or when my eyelids feel swollen. It feels wonderful, and I sometimes find myself dozing off after a few minutes. Other reviewers have commented that it doesn't retain the maximum cold temperature for more than 15 minutes, and that is true, but you really shouldn't apply a freezing cold pack to any part of your body for more than 15 minutes at a time. I'm very happy with this product.
