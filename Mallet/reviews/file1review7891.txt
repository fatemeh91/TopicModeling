review/text: I have been using this product every since it came out many years ago. It works beautifully, the residue washes off, there is very little irritation (you are pulling hairs after all!) and I've had no secondary skin reactions. Everything else I have used wasn't effective in removing hair or caused one problem or another. When my local (world's largest retail) store stopped carrying it, I panicked, but Amazon came to the rescue!
