review/text: In Dusseldorf once I bought a German-made eye-mask that was the last word in eye-mask technology. It was darned expensive, but after having used it for years I wish I hadn't bought three or four more.This one, the Bucky "40 Blinks Mask" is probably the best I've seen for sale domestically. There are no plastic buckles in the back: it fastens to itself using velcro. The straps are proper thick straps, not strings. There is a puffy hollow in front of your eyes, so your eyelashes don't feel crushed: the face mask material is made out of washable foam, not leather or satin.The best thing about this eyemask is that is hugs the bridge of your nose quite a ways down. This will take a few nights of getting used to since it creates a slight pinching feeling, but the big advantage is that very little light will be able to get in through the little crack in the nose opening, a common problem with masks that merely lie flat on your face.
