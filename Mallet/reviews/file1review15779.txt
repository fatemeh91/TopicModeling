review/text: I've owned Cross pens since 1994 and have always been satified. Their pens are durable work-horses that never disappoint. Some friends gave me a Cross Century II fountain pen for a graduation, but the nib was too large. Cross replaced the nib for free. Waterman wanted $45 for the same change.I've used my Tech III regularly for about three year. Because I am a teacher, the different colored inks and the pencil are handy throughout the day. The pen is light in the hand and doesn't grow slippery during extended use. The ink cartridges empty after a few weeks of heavy use, but are easily replaced at Office Max or Staples. Not all replacement cartriges are the same. I've found some produce a smoother flowing black and others a smoother flowing red, so the right cartridge brand for you may take a few tries.One final note about Cross' service. About a year and a half ago, I was carrying my Tech III in the side pocket of my painter's pants. The top unscrewed and fell off in a parking lot without my knowledge. I called Cross, and they quickly replaced it for free. Very satisfied.
