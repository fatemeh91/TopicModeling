review/text: I wanted to give this mop negative stars. Absolutely the worst mop I have ever purchased....EVER! The sponge head kept popping off the entire time I washed my floor. The only way it would stay was with the pressure of me pushing. I would get a few swipes and then off it came. I ending up just holding the sponge and mopping the floor by hand. I've never wrote in about a product, but it was so frustrating. I finally find the time to wash the floor and then it was the biggest hassle. Don't buy this mop.
