review/text: I started taking this supplement with a recent illness and the feeling an over stressed immune system. I took it until they ran out and felt great during that time. I had no reoccuring sickness but once I ran out about a week now I'm starting to have more issues. I am buying again to take these for the next couple months to see how I do. Overall I do think the benefits I had were from taking this product.
