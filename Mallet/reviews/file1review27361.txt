review/text: We've tried several different brands and flavors for whey protein powder, and the Extreme Milk Chocolate by Gold Standard is by far the best tasting. My kids LOVE when I make a shake with Publix low fat frozen yogurt, milk and one scoop of this delicious protein boost. This is their favorite quick breakfast during the school week.
