review/text: I tried this out a few times on my baby, but as a breastfed baby, my daughter really did not care for bottles or pacifiers, so I ended up using a regular thermometer that you can buy at any drugstore for a couple of dollars. It might be wiser to spend the extra money on a toy to entertain your little one while you take the temperature with a regular thermometer.
