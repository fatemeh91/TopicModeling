review/text: Let's face it. You want to go on a diet. You love sweets and you hate that most meal replacement bars taste like the pressed cardboard they're composed of. Today is your lucky day.I bought a pack of these to get some protein (which satisfies cravings) and satisfy my sweet tooth on the recommendation of a friend. They are rich and delicious.I am not going to lie. The texture is a bit weird at first, but the taste over rides this minor issue, making these well worth the money. At 210 calories (about the same as a chocolate bar) you can feel satisfied and stay on track too.Why cheat on your diet when you can have delicious chocolate and lose weight too?
