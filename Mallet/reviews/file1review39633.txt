review/text: It uses a lot of floss, but it gets everything. It's sturdy, but I'm already seeing a little rust on the metal that holds the knob to the stick.STILL, I use organic, sustainable recycled floss with this, and it helps me feel a little better than everyone else ^-^TO MY SIDE FLOSSAID, AND WE SHALT CONQUER THINE BITTEREST OF FOES!!!!!
