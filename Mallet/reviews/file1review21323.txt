review/text: I like my toothbrush and these heads. My only complaint is that they wear down quickly so you have to replace them often. I'm not sure if all electric toothbrushes are like this but it seems I replace these heads far more often than I ever replaced regular toothbrushes. Good product though and does a great job cleaning.
