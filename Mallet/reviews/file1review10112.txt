review/text: I ordered this product for my husband since he is a heart patient and this winter has had more problems with being outdoors at all in the cold. He gets chest pain when the arteries constrict while breathing cold air. It seems to work well! He has had good results with being able to be outdoors for limited amounts of time while using the mask. It advertises to "warm the air" as you breathe and it seems to do just that.
