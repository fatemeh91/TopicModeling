review/text: These blades are not genuine Gillette blades. Comparing these blades to actual Gillette brand ones I bought at the store, these blades have a fake "indicator strip." Blades wear out long before genuine Gillette ones do. The plastic molding of the blade is different than the real thing. The packaging is much cheaper than actual Gillette packaging. I would not recommend these unless you're looking for a fake gillette version blade.
