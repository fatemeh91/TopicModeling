review/text: Is it normal for the flints to break off a small piece after only 4 or 5 weeks of use? This is my first Zippo and in under three months I have gone through replacing three flints. I am the only user and light it about 20 times a day. If this is not normal flint usuage I will be sending it back for replair. Also the wheel will be working just fine and then it will bind up.
