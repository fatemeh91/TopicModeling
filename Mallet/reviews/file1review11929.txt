review/text: The day I found out I was pregnant I rushed to the nearest natural grocery store to get prenatals. I was very happy using the Rainbow Light One a Days- no sickness, easy to digest with or without food (I often took them on an empty stomach). I stopped using them at the recommendation of my midwife, who put me on a healthier vitamin plan (many different vitamins with each meal throughout the day). An yes it is a fairly large pill but not uncomfortable for an adult to swallow.
