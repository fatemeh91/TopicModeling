review/text: Sometimes the simple items are the best! This is a handy sweeper to have around. No cords, no charging, no batteries, just grab it and it is ready to use! Great for most floor types! Doesn't get the deep down dirt in the carpets, but for everything else, it is great! I would recommend it to anyone!!
