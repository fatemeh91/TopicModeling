review/text: OK. Do you know what an erection ring is? It's a device that wraps tightly around the base of a man's penis, slowing the flow of blood out, allowing for a harder, longer-lasting erection. We have tried, and liked, the stretchy, rubber kind, but we decided to go ahead and give this doodad a try.The stud ring works like one of those bola ties. You place the loop over the penis, and then pull the string tight, through the bead. When everything goes right, it fits nice and tight, working like a charm on the blood flow, with excellent results. It's also nice for the man, in that there is less there to interfere with...contact.The bad news is that the sliding bead can also trap pubic hairs, resulting in exquisite pain that is certain to interfere with the moment. So, if you really want to use this product, then you will have to shave the scrotum area. If you don't want to shave down there, then stick with the stretchy rings, they are less hassle.So, my final analysis is good, but imperfect.(Review of California Exotics / Swedish Erotica Julian's Stud Ring)
