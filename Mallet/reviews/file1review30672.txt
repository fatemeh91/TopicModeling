review/text: After 15 years of shaving with Mach3 or its predecessors, I decided to give double-edged razors a try. The results are so much better! You have to be careful the first times, as there is a tendency to apply too much pressure when you're used to M3. Since I started using this Merkur, six months ago, I haven't had ingrown hairs, and when I get nicks, they're much smaller and cleaner than those produced by multi-blade cartridges.The proof of the pudding for me is how painless it is to shave long growth with a double edge razor. If you've tried to shave a 7 day growth with a Mach3, you know what I'm talking about!A related recommendation is that you use real shaving soap or cream, not canned foam.
