review/text: This Green Vibrance is our supper every other Thursday night! It's our health spa night with this light delicious supper.I use pineapple juice, orange juice, frozen banana, yogurt, ground flax seed and a couple of scoops of the Vibrance powder to make a delicious and nutritious drink for my husband and me. I put all in the blender and add crushed ice to get the thickness we like. This and saltines with hummus or peanut butter is our meal ... very satisfying and filling. We have used this product for 15+ years. It is an easy meal, can be varied with different fruit (peaches this summer time of year).Amazon has a great price on the Green Vibrance Family Size Power - 60 Day Supply and as always, on time delivery.
