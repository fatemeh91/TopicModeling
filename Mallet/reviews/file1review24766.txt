review/text: I LOVE this shave stick! The soap is tallow based, a hard to find luxury these days. The scent is earthy, spicy with a hint of floral notes. It is hard to describe the scent. When applied directly to the face and lathered with a badger hair brush this soap makes a dense, slick lather that really lets the razor glide. Other than Tabac, there is no shaving soap out there like this at all.
