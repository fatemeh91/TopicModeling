review/text: First foil shaver that gets closer than any of my other electric shavers. Easy to clean blades with removable guard. It does take longer to shave, but the results are worth it. Seems up be working as expected and feels more powerful than my norelcos. I have been using it routinely for 1 month. Will update my review if the product is less than satisfactory. Otherwise, don't waste your $ on a 50-100 shaver that performs equally.
