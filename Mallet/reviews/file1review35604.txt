review/text: This product fits in an elongated toilet. However, it can freely move a few inches back and forth, leading to instability when sitting down or standing, especially for people with impaired mobility. That's because the size of the part that sits inside the toilet bowl is a few inches shorter in the front-to-back dimension than the opening in an elongated toilet bowl.I came up with a solution, using a bungee cord strapped to the two back legs and stretched around the back of the toilet, which prevents the seat from moving resulting in a much safer configuration. However, it would have been far superior if this product were available in a second version for elongated toilets with an insert designed for them.
