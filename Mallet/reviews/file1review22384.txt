review/text: I really disliked this product. First, once it was washed it shrunk and would not fit properly on the pad. I bought a standard contoured pad from Babies 'R Us and so it should have been compatible. Second, it's too much of a pain to keep taking it off, washing it and putting it back on. I have three of these and now don't use any. If your baby remotely spits up or goes to the bathroom while on the changing table (before you get a new diaper on) I've found it's easier to buy some nice inexpensive matching towels and lay them over the pad. They're cheaper and you don't have to worry about fit.
