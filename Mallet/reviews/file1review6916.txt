review/text: I would think that a product such as this which &#34;retails&#34; around $38 and is &#34;on sale&#34; for around $19, it would be reasonable to believe that a spray that is $4.87/count is a &#34;count&#34; referring to a bottle of the product. So it was very upsetting to get the package to find out it is $4,87 per OUNCE. Unless this advertisement is changed to clearly indicate it is a price per ounce, I can only assume it is an intentional misleading. Although the product itself is very good, I don't think it is worth $4.87 per ounce, but that's just my opinion. Maybe for others, they see that it is worth that much.
