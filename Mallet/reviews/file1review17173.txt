review/text: I have not owned this trimmer for long and it is my first, so I can't compare it to others. Having said that, it does the job well of trimming my beard. It has a number of length settings and can also be used to define the border of the beard by removing the trimmer head. All in all, it's well worth the low price (assuming it does not break).
