review/text: We purchased a Heartstart unit for our home and were very happy with the instructions and ease of use, especially the voice prompts. I've seen people with no experience with an AED be able to use one just by listening to the voice commands.We considered this purchase similar to buying insurance for something valuable - in this case, our family.
