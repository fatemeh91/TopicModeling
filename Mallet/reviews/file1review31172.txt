review/text: This is by far the best ginger root extract I've found. Taking the extract instead of the raw herb enables you to get a very strong dose in two pills.I have found taking two of this brand of ginger root to get rid of chronic back pain when nothing else did. Ginger is a strong anti-inflammatory herb, in addition to improving your digestion and helping with colds and flu.This company is owned by an herbalist and he makes the best quality herbs.Another favorite of mine is his cordyceps. He includes cordyceps with other energy tonics to make the strongest energy tonic you can buy over the counter:Cordyceps Power CS-4 60T 60 Tablets
