review/text: If you're going to buy this, be forewarned. The pediatricians will make you take a rectal temperature if you use this. They aren't convinced of its accuracy. Every time I have used it, however, it's been accurate to within a degree. I use it to screen to see if I need to take a rectal temperature, for example if it's over a hundred I usually take it rectally. I wish doctors would trust it, though
