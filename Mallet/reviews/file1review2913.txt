review/text: I always had problems with multivitamins affecting my stomach and making me sick. I started this formula about 6 years ago and still love them. They give me energy and make me feel awesome and I when I don't take them i really notice a difference. Everything in them is organic and they actually go through a cold fusion process as opposed to other methods of traditional vitamin making. ALl of the ingredients are frozen while the vitamin is made to ensure we receive as much of the nutritional value as possible. Other brands will typically heat the ingredients during the process and some nutrients are lost. I'm a fan and believe me I am super picky so enjoy!!
