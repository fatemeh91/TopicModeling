review/text: I love peanut butter so I might be bias, but these are the best Balance Bars available. They are soft, chewable and have great flavor. The bars I received 9/15/2008 expire 06/2009. So there is no issue here with expired bars. Great product! Use Subscribe & Save and do exactly that. I love Amazon.com.
