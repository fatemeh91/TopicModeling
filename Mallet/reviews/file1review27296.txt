review/text: I've been buying ON's products for well over a year now and have been very happy with them. In fact, when I shop for protein powder, creatine, etc, I first look for something from ON's line. But something must have changed recently, because while this is the same protein powder I've bought before, this recent shipment is really disappointing. It tastes bitter, and doesn't mix well at all. What happened? Something definitely is off. I wish I hadn't bought a 10 pound bag of the stuff, it's not going to be pleasant choking this stuff down for the next few months.
