review/text: Work with elderly. Easy to use & enables independently placing socks on feet without bending down. Demonstrated/pictured instructions included for ease of use if unfamilar with device. Great for people with recent surgeries; hip/knee replacements; heart or abdominal surgeries; overweight; back injuries.
