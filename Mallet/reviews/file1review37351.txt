review/text: I am very pleased with the product. I have an older Epilady model epilator that I use occasionally - I'll never use it again. The Braun is painless in comparison.Initially, upon my first use, I thought it wasn't working. I did not really feel anything (again, I was accustomed to the much more painful Epilady). I looked closely and could tell that it was removing hairs. Soon, I found I could remove the massaging attachment. Without the attachment, I felt more of a pricking sensation, but it was manageable. I felt more sensations in the ankle, toe, knee, and forearm region. In an hour and a half, I epilated both legs and both arms.I also should add that I waxed my lower legs a few weeks prior to my first use. I think that helped the speed up the process.My only disappointment is that I still feel a slight stubble on my lower legs (no where else).
