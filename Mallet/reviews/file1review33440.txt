review/text: What a great idea. I wish I had thought of it. You can take your vitamins while you exercise. Denise Austin is an excellent exercise instructor, and I own several of her tapes. The 2 most important vitamins needed by our bodies to maintain optimum health are also attached to the video. So it's a one-two punch for good health.
