review/text: Not thrilled - suppose I expected more of a chinet - thicker sort of plate. That's not what I received. This is much more for every day use and less sturdy. If it is an everyday throw away plate your looking for (maybe more of a solo brand type) then I recommend this product. If however, you are looking for a better quality disposable, I would look for a different product.
