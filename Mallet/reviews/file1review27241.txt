review/text: I read reviews on how people didn't like the taste, to them I say get a life...what do you want? Build muscles or get fat eating candy? It does taste good, it could be better, but I didn't buy it for taste alone. Some people don't like brocolli either, but it is very good for you too. Bottom Line: it works, and it isn't all that bad tasting either.
