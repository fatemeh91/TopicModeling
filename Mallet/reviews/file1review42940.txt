review/text: I always thought these products looked the part of clean and natural, until they showed up in my house.They are very fragrance heavy, and being a person slightly sensitive to fragrance I started to notice it would make me a bit flushed and headachy. The countertop cleaner really bothered me most of all, because it would be on my food eating and prepping surfaces.The more I was around it the more it bothered me. I would even say it was overwhelming on my table while I ate and the fragrance got into the food when I used it on my butcher block.My wife also got the hand soap and having just used it I found that it too caused me some flushed feeling. So I decided I should share my experience. I have never written a product review before, but I've decided I find the claim of natural and "green" to be a bit misleading. These products truly bother me where most other average products do not, be they green or conventional.
