review/text: I'll preface this by saying I take a lot of pregnancy tests, it took 5 years to concieve our first child and this time around I start testing early due to needing progesterone during the first trimester.I've had great experience with dollar store tests, always neg when not pregnant (and no strange lines) and positive when I was, and thought these would be about the same, wrong. For some reason I keep getting glaring white indent lines which I know are negatives but I find it annoying. They come up within the first minute so they are not evaporation lines. This has happened on 3 of the 5 test I have taken. I have not gotten pregnant yet so can't say how dark the positive test lines end up.Another thing that bothered me was the box they sent me expires in 6 months, yes I know that's half a year away but I would hope when buying a bulk of 25 tests they would at least have a years more shelf life. I've ordered the cheapie test strips from amazon and those have had a year or more left, I think from now on I'll just stick to the cheapie test strips and dollar store tests. And of course if I ever see a second line I'll confirm with a name brand test and a blood test at my doctors office.Hope you see your two lines soon!
