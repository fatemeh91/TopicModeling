review/text: The first time I tried to use this unit I put the sock too far up on the device, this caused too much friction, as I tried to pull the sock on my foot, the stitching at the back of the unit tore out. Eventually it tore all of the stitches out leaving the unit unworkable. I have to sew it up. If you buy this do NOT put your sock more than about two inches onto the unit, gather the sock to get as much in that two inches as possible. It is surprising how this will pull the sock all the way up your leg.
