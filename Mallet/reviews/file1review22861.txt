review/text: I love this carpet sweeper, good on bare floors too. I have a dog who sheds like crazy and it picks it up on all surfaces. The only down side is the handle doesn't screw on, it just pushes on and will come off sometimes while you're cleaning. It pushes right back on and you could probably glue it to keep it secure.
