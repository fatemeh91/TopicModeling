review/text: I tried this supplement after hearing Dr.Oz suggest taking this people who want to relieve stress. After taking it a few days, I noticed that it did take away my stress, however I became very irritable...which I did not like. I would rather have the stress than yelling at everyone for no reason! lol!! Anyway, I stopped taking it and went back to Valerian, which works for me in the stress area.
