review/text: What can I say. It's not that my daughter is a 2 year old genius. There is no way to measure that. Although, she seems more active than all other kids. There's still a long way before I can tell if the product actually worked, but I have nothing to lose.Now, about the product itself. It seems very clean. I've seen and smelled others and they have a very strong odor. This is a very good product. A must buy if you believe the studies on DHA and children development
