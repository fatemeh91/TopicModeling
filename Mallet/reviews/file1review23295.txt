review/text: I bought this at Lowes Home Improvement for 9.97 - it's their regular price. The handle pieces do come out but don't despair! I had some carpet tape (double-sided) lying around and wrapped only a small piece around each end before I put it back together. It works like a charm. For how long, I don't know, but for the price I paid and how well it works otherwise, it will be worth investing in another role of tape in about a hundred years or so.I can't drag the vacuum out all the time, don't want to and besides the dogs go nuts. This works as well as the carpet sweeper I remember pushing around as a little girl so I gave it an extra star for nostalgia. Gets all crumbs (don't expect it to get ground in dog hair) and gets all lint & small things you'd normally drag out the Hoover for. And No electricty needed!! If you miss the sound however, you can always hum!
