review/text: It works great, easy to use and definitely vibrates. The plastic is easy to click in and easy to disassemble. Thumbs up for all that...But, word of caution:When disassembled, the main vibrating piece is not just something the company thought up. At the expense of my own embarrassment, the vibrating piece that comes apart is a female vibrator; complete with speed settings. While that can be easily ignored it is something to consider when you have children, teenagers, or etc, who come across it and begin to ask questions. After you acknowledge this, it is hard to ignore the fact that you now own a head massage that is made with a female pleasure device.So: works great...But: awkward.
