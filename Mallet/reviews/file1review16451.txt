review/text: The bottle says "First Aid for Your Skin" and that's what it is. The product has active ingredients that actually work. It does have a medicinal smell right out of the bottle, however, I don't smell it after it's on the skin for a while. It's a little bit expensive but worth it to me to have a bottle around the house.
