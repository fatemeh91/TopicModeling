review/text: I have taken animal cuts for a while now and I love them! It's a great product that helps boost your weight loss along with working out. It works really well with animal pak too! The thing that stands out about this product is that it not only boosts your metabolism as well as other things, but it also reduces your water weight which makes a noticable difference within the first week or so. I recommend it!
