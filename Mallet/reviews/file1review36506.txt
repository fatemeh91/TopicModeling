review/text: I purchased this product as I am looking for a more natural deodorant. This product didn't work for me. It might be okay as a body spray..but not as a deodorant. I had my hubby asking me why I smell like rubbing alcohol (not good). It also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving.
