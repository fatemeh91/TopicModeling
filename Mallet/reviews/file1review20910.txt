review/text: The Braun 8585 is simply the best electric shaver I have ever used. With the newly designed foil, the time and effort to shave has been reduced by 50%. The closeness of my shaves have never been better, but this is still not the foremost reason I recommend the Braun 8585. The razor burn on my neck is nonexistent. This is a first, and I have been using the most exspensive electric shavers for over 10 years. Braun has finally designed an electric shaver with all the features that truly matter and work effectively.
