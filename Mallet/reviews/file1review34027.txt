review/text: The Magik brushes are great for taking lint off clothes, cleaning the felt near the rim of the dryer filter, and, especially, for removing pet fur from anything. I've given them to family and the people for whom I cat-sit. It makes removing cat hair from cushions, etc. fast. You swipe your hand the opposite direction and the hair comes off. It is reusable and lasts for years.
