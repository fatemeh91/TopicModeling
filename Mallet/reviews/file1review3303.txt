review/text: I bought these somewhat on a whim. I have some cheap drugstore tweezers at home that aren't anything special, and I'd heard good things about this brand. I needed another item to get to my free shipping, so I decided to give these a try. I was so surprised at how much better they are than the cheap ones. I honestly didn't think it mattered what you used- tweezers are tweezers, right? Wrong! These really do grab hairs so much better, and are definitely much more precise. I'm so glad I bought these!
