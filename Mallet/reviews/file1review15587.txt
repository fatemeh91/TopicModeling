review/text: I had been using Lavilin (black container) on my underarms for 30 years and had been recommending it to everyone I knew. When I recently bought some of the new "white container" Lavilin, and applied it, I soon found out that this was not the product I was familiar with. After only one day, the odor came back. After reapplying a few times I got the same negative results. Normally, this time of year (spring in MN), I get at least 1-1/2 weeks out of it (3 weeks in the winter). I was told by a local retailer that the original formula was no longer available (they had removed the talc in 2001). I am guessing that they changed more than the talc since this is a non-functional product for me. I hope that I can get my money back since I had bought four containers to stock up.
