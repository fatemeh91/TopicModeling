review/text: I wanted a scale that would finally be an accurate measure of weight and after reviewing many balance scales on Amazon, decided on this one. I've had it now for about 6 or 7 months and it performs beautifully. I've checked it against the scales at the gym and doctors' office and it weighs perfectly. We don't really have a lot of space for it so it's sitting behind a door in the bathroom. We unfortunately kept forgetting it was there when we first bought it and kept hitting it with the door as we went in and out. Thankfully, the scale is sturdy enough to take the hits without hurting the mechanisms at all, and still works perfectly. I'm VERY happy with it.So why didn't it get 5 stars? Well, the numbers on the beam are so small I can't see them when I'm weighing myself. They could make this better. I have to get off and stand back to see the weight. From looking at the scale it doesn't seem that making them this small was necessary to fit all the numbers on.I definitely can recommend this scale to others. The price was good and the scale is great.
