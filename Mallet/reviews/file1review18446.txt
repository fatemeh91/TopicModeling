review/text: This breathalyzer is TERRIBLE!!! Don't be fooled by other reviews on here. I bought it after reading a story from I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell for the same reason the author brings it to the bar in the story. That said, I wanted it to be accurate, and also not requiring mouthpieces because its a pain to replace those. The first night I had the breathalyzer, I decided to test it out. I followed the directions and calibrated it before I used it. Then I started to drink beer. The breathalyzer kept saying my BAC was 0.00, even when I had enough beer that I wasn't fit to operate the remmote control for my TV. I tried to test it again the next night. The results were better but once again, it kept saying my BAC was 0.08 and I knew damn well that wasn't the case. I was so angry that I stepped onto my balcony and chucked onto the street knowing a car will eventually smash it.Don't be fooled by the cheap price, this breathalyzer wasn't worth the time I spent buying it on Amazon. If I could, I'd give this product no stars
