review/text: Lemme start off by saying that the descriptions youmight read fall short of describing the FOUL smell andawful taste.Try and remember the WORST taste you`ve had in your mouththen add to that a smell/taste sort of like rotten meatand then the bitterness of bile. If you can envision thattaste, that is what you`ll experience when this goes pastyour tongue. trust me when I say, there is NO WAY around this.Like one reviewer said, and what works best for me is take a real smallamount of water, dilute it there...swallow it like a shot and have somejuice handy to wash the flavor down. The after taste wont go away by itself either!I have literally cried while drinking this. I`ll definitely finish thisbut next time I`m buying pills, no matter how much more expensive they turnout to be.As for the effects...I can say that as soon as I drink this my ears getreally red and tingly and I sweat profusely during the workout. I guess that means its working.I take 10mg per day, 1 hour pre-work out and immediately after.I get diarrhea as soon as I take it. Cannot attest to the"viagra" like effects since I haven't felt any change in that department.If you have a strong stomach..take it. I know I wont anymore. I give it 4 stars becauseit does work.
