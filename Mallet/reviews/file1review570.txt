review/text: This nail clipper does a great job of cutting my fingernails. It's easy to hold in my hand and so far this has lasted me well over a year! I also use this for filing my nails and cleaning underneath them. My nails stay nice and short--and rounded off at the outer edges which is the way I like them!As the website indicates, you should have your nails wet so that cutting them will be easier. Cutting dry nails just doesn't work as easily.I highly recommend this nail clipper.
