review/text: I've using this product for 5+ years and still think it's the best. It's mild to the eyes and the moisture lasts longer than its major competitor (Opti-Free, which I used before). Amazon has one of the best prices on this product (if not the best). I really need to mention that Amazon ships INCREDIBLY fast with SuperSaver shipping. I live in New York, ordered it on a Monday late in the afternoon and got it on Wednesday. This is the only place I will buy this product from now on.
