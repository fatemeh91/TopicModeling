review/text: Does pull hairs out but you have to run it back and forth many times to get them all. Hurts a bit but you should expect that. The razor attachment does not work well but I did not buy it for that. Wish it would have had a case to keep it all together, my sister got one also and she is pleased. Better then the one we tried 10 years ago.Update 06/24/09 Still using this product, works great I would raise it to a 4 star now for length of use and still going strong.
