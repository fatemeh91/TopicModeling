review/text: I used this product years ago during college (~7 years ago). I saw major weight loss (more than 120lbs loss) and increased muscle mass. It's important to follow their directions and to work out hard when using a product like this, but my experience was following their instructions and incorporating this responsibly gave me the results I sought. (If you try to use this alone, without a weight-lifting and exercise routine you can easily GAIN weight due to the nature of protein.) This product is pricy but I've found it does work... I used it for 2 years at which point I had to stop using it due to the price (my newly "caught" wife required a home, figure that :-) )Note that this is a MEAL REPLACEMENT, unlike other protein powder options which are supplements. There is a difference, and if you are unsure of the difference research before you start using one of these products.Finally, I'm not a medical doctor nor a health or dietary expert. This is just my observations from my use of the product.
