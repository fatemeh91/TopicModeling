review/text: This brush has a wide rubber grip handle and firm bristles. What makes it a bit unique is its size - at 11.1" it is nearly a foot long. You can use it to clean a large area where a smaller brush would make the job tedious, and in some instances to avoid bending as much due to its reach.The bristles are synthetic and fairly heavy gauge. They can be used to clean corrosive acids and alkalis although this was made for use in bathrooms and kitchens. I tested it on the shower floor and it's perfect for that type of work.The instructions say this brush can be cleaned in the dishwasher. With most brushes, the high heat of a dishwasher would cause bristles to fall out.
