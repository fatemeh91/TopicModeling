review/text: nothing bad to say about the product.1. arrived super quickly from seller (~2-3 days, if that)2. dissolves instantly as advertised even in ice cold coffee (btw ice coffee + chocolate protein powder = yummy breakfast)3. reasonably priced compared with other powders offering the same grams of protein per scoop4. i do prefer the taste of Optimum Nutrition's chocolate coconut powder; however, Elite cafe mocha offers approx. 2 additional scoops per 5lb container, minimally less sodium, calories and carbohydrates, yet more calcium. in addition, ON's chocolate coconut is currently not available on amazon.i'm a fan and will most likely purchase again!
