review/text: This tape does stick though it may require some pressure to be applied in the form of clothing or a wrap.Im using it as a dressing post BRS and its great for holding the incision areas closed to reducing scarring. Ive been instructed to change the tape once a week for the next five months. The quantity provided by the supplier seems more than enough.Its breathable and pretty solidly stuck for up to the week duration when it starts peeling on its own with washing every day. I suspect baby oil and creams may speed this as well.
