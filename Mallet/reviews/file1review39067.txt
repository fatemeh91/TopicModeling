review/text: I bought another shaver titled the all around body shaver and was VERY disappointed. This one succeeds where all the others failed and costs pretty much the same. Use this to trim any and all hair...head, beard, back, neck, etc.It gets warm and I did cut myself shaving the ridge on my shoulder but that was more user error than anything. Just know it is possible for the blade to touch your skin which could also be seen as a good thing.
