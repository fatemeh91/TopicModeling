review/text: As men get older they get weirder looking, and one of the things that makes them look weirder and ickier is targus, that annnoying hair that crops up in their nostrils and ears. This little gem weed-whacks those hairs pretty well. And you can HEAR it chopping away which is kind of satisfying. There is a certain amount of pulling, it's not all that sharp, but the unit does in fact clean out the hair in your nostrils and takes, oh, three or four months off your age at least. I don't really think this thing is going to last more than two months tops, but it works for now. It really does get the nose hairs out. And quickly.Addendum: I lost this little item in a housefire (since I wrote the above review). When I replaced it I did so with a Wahl thinking that the makers of my (excellent) hairclippers would certainly know how to make a high-quality targus-whacker. Well, the Wahl was much inferior; it made a nice enough whirring sound, but it simply didn't do the job. It seemed as if all it did was whirr prettily without doing the concommitant and necessary clipping. And then it just stopped working entirely. The battery ceased to make proper contact with the motor. So I tossed it and bought a new Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Ear Hair Groomer. It was like welcoming an old friend into the house.
