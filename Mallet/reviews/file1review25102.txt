review/text: I'm surprised by the positive reviews here. But I guess taste buds will differ. I had read that whey was preferable to soy in protein powder, so I gave this a try in my morning smoothie. I found the taste medicinal (it has artificial flavoring) and too sweet (it has sucralose). The aftertaste was unpleasant. It's back to soy protein powder for me.
