review/text: High in carbs ,organic and nutritious....Most of the flavors are also high in sodium, so if you border on hbp ,stay away.But the apple cranberry is within reason(sodium) and the taste is sweet and mildly reminicent of its namesake; and the bar is very moist and very homely.The sugar is very high but it lets you dowm in a level manner..Again,these Bars(Clif) are very high in carbs so a walk or run or workout is essential..Although rated high(apple cranberry), they are an acquired taste, as is the black cherry almond, a better, slightly less sweet ,almondy flavored bar.Nothing is more subjective than taste in food, but of those I have tried, the blueberry crisp is highest in the billing and the 5 stars above the title.(They are not yet offered in subscribe & save, but should be(hear this, Amazon?).As it is , they are sold out whenever they appear.)
