review/text: I agree with the review Rebecca wrote. I purchased this product after reading in a magazine that celebrities used it to calm down. This spray is truly amazing! It really works immediately after I spray it in my mouth or in the air and breathe the aroma. I spray it in front of our dog and cats too and they love the smell and immediately calm down. My husband sprays it directly in his mouth too and likes the flavor and the immediate affect. We have the liquid too and they both taste the same. The spray is nice to have to spritz in the air and the liquid is great to add to hot candle wax to immediately calm your nerves.
