review/text: I've had a single wart on the back of my hand for years & I had no problem w/ it until I moved; apparently, some warts can get worse (i.e. spread or become larger) when moving to a different environment. I went from one wart to about 16 warts in a various of sizes. I was skeptical about this product but I saw the reviews & proceeded down to my local Walgreens to purchase. After 2 days of using WartStick my warts had a dramatic improvement! Now, a week later my warts are not protruding; only evidence I have that I had warts are tiny blemishes & I'm sure those will go away. I'm ecstatic about this product and will continue using it for years to come (because I know they'll probably come back.) Oh, by the way, it was not messy, painful and didn't turn white like those liquids such as Compound W & also quicker. Highly recommended!UPDATE: 04/2011: Its been three years since I have used the Wart STICK and its still sitting up in my cabinet. Why you ask? Because I haven't had to use it. They have not come back! The blemishes are gone as well. You can't even tell I had warts on my hand!
