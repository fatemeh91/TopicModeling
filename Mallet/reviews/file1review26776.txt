review/text: Title says it all:&#34;Great taste, reasonable price, quality ingredients&#34;I've used many other whey powders, and I think this one may be tops on my list as far as all around whey goes. Hydrolyzed whey isolate is quicker digesting (perfect post-workout) but the price is through the roof, so I use it sparingly. Besides post-workout and bed-time, I use this whey throughout the day when I need a good quick quality shot of protein and aminos.
