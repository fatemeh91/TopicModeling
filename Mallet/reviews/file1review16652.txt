review/text: I suppose this is my fault for not reading reviews before purchasing the item, but nevertheless, there was no fuel in the lighter when I received it. I should have read and found this out prior to purchasing it, and also bought lighter fluid. The product is as advertised, an OEM Zippo lighter, and has the look and feel of a high class lighter. I would recommend this to anyone who is a little careless, and wants to keep this lighter in a pocket with keys and such, due to the brushed exterior of the product. The seller delivered on time, and I would buy from them again.
