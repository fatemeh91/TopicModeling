review/text: First, the bad. The Precision Trimmer is way overhyped. In theory, it's a great idea: it's difficult to get sharp symmetrical lines using an ordinary razor, and one would think a single blade would do the trick a lot better. In practice, though, this doesn't work. In the first place, either the blade isn't sharp enough or it's burried too deep inside the cartridge to be truly precise. And secondly, whatever hairs it trims just get stuck in the blade - and it's a real pain to get them out.The good. Fusion isn't worse than Mach3. This was actually a great relief following the disappointment of M3Power which was a disaster. I can't say yet if Fusion gives a superior shave to Mach3 Turbo, but it stands to reason that five blades would perform better than three.
