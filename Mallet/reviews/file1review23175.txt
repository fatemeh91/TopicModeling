review/text: I have a long haired indoor/outdoor cat that not only leaves hair, but little flowers from a huge back yard tree, and miscellaneous other debris on my wooden floor (not mentioning the occasional bird). This little sweeper picks up all the stuff quite nicely and is easy to empty. Very good to use daily, between regular vacuuming. I had been using a sort of dust mop that only pushes the stuff around. This is much better. Also picks up on a kitchen entrance rug nicely. I didn't want a cordless sweeper, as they have to stay plugged in some place, and no point in using that electricity. This is a great alternative. My cat finds it interesting. Some reviews said the handle falls apart. Mine has stayed together.
