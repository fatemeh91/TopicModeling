review/text: I was looking for a way to provide protection for my bedding. These pads do a great job and are easy to wash and maintain. I decided on this size so that I wouldn't have to worry about tossing and turning at night. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a way to provide extra protection for the rest of your bedding.
