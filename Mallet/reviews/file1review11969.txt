review/text: Overall, these are a high quality prenatal vitamin that cause only one side effect for me - sweating! I'm fairly certain the vitamin is causing this as I've cut it out and the sweating stopped. I'm currently not pregnant, but take prenatals pretty consistently because I like the impact on my hair and nails. I didn't read anyone else having this side effect, so perhaps it's just me...
