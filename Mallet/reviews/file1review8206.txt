review/text: This bottle brush works extremely well when washing any kind of narrow container. I bought this to clean out my Thermos brand water bottles. The brush is about 12 inches long from top to bottom. The bristle portion of the brush is about 2 1/2 inches from one end to where the black handle starts. The bristles are very soft and the handle is long enough so you can use it on a variety of containers. Since it's made by Oxo, the handle is very comfortable. Bottles do need a good cleaning even when they're used for water only and this brush does a decent job.
