review/text: Just want to let you know that I have been a Nad's user since it came out in the mid 1990's. I used it on myself as well as my fiance, mom, nieces and friends. Only recently did my friend (who I used Nad's on) tell me about your peach melon sugar wax. I was very skeptical since I have sensitive skin and the word "Nair" means "irritating and smelly chemicals". She assured me over and over how wonderful your melon wax was. (She found it when she couldn't afford to buy the Nad's since Nad's is usually $20.00 a jar!) I bought it the other day and used it on my fiance, mom and myself AND LOVED IT! I couldn't get over how wonderful it was! I love the smell, the effective hair removal, and the fact that it is sugar-based and water-soluable - just like Nad's only much less expensive, smells wonderful and is a absolute easy, pleasure to use! I threw out the rest of my Nad's. I never thought I'd say this, but for me, it's only Nair from now on. PLEASE DON'T DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT. I LOVE IT!
