review/text: I can't believe I'm writing a review for deodorant! But seriously, I had to say something about this particular one since it's the only one I buy and I can't seem to find it in the stores anywhere. After searching so many places, I settled for that unscented gel kind and it's so awful. It's not even unscented. It's very very scented. Your armpits feel all wet and cold the second you put the stuff on, and it just smells terrible.This deodorant here though, it really is unscented and it managed to deodorize just fine. With shipping costs, and the three included in the pack, I think it's actually a pretty good deal too. I remember the one in the store being somewhere between 4-5 dollars anyway.Attention Mitchum, please don't discontinue this product! I've been using the gel kind now for two weeks and I hate it so bad!
