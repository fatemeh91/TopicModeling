review/text: ON whey gold standard, Double Rich Chocolate was the first protein i tried. The taste is very enjoyable just like quik chocolate milk even though i drink it with water. I use a blender bottle and i never have a problem mixing it up.I have tried other brands of whey protein and i cant get my-self to enjoy them as i enjoy ON whey gold standard.About gains well I'm working on it so cant really comment on that.For me this is the best Whey protein out there, I would definitely recommend it.
