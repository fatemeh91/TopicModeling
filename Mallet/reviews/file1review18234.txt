review/text: After taking these pills for a week I definitely did notice a difference. I have been taking them for 3 weeks now along with my prescription medication, which I hope to ween off of eventually. I have tried many prescription drugs for my IBS, but the peppermint pills have shown the most improvement. The biggest change has been in the constant bloated feeling I used to have. Even when I do experience the bloated feeling it doesn't seem to last as long as it used to.The only negative that I found (if you could call it that) was that I burped a lot more than usual during the first week. It has since gone back to normal, and it was nothing excessive anyway.I plan on taking these pills for many years to come.
