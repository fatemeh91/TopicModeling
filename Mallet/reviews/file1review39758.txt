review/text: I'm on pregnancy bed rest, but able to recline at 45 degrees & use this for my laptop for short periods of time. Not sure how well it would manage a computer at any steeper angle, but I'm sure it would work well for books.The legs are quite tall, which would probably accomodate bigger people using it - but I had to get the legs cut down. No trouble, just need to be sure you've got someone who can do that for you.
