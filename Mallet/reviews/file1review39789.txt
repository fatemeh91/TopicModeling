review/text: The orange spray does meet my expectations and was worth the purchase price. I used it with it's sister product to restore the wood kitchen cabinet doors and frames over a year ago and they still look great. If you have some wood work in your home that is aged and dirty from exposure I recommend that you use this product along with the sister product to restore them.
