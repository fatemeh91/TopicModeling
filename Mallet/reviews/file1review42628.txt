review/text: I've tried several protein powders and this one is the best for the price. It mixes very easily and tastes great. Plus it has lower cholesterol per serving than most of the other protein powders. I didn't realize how much cholesterol was in some of the previous ones I was taking. Mix this with their Gourmet line and you won't be disappointed.
