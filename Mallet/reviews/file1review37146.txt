review/text: I generally wore these while driving long distances and not while I was doing other activities. I wore them regularly after purchasing them and found that they did not seem to help with the pain in my hands any better than regular driving gloves. Also, they made my hands sweat which caused the skin between my fingers to become irritated. Since the objective was to keep my hands warm to soothe the arthritic discomfort, I have gone back to wearing regular driving gloves.
