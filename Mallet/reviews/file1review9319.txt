review/text: I like this product however there are two things I would like to see made differently. 1) The top should be split between AM and PM so when you open the case the only pills exposed are those you are taking. Currently when you open AM, PM opens as well. 2) The cradle indentions could be a little deeper for a better fit. Over all I like the product, great size
