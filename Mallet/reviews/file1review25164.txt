review/text: When this arrived it didn't work. Amazon was great about sending another one. When it arrived it didn't work. You could see the wires inside going to the second egg and they looked like they were burned. Might have been from when it was manufactured. Amazon refused to send a third one. Maybe the lot was bad. Anyway, it looked like a great toy, but unfortunately wasn't able to find out. I'm ordering from another site, so we'll see. Also, it's huge, so don't order it if the idea of a large toy scares you!!!
