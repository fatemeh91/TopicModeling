review/text: I've had a Braun 8585 for years...got this to replace the cutter and foil. I found the shave quality decreased and the blades started pulling whiskers. Also I was nicked more often.I finally replaced the cutter and foil on my 8585 with this:Braun Series 3 Combi 30B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 4700,7000). It fits perfectly and gives me an excellent shave. No more pulling, no nicks, and a closer shave. Definitely the way to renew an 8000-series razor.Avoid this foil and cutterblock!
