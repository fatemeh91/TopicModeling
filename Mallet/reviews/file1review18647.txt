review/text: I want to say that I ordered this in Oct 2012 and just received it Feb 15, 2013. I had made requests, applied for a refund and even contacted Pay Pal...no help, no communication at all.This brand is fantastic and after using it for years and trying different ones, this is the best one. It helped me with my Endometriosis. I have not had a surgery since 1992 because of Cat's Claw.It knocked out my allergies to cats and dogs.It works as a natural anti-inflammatory and literally got my Frozen Shoulder working when therapy wasn't helping so much.This is fantastic.
