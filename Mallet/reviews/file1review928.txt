review/text: I bought a couple of these so I could use them at home, office and pack one for travel. Really refreshes feet after a long day or a strong workout. Not too pointy, just right to stimulate a tired foot or use during pedicure/home spa. Packs easily and is just the right thing at the end of an active vacation day with lots of walking/hiking - or after you kick off the high heels.
