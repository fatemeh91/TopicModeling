review/text: Well, I was scared to order this based on the reviews, but we have now been using it for 7+months and still think that it is great. This diaper pail is the same size as all the rest, which since this is our second child we know all pails when used with older kidos need to go out about every 2 days. Solid food changes bring on real stink to the situation, but this pail does the trick on keeping the smell gone. We used the electric part for a while, but I prefer to use the thing by hand, I can open and close it quicker, which is the only way smell escapes. All of our friends traded in their genies for this one, no additional cost for fancy bags and it can hold larger fuller diapers without getting stuck, something the genie has a lot of problems with (YUCK). This was my fourth try after having a genie (both regular and foot operated) and a draco-- we love this.
