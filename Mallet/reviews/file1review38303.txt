review/text: I really like this product, Isopropyl Wintergreen Rubbing Alcohol, 70%. The very best use is to rub on sore muscles, which we will all have this summer. I use it for about all my alcohol uses. I like to put it on the wire/post part of my pierced earrings and I put it on my feet every day-especially the nails to be sure I am free of any fungus on my nails. It does a terrific job on windows when you put it in a spray bottle. It will take those black smears off your linoleum or tile. I use it to clean my bathroom tile. It does not smear the way other cleaners do. I would just warn you that you get 12 bottles from this vendor and I did not notice that and now have a lifetime supply. The vendor did not offer any help.
