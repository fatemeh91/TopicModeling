review/text: Taste is pretty good mixed with water. I haven't tried mixing it with milk yet. The taste and texture is sort of like vanilla jello pudding but a little more powdery. I've heard some people complain about it clumping but it doesn't seem to clump much more, if at all, than my whey protein.
