review/text: Our master bath is poorly ventilated with no windows. We've fought unsuccessfully against mildew and mold for nearly 14 years. I've tried countless products that have not come even close to making a dent in the problem. It was embarrassing and gross even when "clean." Though disheartened I'd pick up something new every now and then and give it the old college try to no avail. White tub/grout was still disgusting with black mold and mildew.I found this product sitting on the bottom shelf of a super store with the daily shower spray cleaners and assumed it was a daily spray - and my husband and I used it as if it were for a couple of weeks. Today our tub, grout and sliding door look nearly new. It has been an amazing transformation! We are both thrilled and neither of us lifted a finger to scrub (since we didn't read the label and thought it a daily spray on). Having just read the label I realize it doesn't claim to be a daily cleaner but it should be.Yes, it's toxic - but so are mold and mildew. It's bleach - and that's what it smells like. I am highly sensitive to bleach fumes so I've tried to avoid them if I need to hang around and scrub. Despite this fact - you can still have success with this product without making yourself sick. Spray it on as a daily after your shower and walk away. Within two - three weeks you'll be shocked at the change. Now that we have a sprakling shower after all these years, we'll drop back to spraying maybe once a week and see if that holds. I'd imagine that using it daily would start to do some damage. For now I see none - just commercial ready beautiful tile. I'll update if anything changes. Cleaners generally don't excite me, but I love this product and highly recommend!
