review/text: Was going on 7 years with the previous battery and the alarm system was indicating Lo Battery. So I ordered this exact replacement even though with shipping it was a couple of dollars more than a wholesale outfit across town. But then again I did not have to waste gas and time getting it.The delivery was fast even with standard shipping, and even though the box was a bit beat up when delivered, the battery was well packed and not damaged.Yes, it does take half an hour before the alarm system removes the Lo Battery indication. And now I am looking forward to another 7 years of trouble free operation.
