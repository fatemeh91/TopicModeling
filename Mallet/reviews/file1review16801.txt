review/text: Be Aware!! The add shows them to be OLD!! Out of Date!! The add shows them to have expired back in 2011. Shelf life long gone.Thanks to the guy that mentioned the low cost alternative: "remove the casing from an alkaline 9 volt battery, which has 6 AAAA batteries inside"!! I just did that & Walla!!! 6-AAAA's!! Very easy.... Now the question..... are they as strong as a regular AAAA battery?? Will report back later.8/20/12: WOW!! So far it looks like the 6 batteries removed from a Lowes 9 volt battery are stronger than the Energizer!!
