review/text: My mother used to be up every few hours during the night because of weak bladder control. Now that she is nearing 90 and has Alzheimer's, she rarely gets up in the night. I was washing her sheets every day -even though she slept in Depends with an added maximum protection pad! I purchased several different pads last year as I was unsure which was best. THIS pad has been my favorite. The smaller (about 36" square) pads that I ordered do work... if her hips remain on the center of those pads all night. There has never been a problem with leaking around this pad. It is long enough for almost all of her body to be on it so it is less likely to get bunched up as she moves around -if she shifts her hips, her shoulders hold it in place and if she shifts her upper body, her legs hold it in place. I still have to wash the sheets every few days, though. Though the pad does prevent actual seepage of urine, and a freshly laundered pad is used each day, there seems to be some odor build-up in the bedclothes that is noticeable by the third day -but then NONE of the pads I have tried will prevent this problem. The pad has held up well, but I do not put it in the dryer. I wash in cold water and hang it on the line to dry (or over the back of a chair if it is rainy). Highly recommended... I am buying several more today!
