review/text: I have a 15 year old cat that has become incontinent while sleeping (we are just starting oral incontinence remedies). She really wants to be around us and we don't want to confine her to another room. I bought these to protect our comforters and it's working out. They do keep you a bit warm in the bed though you may have to start using thinner blankets. I'd suggest attaching some snaps without penetrating the barrier on the other side to attach them each other for best protection. The can slide a bit during the night.I have washed and dried these pads many times and they are holding up well.If want more comforter protection try the Bedwetting store they sell waterproof duvets which I will use in conjuction with these. Whether your incontinent pet sleeps with you, on your couch or you want to protect their bed this is an economic alternative to buying puppy pads. These give far more coverage for the area you are trying to protect.
