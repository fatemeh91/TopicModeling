review/text: I love these divided containers! I pack a waste-free lunch for my son every day, and these are wonderful. Each compartment is sealed so I can pack a sandwich in the big one and not worry about juice from his fruit getting on it! My husband loves how the containers and lids all stack together and how he isn't forced to find separate containers and lids when making lunch. A great buy!!!!!
