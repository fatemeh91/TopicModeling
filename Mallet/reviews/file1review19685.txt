review/text: This is a great trainer, my sons loves it and asks to use it. It adjusts easily to fit any toilet seat and stays fairly snug once installed. The bump on the front is very nice as well; it helps keep it in. I must say though, the best part about this seat is that it is NOT made in China but in Sweden. A definite plus for me.
