review/text: Honestly didn't think this product would work. I put a tiny dab on an age spot that appeared in the middle of my face every night for two weeks. The tube has only a mere dent in it since it completely removed the spot in that short amount of time with that tiny amount of product. I shall be keeping this tube to fight off new age spots as they appear. I am 31 and this was my first age spot. I do believe this cream will help eliminate all of the others to come. Oh, and you will never believe how reasonable the price is compared to other similar products.
