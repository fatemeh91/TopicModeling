review/text: I bought this for my constant neck pain. My neck pain stems from my trapezoids and the muscles under my shoulder. The back buddy allows me to put accupressure on those knots and helps relieve the tension. The various types of knobs are hugely helpful. My only gripe is it is to big to put in my suitcase. I would try to carry it on the plane but I am afraid they might think it can be used as a weapon. I am thinking of buying these for Christmas presents for everyone seems to love it who try it out.
