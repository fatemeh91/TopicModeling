review/text: I really didn't care for the large size and the taste of this multivitamin but when I switched for a while to the easy to swallow and tasteless Twinlab daily one cap, I noticed it didn't give me the same energy boost. So I am back to Advanced Nutritional System. I only take 2 a day vs the 6 that the label suggests. I am happy with the results. It may be because there are some probiotics included.
