review/text: I love this product. It tastes amazing, and I know there won't be any clumps. 15-20 seconds worth of mixing in a shaker cup and I know I'll be good to go. The best part about this protein is I don't have to worry if I'm out of milk, as it still tastes just as good when using water only.
