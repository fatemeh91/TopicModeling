review/text: Best trimmer ever. Does exactly what I bought it for. I was looking for a very close trim because I don't always like using a razor. It's always on setting 1, which cuts closest to the face and it does a very good job. Setting 1 cuts the hair close enough to the face that it looks like I used a razor on it. Tried it on setting 2 and no matter how much pressure I put on it when trimming the gear always stays locked in. Overall, it does the job it was built to do in a very quick and efficient way and no hair pulling at all.
