review/text: After getting fed up with rashy armpits, I wanted to look for something different. I was a bit skeptical of the claims, but thought it was worth a try. It took a couple of weeks of use before it became really effective, but I'm VERY pleased with the results. When I first started using it, I did notice the "skunky" smell that some others have described. After some experimentation, I discovered I was applying too much. Once I backed off on the amount, it really made a difference. During the winter, I can go a week or ten days before reapplication. I've found in the summer, it's more like 3-4 days. That just might be how my body chemistry works, though. Overall, QUITE pleased and no more skin irritation.One tip I have is using a rubber glove for application. That keeps the pasty stickiness from staying on your fingers after application. Hope this works as well for you!
