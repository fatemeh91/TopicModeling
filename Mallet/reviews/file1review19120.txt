review/text: My cycles are long (35-38 days). We had been trying to get pregnant for 6 months, but shooting way too early in my cycle missing the fertile window. I bought these strips last month, got a positive 2 days in a row 3 weeks into my cycle and we did our thing the second positive day. Happy to say I'm 5 weeks prego today!
