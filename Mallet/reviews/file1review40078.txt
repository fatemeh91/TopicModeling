review/text: This Crest toothpaste product is very helpful squeezing out the toothpaste, especially for the kids. It stands up on its bottom instead of lying down on the counter. This way, if the top gets misplaced, the tip won't be on the counter collecting germs. The mint gel taste is still pleasant and refreshing. The shape of the bottle is much firmer and it fits into your hand much better. The only problem is getting all of the toothpaste out, since you're not able to roll it up like the old product. I also hope that it comes in a larger bottle for my large family, and that the price is very reasonable. In all, I may purchase this product again.
