review/text: Red Yeast Rice has reported cholesterol-lowering effects similar to RX statin drugs, but &#34;without the adverse side-effects.&#34; However, having had muscle pains with Lipitor and all the other RXs, I noted the same increase in muscle pain when taking RYR. At present I am only taking 1 cap every other day and have only minimal pain.
