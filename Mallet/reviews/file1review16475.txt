review/text: Even though this item isn't alot of money initially, once you pay shipping, the product isn't worth the cost. The two pieces of the "adjustable" pole won't go together properly, so it's not only not adjustable - it won't stand up straight. The set screws that fasten the top and bottom onto the poles are microscopic. I guarantee no one has a phillips screwdriver that small, but even then, the screws are too large for the holes provided! I would have sent it back, but didn't want to invest even more. Skip this one!
