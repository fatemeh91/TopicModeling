review/text: I already had one of these Elasto-gel cervical collars, but I lent it to a friend, who kept it. The elasto-gel collar is really helpful with my occasional neck pain. However, I did not receive this product from Amazon. After I ordered it, and received notification that it had been shipped, I received another e-mail stating that I was getting a refund because I had returned it. I did not receive the product, nor did I return it. The payment was credited back to my account and I bought this product on another website.
