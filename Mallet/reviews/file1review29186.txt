review/text: I have waited a few months to write this review so that I would have real experience to base my review on, and I have been pleased with this product. I formerly used a Sonicare electronic toothbrush which was much more expensive, vibrates the entire head instead of just the teeth, and has a less appealing design in terms of its curvature and ability to reach into the back areas. I found this toothbrush gives a sufficient amount of power and my teeth feel clean. The first few times I used it it reminded me of a cleaning at the dentist's office.If you get this product from a store, keep in mind that it is possible to try out the toothbrush while it is sealed, so you might not have a full charge. I first thought that I had to use more force while brushing but it turned out to be the battery which after I changed worked perfectly. It uses one AA battery.Cleaning the inside of the toothbrush is easy, when you buy the replacement brushheads there is a device included that allows you to open your toothbrush so that you can clean the inside parts as well as replace the head.I recommend this toothbrush over a traditional or electronic toothbrush.
