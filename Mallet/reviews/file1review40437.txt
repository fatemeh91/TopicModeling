review/text: I've owned a product like this for ever...20-30 years...After all these years with all the new technology you would expect these people to put on a hi-intensity LED light to assist the viewing...instead you have the same horrible week flashlight bulb that is all but useless...in any well lite room...People it's 2010...put a light on this thing....It's not 1953...AGGH!!!
