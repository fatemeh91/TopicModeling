review/text: I have always liked the Oral B products and the sonic version of the toothbrush seems to me to work very well. My only complaints about the toothbrush heads are that they wear fairly quickly (and you really need to replace it when the toothbursh head is worn) and they are pricey - very pricey in stores. The Amazon deal I got makes the price much more palatable.
