review/text: I AM A DIABETIC AND DRINK ALOT OF WATER. the only one i feel is the best for me is the iceland pure water. I have tried all the other so called spring water out there andis nothing compared to iceland pure water. I have a hard time finding here in N.H. I would like to know where else i can get this water besides Walgreens. I GIVE THIS ICELAND PURE WATER AN A- PLUS.Carol Mccarthy
