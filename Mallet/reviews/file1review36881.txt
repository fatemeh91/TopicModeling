review/text: This replaced a flat one piece sock assist. I like the "fingers" - they fit my foot better. Good value.However, I would rather have the smooth side out - I could do this with the flat one I had before. It was easier to slide the sock off on my foot with the terry cloth next to my foot and the smooth side next to the sock.
