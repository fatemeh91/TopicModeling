review/text: My skin is extremely sensitive and has a tendency to break out. But with this gel, it hasn't. I loved the way my skin felt when I got out of the shower. The lather was great and you can use the gel sparingly, which will save money. My skin doesn't seem as dry as it does when I use bath soap or bodywash for shaving. I've used shaving cream before, and I prefer Skintimate gel to shaving cream. Even the fragrance is nice. I would definitely recommend this to some of my friends and family.
