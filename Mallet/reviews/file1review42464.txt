review/text: Biotin is a dietary supplement in the same family as Niacin, I'm told. It was recommended by my doctor for thinning hair, along with Vitamin D and Minoxidil foam. Unlike the previous version I have been taking, this is pure biotin, and it is not supplemented by other vitamins, minerals, etc. So it is more appropriate for anyone already taking a multi-vitamin. It is also easier to swallow and less expensive than what I used before. And it eliminates a somewhat unpleasant taste. When I began taking biotin, I noticed that my nails grew thicker and more quickly, and it seemed that the skin on my hands showed less dryness. My hair is still thin at the top, but there may be a little faster growth and thicker strands, in keeping with the other effects. Nobody has come up to me and told me I look 20 years younger, I regret to say.I don't detect a difference in effect between the two; it seems to work just as well as a more "complete" product, at least when it is taken with multivitamins. I see this as a good product that is part of a regime that seems to help at the margin to delay the inevitable. I would buy it again.
