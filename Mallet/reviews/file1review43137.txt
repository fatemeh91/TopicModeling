review/text: If you are interested in ayurvedic medicine, or simply enjoy traditional indian cuisine, Hing, or Asafoetida is absolutely necessary in many recipes. Yes, the odor is VERY intense and often disagreeable to the western nose, but prepared in a mixture of spices and gently heated in oil, it releases many wonderful flavor and healing compounds. It is inexpensive and long lasting. You would do well to use it regularly if your dosa permits it readily. Also, a small amount added to legumes prevents gas and helps with digestion. As with any application of any strong Ayurvedic medicinal/culinary herbs, it is helpful to have an understanding of your own personal temperament as well as the effect that each food/spice/herb has on your constitution.
