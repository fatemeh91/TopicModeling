review/text: This Walker-Rollator is a dream come true! I was STUCK in a wheelchair till I found my savior in the form of this Walker-Rollator. I can walk... but slowly and anyone who took me anywhere for appointments, to shop, to eat out, etc. would always insist on the wheelchair-- NOW I'M in the drivers' seat! It gives me many more options for mobility. The wheels are larger than a wheelchair so it moves better in grass. I can stand in one spot and move the Walker-Rollator but the wheelchair couldn't do that. If I get tired or out of breath all I have to do is turn around and sit down. If you are considering this Walker-Rollator for yourself or a family member who CAN and wants to walk more-- buy it now! The price was excellent and quality is even BETTER than I hoped.Do I sound happy? I'm ecstatic! Move over boredom and being trapped... HELLO WORLD!
