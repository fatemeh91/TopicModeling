review/text: A friend of mine introduced me to an older model of the Silk Epil. I was hesitant, given my painful memories of the Epilady (remember that painful gadget?), but loved it because it plucked out all the hairs out of my legs. So, I decided to invest in this model and love it! I highly recommend it, especially if you're too lazy to shave your legs every other day and especially if your boyfriend hates stubbly legs!
