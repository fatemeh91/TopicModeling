review/text: I am a former registered nurse who has taken hundreds of blood pressure readings on others over the years with a manual blood pressure meter. Now that my doctor wants me to keep closer track of my own blood pressure I needed to find an automatic meter that I can quickly use at different times of the day. He recommended that I purchase an Omron brand meter. Like any new gadget, this one took me a few tries to feel comfortable with it but after that I found it very easy to use with very little thought or effort. The readings seem to be consistent from day to day although I haven't yet been able to check them against manual readings taken at the same time. So far, I've been extremely pleased with my new blood pressure meter.
