review/text: You can hardly do better than a non-adjustible safety razor made by Merkur if you're just starting out. The only one that might be a better choice is the "hefty" variant of the Classic, but it costs a bit more, too.I've been shaving with this razor for a year now and I really love it. Remember: the blade you put in it is even more important than the razor! Your milage may vary, but the Merkur blades are not the best. Try Swedish Gillettes or Derbys, Israelis, or - my fav - the ninja-sharp Feathers from Japan.Also remember: no pressure when you shave with these! Let the weight of the razor do the work, and make multiple passes, lathering each time.Happy shaving!
