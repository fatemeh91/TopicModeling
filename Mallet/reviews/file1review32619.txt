review/text: This tea is very favorful! I drink it natural without sugars or other sweeteners, it taste great! After drinking the teas I feel very relaxed. I can't say that it has brought my blood pressure down, because I don't drink it everyday...however, I will start tomorrow drinking it everyday and give a follow-up review.
