review/text: Well, what can I say. It's a well-priced whey protein powder. It's not going to work any miracles, but it provides some nourishment.It's been my experience that whey protein isn't as good as protein blends, but hey that's just what works for me.Oh, and this sometimes gives me cramps and gas if I drink it on a completely empty stomach.
