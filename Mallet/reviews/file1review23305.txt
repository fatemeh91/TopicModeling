review/text: Very good sweeper. Gets dirt, crumbs, outdoor tree needles etc very fast with 1-2 sweeps, both from carpet and tiles.I use it mostly because of my toddler, sometimes he makes little mess and I don't have to use vacuum. Also great when he sleeps, i don;t have to wait to clean.I think the manufacturer improved the handle, I don't have to use the tape to keep it together. After several uses it gets loose, but than just have to be tighten again.Can not complain, highly recommended.
