review/text: This is by far the best whey I have found. The Double Chocolate flavor is good, but Rocky Road is superb. I like to mix a scoop of the Double Chocolate flavor whey with a scoop of Cookies and Cream flavored Casein.It mixes extremely well in a blender bottle. I usually mix it with skim milk, but water works too, although it doesn't taste quite as good. The price is great compared to products with similar nutritional value.
