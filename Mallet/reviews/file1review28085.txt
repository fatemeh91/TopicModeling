review/text: i needed my two 5 lb tubs of protein and 3 days after i ordered they cancelled my order. what kind of business entity renegs on a purchase agreement after i have already paid? absolutely TERRIBLE! unbelievable. who are these people? XcessSupply should change their moniker to XcessDissatisfaction!!! if you are considering to order from this supplier i highly advise you to go with a different one. not worth the hassle. good night. i mean, come on!
