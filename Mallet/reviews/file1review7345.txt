review/text: This product really heats the water. I have purchased three other foot baths before this one and none of them really kept the water warm. This product keeps the water warm , has jets and bubbles. It also has a drain on the bottom that makes it easy to empty it. I have a friend that comes to my house to give my mother pedicures and manicures and she is going to buy one to use with her other clients. I am so glad I found this on Amazon.Foot Baths - heated foot bath
