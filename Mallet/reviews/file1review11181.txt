review/text: I have been using Ricola Honey Lemon Echinacea drops for many years. I have found it to be the best throat drops when a cold, sinus, or fever related problems arise. And it tastes good!Unfortunately, I cannot find the Honey Lemon Echinacea kind locally any more, and see that Ricola's web site no longer lists them as one of their products. So I bought this pack of 12 via Amazon to stock up. I hope that Ricola makes it again.
