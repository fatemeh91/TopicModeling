review/text: Bought this as a replacement for a T765 I've had several years. Thought my old one was dieing so I ordered this one. Forgot to charge the old one so now I've got two. Very satisfied with the unit and the value for the price. Battery is fine as long as you charge it and my experience has been outstanding. Don't know anywhere else you can get these features at this price. VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER / USER !!!
