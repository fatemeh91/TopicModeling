review/text: I give this three stars solely because I was unaware that there is a lot of lactose protein in this gainer. Im lactose intolerant so I was losing more weight using it than I was gaining. Not there fault,it was mine for not looking. But just a warning to whoever buys this. If you`re lactose intolerant dont buy it. As far as taste and mixability, the taste isnt that bad but you have to use a blender to get this stuff to mix. You cant use a hand shaker
