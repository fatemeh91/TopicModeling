review/text: This is such a nice little sweet and may I stress little, as in degree. This is not like a sugary gumdrop, nor a gummi bear. These pastilles melt slowly in the mouth and this particular taste (cassis) is mild and soothing. Our 4 year old daughter loves them. It's great to know that we can order them on Amazon, since we discovered them at Ikea in China. We'll be ordering some soon!
