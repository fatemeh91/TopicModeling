review/text: I too needed to get off Advil as it keeps causing me kidney problems. I ordered this last month and began taking Three Capsules Twice a Day. The label says to take with food, but I do not find that necessary. I find that D-Flame is more effective in reducing muscle pain then Advil and I have had no side effects. I also have needed less Soma since taking this.
