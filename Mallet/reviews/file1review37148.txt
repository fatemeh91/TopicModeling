review/text: I am 51 and have had a pair of these gloves for over two years, Don't think I have Arthrits but I am basicly a two to three finger typer. so these fingers do ack from time to time. For the most part I will go to sleep with these gloves on and my fingers feel much better in the morning. The gloves have held up quite and have been washed many times, air dried. The fingers tips of the gloves are starting to loosen up a bit. I diffently recommend these gloves. I would and will buy them again.
