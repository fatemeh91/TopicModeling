review/text: The quality of this changing pad cover is very, very low. After only one washing, I had loose threads all over and the terry had already snagged. Now, after months of continued use and turning a blind eye to all it's imperfections, the terry material is pulling away from the elastic edging. The Especially for Baby brand changing pad cover is so much better: MUCH softer, better made, comes out of the wash perfectly, doesn't get snagged by bibs with velcro closures that are also in the wash. I had two Simmons covers and both are terrible. I'm buying another Especially for Baby one immediately.
