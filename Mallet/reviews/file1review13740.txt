review/text: Look into the history and reap the benefits. Speaking for myself ~ I know it works. I got a small cyst on the back of my leg when I was out hiking from scratching a bite. I used it orally as well as making a poultice with the turmeric from my cupboard. It's a miracle worker! Solaray has the exact dosage recommended for keeping issues at bay and to cleanse the body of irritants.
