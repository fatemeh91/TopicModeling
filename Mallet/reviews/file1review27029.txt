review/text: This stuff is sooooooooooooo good it's like drinking a candy bar! I use this every morning after the gym, and sometimes for a dinner replacement. This is the first and only protein powder that I've used that actually fills me up, keeps me going and TASTES FANTASTIC! I bought the 5 pound of it, and will probably by the 10 pounds next time....I go through it so quick.It dissolves effortlessly in water, and mixed with some ice is a tasty treat when i'm craving ice cream. I've been able to lose about 10 pounds so far in 3 weeks thanks to this protein! Really has curbed my eating!
