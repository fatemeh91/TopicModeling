review/text: After buying a table top bath tub that leaked all over the place I started looking for one that would go in the big bath tub. For a while I used a sling to keep her up right plus I used a foam seat to keep her from sliding all over the place. Once we got done with the sling I kept using the foam seat to keep her in place. Now that she is able to sit up on her own I don't even use the foam seat anymore. She loves it. I plan on buying it for 3 up coming baby showers.
