review/text: The AO Safety Reusable Corded Earplugs, Aearo #90586 works great in a noisy environment. Inexpensive, even in a large hardware store.A group talking in loud voices, back of a noisy bus, sleeping next to a roomful of snoring vipers, in a machine shop, coffee shop with espresso machine going. Haven't tested it in a autobody shop, yet.The NRR element is rated at 25dB by the EPA, although I think that it is a conservative rating. I'd estimate it higher, more like 30-50dB when carefully moved around to seal well to your ear canal.The blue cord is about 2 ft long and the triple flange noise reduction soft plastic element is comfortable to wear 24/7. Even when the earplug is under your head in a pillow. The cord loops behind your neck. The cord helps preventing loss when you need to talk.I'm on my second pair in 4 months. Be careful on yanking on the cord only, as it is the weakest part where it joins with the NRR element.
