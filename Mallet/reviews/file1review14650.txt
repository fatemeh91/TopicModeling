review/text: When I first used Source Naturals vinpocetine I took two 10mg tablets within two hours of each other. About an hour after taking the second tablet I could feel the blood going to my brain. It kinda freaked me out, but I knew it worked. For a couple of weeks I was able to focus much better. However, now I do not notice a difference. I even took 15mg at once and didn't have that same sensation of blood going to my brain.I recommend doing research on various supplements that purportedly increase concentration or memory, then go to WebMD and find out if there is scientific evidence to support those claims.
