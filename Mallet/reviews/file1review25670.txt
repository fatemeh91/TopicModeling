review/text: I purchased this product this past June and it is broken already. The motor is failing badly. Changed batteries twice and it has a grinding noise coming from it that doesn't sound safe. I also believe it is rusting by being around our bathroom sink, and never in the water. I wouldn't recommend this product.
