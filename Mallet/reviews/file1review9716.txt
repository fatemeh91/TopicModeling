review/text: I was told I have Emphysema 4 years ago (mild) and had to quit smoking immediately. So in the last 4 years I have tried the patch (twice...first time I was on them for 2 months!) and the various gums, losengers, etc. All of them get you through the duration while you are taking the product, but when out in the world alone, I was always too easily (mentally) tempted to cheat. Cheating led to a month to six month binges and another product was tried. Smoke Away is the only thing that Detoxified me quickly and now I can be around smokers and stress in all settings and have NO DESIRE to "bum" a cigarette!! Using the product fully (phase 2 is just as important) did the trick for me. TRY IT!!!
