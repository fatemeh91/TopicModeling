review/text: First the only other ON Protein that I have tried is the double chocolate which is very good. I had really high hopes for the chocolate mint and ordered a 2 pounder. The smell of chocolate mint is absolutely amazing and got me really pumped up for the taste. Once mixed up the taste wasn't all that great. There is no real mint taste and the chocolate was toned down as well. I wish it tasted like it smells. I will be sticking with the Double Chocolate.
