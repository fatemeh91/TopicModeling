review/text: This carpet cleaner is great for quick clean-ups. It gets the crumbs and lint off my area rug in dining room when I want to do a quick clean up in between regular vacuuming chores. Only major complaint is that the handle is two-pieces and comes apart easily, so you have to lift the sweeper from the bottom of the handle.
