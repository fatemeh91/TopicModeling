review/text: Even if it does I don't believe the effect lasts too much - my dishes still need to bethoroughly rinsed before I load them.I can tell you however that my dishwasher (GE Model# GDWT368VSS) is very likely the WORST in the world. (Rest assured, you can always go wrong with a GE dishwasher.Yes, it is also an admission of sub-par intelligence since I bought another dishwasher from GE despite the terrible experiences with my previous dishwasher - from GE!!)
