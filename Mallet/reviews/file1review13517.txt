review/text: My friend recommended these to me. I'm so glad that I bought them. They are SO worth the money to me. I love love love them. They're even better than my $500+ custom orthotics from my podiatrist!I love them because they prevent me from having foot and leg pain at the end of the day. However, I can't say that I noticed any difference in cellulite or fitness of my legs.I have unusually high arches and my feet supinate when I stand, walk or run. Without any inserts or orthotics, if I stand or walk slowly for too long, my heels and arches are so painful and it causes my thigh muscles to ache all night and I can't sleep. My orthotics lessened this quite a bit but they don't fit in most shoes because they're too bulky. I wanted to try something that I could wear in my other shoes and so I bought these.With these, I can walk or stand all day and my feet are in next to no pain at the end of the day. Now, I prefer wearing these instead of my orthotics. I've had these for 6 months now and use them nearly every day and they're still holding up.
