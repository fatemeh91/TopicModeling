review/text: I purchased 3 of these toothbrushes for my family in June 2006. The toothbrush does a very thorough cleaning and leaves your mouth with a 'fresh-from-the-dentist' feel. Also the two minute timer is very useful for children as a way to encourage longer brushing. Dentist commented at 6 month check up that our teeth all looked well cared for! BUT one toothbrush simply stopped working in Jan 2007 - this was certainly annoying for a product only in use for 7 months but it was still under guarantee so I packaged it off to a service centre per Braun 1-800 number instructions. Never heard anything for weeks and finally called the service centre. They had been unable to repair - (thanks for the follow up call, not!) - and had advised Braun. Called Braun and they said they would send out a replacement shortly. Well, this became the longest journey from NJ warehouse to my DC address ever! Took 3 months and 5 phone calls on my part. On one occasion, I explained to customer service people that I was still waiting for the toothbrush. I had followed the Federal Express tracking number but Federal Express had been unable to deliver as the address was incomplete. They had returned the toothbrush to Braun. The Braun customer service agent asked me curtly "why do you blame Braun for that?" Not once in any of the 5 phone calls to Braun did anyone offer an apology for the situation and the ridiculously long amount of time I was without a toothbrush. Customer service - zero stars. toothbrush - 4 stars. I went down the middle and awarded it 2 stars/.
