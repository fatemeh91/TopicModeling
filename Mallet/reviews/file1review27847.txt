review/text: I recently started to become "health conscious" and a friend recommended this product to me. She actually tried to fool me with the unsweetened version (seriously -- not sure how she thought she could get away with that given she was dealing with a major junk food eater), and when she found out I was putting in Equal to help it taste better, she revealed there was an artificially sweetened version.I love it this product. Sure,it could be a little chocolaty-er (I'd like to think me using a little less skim milk helps with getting more of the flavor) but all in all, with the help of milk & a couple of ice cubes, I've come to view it as a frozen treat that I really look forward to every day. Like a little chocolate shake. Which is really saying something because I don't think there's anything that I love to eat/drink that is healthy for me, other than blueberries.... but I digress.. this stuff is really good. As good as a Haagen Dazs chocolate milkshake? Absolutely not. But for someone trying to shift gears, trying to get away from the dark side of foods...and trying to eat healthier & lose weight, the taste (and a little bit of mind games) can fool me into thinking I'm having a Haagen Dazs shake (ok, maybe a lot of mind games but still -- I view it as my healthy Haagen Dazs shake).Big clue -- the unsweetened version has the word "natural" in there. I've read complaints about this one having artificial sweeteners -- sure, that should be in the description/review of the product so maybe that's what the complaints are about because if otherwise, the solution is simple -- buy the unsweetened one.As for me, dare I say a former junk food junkie who has a big sweet tooth -- I'm happy there is something out there that can satisfy my sweet cravings without me having to add anything else (besides the milk & ice of course) and without me having to eat anything else.
