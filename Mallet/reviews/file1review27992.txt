review/text: I'm giving it 5 stars because it is one of the healthiest whey protein and has the most quality protein I could find in a product for this price. It is great protein and has the potential to give you the results you want if you use it right (Meaning its not a substitute for your meals. I drink almost 3 shakes a day, 2 scoops per, along with 4 meals before I could finally see result,though I have had an EXTREMELY hard time seeing results, I'm FINALLY SEEING REAL BIG RESULTS, My other issue was not giving my muscles time to rest and heal. If you do any of these wrong you wont see results no matter what supplements you take). The issue is, I got the "Delicious Strawberry" and it is not so delicious after half the bag is consumed. Yuck... but it deserves 5 stars because its a good solid product and a great price and despite the taste, if your dedicated you will deal with it.
