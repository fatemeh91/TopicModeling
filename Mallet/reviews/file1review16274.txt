review/text: I love Finish brand dishwasher tabs and use the Subscribe and Save Program through Amazon to purchase the original, unscented, Finsh Powerball tabs on a regular, scheduled basis. I gave the orange scent a try and they do the same, awesome, spotless job cleaning my dishes as the regular, unscented dishwasher tabs. They do have a really nice orange scent when you take them out of the package and place it up to your nose, but you will never smell the orange scent again once you close the dishwasher and run the cycle. The dishwasher does not smell like oranges when the dishes are clean, nor do the dishes. I really don't see the point of adding a scent to this product because you never smell it unless you actually hold the tab up and take a whiff (who does that anyway?) and they are individually wrapped in plastic, so you cannot even smell the product until it is time to use it. I can understand scented hand soap and scented dish washing soap that you use to hand wash the dishes, but you never enjoy the scent in this automatic dishwasher tab. These tabs look exactly like the original tabs. I gave this product 5 stars because it is an excellent cleaning product and I have never once had a problem with spots or food left on my dishes after using this product. I did not take away any stars due to there being no point in having a scent, but if there is a price difference between the original and the orange scent when you are deciding on which ones to purchase, don't waste your money because it doesn't matter whether they are scented or not.
