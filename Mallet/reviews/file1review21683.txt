review/text: In using this product for approx. a year, I have to had to use vinyl sealer for a couple of leaks around the seams. The concept is incredible and has saved my daughter's head a couple of times. The non-slip bottom is excellent! She loves playing in it as well. If it were made with better vinyl I would give it a 10 star! Seriously, if you don't want to make repairs, pass on this product otherwise it is money down the drain in approx. 1 month.
