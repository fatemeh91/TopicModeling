review/text: This seemed like a great thing, I ordered it for the airplane rides on my recent international adventures. But in just a matter of weeks it won't hold air any more. I didn't damage or puncture it, and I can't see or hear where there is a leak. So it's a disappointing addition to the land fill, now being too late to return it. I'd suggest a different product.
