review/text: ***** Mamarina: Henderson - NV 12/18/2007The Happy Company Microwaveable Therapeutic Cozy Chenille Happy Wrap, Blue.I am very happy with this item, it helps me relax, I am using it a lot, smell so good and help me go to sleep.Now magical buckwheat comes to the rescue, swathed in the comforting softness of a removable chenille cover. In this "HAPPY WRAP" it combines with moist heat & hints of scent, primarily lavender. Microwaves are usually available for a 2-minute heating-up and that guarantees a deliciously therapeutic tension-melt-down.Mamarina
