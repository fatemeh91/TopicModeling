review/text: Extremely overrated. Way too expensive. had I known that I had to utilize 3 to 6 pills per day, I would not have purchased it at all.No difference, no change compared to other a lot less expensive vitamins I had used.Going back to old faithful for less than half the price and same results if not better.Again, over marketed and over rated. Not a customer at all.
