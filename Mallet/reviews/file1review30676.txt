review/text: Ladies like this razor too! I feel a bit odd writing this review about a traditionally men's product but I feel compelled to praise this excellent razor. I use this razor to shave my legs and I concur with many of the remarks made by the gentlemen. It gives a close and long lasting shave. There is a learning curve but I have never cut myself once in two years of use. Mainly because I just use the weight of the razor and I don't apply pressure. I cannot say that about the many disposable and cartridge razors I have used over the years, too many cuts to count. In addition, the blades are quite long lasting. Yes, the expense is upfront but the razor is well made and I fully expect it to last a lifetime.I decided to try the Merkur after being rather less than thrilled with the "modern" razors and the cost of replacement blades has gotten absolutely absurd! If you are using the higher end razors and cartridges as I was, switch to the Merkur, you will break even in a year or less and be ahead the game for the rest of your life.My husband has used this type of razor for twenty-five years and says that there is nothing better. Judging by his face and my legs, I agree.
