review/text: I got this commode chair for my dad who was having trouble getting to the toilet in the middle of the night. I put it next to his bed at night and it has really helped! The commode itself is exceptionally well made. It came completely assembled, is nice looking, considering what it is, and is very stable, sturdy, and smoothly made. The lid closes tightly enough that even when it has been used and there is fecal matter or urine in the hopper, there is no odor. The hopper is very generously sized and is made of a smooth thick plastic that is easy to rinse clean. The side arms are quite sturdy. My father depends on them to get himself up and out of bed in the night. Even though the construction is so sturdy, it is still not overly heavy. I find it very easy to move each morning when I put it away. It was an excellent purchase for the price, and would have been even at twice this.
