review/text: Because my skin is sensitive, shaving with a blade causes a lot of irritation. So I was forced to go with an electric shaver. I had been using one of Norelco's better shavers in the 8000 series and it did an all right job. I thought that was the best that an electric razor could do at a reasonable price.I was wrong. The Braun 8585 shaves much closer. As far as I'm concerned, as close as a blade. I am simply amazed. It doesn't charge as quickly as the Norelco and it is not as easy to clean manually as the Norelco. But with the Clean and charge unit, these issues are moot. Of course, there is the extra expense of buying replacement solution for the clean and charge unit. But this is a minor issue given how good a shave I get.Money well spent. Does anyone want a good deal on a top of the line Norelco?POSTSCRIPT: As I said above, I am prone to skin irritation if I shave with a blade. This electric razor does give one a shave comparable to that of a blade, but after a couple of weeks, it began to irritate my skin like a blade. I got the Norelco 8894 XL when it came out. It doesn't shave quite as close as this shaver, but my skin does much better. I just run a couple strokes of a Gilette Fusion razor to clean up a bit of stubble and I'm good to go. (See my review of the 8894 XL) I was really excited about this shaver at first, but it caused problems for my sensitive skin.
