review/text: I started taking these when I was pregnant with twins. After they were born I ran out and bought a different brand; within a few days of the generic vitamin my fingernails started breaking! I ordered more Rainbow Light vitamins and feel so much better and my fingernails are growing again! I plan to continue taking them for a long time!!
