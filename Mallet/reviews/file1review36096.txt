review/text: I've struggled with insomnia since I was about 12 years old. At 37 now with a young child who also doesn't sleep well, I get too close to the breaking point too often. The sleep deprivation is brutal. I'm a born night owl with the "my mind won't stop" kind of insomnia. I'll lie awake in bed at night for 2-3 hours before I can fall asleep, if I fall asleep at all before 5. And of course my son gets up around 6:30. Anyway, I decided to give these a try out of desperation and what do you know! They really help a lot. I don't spend hours awake anymore :) Very happy with them!
