review/text: This product is NOT for women; which is funny because they all have a feminine design. If the velcro touches your hair it will stick to it and God forbid your hair get tangled up in it during the night. I wore this one night and one night only. Terrible design, terrible purchase. What were they thinking? The person who designed this either has no hair or sleeps standing up.
