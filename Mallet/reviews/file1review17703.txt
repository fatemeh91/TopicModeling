review/text: I've bought three different Remington Beard and Mustache Trimmers to trim my goatee/side burns and the MB-200 continues in the long line of superior and affordably-priced trimmers.The trimmer is quiet, palm-sized, has a long battery life between charges, and does a wonderful job cutting. Recently I tried the Braun Cruze 6, which is twice as expensive, and it paled in comparison. Using the exact same cutting method, it routinely left hair that I had then go back with the Remington and trim. I liked the one I owned so much before buying the MB-200 that when the batteries died, I took it apart, jerry-rigged new rechargeable AA's into it, and used it for another 3-4 yrs.Honestly there really is no comparison with other trimmers and for $20-25 and a 5-10 year expected lifetime, you can't beat the price!!!
