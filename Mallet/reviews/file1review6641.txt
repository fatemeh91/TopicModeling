review/text: I bought this because I suffer from neck, shoulder, and middle back pain. I thought this would help and give my poor boyfriend's hands a rest. I find this uncomfortable to use and not particularly effective for my problems. Even using it very lightly, the knobs hurt! Some of them are kind of scratchy, too, due to the material. I considered wrapping the knobs in some sort of fabric to make it softer, but decided to just return it instead. I can see how this might be helpful who had no other options (i.e. no one for massages), but it just isn't good for me. I've returned mine.
