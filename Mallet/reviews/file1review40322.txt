review/text: I was sick. I took all of these pills, and now I am well. Would I try it again? Yes. What did I have? I'm not sure, but I was coughing up green stuff, and now it's all gone. I missed the early onset by a day or two, but it still worked.You're supposed to take 5 doses of two pills each for two days. That equals 20 capsules, which is the same number as is in one bottle. At first I was surprised that I was going to use the whole bottle for just getting sick once. But after it worked, and I got better fast, I realized that the price of this bottle is very small compared to a doctor visit, or compared to drugs.I really liked how deluxe this is. The capsules are these cool capsules that are gel-caps, but have the shape of hard gelatin capsules. The main herb in this is echinacea, and it's a very concentrated liquid form. Gaia didn't skimp at all, and this product is a very deluxe product. I liked it.Pros:+It works+Lots of super deluxe echinacea and other herbs+You can look up the code of your bottle on the website, and see information about where each herb was grown+Nice packagingCons:-You need a whole bottle for each illness
