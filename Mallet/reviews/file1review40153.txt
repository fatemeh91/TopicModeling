review/text: I would totally recommend this to anyone just getting started with yoga. I'm sorry, but mats, blocks, straps, etc are pricey. And this is a really good deal, getting everything for such an inexpensive price.If you find that yoga's for you, you would probably want to upgrade, especially as your usage increases, but I can't say enough what a good deal I think this is. The cheapest mat I found was $20, so I really think it's worth the extra $6 to get a bag, blocks, and strap too.I noticed some of the comments said the bag is flimsy. Well, no it's not top strength nylon or anything, but how sturdy do you need a bag that's carrying 3 lbs to be?I guess what I would take from all of this, is that if you're a yoga guru or someone who has money to blow-go get a nicer, pricier set. If not, this is the perfect set for you.
