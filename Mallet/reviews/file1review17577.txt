review/text: As far as functionality goes this thing does exactly what you'd expect. My only gripe with it is the power/battery system. The product description says that it's "corded/cordless" which isn't true. If the battery is dead you have to plug it in and wait for it to charge, you CAN'T use it off of AC power. I was usually able to get 1-2 trims per charge, and if you let it sit too long the battery drains. On the other hand, leaving it plugged in all the time also seems to kill the battery life, it will barely do 1 trim on a full charge these days. For the price though it's probably a good deal - I bought it 2 years ago and it finally bit the dust today, even after charging all night it can barely move the blades.
