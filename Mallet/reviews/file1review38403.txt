review/text: I was using the Emjoi Gold, which I thought was great, but it was old and tired. Ordered this and love it. It works even better than Emjoi Gold, gets my legs smoother, with less noticeable grow out. I find the shaver attachment useless, but don't need it. The fact that it's corded and not battery run doesn't bother me either. I actually think it may be more reliable as is. I've tried other epilators and find this the best and worth the money.
