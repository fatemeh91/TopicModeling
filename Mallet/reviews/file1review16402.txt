review/text: I have been taking it for years. You must take it at the first suspected sign of symptoms; tiredness, headache, aches all over, sore throat, coughing. Drink as much water as possible and it seems to knock out whatever I was coming down with. I think it helps to take it before bed and get a good nights sleep. Two kitties next to your body helps greatly. Great product-homeopathic.
