review/text: My first gopher lost a suction cup while getting a sack of sugar of a grocery store shelf. I have not been able to find replacement suction cups anywhere. Apparently it will not handle five pound loads as advertised.My second gopher (needed after the first lost an irreplacable suction cup) lost both suction cups while trying to pick up a wrench from a rough concrete floor.I will not buy another gopher until Ontel provides replacement suction cups (preferably free since I've bought two of them and they both failed in the same manner).It seems Ontel's opinion is what do you expect for ten bucks. I expect it to work as advertised and last more than six months. I cannot afford a new one every six months so will try to find a competitor who will stand behind his product.
