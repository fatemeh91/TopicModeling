review/text: I have been using this product for three months now and I don't see any results. The bottle does not last long being it contains 60 pills and you have to drink 8 pills a day. This is ridicules we are all better off using Nuro- PS Gold by vitamin world. The only reason I tried focus factor was because I did not have enough money to purchase the bottle from vitamin world at 50.00 dollars a bottle. I highly recommend those instead. I will never buy focus factor again.
