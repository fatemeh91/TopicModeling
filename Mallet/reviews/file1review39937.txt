review/text: I have been using Solgar's "Whey to Go" for several years. The reason I buying this brand? First, it's a delicious low fat, easily absorbed protein powder that tastes just like natural vanilla bean. Also, in Whey to Go there is NO soy and NO protein powder derived from cows treated with rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone) and NO artificial sweeteners. It's a terrific way to get the low fat protein we don't always get in our diet and it's very easy to digest. I mix 2-3 scoops of "Whey to Go" ~ vanilla bean flavor in a glass of low fat milk for quick energy. For a delicious recipe I add 3 scoops Whey to Go vanilla flavor in my blender along with one banana, 1 cup low fat milk, 1 cup apple juice, 2-3 Tablespoons Nutiva's Hemp chocolate shake, 2 cups frozen peach slices, 1 cup blue berries or blackberries, 1 teaspoon vanilla and blend. I usually have more than enough to freeze a glass in the freezer to have later as a delicious chocolate "protein" ice cream. There are so many other combinations of fruit, juices, milk that can be blended together with Whey to Go! And it is healthy!
