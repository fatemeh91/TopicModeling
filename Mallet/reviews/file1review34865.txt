review/text: I've tried everything on this razor. I bought a water sharpening stone to hone it, and I have a strop. However, no matter how much I sharpen it or hone it, it remains dull. I go over my face over and over again, and very little hair is removed. I do manage to cut my self 22 times, but little hair is removed. If you want to shave with a straight razor you should either buy a DOVO or buy a vintage one from the 30's made by a good american company such as:1.) Waterville2.) Genco3.) Geneva4.) Case (W.R. Case & Sons)5.) Winchester6.) Sta-Sharp7.) Craftsman (There is also a German version that is superlative)You can find these razors in fine shape on ebay for under $20
