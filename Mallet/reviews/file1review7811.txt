review/text: I bought this to massage my scalp and I can't help but feel like I'm not using it correctly. It's difficult to rub my scalp with and I keep accidentally poking myself in the eye with it. I also used it to massage my jaw after eating too much beef jerky and for some reason it made me feel a little bit gay. My wife however seems to absolutely love this, which is interesting because she's never mentioned having any scalp issues before. I do notice that after she uses it, the massage wand is usually all slippery, so she must have a very oily scalp, that may be why it works better for her. I guess I'll keep looking for a massager for men with dry scalps, but if you're a woman with an oily scalp this thing is apparently great.
