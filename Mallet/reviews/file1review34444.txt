review/text: You can't over estimate the value of a good lube, am I right? This is far and away the best lube we've tried. It is super slippery and NEVER becomes sticky like so many lubes. It's odorless, and it doesn't have that yucky chemical taste either. My vagina is very easily irritated and dry, and this lube feels great! It's made a world of difference for my husband and me.
