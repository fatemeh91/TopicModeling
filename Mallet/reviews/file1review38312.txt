review/text: I may have to start a support group because I have become an epilating fiend. True, it is not (initially) an exceptionally pleasant experience, though no more uncomfortable than waxing AND the pain diminishes the more you use it. My friends say that I sound like an Emjoi commercial, but I love the results and it is so easy to use. In my past life (when I shaved)I would get a 5:00 shadow. VERY unattractive. Stubble - Blech. But all of that is in the past. Thank you Emjoi!
