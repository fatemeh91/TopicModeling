review/text: I wanted what some other people who bought this wanted: to shave my head under the shower. What I find is that if my hair is not very clean and dry, the blades pull my hair and do not cut well. This is counter intuitive as it is advertised as something you can use in the shower. So you can do that, but in my experience it is a bad idea to get your hair wet before you are done, which sort of defeats the purpose...Yesterday I bought a new Braun Electric Razor. It cost a lot more. But it's also capable of cutting while right under the water. Seems to like it, in fact. Much better. You get what you pay for, I guess.
