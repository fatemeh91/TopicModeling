review/text: one of my favorite teas ever! nice soothing and good flavor! i only like few kinds of tea this one rocks. i used to drink it in holland where my office would get at any near by grocery store. it was nice for working on the computer in the winter because it kept my mouse hand warm, helped with acid stomach and stress stomach.
