review/text: WOW! Anyone who thinks Hoodia doesn't work hasn't really tried Hoodoba PURE 750. I almost gave up on Hoodia after getting no suppression with several so-called "top brands." But by the 3rd day of my trial with Hoodoba PURE 750, three capsules before each meal extinguished my appetite better than 15 mgs. of medically prescribed Dexedrine. From my initial 287 pounds, I've already lost 98 pounds and eliminated all signs of diabetes thanks to Hoodoba PURE, without exercising. Yes, I should exercise, but I thank G-d every day for this lifesaving plant and a still-honest company that refuses to dilute it -- just for profits.If anyone knows of anything else that can painlessly KEEP fat off a 52-year-old male as well as Hoodoba PURE, I'm all ears. Until then, I'll stick with Hoodoba PURE 750. (It works so well that two of my doctors are now using it on other patients.)P.S. Only one other Hoodia brand suppressed my appetite, but even when I used 8 of their 750 mg. capsules, it did NOT equal the intensity and duration of appetite suppression I routinely get from two to three Hoodoba PURE 750s. (After my 3rd week on Hoodoba, two capsules before meals could suffice to stop my overeating; three zapped all desire to eat.) Hoodoba PURE 750s contain absolutely NO fillers, flowing agents, or other junk (such as magnesium stearate); everything else I tried and researched was heavily DILUTED with unnecessary and unhealthy garbage. I believe this is a key reason Hoodoba PURE works where others fail.Tip: CHEWING my Hoodoba PURE 750 veggie-capsules makes them zap my appetitie sooner and deepens the suppression. I also achieve a nice level of suppression with Hoodoba's 400 mg. capsules as well as their 500 mg. Potent Hoodia liquid version, but I prefer Hoodoba PURE 750 more than any other Hoodia product on the market.
