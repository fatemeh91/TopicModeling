review/text: Our 8 year old son had a problem with bedwetting, and we had tried many techniques to no avail. We got the Dri Sleeper Excel and the first night that he wore it to bed, he got up at night to use the bathroom before the alarm even sounded. He knew the alarm would sound if he was wet and so he just made sure the alarm didn't go off. Ever since then he has always been dry in the morning. His bedwetting problem was literally cured overnight.
