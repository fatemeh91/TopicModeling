review/text: I really just wanted to use this product while giving my nephew a sponge bath instead of bathing him in the sink. So to test this out I put it on my couch and then put my nephew on it and he kept sliding down it. Thank God I did not put him in this thing in the sink before I tested it out. I just went ahead and bought an infant tub. I dont know what I am going to do with this thing. I know it does not cost much but I think you would do better to buy an infant tub with a sling.
