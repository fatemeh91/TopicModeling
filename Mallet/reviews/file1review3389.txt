review/text: I originally bought this pill crusher/splitter because I needed a splitter and I thought the other features crusher/cup/storage might come in handy. Well, the splitter didn't cut my pills cleanly...the pill crumbled horribly when cut. Also the blade was very exposed which worried me a bit since I had to hold the pill still when I started cutting. The various pieces merely snapped together (except for the crusher which screws on at the bottom), so I would not have put a pill in the storage compartment and put the whole thing in my pocketbook for fear of it opening. I started to give it a bad review after a few unsatisfactory uses, but decided to purchase another splitter first and see if it was any better (I thought my pill was perhaps, simply "unsplittable"). I purchased theApex Ultra Pill Splitter. The Apex was awesome!!! My pill is definitely "splittable". Furthermore, the Apex held my pill still so I didn't have to worry about cutting my fingers because I was holding the pill still. The Apex has a safety shield over the blade when the splitter is open, and it is very easy to push the pill into the storage compartment once cut (this was not so easy with the splitter you are reviewing). The storage compartment on the Apex only snaps closed, so you wouldn't leave the pill in it and through it in your purse. But overall the Apex was awesome and this one was not.
