review/text: The Wahl 79524 26-piece deluxe clipper set works fine if you make sure the power screw is at the optimum . I had to turn it quite a bit . READ THE DIRECTIONS .The DVD is very helpful . I picked this package because it was the only one with a DVD . I am a adult white male and the 1 inch '' guide '' is the only one I use . I gave myself a great haircut . WATCH THE DVD AND READ THE DIRECTIONS .
