review/text: Sometimes you just need something simple.This brush is perfect for cleaning many sorts of travel cups, thermoses, bottles, vases, and other various hand-wash dishes such as little spoons. Since I've collected the spoons from around the world, I want to keep them in good shape. The OXO brush is much nicer on the spoons than the dishwasher, and the multiple angles of the bristles make it very easy to clean smaller items.I have also used the brush on hand-wash cups because it is so easy to use. The flexible stem and bunches of bristles means it almost cleans the dish itself (with soap).That said, I use it as a secondary brush most of the time, once I've scraped off any visible marks. Although the bristles are good, they are not real strong. I don't think it would scrape off dried dough, for instance.Considering the price, it may be worth it to just stock my sink with several of the OXO brushes, one for every occasion.I haven't washed the brush in the dishwasher yet, I'll let you know the results when I do.
