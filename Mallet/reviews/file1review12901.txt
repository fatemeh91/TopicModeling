review/text: I have two Elasto Gel sinus masks!! I used the first one so much that I needed to get a back up... that way I always have a perfectly cold mask. I have never used them for heat, but they can be used for that purpose as well.GIRLS: My only caution is that over time they flatten out you eyelashes. I use an eyelash curler on the days I use this mask because once they go flat it's hard to get the natural curl back... and really hard to wear your mascara! All that said, this is a fabulous product!!
