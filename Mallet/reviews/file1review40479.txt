review/text: I love Taylor of Old Bond Street products. They genuinely are top notch quality with a bargain price tag. Their shaving creams are no exception either, which I have been using for years.Pros:- The lather is super smooth and creamy. Once you learn the right amount of cream and water for your beard, this will make a great lather.- The cream will not clog a safety razor (I use a Merkur).- One tub will last 12-16 months!- The beard softening properties of this cream is unmatched!- The cream is also high in moisture; I have never needed to use a post shave treatment when using this cream.Cons:- I can't get past the smell of this particular cream, and neither can my wife. We both prefer the almond scent by the same company.Bottom line: I will continue buying their products, just not this scent. If you like muskier and woodsy scents, it might work for you just fine.
