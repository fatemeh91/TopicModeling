review/text: We have been using Bright Spark for three weeks now, and I have seen some substantial improvement in my daughter's behavior.I don't think that this remedy used alone is a panacea, however. The improvement that we have witnessed has been in conjunction with other adjustments we have made and other nutritional therapies.We are also treating our daughter for sensory integration disorder (which is truly helpful). Also helpful is fish oil. I am also using flax oil, spirulina, etc. for a daily smoothie.She gets Bright Spark 3x daily, 2 tablets a day. All of this treatment works best if she also avoids sugar and gets a good night's sleep.I would agree with the post that warns about missing a dose. The one tantrum my daughter has had in the last month coincided with missing a dose of Bright Spark. It was ugly, but not as extreme as previous tantrums had been, so progress even there.
