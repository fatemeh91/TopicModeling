review/text: I had warts build up on my palms and fingers. They started out small till I tried tofreeze several of them off or pullout them out(ouch). Went to the doctor to freeze,and my own freeze can from Dr, Scholl's and nothing. Used a special natural oil, nothing.Used Terrasil and nothing. But the stick cleared them all up a tad over 3 weeks! I usedit before bed. At times used it twice per day. After three days you see change with thewart drying out and shrinking.
