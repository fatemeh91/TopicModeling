review/text: As soon as I used it I noticed that this is the worst razor I've ever used. It is not good for the curves on your legs, armpits or bikini area etc. because of the soap head which stands there clumsily. Plus, because of the soap head, you can't shave as close as you want. I didn't like it at all, waste of money and time. The first thing next day was to go to market again and to buy a new razor.(nowadays I adore Wilkinson Quattro for women)
