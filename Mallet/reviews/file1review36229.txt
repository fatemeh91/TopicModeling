review/text: I was very concerned about my blood pressure. My GP suggested I begin taking a well known prescription med to lower my pressure which was 156/90. I knew that it was a slippery slope once I would begin to take this drug. After doing some extensive research, I decided to try Vaxa Circulin. In just a few days, I began to see a significant difference and after a few weeks, my pressure was 123/64. This certainly works for me! I have had no side effects at all. I will continue to purchase this although I know that the prescription drug would be a great deal cheaper with my insurance. It is worth every penny.
