review/text: OK, I'll say it: I have a lot of nose hair. And this little gadget works great at trimming it down. And stays sharp after months of use... at least so far. Uses 1 AA battery. Travels well. Exactly what I needed. OH... and it doesn't cut me like a cheap jobbie did that I bought before I bought this one to replace it.
