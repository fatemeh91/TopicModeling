review/text: I have been using this product since 2006. Before I got this, I have used different trimmers available in the market, but they were not even close to this. This trimmer trims the beard as close as possible to the skin. and the self sharpening blades keep the blades sharp forever. Once the built-in battery is fully charged, this device can be used for at least 6 beard trims.I have used my first MB-200 trimmer for 3 years and got another one and been using since 2009, I have recently purchased another one. I dont want shift to any other product as I am extremely satisfied with this. you get the best trimmer for the amount you spend.
