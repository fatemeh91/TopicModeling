review/text: I bought this for my bug-out bag. It seems quite the good value with lots of good stuff for general problems. Trouble is, I don't feel it's a good trauma kit for when one might get shot. I'm still working the details, but I think the best kit is probably a hybrid of the kits readily available. I'm going to add to his one. Need some clotting agents and more heavy bandages. This is the yuppy "I went kayaking this weekend" kit. Not the "I just got attacked by a cougar and I have a 8 inch open gash in my abdomen" kit. I'm kinda looking for the cougar kit. I'd say buy this to start, then supplement with what else you think you are missing. Depending on what you are looking for, this kit is 5 star or 3 star. If skin staplers and sutures aren't on your list, this kit is great. If you're trying to fix a bullet wound or serious trauma, this will need to be enhanced.
