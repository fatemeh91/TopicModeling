review/text: Glucosamine Joint Movement worked well for me. I had trouble walking up a stair way because of my knee problems, specially the right one would have a small pop and friction. This bother me so bad I would walk up the stairs side ways. After taking this product for a week or so I started to notice my knee problems where starting to disappear. People also report that this product has a bad taste. I think is a matter of time before you develop a taste for it. Price on Amazon is a few Dollars off from COSTCO warehouse, so if you want to try right now and you have membership or know someone who does, purchase at COSTCO. COSTCO warehouse bottle is 1000ml at a cost of $19.99 or so. Today I can say that this product took care of my knee problem. I would highly recommend you to try it for two week trial and see if it would do the trick for you. 33 servings 1000ml & sugar free, does the trick.
