review/text: I purchased this product specifically to target the area between my shoulder blades. Although it reaches this spot, there are a few issues. First, "the device", as it is called in my household, shipped without any instructions of any kind. Nothing. You can, however, BUY books that tell you how to use it... completely unacceptable in my book. I contemplated giving it one star just for this. Second, because you need at least one hand to manipulate, it's harder to reach my trouble area than it is for, say, a tennis ball. Finally, it's hard plastic and not as comfortable as a tennis ball.I gave "the device" three stars since it basically does what it's supposed to, just not up to my expectations. My advice... buy some tennis balls or base balls.
