review/text: I use a lot of wipes in my household, doing my part as a full-time caregiver to my ninety year old grandmother. That involves wiping down and sanitizing a lot of surfaces. We previously used a more chemically-based wipe, with a high level of bleach. That meant it really dried out and irritated the skin on my hands. Though, Method doesn't list all of the ingredients used in their Cleaning Wipes, they do mention that they are "anti rubber glove." I was pleasantly surprised that they were right. You don't need to use latex or rubber gloves to protect the delicate skin on your hands, when you use this product. It effectively cleans and santizes any surfaces you clean with the wipes, leaves a fresh grapefruit scent, without being abrasive. What's more, they are biodegradable and aren't tested on animals. Highly reccomended!
