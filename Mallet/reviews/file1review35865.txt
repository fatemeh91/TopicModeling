review/text: I have dry skin and was looking for a reasonably inexpensive moisturizer/after shave lotion. I hate products that leave an oily film or have pungent aromas. This Nivea balm has neither. It easily absorbs into the skin after a few minutes leaving your face feeling refreshed and ready to start the day.I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the packaging. A plastic bottle you could squeeze would be safer and more convenient than the glass bottle. (This should also make it cheaper to ship if you are ordering online given the corresponding reduction in weight.) This is the only drawback of this product.4 stars (would have given it 5 if not for the packaging).
