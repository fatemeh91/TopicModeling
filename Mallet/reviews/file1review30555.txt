review/text: First, I'm not a heavy pit sweater so antiperspirants are not for me. I tried many brands of deodorants before finding Herbal Clear. All of the others either gave me a rash (and I'm not known for having sensitive skin) or they completely destroyed my white undershirts. I was replacing my undershirts every couple of months due to yellowing and hardening of the fabric. So gross.I was so happy when I found Herbal Clear. Great smell (Aloe version) and no annoying side effects. For years Target used to carry this stuff and it was dirt cheap. Under 2 dollars a stick. For some reason they stopped carrying it. So now I'm forced to bid on this stuff on eBay or buy it from Amazon for nearly twice the price. The fact that I'm bidding on deodorant on eBay is a pretty big endorsement for this brand. Give it try!
