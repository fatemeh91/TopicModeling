review/text: I shave with a Merkur double edged razor and this is the best I have found. I've tried Barc, Zirh, Menscience, Aveda, etc etc and Kid Glove is a great combination of clearness, smoothness, zero irritation and a good smell. The only thing is that it does pack quite a tingle. Personally, it does not burn my face, but I can see how some might find it irritating. It leaves my skin smooth, hydrated and the best part for me is it being clear so I can see exactly what I am shaving. It doesn't clog my razor like others and I can see every hair as I am shaving. I would recommend this to anyone that asked for my opinion and did not have super, sensitive skin.
