review/text: I was hesitant to buy a sex toy online, because there is no way for you to actually know how well its made, size, etc.So I took the risk on this because so many people have raved about the Rabbit. And its only like 25 bucks so no great loss if it sucks.It arrived a little early, VERY discrete packaging (I had it sent to my boyfriends house, and his parents didnt even suspect!!).I tried it out right away because I wanted to know what I paid for.30 seconds later, and I was ready to buy a lifetime supply of this!!The head is pretty thick, and I didnt think I would like that, but it wasnt uncomfortable at all.Well worth it!!!
