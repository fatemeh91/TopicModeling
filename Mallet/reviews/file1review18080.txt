review/text: I have tried various masks over the years, and this is the best one I've ever owned. It does a great job keeping the light out, and I can barely feel it on my face... and what I do feel is very soft and comfortable. The elastic is neither too thick nor too thin, and connects in back with Velco, so it's adjustable. I often use it at home, and always bring it with me when I travel; somehow the hotel curtains NEVER close all the way.
