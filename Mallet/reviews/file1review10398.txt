review/text: When doing a low-carb diet, constipation can often be a problem, especially in the beginning stages when the carbs are the most restrictive. It's a complaint many people have about low-carbing. Now, if you're doing it right, it shouldn't be that way, but sometimes it just happens. Also, someone with chronic illnesses and also those who take pain medication regularly might find themselves with a bout of constipation too. So while I know this is called a 'dieter's tea' and I know that some people use it for cleansing and even for dangerous weight loss by drinking too much of it to 'flush out' the foods they eat, this tea can actually be used safely and for good purposes when used properly for constipation relief.It takes a little bit to find the right level of brewing to make this work for you. Too little, and it doesn't do much, too much and you'll explode and run to the bathroom almost right after drinking it. Find the right balance, the right steeping level vs. water for you, and you'll simply have a normal, easy relief the next morning. Once or twice per week, after a meal, works great for most folks I've talked to. Works wonderful for me when needed.The flavor is great too. I've tried the other flavors of this brand, and I don't like them. My best friend likes the lemon though, so to each their own, but for me, the cinnamon is the best. It's lightly sweet on its own, but sometimes I'll still add a little honey.Good stuff, and if properly steeped, it doesn't cause cramping or pain or unflattering gas, with a decent taste. Definitely recommend if it's something you need.
