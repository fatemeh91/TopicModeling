review/text: Using only the highest quality ingredients (no synthetic substances) and no flowing agents, (magnesium stearate and stearic acid), I believe Meta Fem is the best multi for women for the price on the market. Flowing agents, such as magnesium stearate and stearic acid, enable the ingredients used in supplements to flow through the presses more smoothly without sticking. They also cause the supplements to become sticky and less usable by your body. I have researched the contents and prices of a number of natural supplements, and of all the best ones, for the price and quality Meta Fem is my favorite. If your body can't use the ingredients, what good is taking a supplement? You might as well throw your money down the toilet.
