review/text: I ORDERED TWO CALF SLEEVES FOR PREVENTIVE PURPOSES. I HAVE FRAGILE CALVES AND HAVE SUFFERED FREQUENT INFECTIONS FROM MINOR INJURIES. SO FAR, THEY ARE ALMOST PERFECT FOR MY PURPOSES. ONLY THING BETTER WOULD BE IF WERE AVAILABLE WITH VELCRO WRAPAROUND CLOSINGS FOR QUICKER ON/OFF. ALSO, I WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF THEY FALL APART PREMATURELY.
