review/text: It has positive effects beyond simple placebo, but it seemed incomplete, maybe because the company only quantifies one of the 2 supposedly active ingredients for this herb. It does have a potent amount and concentration of the main "active ingredient". For this reason I started adding a different blend from another company as a second capsule per day (instead of two of the same), to round things out. This seems to work well, but I will develop my definitive opinion only over time.
