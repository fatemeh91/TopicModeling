review/text: When I ordered these, I thought they were nylon bristle brushes on one end. They are not! They are a flat bristle molded as part of the toothpick. So much the better! I wondered how they could be so cheap. They are simply molded plastic toothpicks with tiny flexible tines on the other end. Oh, and the pick side has a few small ridges on the flattened sides, for clearing plaque.Let me tell you: THEY ARE AWESOME!!!My wife and kids thought I was crazy when I started to rave about these things. They are perfect for anyone who maintains some pretty regular oral hygiene. You can get out the toughest of food particles or stringy fibers!OK, it's true. The toothpick end is knife-shaped: sharp at the point and pretty rigid. But, I think that is one the best features! This shape allows you to insert the pick into the gaps of teeth, right at the gum line, and clean both teeth with a few passes, in & out. The fact that the pick is knife-thin on one side, allows it to fit in the gaps between closely spaced teeth. Use the thick side up on the top teeth, then thick side down on the bottom teeth. If you use them this way, they are quite comfortable - DAY 1! The pick alone will dislodge most food particles.The brush on the other end is molded onto a thin rod that fits into even tighter spaces that the pick side. The brush can then be manipulated as needed to get even the most stubborn food particles dislodged. I often spin the whole pick/brush to allow the brush side to do its thing.My father was a big toothpick guy, the wooden kind, but I could never get get them to work for me. They didn't fit between my teeth. I could never direct the point to the right place to get the food out. I NOW KNOW THE GLORY OF USING A GOOD TOOTHPICK!!I have never used a better device for cleaning between my teeth - PERIOD!!BUY 'EM! USE 'EM!! You'll love 'em!!!
