review/text: The Omron blood pressure monitor is very well made, well designed, easy to use, with many features, and an easy-to-understand manual. What more can you want? Omron has been making monitors for quite some time, so I was comfortable in ordering this. As well as the blood pressure number, you get pulse, and an indicator of too-high-pressure or irregular heartbeat. I am very satisfied.
