review/text: This is a great product. I highly recommend it to anyone that has trouble sleeping from any source of light intrusion, whether it be daylight or a nitelight. I saw it in a Money magazine article that suggested it for frequent fliers. I would also say to anyone living in Alaska, it would be very handy to have in your nightstand.Bucky 40 Blinks Mask Ultralight Eye Mask
