review/text: I have been using Hammer Gel for almost 15 years as a fuel source for mountain biking, backcountry skiing, running and mountaineering. I particularly appreciate that Hammer Gel provides consistent energy and is easy to carry and consume with refillable flasks.I first used Hammer Gel when I guided a client on the Grand Traverse in the Teton Range in Wyoming in 1998 - a technical traverse of 10 peaks, including Teewinot, Mt. Owen, the Grand Teton, Middle Teton, South Teton, Cloudveil Dome and Nez Perce. Prior to the trip I searched for fuel/food that could sustain me for three days while keeping bulk and weight to a minimum. I took a bit of a gamble with Hammer Gel, considering I hadn't used it before, but it worked really well for me. I found that I could get the carbohydrates I needed over the course of the day and experienced a consistent level of energy. Hammer Gel was my primary source of fuel; I supplemented with dehydrated meals in the morning and at night. I also liked that it was easy to access, even one-handed (useful when belaying), had a pleasant flavor and could easily be mixed into a water bottle. My experience with Hammer Gel on this trip was something of a seminal moment for me in that I learned how proper nutrition could contribute to mental alertness and consistent energy levels.Since then, I have learned to include protein on extended efforts and have incorporated Hammer Nutrition's Sustained Energy, Perpetuem and Whey Protein Powder. Along with Endurolytes (electrolytes), I feel that I have a fueling system that is convenient and covers my nutritional needs in the mountains as well for training. I also appreciate Hammer Nutrition's commitment to quality ingredients, overall health and consideration for the environment.
