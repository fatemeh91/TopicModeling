review/text: I'd used two old coil Epiladies for over 20 years, and the last one finally started dying. I've had this Emjoi for about 3 months now and am happy with it. I hope it doesn't break down as some folks experienced.GOOD: Works well. Even underarms are easy now, and fast! Not painful for me since I am pretty used to the sensation, just takes a bit of practice for newbies. Bikini line tough due to angles but works ok with a bit of manuevering. Well worth expense and slight initial pain. Unit is light, though must use heavy plug. Also, I thought the shaver attachment was useless but have actually used it several times already- a good addition.BAD: Ergonomics are horrible- bad design makes it tough to hold and easy to drop (hence break); loud; no multiple voltage for international use; case is waste of materials, better to have a simple bag. Overall, a great purchase.
