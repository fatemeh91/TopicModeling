review/text: I bought two of these daily pill trays, one for my aging father and one for me. I like the fact that the full name of the day is on each container to help my Dad reinforce what day of the week it is and the different colors help too. There is also a wall between AM and PM sides to keep the pills separate. Each container is 2 3/4"L x 1 3/4"W x 3/4"D and has a small 3/4" hing point at the back (time will tell how long this hing will last). The containers just sit into a slot in the tray ready for daily use. It's a lot nicer to have just this pill tray sitting on my counter than a bunch of vitamin and Rx bottles. Good value for the price.
