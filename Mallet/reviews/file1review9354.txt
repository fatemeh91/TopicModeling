review/text: When I opened up the package, I was a little surprised because each pill box was much bigger than I had expected. But it has worked out well since my doctor is still adjusting my dosages and sometimes I'm taking 3 pills of the same thing. It's also very nice to just be able to pick up the one box for a particular day and throw it in my purse. I've never had any issue with the AM pills getting mixed up with PM pills while the pill box is jumbling around during the day or in luggage if we're out of town for a few days.One negative: the bottom of the pill boxes aren't weighted, making it difficult when I lay them all out on Sunday afternoon and fill for the week. I have to keep a close eye on the pills to be sure they don't roll out and get mixed up. I've considered lining them up on the kitchen counter against the backsplash, and then placing my cutting board in front--using the backsplash and cutting board to keep the boxes in place while I fill them.If you were elderly or had dexterity issues, these pill boxes would be very difficult to fill at the beginning of each week.
