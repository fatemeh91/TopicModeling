review/text: We ordered this tub six months ago for my then 6 month old daughter. I have loved using it, but mine seems to have several slow leaks and I am just about to order another one. Right now I have to blow mine up before each use. Also, I never use the drain plug because it is too hard to manipulate it. We just dump the water over the side.I really have enjoyed the tub...I like how it uses less water than the big tub...it takes no time at all to fill the Snug Tub. I like the soft sides that keep her from bumping her head, and I like the suction cup that allows you to hang the tub up when you are finished.I recommend this for babies who are able to sit up well on their own.
