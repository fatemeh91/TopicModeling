review/text: I am in the gym a lot and I have gotten a few warts on my hands over the years from likely the weights. This product is simply far and away the best one to use...period...the acid % is much higher and it's easy to travel with...no messy/stinky liquids, over-priced bandages, etc...Simply apply to wart area, cover with band-aid (inside also line with this stuff), and cover with duct tape...the combination works great and it will rid you of your warts in very little time.You literally have to burn into them with the acid to kill the root....it might take a few weeks, but it does work...I've had to do this several times in the past....
