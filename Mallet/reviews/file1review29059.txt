review/text: Another reviewer rated the closeness as fair.I would have to agree as it was not anywhere close to good.But, I got this shaver to trim my beard.It does not trim beards at all. Facial hair cannot reach the micro-screen. It may be a good gift if you hate someone.I will be returning mine, as it does a bad job as a shaver, and does not trim beards.I am very dissapointed now since I've been waiting for a while to get one and received this as a gift. It was hard to tell the giftor that it didn't work. Don't waste your time with this shaver.
