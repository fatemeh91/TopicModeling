review/text: I was so excited whenI saw the price on these tests, but after using five of them before even getting the TEST CONFIRMATION line to show up, I was over it. I used them as directed, but when I contacted the merchant to ask why the test line might not show up, I was told, "well, you have to hold your thumb over the test window as you use it." This is not, however in the instructions, so I wasted five tests. Now that I know, I have still had trouble with the test line. Basically, you have to use a sterile cup and use them as a dip test. Not exactly what I expected. Skip this product. Buy the Target Store brand tests that work and only cost $4 each. It is worth the extra money for your frustration.
