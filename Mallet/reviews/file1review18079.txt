review/text: After 3 nites of little or no sleep due to lightning storms (this is the downside to a house with a lot of windows out on the prairie), I got online to find a sleep mask! The reviews on this one were good so I gave it a try. I was looking for non-bulky & cupped so my long eyelashes wouldn't rub & feel all smushed. Plus it needed to be adjustable to fit my big ol' noggin (I'm a woman that wears a 7.5 size hat). FOUND IT! The test for darkness control came the nite after receiving my mask in that there was weather forecast of another lightning storm during the nite. Popped on my mask, ahhh sweet darkness! Slept like a log. I had to ask if there WAS a storm even... yes there was. Then just 2 days later, I came home from work with a migraine. Took my meds, popped on my mask, & crawled into bed. Woke up a couple hours later all refreshed. I'm sayin'... I LOVE this mask!
