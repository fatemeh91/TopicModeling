review/text: I've used electric shavers all my life. I've never been comfortable using a blade because I always ended up with more knicks & cuts then it was worth. Part of the problem is that I have a very fine beard, especially in the neck area. This results in a lot of 'scragglers' that were almost impossible to get with an electric razor. But after using this razer since Christmas, I have to admit that I LOVE THIS THING! It's given me a closer shave then I've ever gotten from any other electric razer (and I've tried cheaper Brauns, Norelco's, Panasonic, etc). It picks up the scragglers and leaves everything smooth as silk. The automatic cleaning system also kick @ss. Just put it into the dock and let it do it's thing. 30 minutes later, it comes out fresh and ready to go again. No more hassling with brushes and periodic cleaning. (Hint: To save on the cleaning cartridge, I tend to dock and clean it after every-other shave - it still comes up with "normal" cleaning. There's a higher and lower level of cleaning that it will use depending on how often you dock it.) I have to admit I am spending a little more time shaving then I used to, but I attribute that to me making sure I'm picking up all the 'loose ends' that my previous razers always left behind and taking the time to make the shave as smooth as possible.
