review/text: Well, they work if you remember to fill them and then put them in your pocket. And of course, if you can do that, you probably only need one container to refill every day, not seven marked with the day of the week, unless you have different pills every day of the week and get off on filling them all at once in advance like my hypochondriac father. I just wanted to remember to take my supps three times a day and now only use one of the containers.
