review/text: I don't want to sound so girly here, but I do have a sensitive skin. So whenever I shave, I ended up bleeding all over and it takes time for my face to heal. Darn. I've used this product for about a year now, and definitely has helped my skin calm down and heal better. Maybe it's all in my head, but I religiously use this balm after I shave to protect and heal my skin. Very good product, like it a lot cuz no scent and feels light. But does it have to be so expensive?
