review/text: I've been looking for this oil all over where I live but no luck in my neighborhood and I am surrounded by Big Stores but I am glad I found it here at Amazon.com it arrived very fast, I applied it to my New Butcher Block surface, it was very thirsty and now it looks Great it doesn't have a strong smell just a very tiny slight scent of lemon and it worked fine, next day I could see all the beautiful shades of colors from the Maple wood coming through, now I'm looking for other surfaces to oil!
