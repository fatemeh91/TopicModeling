review/text: While shopping for a manual toothbrush this one was on the rack for 4 bucks and change, not even a dollar more than most of the manual brushes. Since it was Oral B it seemed worth a try. I used a $20 electric tooth brush for a while but went back to manual, couldn't pay $80-$100 for a toothbrush (think about it...) This really cleans my teeth VERY well. Maybe a $100 one works better, but I doubt that it's two times better, and certainly it's not 20 times better.
