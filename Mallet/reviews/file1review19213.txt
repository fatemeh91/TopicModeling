review/text: I started taking it because I heard it helped hair. I have never had hair longer than reaching my collar, even though I've tried everything. I never for 1 minute believed NV would help with losing weight, but I can attest to the fact that my hair is longer and healthier than it's ever been. I have been taking it for 1.5 years now - and only 1 pill per day! My hair is now not quite to the middle of my back. Everytime I go to the salon she remarks about how much healthier my hair is. So, NV does have some sort of redeeming value. At least for me.
