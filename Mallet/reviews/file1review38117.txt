review/text: I have been using the Lavender Sheet and Clothing Spray from the Good Home Company for years and loved it. Recently when I was running low, I ordered 2 more bottles. When I reived them I noticed the bottle design and cap were slightly different but didn't think any more about it. I opened the first of the two yesterday and it was such a disappointment. It barely smells like lavender anymore, instead there is a strong scent that burns my nose and gives me an instant headache. One reviewer pointed out that it (the old formula) was not overly synthetic, but now I guess that is what you would call it. Even my husband noticed it last night when we went to bed and commented that I should go back to what I was using - he was surprised when I told him I had not made any changes - we did, however, have to get up and change the sheets because the scent of the new formulation is horrible. I guess they did something to it to make it cheaper to manufacture - too bad. I will never buy again. Have to search for another alternative.
