review/text: I am a huge fan of Met RX regular chocolate and vanilla protein powders and was so excited to recieve this delicious soundingcake batter protein powder. However, after waiting for more than a week to recieve it and being super excited to try it the product proved to bea huge dissapointment. Well the consistancy was like cake batter the powder did not mix well and was thick, clumpy and dried out dispite adding lots of water the first time and almond milk the second time. Additionally this product tastes nothing like cake batter. I was expecting a delicious childhood memories eliciting flavor but what I got was chalky bland flavor. If you are going to use met rx I would highly suggest sticking to the regular chocolate or vanilla flavors which have great taste and lots of filling protein.
