review/text: After being turned-on to a TheraCane, I found the BodyBackBuddy on Amazon and have to say it's much nicer in many ways. What's not obvious with initial information is that aside from the two arcs being different sizes, the shapes of the knobs on each end are different (more spherical or more pointy) which helps for different levels of healing. The dual knob is AMAZING for working on the neck the extra poles make it easy to simply gain leverage and also tight spots in legs or arms.All-in-all I purchased three of these for myself and two employees and they've basically gone viral due to their simplicity. This is the type of tool that should be at Walgreens and in a few short years many people would have them at home with the great price level available.
