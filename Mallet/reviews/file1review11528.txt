review/text: About a year ago I purchased 16 of those with a duracell brand charger and they worked pretty well for remote controls and kids' toys that mainly makes sounds (i.e. not a huge power drain). The duracells do self-drain a little faster that I expected but I didn't find it a huge hassle.In June 2009 I decide I need another batch so I bought another 16. The new ones are horrible! I charged them 2 weeks before use and I was surprised to find none of them had enough to even power a PS3 remote control. I have a travel size shaver that takes 2 AA's which I use 2 days a week and those new duracells couldn't even last 2 consecutive weeks.I wish someone can tell me I'm doing something wrong to the batteries but chances are they just suck. Numerous cycles of recharge followed by immediate self-drain make me give up on them, now it's more than a hassle to bother using them.
