review/text: If you have bad periods.... this will help tremendously!!!! Plus it really helps give your skin a glow! I used it for years but quit once I got pregnant. My daughter is 3 and I finally got sick of having terrible cramps and mood swings every month so I started back on this! It is a good product! I have only used this brand and one other and they both seemed to do the job equally. This one is a little cheaper and more potent!Good for us girls!
