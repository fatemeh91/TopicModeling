review/text: I tried these "medical" support pantyhose in my search for the perfect pair of support hose to help the venous return problem in one of my legs. I found them to be expensive and a little on the short side. I found them to fit poorly too. After wearing them for about 2 hours, they started to bag around my ankles and knees. I had to go to the restroom and pull them up every two hours try to reduce the bagging. They also didn't hold up better than the Futuro pantyhose I bought and I couldn't tell the difference between the Futuro pantyhose and the Jobst pantyhose when I took them out of the package!!They are fairly sheer, have a slight sheen, more like regular support pantyhose, if you are looking for a pair of pantyhose that offer sheerness without looking like medical grade support hose.
