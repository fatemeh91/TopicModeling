review/text: The Silk Epilator is a nice alternative to waxing because it's a lot cheaper in the long run. Your legs also stay smooth for a while afterwards, just like waxing. Unfortunantely it hurts much more than waxing does. A lot of times I'm tempted to just shave because it hurts a lot. Also, I've been having an excess of ingrown hairs, so after using the epilator, I have to go in with my tweezers and get those too. If you are willing to put up with the pain and the long amount of time it takes to do this, then this product is for you.
