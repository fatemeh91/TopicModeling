review/text: While I agree with some of the previous review's comments about the quality of these bandages, I have to ask the question: What are you expecting for $1.50 per bandage? (Okay, $1.48 per.)These are perfect to fill you office's first aid kit, perfect for a coach's kit bag and perfect for those 1-time use injuries. If you're looking for a bandage that you can use again and again, I'd spend the money and buy a proper bandage. I gave these 'ace type' bandages 4 stars because they work well for a one time use bandage and at a $1.50 a pop, they are cost effective as well.
