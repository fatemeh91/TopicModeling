review/text: Ok, so, the taste and smell is very strong. When you are felling sick at first, this smell really want to make you gag. My girlfriend got a bad stomach flu that resulted in it coming out both ends. I knew it was only a matter of time for me. I went ahead and started this product... no suck luck. I started having the double ended action too. I actually kept that up until I dehydrated my way into the hospital. Maybe that bug was just too much for it. She took nothing and got off better than I did.
