review/text: The only way a home AED can be successful is that if everyone in the home is trained in it's use. I do not think that people will use an AED in place of calling 911, however the AED doesn't perform CPR, rescue breathing, or relieve foreign body airway obstruction (choking).You wouldn't by a car without knowing how to drive? Same with an AED. Training for all emergencies should be the goal and the AED is an adjunct to reaching that goal, an AED by itself is a good idea but not a solution to a safety problem.There are many courses and programs out there, EMS Safety Services, ASHI, Medic First Aid, National Safety Council, the American Red Cross and American Heart Association all offer courses nationally. If you're going to buy this product, get trained in AED, CPR, and First Aid and make plans to manage all home emergencies (not just cardiac arrest).
