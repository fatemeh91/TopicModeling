review/text: I have the elasto gel eye thing, 4" roll and the foot wrap.. All are great. The cervical neck thing is crap. It has a cotton cover unlike the others and barely gets cold even after you lay it on yourself for a while and it's not comfortable with the elastic attached. Don't buy! I wish I could return it. Try the cervical by chattooga col pac, I have two I luv.
