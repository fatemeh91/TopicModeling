review/text: What a great tub! I was getting so frustrated with those plastic tubs...they were so hard and uncomfortable for my baby. A friend told me about this tub, and as soon as my daughter could sit up on her own, I bought it! She has so much fun in it, and I'm not as stressed out during bath time! The fact that it is inflatable is so nice, because one time she teetered over a little and did not get hurt because of the nice, soft sides! It is also so easy to clean and store as well (it has a suction cup on it so it attaches very nicely to the back wall of the shower). I also like that the bottom isn't too slippery.
