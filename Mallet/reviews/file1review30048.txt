review/text: My co-worker introduced me to this product and the first place I look for good pricing is Amazon. This tea really does what it says. Always take this tea with food as it basically speeds up your digestion process so if you have an empty stomach you will end up with some pretty intense stomach cramps. It is rather gentle since it has a mild laxative in it. Usually sends the "feeling" about 30-45 minutes after consumtion. I drank about 2-3 a day and while it doesn't just shed pounds it helps maintain weight or lose a bit all by itself. Combined with a good diet and excerise and you will for sure lose weight and get healthy. It doesn't have a bad taste but I chose to just gulp it down. Not one for sipping this tea. All in all a fantastic product.
