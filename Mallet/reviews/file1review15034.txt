review/text: I smoke 1.5 to 2 pack a day for 14 years. (since i was 16 - now I am 30.)Im a cheap and got 4 free patches from a buddy (2 of my buddies quit using these patches too)- Transdermal brand. So instead of going on the 6 week program I went on my own 4 day program with these patches. I had 1- 21mg and 3-14mg patches.It really works. what I did was for the first 2 weeks I hid from everyone i knew who smoked. I know that sounds drastic, but its true and it worked for me. I told myself, do not replace this habit with any other habits (ie. chew gum or eat candy). So I just stayed home and became a hermit for a couple weeks. after the 3rd week the urges have subsided and it has gotten alot easier. i am in the end of 6th week and to be honest I dont have a urge for a cig anymore. In fact I can even watch other my buddies smoke and its no biggie.These patches do work, but it also has to do with will power! Just remember it gets easier after week 3++.About the patches it self, the bad thing is that it does not stick onto your body for a full 24 hour period. i used tape to hold it down after the 10th to 12 hour.Good luck!
