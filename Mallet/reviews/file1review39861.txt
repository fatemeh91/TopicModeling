review/text: When I saw the tv ads for the Gopher I knew it was just what I needed and my husband ordered the deluxe set for me. I used them constantly to reach and grab things as I have a herniated disk in my lower back and am not supposed to bend over or reach above my head. I gave one to my grandfather and used the other one until the cable snapped about a year later(the locking mechanism broke first). Just like others have shared here, this product is not able to pick up 5 lbs. and the suction cups are always coming unscrewed. We replaced both (so I can have one upstairs and down), only buying 1 Gopher. I recently accidentally stepped on the Gopher and broke one of the suction cups and am disappointed there is no replacement part available. I will try gluing it back on as I don't feel like investing in another one at this time or buying another EZ Reacher by Arcoa(at $20) since they are not as convenient. I bought the EZ Reacher from the local hardware store when I couldn't find any Gophers and I liked it's heavy-duty capability. The suction cups are bolted on and there is no inner cable that can break. However, it does not have a locking mechanism and can't be folded. Finally, it would be nice for such a useful tool as the Gopher (or any of its counterparts) to be better designed and more reliable, but I guess that's asking too much of a "bargain" tool.
