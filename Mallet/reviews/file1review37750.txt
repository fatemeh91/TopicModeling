review/text: I love this product. It takes time for it to build up and have lasting effects but the time was well worth it for me. I was on proton pump inhibitors that were causing many other health issues and now most of those issues are gone. I can go between 3 and 6 months without taking anything other than an occasional Tums. Hearburn Free really works for me. Thank you.Heartburn Free with ROH10 10 Softgels
