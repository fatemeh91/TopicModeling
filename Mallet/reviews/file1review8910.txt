review/text: Our entire family has been using this product for well over a year and we love it. It definitely doesn't taste good, but we just mix it with flavored powders (like Crystal Light) and then it becomes tolerable. It truly does boost your immune system. I had one cold in the last 12 months and it only lasted a few days. If you're a family on the go and you don't always get your full daily recommended dose of fruits and vegetables, this is the ideal way to get your daily dose. It also has a ton of other beneficial nutrients. My husband is a health nut and does all the research for me, and so far, this product is worth every penny. Do your research and you'll come back to this product :)
