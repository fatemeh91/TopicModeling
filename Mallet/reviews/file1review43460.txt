review/text: I purchased this item to monitor my blood pressure easily rather that using my medical blood pressure monitor. (Incidentally, I am a physician.) When comparing the automatic blood monitor measurements with my medical monitor I noted a 8-10 mm lower diastolic pressure (the smaller number) in the automatic unit. I contacted the mfg. and they promptly replaced it with one that is accurate and consistent with my medical blood pressure unit. My recommendation is that if you purchase this unit, make sure it is accurate by having your blood pressure checked by your physician's office and comparing it to the automatic unit to insure its accuracy.
