review/text: One of my Chiropractic patients LOVED these inserts and since I am always on the search of an inexpensive alternative for my patients for shoe orthotics I was excited to buy these. OMG, the immediate pain even using the lowest adapter was crippling! I made an effort to adapt to them too. I even tried removing the arch supports and replacing them with cut-out cardboard hoping I would slowly adapt and be able to eventually use the lowest of the three arches supplied. No joy.But it is probably me because every orthotic I have ever tried have hurt my feet. I believe there are those of us who just cannot use any orthotic and I am one of those folks. I don't have flat feet but my shoe size has increased by 1 or 2 sizes and width over the past 30 of my 60 years so I know that my arches have fallen and I need support...just not these.On the bright side, these are very well made and since they are "arched" and not "flat" like some solid orthotics they "hover" over the shoe's built-in arch. This is exactly what you need to use arch supports in shoes that do not have removable arch inserts like dress shoes because otherwise you will end up with too high an arch prescription. Also the price is right; good general purpose orthotics can be much more expensive. Also the fact that they come with 3 heights is terrific: my patient I mentioned found the middle height to be better for him and said that he felt immediate comfort and better stamina due to the better support. I sure hope you are in the majority who can adapt to them.
