review/text: I got this mat to practice prenatal yoga at home, it was fine for that purpose for the months I used it while I was pregnant. Recently I started using the mat again for a power yoga class at my gym, it didnt take long for me to realize how terrible this mat really is. On my carpet at home I didnt notice how thin the mat is but on the hard gym floor it barely feels like there is anything under me. Apparently the sticky wore off during my prenatal practice because now my hands slip so badly downward dog is impossible to hold for more then a few seconds. I had to stop using the mat because it is completely ineffective and could actually cause harm because I slip so badly on it. It was fine for about 4 months at home, the block and strap are fine, the bag is pretty ugly, but it works for storage. I would never recommend this item.
