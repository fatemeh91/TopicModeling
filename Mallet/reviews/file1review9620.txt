review/text: Seems when they ship these, they all have melted, the 'cookie' part has sank down to one side of the bar, and you wonder if they know that you can't store these in a 130 degree warehouse.Overall you buy these for something to eat when you want protein/carbs due to training. You can get that from these, but don't expect great taste. If the whole bar was covered like it was supposed to be, then these would be great. Otherwise 1/5th of the bar is good, the rest is dry and chalky.Eat them if you have too, but otherwise look for something else.
