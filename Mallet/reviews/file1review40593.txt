review/text: There are many so/so reviews for this product, however, we have used it and have found it works great. First off, we have soft water so we only fill one cup, otherwise, suds will leak out from the dishwasher. Second, when we load the dishwasher we make sure the dishes are rinsed off well. The result is perfectly clean dishes every time, and we don't get that chlorine odor in our house from regular commercial dishwasher detergents. Great product!!
