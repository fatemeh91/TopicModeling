review/text: Just buy this online. It's almost impossible to find these replacement heads in regular stores like Target, etc...Makes a great shaver even better. If it's been a year since you replaced your blades, or if you have no idea how long it's been, try these.Also, forget about the Nivea gel packs that come with this shaver. Regular shaving cream works just fine.
