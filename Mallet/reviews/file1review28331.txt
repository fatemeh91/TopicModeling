review/text: For the past 4 years, I have purchased the Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard protein powered. Why? Because it is an excellent deal -- approximately 85-90$ -- it lasts for months and taste excellent when mixed with fruits and honey. I mainly use this product for morning meals and after-workout shakes and find that it is very filling and great for replacing a meal at night or a quick breakfast on the go. I highly recommend this product.
