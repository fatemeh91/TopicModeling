review/text: Having a home defibrillator is great for those who can afford it, especially dentist offices (often heart attacks can cause tooth/jaw pain), and residences with seniors. Last I checked, chances of survival following cardiac arrest drop approximately 10% per minute without treatment. Unlike cpr, defibrillators don't just keep the blood oxygenated and circulating but can actually bring the heart back into a normal sinus rhythm.
