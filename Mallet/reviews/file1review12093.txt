review/text: Ever since I was a little girl, I thought that my mother had the most beautiful hands. I thought, when I grow up, my hands will look just like hers and I'll be a woman. But I never got my mother's hands. Even in my 20's, My fingers were chubby, my nails were always stubby, thin, peeling and ugly, not like her effortlessly beautiful, long, thick nails on long delicate fingers. Then I got on Pinterest... and my desire for better nails became stronger. I decided to start taking a prenatal vitamin because pregnant women are always raving about what they do for them. I decided on this one because of the high rating and the fact that you only have to take one a day. I have been taking them for about two months and my nails are longer and stronger than they've ever been. I had a nail that split down the middle habitually. No matter how careful I was or how short I kept the nail, it would always split, often painfully. Well now I've had to get used to doing things with that nail long! Never thought I'd be doing that! In addition, my hair is growing a lot faster than usual! My fingers are still chubby, but now my hands are almost as pretty as Mom's since I can grow out my nails. I also use Nail Envy religiously.Note: I didn't notice a metallic taste, just the normal "vitamin" taste. They are the same size as your standard adult daily vitamin, and no stomach aches here, except that I think they have made me more "regular"!
