review/text: The Clif-Z bars offer a more nutritious and organic alternative to the typical grocery store granola bars. Check out the ingredients: (for the chocolate brownie) 120 Cal, 3g Fat, 3g Protein, 3g Fiber, 35% Vit C, 30% Calcium, 10-30% of the B vitamins, and more. I really like the chocolate and peanut butter, but haven't tried the caramel apple. Most nutrition bars for adults are much higher calorie (and higher price!). This is my favorite lower-calorie snack bar that tastes good and is full of healthy ingredients. It helps me make the most of my calories!!
