review/text: I have to say this toilet seat is really the best. We used this from the beginning while toilet training our son who is 2 and a half. The grandparents purchased another version for their house. Their seat has rubber grippers that don't hold the seat in place, side handles that don't serve much purpose, and the lip in the front is way too shallow! The Baby Bjorn has adjustable wings that grab the toilet seat so it won't slip around. The raised portion in the front is raised high enough, unlike the other seats. It is a bit more expensive, but we got one for every toilet in the house. It hangs easily on a hook and is easy to clean.
