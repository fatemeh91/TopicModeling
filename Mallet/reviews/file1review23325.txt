review/text: I read the previous reviews about this sweeper and with trepidation bought it anyway. Most of the complaints were about the handle coming apart. When the sweeper arrives the handle is in separate pieces with tapered ends. Logic would indicate that tapping the pieces together would keep it together, so I used my wooden meat tenderizer from the kitchen to do the job, and the handle is now as solid as can be. Obviously the people that were stupid enough to not do that were the same ones expecting this thing to work like a vacuum cleaner. It is not a vacuum cleaner, and was never designed as one. However, this sweeper works way better than I expected. I have been using it almost everyday on both my kitchen rug and the hardwood floors throughout my house. It does not do as well on the hardwood floors, but still picks up enough to make a visible difference. On the rugs it works the best, and has broadened the frequency of busting out the vacuum cleaner. It is quiet, light and efficient, and I regret not getting one long ago.
