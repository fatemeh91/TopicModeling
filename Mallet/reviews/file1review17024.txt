review/text: After about two years, the battery on this thing is completely shot, which makes the whole thing useless. Even when plugged in, I have to turn it off, wait a few minutes, then I get about 20 seconds of trimming before I have to repeat the process. It's been getting worse and worse, and today it finally got to the point where it's no longer able to do its job and is garbage.This would be a 4-5 star product if they had decided to use a battery that wouldn't make the product worthless after just two years. You get what you pay for.
