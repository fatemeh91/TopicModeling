review/text: Pros:The massage functions works great, there are so many different setting for the massage and it has a battery.Cons: Not eneough material to cover the motor esp the bottom seat of the chair, I felt like I was sitting on the motors and really its not comfortable, therefore added an extra cushion on the buttom and it helped.
