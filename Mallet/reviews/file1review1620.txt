review/text: I had purchased my wart stick at a liquidators store so I didn't know what I was really getting. I had a painful wart on the ball of my foot which I had been trying to remove for some time with various methods. I used the stick and the wart was gone in a very short time. I was impressed. It was gone for a year and now it is back and I started using the wart stick again and than misplaced the stick. I just found it in my medicine cabinet. I am bookmarking this item on my computer. I want to know that I can always have this item if I need it. It really works and fast!!!!!!!!!!
