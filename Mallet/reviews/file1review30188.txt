review/text: My desk I purchased didn't come with one, and was very unsightly. This was the perfect product to cover that hole and make it less conspicuous. Unfortunately the hole was slightly bigger than the grommet fitting, which I added double stick tape around the grommet fitting which made it fit perfectly and stay in place.
