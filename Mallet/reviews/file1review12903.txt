review/text: I purchased these to help clear up a stye I had on my eyelid. I tried other warming masks, but most would cool down very quickly, and were very inconvenient. The Elasto Gel mask stays warm for much longer, and is very pleasant. I have since used it when I had some sinus problems, and they really helped make my sinus headache go away. I highly recommend it.
