review/text: I use the screen to magnify my computer screen. When the agency I work for changed to a smaller font to 'squeeze' more onto the screen, my eyes were constantly tired. They burned and itched, and by the end of the week, I just wanted to keep them closed all weekend. The very first day I used the magnifying screen I could tell the difference. It was like a big relief....no more burning, itchy eyes. I wouldn't be without it at work and would recommend it to anyone!! Loree Halvorson
