review/text: I used a Wahl 7040-614 Custom Shave 5000 for several years and never had any problems with it pulling my whiskers. Wahl has discontinued that model. I have tried 3 different Wahl models that are now in production and they ALL pull. I never know when it is going to do it but it pulls about every other time I used it. I sent one back to Amazon and got a refund and took one back to a dealer. I am getting tired of sending them back so I will just put this one in a drawer and leave it there. I am now using a Gillette safety razor. I think it is called the Mach3. It dose a great job and I will continue to use it. I will not buy another Wahl unless I can find the older "Custom Shave 5000"
