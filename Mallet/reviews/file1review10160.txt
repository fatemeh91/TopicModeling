review/text: I mix Met-Rx Plus with regular flavored rice milk in my blender and pour it on my cereal with if I can get them, fresh red currants and rasberries. I like this product because it also gives me a great amount of calcium.Since red meat is said to be a good source of protein, I don't have to eat so much meat to get the protein for my weight training workouts. I also have the chocolate powder for my evening meals. Except fo the hassle of washing my blender twice a day, I think I'll continue drinking Met-Rx.
