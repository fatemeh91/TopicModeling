review/text: Works as advertised. No stinky pits. I'm 6'0 195lbs and sweat as much as your average person. You may need to use it twice on workout days or if you plan to be standing outside in the heat sweating for hours. But normal usage for me is once in the morning and it lasts all day. The only problem is it's kind of expensive on Amazon compared to one of the local retailers in Tucson that used to carry this for half the price. But I'd rather stick with this brand than some of the others that major retailers carry. One stick can easily last a year as long as you don't drop it. If you do drop it, the crystal will become jagged and it's not fun to apply it after.
