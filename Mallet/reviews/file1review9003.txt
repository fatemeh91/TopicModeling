review/text: It's not bad, I kinda been getting use to it. I mix it w/Sunny D smooth instead; it doesn't seem to mix real well b/c it's a very light-weight powder. I've tried both whisking and using a spoon but it doesn't all seem to blend very well. I will say I have noticed a difference in less aches and pains that I've been having now being in my 50's. I usually drink it first thing in the morning b/f breakfast.
