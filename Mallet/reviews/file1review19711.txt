review/text: I originally bought the arm and hammer seat, because it was less expensive, however it did not fit on our toilet. This potty seat fits on all the toilets in our house, and will be fantastic to bring with us on trips if we have to, because we won't have to worry about it fitting (since it has a dial in the back that expands to fit just about any toilet seat). Definitely worth money. I wish I would have just paid the money from the beginning instead of going the cheaper route, but you live and you learn!
