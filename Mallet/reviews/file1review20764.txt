review/text: I am really satisfied with this shaver...i bought the more pricey model a few months ago...i think it is the Braun 8595...no reason to spend the extra money...i bought the 8585 for my weekend home and it does exactly the same job...the 8995 have an lcd display that tell you when to clean but i ignore it anyways...both leave a little hair on the neck but i simply follow with a few strokes of a dry razor after shaving with the braun and all is good...it is a much faster and cleam way to shave...no hair on the countertop...no running out of shaving cream and razors...less irritation...cordless...simply replace the cartridge every few months and you are good to go...i do not clean every time i use it...a little noisy, so i clean in the morning...the cleaning cycle takes about 30 minutes...buy it...you won't regret it
