review/text: After using many many heating pads over the years, in which the plastic "smooshed" and cracked & with covers that fell off and were not soft I found the Thermaphore heating pad which is absolutely wonderful! The heating pad itself is not made with plastic on the outside, but a canvas like cloth which is very durable and conforms to your body! The outside cover is a very soft, thick fabric! What a difference it makes to have something soft and cozy next to your skin... I love having the control of the on/ off hand held switch. My back and shoulders feel much better after a 20 minute treatment. I purchased two more for my parents! They have his and her's heating pads. I think the hand held switch is a great idea for anyone who might fall asleep when using a heating pad.
