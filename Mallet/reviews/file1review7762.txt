review/text: I bought this brush over a month ago and have been using it every day since. It goes through the dishwasher every time it is run and still looks as good as new. The shape of the head allows it to reach into corners really well. I do wish the bristles were slightly stiffer so they would grip stainless steel pads better. All in all it does its job really well and is very comfortable to use.Update. After using the brush for another month I have come to appreciate the scraper feature. It does a great job of cleaning without damaging non-stick surfaces. It is also effective for gripping a stainless steel pad (overcoming my previous) reservation. The brush still looks new despite constant use.
