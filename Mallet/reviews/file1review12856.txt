review/text: I suffer from ragweed here in good ole Tennessee...My ENT has told me to move to FL. and I am working on that but untill then , I do rely on THIS MASK and my Alergist and my ENT. I use the mask warm when I need to open my sinuses up , conjestion is no fun...When anyone has a headache in our home, they use it cold...after the cooling stops, just haveing the dark helps relax you and keeps you resting without any light leaking like a typical mask.This is my second one to buy because I want my OWN - you will LOVE this mask...My husband has everything this company makes because of neck and back surgerys, he rates ELAST products 5 stars also...If you know anyone with migrane problems, buy them one of these masks as a surprise, Christmas - I know for sure it works - I have had 2 sinus surgarys and WISH I would have had this mask , was a few years ago and do not know if they made them but my pain would have been decreased no dought !!! Sinus surgey hurt more than having my twin daughters x 10 - know anyone going in for sinus surgary, spend $16 bucks to ease them through the pain, they will love you for life ~!
