review/text: This chair is perfect for a relaxing massage. The massage is deep & effective. I was happily surprised as to its quality & attractiveness.I would wholeheartedly give this chair 5 stars where it not for two small complaints:1) It does not quite get to lower (20%) of my back.2) You can't realy sit on this chair without a massage, because the rolling balls that give you the massage park themselves on top of the chair just below the neck area.
