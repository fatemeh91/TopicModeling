review/text: I bought one package of these and one package of the Medela washables so I could see which one I liked better. I've been happy with the Avent, happy enough that I bought another package. The feature that I was most pleased with is that they barely show, especially compared to the Medela, which look very lumpy.I've also used the Avent disposables (free sample) and liked them fine, but as someone who is using cloth diapers and wipes, there was no way I was going to use disposable pads on a regular basis.
