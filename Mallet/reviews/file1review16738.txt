review/text: Due to some strange combination of genetics and ethnicity, I've been shaving since junior high, i.e., about 34 years now, and it goes without saying that it's become a chore. Occasionally, depending on my schedule, my Mediterranean swarth (I'm half Italian) requires a twice-daily pruning, which holds about the same appeal for me as listening to those &quot;American Idol&quot; kids' endearingly bad grabs for the brass ring. While Gillette's shaving gel can't do anything about reversing my hirsuteness, it does make shaving a whole lot easier to take (I'll stop short of using the term &quot;enjoyable&quot;). A very small dollop of this stuff produces much more foam than needed and it goes on easy, conditions and lubricates the skin, and smells great. I've tried about every shaving product out there, both foam and gel, and this one is as dependable as the tides. Highly and unqualifyingly recommended.
