review/text: I like Amazon because I like to read the reviews and this product seemed to have glowing reviews. I have many foods that I cannot eat, including dairy and I was hoping that adding enzymes would solve the problem. I took these one pill a day for a whole week, WITHOUT changing me diet to see how my body reacted. I was running to the bathroom everyday. I stopped taking the pills and I was back to normal. These pills made me sicker than if I had eaten my "problem" foods. I understand everyone is different but I was extremely disappointed.
