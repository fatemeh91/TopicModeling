review/text: I love the firmness to it, it's still slightly bendable but not floppy like some dildo's out there. The rabbit does its job wonderfully and I like the vibration speeds and the motion. Kinda noisy when you use the circular motion side but if you use just the vibration side you can barely hear it. Definitely a plus there.
