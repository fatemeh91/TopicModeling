review/text: Heat these in the microwave and have them set out where you are going to sit watching TV while you moisturize your hands after a paraffin dip.After dipping your hands, you can then place them in a plastic liner or plastic bags work well too. Then, place your hands into these mitts.Your moisturizing results will double when you continue to heat the paraffin on your hands. Spas tend to use electrically heated mitts, but these don't need to be plugged in and are also calming and aromatic because of the herbal mixture inside the gloves.~The Rebecca Review
