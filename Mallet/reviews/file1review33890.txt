review/text: This is a great stethoscope and I can hear very well on it maybe even better than the Littman I once owned but this is heavy. It says its light weight but its not. The first day that I took it to work all the nurses wanted to look at it and everyone said the exact same thing. So if you want a good stethoscope and don't care about its weight then this is perfect.
