review/text: I notice that I'm not as tired when I take these multi vitamins. We are trying to conceive so hopefully these will set the stage. The only thing I don't like is the smell of them -- it's personal preference -- but they started smelling like Flinstones vitamins to me after a while and I hate the smell of those things. LOL. I just swallow them quickly every morning and have no issues.
