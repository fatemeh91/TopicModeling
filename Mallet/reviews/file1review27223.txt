review/text: I've been using protein supplements for over ten years. There are a variety of factors that determine the price of protein powders, the two most important of which are quality of the protein and taste. For the most part, you get what you pay for. Cheap protein isn't very high quality and often tastes like chalk. Really expensive protein is high quality and tastes good, but you're often paying for advertising. Optimum Nutrition is a solid quality product - not the most pure, but very good (and I'm not convinced there is a big difference between moderate range and elite range proteins). So, the quality is very good, but on top of that, the Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey line is one of my favorite tasting protein powders I have ever used. I have tried most of the flavors, and they are all above average; Most I would rate 4 to 5 stars (you can buy a package with a single serving of about 15 different flavors - I got mine from Bodybuilding.com). For the price, this is by far my favorite protein company. I go through one five-pound jug every two months. I recommend it to all of my friends. My favorite flavor is Extreme Milk Chocolate (5/5 stars). It is fantastic with just milk, and I like to make shakes with it in the blender using ice, milk, bananas and peanut butter. It has been one of the best selling supplements on Bodybuilding.com for years for a reason. Try it, and you won't be disappointed.
