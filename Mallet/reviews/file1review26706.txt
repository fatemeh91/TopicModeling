review/text: I started out drinking Muscle Milk Light Vanilla Creme. I really liked the taste, but didn't want all of the &#34;extra&#34; ingredients they include. I just wanted plain protein.After reading reviews of Optimal Nutrition (ON), I gave the ON vanilla ice cream a try. I mixed it in milk, and there was very little added taste to the milk. It tasted like I was drinking plain milk.I gave French Vanilla Creme a try next, and found that it has a little more vanilla flavor. I prefer it over the ON vanilla ice cream. However, still not as good of a flavor as the Muscle Milk.With my weight training, the ON protein has helped me to add lean muscle. Plus, I don't find myself hungry later, and end up eating all kinds of junk.By the way, the cost per serving is less with the ON. So, that's what I'm sticking with for now.
