review/text: I take meds twice a day and this product is quite handy. I no longer forget what meds I've taken on a given day. I simply load up a week's worth in the multiple containers. This product would not be useful in my opinion if you need to take meds more than twice a day or if you take a significant number of meds and/or the tablet sizes are very large - if this is the case for you, you will have a challenge.Each container has a partition dividing it into two parts and each part is not particularly large. One solution might be to just get two sets of containers as this product is not all that expensive. Also, the containers are easy to open upside down and then all the meds get mixed together.
