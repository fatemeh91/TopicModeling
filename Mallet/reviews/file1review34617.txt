review/text: This is the only floss I use. I don't like mint (haven't been able to find it in not-mint); so, I learned to like mint and now it doesn't bother me. It is "sweet" tasting. It's wide and soft without being bulky. It rarely shreds and doesn't hurt my gums like the cheap ones. It's not cheap; but, my dental health is worth every penny!
