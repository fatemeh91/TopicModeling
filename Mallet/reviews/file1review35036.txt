review/text: I use the spray for my pets, particularly 1 cat who is highly temperamental and stresses out very easily. It is nothing for us to breath in her general direction and she starts growing. My vet has given up on her and will not even see her unless she is drugged. Then I heard about this spray and figured I had nothing to lose, within the first 30 minutes this demon cat had completely calmed down to the point that one of my others cats could touch her and she did not start screaming or even growling. This stuff is gold, I love it because it is natural, and does not drug my cat but it does calm her down. She is actually a very sweet cat when she is calm, which is most of the time with Rescue Remedy.
