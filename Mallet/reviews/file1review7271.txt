review/text: The only foot bath out there that actually heats the water and keeps it hot! Nice large capacity also, the others we have tried were not big enough for my husband's feet, and he has a normal man sized foot. The jets are nothing special, but I imagine you would have to have a much larger and noisier motor to have jets that generated enough pressure to actually massage your foot. We also like the handles that enable you to handle it to empty it when you are done, one the others over look that make them very cumbersome to deal with once you add water.We added water to the fill line before putting our feet in and found it overflowed once we turned iton, so be sure to have your feet inside before adding to the fill line. I also wish there was a way to turn the jets off and just use the heat, you can turn the heat off but you can't run it without the jets on.We have been using it consistently for two months now and it is still working fine.Overall we are happy with our purchase!
