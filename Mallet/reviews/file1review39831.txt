review/text: I ACTUALLY LOVED THIS WHEN I FIRST GOT IT. THE LOCKING FEATURE WAS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE.I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS, AT THE END OF FEB. IT FELL APART. THE SUCTION CUPS FELL OF AND THE SCREWS WENT FLYING - COULDN'T FIND THEM. I TRIED SUPER GLUING THE PCS BACK TOGETHER - NO HELP. I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE IN MAY OF THIS YEAR AT WALGREENS AND A MONTH LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THAT ONE. THEY NEED TO BE MADE STRONGER!!!!!!! PLEASE REDESIGN AND TRY AGAIN.THANKS,VIRGINIA SALTER
