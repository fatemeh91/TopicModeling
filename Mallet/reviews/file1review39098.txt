review/text: I don't remember how much I paid for this clipper on Amazon but I've had no haircut at a barber since I bought this 4-6 months ago. it comes with everything you need! I've been getting several compliments on my new haircuts since I've started cutting/clipping my hair. It became a lot easier to cut my own hair after the second time. I learned how to shave my head to a fohawk and I got more compliments on it than when I had it done at a barber...It works for me! I highly recommend this to everyone! Cut you own hair and save $20-30 every time you need a hair cut. It only takes 30 minutes!
