review/text: Hands down the best solution I've found to having a baby/toddler crawl into bed with you. Protects against pee accidents, leaking breastmilk after having a baby, and baby spit up in the night. Best part is that it sits on top of the sheets so you don't soil the sheets each night when the baby sleeps with you.I know I read in other reviews that when it arrives it says, "not for use with children under 12 yrs. old." It does not explain why, but I'm guessing it's overly cautious b/c of1) it being vinyl underneath and hence is not an organic material & has associated odors when you first use it.2) b/c it's vinyl, it can get warm, even make you sweat if you don't have AC in the summer, and I guess you don't want to overheat kids (but it has a cool cotton quilted top that is very natural feeling & soft)3) it doesn't "seal" to the mattress or tuck underneath and is made to go on top of the sheets, so it potentially could get scrunched up and I GUESS obstruct breathing in a baby. I'm just guessing on these 3 possible reasons for the warning.Now I am pretty environmentally friendly and super concerned with toxins with my children, but after 2 boys who coslept with us and multiple "accidents" on our mattresses that would seep through other protectors/towels (not to mention the sheets on top)...I was ready to leap at a new approach while expecting baby #3.I know it's not intended for cosleeping with babies, but let's face it...a lot of us do it...and this certainly works! The best part is that I just purchased 2 of them (despite the cost) and that was a wonderful choice. When baby soaks it for some reason, I can just pull out the other one and lay it down right on top of the sheets. No late night soaked sheets! They dry super in the dryer and I've used them nightly for 6 months now.
