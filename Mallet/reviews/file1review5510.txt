review/text: After having been trained as an Emergency Medical Technician in 1984 I have had numerous occasions to provide medical assistance to injured persons. Step one is check for a response. Step two is insure adequate breathing. In most cases step two requires contact with bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood and/or vomitous. Since the discovery of AIDS you would have to be a fool to provide mouth to mouth resuscitation without the protection provided by a 'mask'. If you know CPR, and you should, you need a mask. It is of no use unless it is with you. This seems to be a good one at a good price. Don't be without one!
