review/text: This product far exceed my expectations. I bought it for skiing and at the end of the day my 'bad' knee was in better shape than my good knee. Guess I'll need to get a second one. When I made this purchase, I was hoping for something that provided enough support so that I would be able to get some skiing in and have manageable pain afterwords. What I got was a full day of skiing and no knee pain in the braced knee.
