review/text: As the other reviewer mentioned, it does have more of a coconut smell than the other 2 I bought, but it has an off taste to it that the others do not. Reading about coconut oils, someone mentioned the gag factor. I had no idea what they were referring to until I tasted this. NOW's a good name, but they fell short here. You'd be better off with Jarrow or Nutiva, similar price, better taste...
