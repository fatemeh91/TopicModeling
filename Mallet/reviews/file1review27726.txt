review/text: It's not a pure WPI, but dollar for dollar, it is one of the better Whey Protein Concentrates (with WPI mixed in) that you can get, it is a consistent formula with good quality control, and it comes in a huge bag. This reliable, affordable averageness is how Optimum staked their claim and many customers are happy with that. If you're buying designer, pure 100% WPI whey, maybe you take yourself too seriously and you ought to eat better food anyway.This does have sucralose but it is gluten-free, and it also has very low lactose. I am pretty lactose intolerant and this whey has never caused me serious issues. The amino acid profile is just plain excellent.The flavors are ok. Like the 100% WPI person above, if you care too much about the flavor of whey supplements, maybe you should check your head and go eat some pudding or something instead.
