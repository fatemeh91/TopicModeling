review/text: These replacement blades work very well.I've had a Norelco cool skin shaver for about three years and I've just now got around to changing the blades mostly because I couldn't find them anywhere.Don't even try to find HQ177 replacements at traditional retail outlets such as Wal-Mart or Target because you won't find them there.Just order them here.
