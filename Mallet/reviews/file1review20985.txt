review/text: We have had our Jeanie Rub for about 3 years, and don't know how we lived without it all these years! It has a large, soft bottom and variable speed. It's heavy to hold, but helps apply additional pressure on the back or any other body part (except the head) you want to use it on. We use it at highest speed with a lot of pressure, generally in the upper back area, for about 5 minutes, then stretch each other's back and can usually pressure the spine into place the way a chiropractor does--although we do not recommend it for others, if you don't know what you're doing! Note than the more pressure you apply to the Jeanie Rub, the lower the speed gets; however, it doesn't reduce the effectiveness, the motor doesn't get hot, and this has been an extremely reliable product. The price (about $180 at the time) was a steal. We don't remember the vendor, but do recall that we found him/her to be most reliable. We wouldn't hesitate to get another if/when this wears out, and from the same vendor.
