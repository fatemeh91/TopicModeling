review/text: I bought this because I read that sulfur would help break up keratin (I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms). After daily use for about 3 weeks I have yet to notice any difference. It may be that it takes longer, but most of the people here that said that they noticed a difference noticed it by this point. It also hasn't done anything for the various other pimples I have.It's not terrible, but for me, it doesn't do anything that a $0.50 bar of soap already does. I'll be looking for a keratosis treatment elsewhere.
