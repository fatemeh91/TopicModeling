review/text: I've read reviews saying Butter Cream Toffee is the best flavor, and also the worst flavor, but after actually trying it, I am a fan. I've gone through 5lbs of this stuff no problem, and will probably be ordering more soon.Performance-wise: I drink it directly after both cardio and lifting. I've definitely noticed improvement in my recovery time as well as strength-increase.Taste-wise: I would describe it as a sweet cookie-dough kind of flavor. It's much better with just water (a little more than the suggested 5oz). I also tried it with soy milk, but it came out much too thick and tasteless for my liking.You will also need a shaker bottle for this--it will give you a better result than even a blender. So, if you don't have one, don't forget to pick it up with the whey.
