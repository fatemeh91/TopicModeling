review/text: I too am like some of the other reviewers who were regular before taking this product. If you are regular, PLEASE re-consider before purchasing. I have been taking Fertilaid for about 2 and a half months now and stopped taking it two weeks ago after reading all of the other negative reviews. Today my doctor confirmed that I did not ovulate this month, and I truly feel that this is due to the Fertilaid. I am hopeful that my cycle will return to normal very soon. Good luck to all of you on the TTC journey!
