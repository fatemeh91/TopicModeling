review/text: So often, I order some grooming product and find out that it's just not what I wanted it to be. It's quality stuff that does the job, but it's lacking something. Star power, luxuriousness, whatever. The Art of Shaving after shave is everything I want it to be. I am satisfied in every way you can be with a hygiene product.It's rich, thick, and creamy. It makes my face feel soft and smooth after every shave. I'm usually sensitive to anything that's not oil free, but this hasn't made me break out at all.The smell deserves its own paragraph. I've stopped wearing cologne. The smell is a little strong in the beginning, but it stays with you at reasonable levels throughout the day. Someone has to hug you to notice, but when they do, they hang on for a minute.I ordered the travel size because I don't want to be without it. That's where I'm at with this stuff.
