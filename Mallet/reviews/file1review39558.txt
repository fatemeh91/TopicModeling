review/text: I used the Skintimate shaving Gel and was very happy with it. I also gave it to my two teenage daughters to try. It was easy to use, didn't irritate the skin, and made the job easy -- even my two ""beginners"" managed the job without knicks or cuts. It worked better than many other similar products we've tried.
