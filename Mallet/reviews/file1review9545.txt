review/text: I actually use this everyday, for 2 years now, as my face cream. Add some Kiss My Face SPF and you are good to go. I have switched over to other day creams but always come back to this one. It absorbs so well and I just feel like it keeps my skin hydrated all day long. Does not smell and does not sting. Not tested on animals and no nasty animal by products. I highly recommend this.
