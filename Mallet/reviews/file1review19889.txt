review/text: This toilet seat has been great for our toddler boy. The way it adjusts to fit different size toilet seats is very nice as we have taken it with us to grandparent's houses and so on. It isn't really small so I would not consider it very portable, but it we do take it traveling in a zippered canvas tote along with a Kikkerland folding step stool. It is very simple, basic, and easy to clean.Our son started potty learning on the bjorn standalone potty chair, and then at around age two we started using this toilet trainer. He liked it right away and hasn't made a mess - perhaps because he started on the pottychair first. He still uses both - it is nice to be able to offer him a choice. It might sound silly - but to a toddler those choices make things easier sometimes. So we say, do you want to use the "big toilet seat" or the "little blue potty" and he likes to get to choose.It is a bit pricey, but I wouldn't change a thing about the design so I am very happy with the purchase.
