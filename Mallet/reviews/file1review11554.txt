review/text: The Duracell 2650mAh batteries surprised me by being dead when I needed them (I thought they were ready and good for use). It's been only a couple of weeks roughly since I recharged the 2650mAh's prior to my attempt to use the batteries. The astonishingly fast self-discharge rate make the 2650mAh's impractical/inconvenient. I am discarding (properly) all eight of my Duracell 2650mAh batteries, and ordering more pre-charged batteries such as the Eneloop.
