review/text: ChapStick has become indispensable to our family. Original ChapStick was our favorite for many years. I personally like Cherry Chapstick because of the slight cherry flavor. I usually put that on a bed time because the slight reddish tint sometimes makes people wonder whether you are wearing lipstick.My wife prefers ChapStick Medicated when her lips become very chapped. ChapStick Medicated contains camphor, phenol and menthol to help cool and ease pain. The petrolatum helps to retain moisture and protects the skin of your lips.Chapstick Moisturizer contains two sunscreens to yield SPF 15, helping to protect your sensitive lips from sunburn. Chapstick Moisturizer is wonderful for people who are outdoors a lot, especially in the dry cold of winter.We like to buy ChapStick multi-packs to make sure we never run out. ChapStick is one of the best ways to keep your lips moist (excluding kisses, of course). Putting ChapStick on my lips makes them feel good and the soothing feeling when they are chapped is wonderful. I strongly recommend ChapStick for your lip protection needs.Enjoy!
