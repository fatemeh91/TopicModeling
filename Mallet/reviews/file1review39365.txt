review/text: I think this product would work, but one size does not fit all. I am small, but not so small that a general one size should not fit me, especially since it has an adjustable back. I had this closed all on the smallest hooks and it still was sagging on me. I think it would work, but you must have broad shoulders and a broad back. Don't trust the picture, I don't know how they made it fit that woman.
