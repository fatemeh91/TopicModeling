review/text: Natural Healing salve with amazing beneficial properties. Recommended to me by a chef who used it on hand cuts in his work - I have put this on a bleeding wound and gotten immediate pain relief, there is no development of redness around a wound, the skin remains normal color and does not dry out; it speeds healing, and greatly reduces any scarring. Herbal Ed's is a natural product and the synergism of all the ingredients produces immediate and healthy curative properties. From my own personal use, I know it works. I use it on my dogs if they get a cut, and on dry paw pads. It restores natural oils and relieves soreness. Give this the HIGHEST recommendation possible!
