review/text: I purchased this product because I thought it appeared easy to use and allows your feet to breathe. Be careful with the size. I bought a large because I wear a 9 in women's and it kept sliding off at night and the Velcro wouldn't allow me to tighten it further. Overall I think it would have worked if it weren't for the wrong size.
