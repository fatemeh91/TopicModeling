review/text: The emjoi has no joy involved, but it does most of the job. You have to get used to the feeling of it. It also takes a few times of going over the same spot before it gets everything. I still can't do the entire leg, too painful. But, for quick, do it yourself hair removal, I still recommend it. Just remember to exfoliate ladies!
