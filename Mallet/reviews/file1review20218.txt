review/text: my little chorkie has a severe liver shunt which means she has very high uric acid levels like people who get gout. so I give her ...her juicy juice & she loves it. I was buying the organic black cherry juice but before it would be half way done it was fermented so I switched to this, I do dilute it just a little bit & its perfect. It works for Gout, anyone or a pet with uric acid. The problem with liver shunt dogs is the RX is not good for them so this is better. Im all for natural medicine first...RX later. I had my little dog tested..works!!!
