review/text: I just got this today and have been playing with it for a couple of hours and haven't gotten a decent orgasm. This is my first vibrator/toy ever and I don't think I will be buying any more. Maybe its just me but vibrations do little to nothing for me and the fact that this toys rabbit ears are way too long doesn't help. After playing with it for awhile and just being left frustrated I managed to get a weak orgasm not worth anywhere near the 30 dollars i paid for this! The vibe itself is way too thick and it has a awful chemical smell. I should saved my money! I will continue to try and play around with it but I am not hopeful. The rotating shaft also does NOTHING for me..
