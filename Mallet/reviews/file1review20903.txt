review/text: The Braun 8585 is the best electric shaver I've used - including the Braun shaver I had in college. It has the usual drawback of an electric shaver - the shave just isn't as close or smooth as a blade. However, for someone like me with very sensitive skin, it works well.I've gone back and forth between electric shavers and razors since I started shaving. Even using expensive products (the Art of Shaving, Aramis Lab Series and Anthony Sport), I have problems with my skin when using a blade. With the Braun 8585, I have had none of those problems. Timewise, I think it is about the same as a blade.The self cleaning system is pretty cool but it's very noisy (scares the cat every time I use it) and buying the additional cleaning cartridges and head is a little pricy but not unmanageable. The shaver holds a charge and travels well. If you're after an electric shaver, this is the one to get, but keep your razor and shaving lotion for times when you need that extra close, extra smooth shave.
