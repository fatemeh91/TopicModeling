review/text: It's a nice length and width, but it's very loud when it's on (you can't hear it if you have a fan/tv on and it's under the covers, but other wise, people can hear it through the door) and it seems like most of the vibrating power is on the "handle" rather than any other point along it.It's an okay item for the price, but it's not the best out there. You won't be horribly disappointed if you buy it, but you're not missing anything spectacular by passing it up.
