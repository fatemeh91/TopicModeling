review/text: Amazing taste with milk or water. Im on my fifth five pound tub and don't even care to try anything else, regardless of others reviews because there is no way its better than this. I use a magic bullet to mix my shakes in the mornings with milk and after workouts I use water and a little crushed ice and both taste great. I highly recommend a magic bullet to anyone serious about a consistant intake of protein because if you have the extra time its well worth it to make it with the bullet vs a shaker (all of them suck).
