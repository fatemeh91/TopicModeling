review/text: I dont know I could just be using it wrong but I was surprised when it didnt trim a close as it said it would. Fine hairs, forget about it. That was what I got it for, to get the fine hairs that the larger trimmers dont get and to spare myself waxing. Now this product just sits in a storage bin as I wait for something I could use it on. I have had it for going on a year now.
