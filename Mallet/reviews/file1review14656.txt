review/text: I understand that this product might affect older folks differently from younger ones (I'm 30 years old), but I guess given I'm already in very good health perhaps it was doomed to not change how I feel. I tried this product for a full week at 20 mg per day and felt nothing whatsoever. Not even placebo effect! For $5, it's still worth a shot if you're sedentary and are looking to give your brain a boost.
