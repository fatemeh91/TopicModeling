review/text: I tried a couple of other seats first. The Sesame Street seat slid around, and the First Years Secure-Adjust Toilet Trainer was too big. We have the Eco Drake round Toto toilets with soft close lid. The seats curve down in the middle and are small. The Babybjorn fits on the smallest setting and does not slide around. I can see how it could adjust to quite a large toilet seat. We should be able to use it when we travel too. Our daughter is almost 3 and has been using the small BabyBjorn potty chair, but she started sitting on the regular toilet, so I really wanted to find something so she would be comfortable. When I first put it on, she stayed on there for a long time, and now uses it everyday. I believe this is our toilet seat (TOTO SS113-01 Transitional SoftClose Round Toilet Seat):http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QTZOBK/ref=noref?ie=UTF8&s;=hi&psc;=1You can see how it curves downward in the picture so most potty seats do not work on it. I was so happy that it fit!
