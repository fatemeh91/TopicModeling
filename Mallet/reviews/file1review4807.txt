review/text: I've been using this product for about a year. Its hard to get all your greens in one day but not with Macrogreens! I mix it in my water bottle every morning. The taste does not bother me. If you put it in a smoothie, you can't even taste it. This stuff makes me feel energized and healthy. Some of the other green powder products have that "scratchy" feeling when you drink it. This does not. I love it!!!
