review/text: First, I these plugs are great, and I know, because I've used plugs every night for a decade, and have used all shapes, sizes, materials, and price ranges. I also use them during the day at times to create some quiet for reading, work, or just QT. Nothing comes close to these except Flens cotton/wax (if you don't mind the oily feel; I love them at night).And now that I've put in a good plug for these plugs, click on the pricing and ask yourself who would pay more for 500 pair than for 600 pair (3 sets of 200 pair, for the mathematically challenged). The answer is that few would pay it (though Barnum said there is always one). But the very presence of this "option" causes the price for 200 to appear relatively cheap-- a real bargain--so more will buy them than if there had not been the pricier option.I was fascinated to read some of the psychology of marketing, and how we can be tricked into buying something we'd not have been interested in otherwise. There are excellent examples in the book "Predictable Irrational" (eye-opening and fun book). Such approaches work great with magazine subscriptions, from National Geographic to Harvard Business Review, and people spend small fortunes to get the "freebie" when we all know nothing is free.I do not, in the least, fault these sellers for their psychological tricks, because it is a great price, regardless. But as the economy tightens, marketers are getting savvier, so it pays to make sure we know the true value of a product, versus its price. Frustrating sometimes--but fun if you take it as a challenge.Sweet dreams with these plugs...
