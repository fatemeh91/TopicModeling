review/text: My daughter started with a "prudence" potty, which she loved (still does), but got interested in the big potty (and I decided it would be a lot easier for me if she went directly in the toilet!), so I bought this one. It is adjustable to fit different toilet seats and it fits the toilet snugly. Since it is one piece it is easy to put on and take off and it is pretty easy to clean. I tried an $8 First Years seat for a second toilet, but it was a big mistake -- it hardly fit at all, it slid back and forth unless you glued or taped it to the seat, and it was two pieces which was a pain. We tried to use it once, but it just didn't work. I am buying another one of these bjorns. the only problem (not a big one) is that the step stool is a little too short for my daughter (but she is only 2 and can't be on the big potty by herself anyway).
