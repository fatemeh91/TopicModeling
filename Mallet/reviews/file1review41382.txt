review/text: In spite of the fact that overpronation (inward sagging ankles especially with aging) is a common problem, particularly for women.. many women's shoes still opt for fashion over even minimal foot support and products for this problem continue to be scarce. Many shoes do not have any arch support which, over time, means you will need shoe inserts of some sort eventually. Many products are for the whole footprint which I do not need and often add a tighter toe fit to dressier shoes. Some products are ok but their thicker, gel design works only for heftier athletic shoes. This product adds a bit more arch and some inner heel thickness to cant the foot back out into a less stressful configuration and helps a lot especially if you do not have absolutely flat feet or serious arch issues. The thin nature works well on dressier shoes or ones that have minimal support and just need a tad more.As to the reviews which speak to higher heels, the product promo is a bit inaccurate but since I never tortured my feet with the stupidity of high heels, more serious foot complications are not an issue. Comfortable shoes need to be more than just squishy, bedroom slipper like footbeds but since shoe manufacturers, even some name brand styles, mass produce for the middle of the road, I guess products like these will continue to pop up. I will buy a few more since every time I find what I need, it disappears before I can get more.. Also some of these products which are just gel forms are HIDEOUSLY overpriced. These are more reasonable.
