review/text: I've been using a popular mainstream name brand cleaner for my gas permealbe lenses for more than 20 years. Recently, I couldn't get my contacts clean. Despite repeated cleanings (every few hours) and enzyme treatments (everyday), my contacts remained blurry. Then, I read the reviews on this product and thought I'd give it a try. I am so pleased. My contacts are finally clean! I have no blurring or build-up on my lenses. After using this cleaner only once, my problem of blurred contact lenses was solved. I highly recommend this product!
