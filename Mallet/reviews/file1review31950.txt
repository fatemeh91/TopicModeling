review/text: I'm so surprised at all the folks who say this stuff tastes terrible. I tried it after using another brand for quite a while and was so delighted at how much better it tastes than the other kind! I mix with milk and psyllium. As always with psyllium, you have to drink it fast or the psyllium gums up.
