review/text: I've been using this product for around 3 years. I didn't use it for the 9 months I was pregnant because I wasn't sure if it was safe for pregnant women, but it probably would've help with the lack of energy I experienced. :\ I always drink it the first thing in the morning. I used to make a smootie with it, but now I make a quick shake, as I don't have the time in the morning like I did before, with a little one. My shake consist of this powder, yogurt, oj, milk, chia seeds, cinnamon, and agave nectar. I put it all in a container with two ice cube... shake, and that's my morning energy boost. I love it. I can't say I feel a boost of energy, but I feel good. Not tired in the morning at all... and very regular. :)
