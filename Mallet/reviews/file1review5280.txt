review/text: I got these in an effort to combat the combination of morning sickness & carsickness on a two-day bus ride I was taking. I really wanted to like them, but the taste was absolutely awful. If you're thinking ginger flavor like ginger ale, this isn't even close. They were spicy and bitter and just plain icky - I tried twice, but couldn't keep one in my mouth longer than about 45 seconds. Bummed that I wasted the money on these, I could have bought Preggie Pops instead for the same price - and they actually taste good!! Would recommend ginger root capsules instead.
