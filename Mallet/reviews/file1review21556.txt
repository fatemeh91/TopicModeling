review/text: It was too expensive and a waste of my hard earned money. I wish it would have had bigger holes for the ta ta's. And it's not comfortable the way my chest and stomach rests on it. I will never use it. But that is just me. I had a nice pillow for the ta ta's years ago but my puppy chewed it up. Darn it! It had big holes and didn't fit but under the chest. So comfortable. But i can't find it out there anywhere.It looks to be well made and would last years and years if this is what you are looking for.
