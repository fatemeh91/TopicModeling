review/text: ON Whey is great! If you do a little research you will find that it is one of the best Whey proteins you can buy. I bought vanilla ice cream, and to be honest i'm not entirely sure what it tastes like plain because I bought it specifically to blend in with fruit for a fresh post-work out drink (much better than those syrupy emerald city shakes they sling at my gym). Throw in some milk, a scoop or 2 of this protein, half a banana, frozen berries, strawberries, and/or some high pulp OJ and you are golden!
