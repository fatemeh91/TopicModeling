review/text: I was immediately happy with this Remington MPT-3000 Titanium Personal Trimmer. The motor is on the powerful side. The trimming is fast and effective. The only thing I wish it would have had was information on where a person could order more heads for it. All trimmers I have order does not have information on where you can get replacement heads for them. I really would have loved to have had that information with this trimmer. I am so happy with the trimmer that I would order more heads if I knew where or how to get them.
