review/text: Bought this several years ago as a gift for my husband. His back would hurt after hours in his office chair. He stopped even trying to use the massager part and just used it as a pillow after a few months. The massage is a high vibration that made his back itch after a few minutes, although he enjoyed it until the itching kicked in. Still uses the pillow to improve the back support in his chair.
