review/text: I'm not a power lifter or looking to get huge, but I do some working out and running and was looking for a protein powder to supplement my diet. I started with a small tub of muscle milk (vanilla) but after doing some research, I decided to get the ON gold standard. It is low in fat and carbs (compared to other powders out there) and for the price, is a bargain.It didn't mix as well as the muscle milk in my blender bottle, which is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Mixed with milk, it tastes pretty good. You can tell it's a protein shake, but the flavor and aftertaste are not bad.
