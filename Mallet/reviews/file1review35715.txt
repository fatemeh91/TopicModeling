review/text: Have used Similisan "Dry Eye Drops" for at least two years, off and on, and recently began to use them several times every day. They provide immediate relief for dry, scratchy-feeling eyes. The relief is equal to (or even better than) brands such as Hypotears and other heavily-chemical products I've used. The "Dry Eye Drops" and other Similisan products are homeopathic, meaning that they contain minute quantities of the active ingredients. There's a debate about homeopathic medicines--are the ingredients effective themselves, or do the medicines relieve symptoms by a placebo effect, through the mind/imagination of the user. Personally, I don't care what causes the effectiveness, since (1) they ARE effective for me, and (2) the ingredients are safe, to the best of my knowledge. My ophthalmologist approved of this product for "as-needed" use when I had a subconjunctival hemorrhage, as well as for regular daily use several times a day.
