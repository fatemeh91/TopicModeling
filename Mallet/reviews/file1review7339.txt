review/text: this is my first foot tub. i don't know the performance of other type. but this one has strong enough flow. the strength has high and low two settings. the heat is only on/off. there are only two blow heads, one for each foot. massage nodes don't move by themselves. these are pretty much standard features among all kinds of foot tubs.my problem is the remote control doesn't work. i have to stop by the store tomorrow. hope it is the remote controller's problem. second, it is the deepest i have saw in stores, which gives a deep massage and i love it. water line any deeper than this may not practical because of the weight of water could be considerable for some people. however, tall tub also means the legs are restrained somehow. The solution might be finding a higher chair. Even with these problems, I like it over all. The experience has no regret.
