review/text: I randomly will get a killer headache and would use ice packs, cold wash cloths, etc. for relief. I needed something that wouldn't fall off if I turned my head so I purchased two of these. They have come in very handy, and I like that you can take the cover off to hand wash if needed, and also that it stays on your head. My only issue was that the mask didn't stay very cold. I thought that might happen, so I purchased two and am glad I did. Definitely worth the money, just make sure you buy two so you have a backup!
