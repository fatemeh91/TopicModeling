review/text: I purchased this item 1/30/2012 and tried to return it today, but my refund date has expired. It was going to be the 4th time i would have used it, but it's not even turning on anymore. Even when i did use it, the battery died within 3 minutes of trimming my beard. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even if you plug it in to the charger and try to use it, it doesn't work. Dont buy it. Not worth it.
