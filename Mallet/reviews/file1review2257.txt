review/text: My husband and I both use these. I know they are for men but I haven't found a lady's razor yet that could touch the Mach 3. I had been buying the blades from that super-center store (you know the one) and it is more expensive to buy from there than it is to order here online from Amazon. Especially if you get the free shipping with your order you can't go wrong. One blade will usually last me one week shaving my legs every day.
