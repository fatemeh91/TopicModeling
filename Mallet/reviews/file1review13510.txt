review/text: I've tried many, many, many deodorants (never anti-perspirant; sweating is an essential bodily function) --from the conventional stuff to the organic, all-natural, magic crystal products. They either didn't work at all or at their best had me smelling a mixture of BO and their particular fragrance; unacceptable in any case.I happily opted-out of using deodorants for a few years, but when a friend introduced me to Sharps I opted-in again; now the people around me are happy.Happy me, happy you, happy everyone!
