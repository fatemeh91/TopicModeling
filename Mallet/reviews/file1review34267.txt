review/text: I am amazed at how well this works. I have been having such intense pain and bleeding for a long time now. I have tried so many things. I was miserable. I stopped all my bleeding after 2 days of use and the pain subsided 90% too! I have been using it about 5 days. I have only used it externally so far. I put some on a couple of squares of toilet paper which I leave tucked between. I usually would not share such info but if you are really suffering as I was, it is the moral thing for me to do!
