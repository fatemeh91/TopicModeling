review/text: If these are the batteries with the green labeling, I cannot recommend them. Electro-chemically they seem fine, and hold a good charge for a long time, but the batteries are just a little too fat to fit most of my AA devices. I have to conclude they do not meet AA mechanical specs. So I have to use the competing brand for most of my equipment.
