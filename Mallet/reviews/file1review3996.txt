review/text: Okay so they upped my blades from three to five, but I can still just stick with three. I think I will do that for the fact that although I do really like these new blades, they are high in cost compared to the M3 I normally use. I do like the way the blades are set neatly in the plactic molded container so you just retrieve them by sticking the handle in, hearing the click and then pulling it out. The others I use have the plastic tabs you have to break off and then shake the blade out. I think this part is a great improvement in the retrieval of the blade. It does give a close shave and when you first give it a go you have to be a little careful because five blades is really almost overkill. I did like the ones I bought to try, but will not buy more until they come down in price. It is hard to justify spending that much money on these blades when a lot less money and a steady hand can still produce the same result.
