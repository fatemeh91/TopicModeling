review/text: Good quality product. Ordered 24 and they came in a yellow bubble wrap envelope, no box or anything, not that Iind but perhaps others may. Used a few and they perform as expected. Design of the wrapper has changed from before. It is blue now and just says 'crown' with no mention of 'skinless skin' so it made be a bit surprised. No big deal though I later saw on another website that the wrapper design had changed. On further inspection I saw that these are manufactured in Thailand. I thought the old ones were made in japan but I forget.... As ling as it works as expected I don't mind where it's made. So, overall happy with the purchase.
