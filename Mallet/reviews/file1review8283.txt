review/text: I wanted a brush for cleaning beer bottles for making beer. this is not the right brush for the job. I read up on it but I must not have caught the details to cue me as to what kind of bottles.- This product does appear to made quite well with a blister maker grippy handle and resilient bristles. I like OXO products. If it had fit the beer bottles I would have awarded another star. I will keep it and use it for other things, But to my fellow beer makers....we must search further into the Amazon for a proper brush. Blessed be the beer makers..and the brew they make.
