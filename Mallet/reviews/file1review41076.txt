review/text: I wanted something that was natural without all of the synthetic sugars and this product delivered. It tastes good mixed with milk or crushed ice and water and is not upsetting to your stomach at all! The only complaint I had was the shipping took too long.. I recommend ordering two weeks out from when you actually need it.
