review/text: This trampoline came with a broken part and the handle of the carrier bag ripped as soon as I took it off the folded trampoline. I emailed the company but received NO RESPONSE. There was also no literature included. The mat on which you bounce seems too small, certainly not 40". The springs show and are not covered by the edging. Wish I had picked another rebounder!!
