review/text: I bought this lighter for $7.08 and couldn't be happier. It is an official Zippo lighter. It does it's job and does it well. Retail for this lighter is $14.99 (as the sticker implied), so I definitely feel like I got a good deal. As previously mentioned by other reviewers it does not come with any lighter fluid in, but does come with a full flint. Highly recommended as I didn't want to have a shiny polish that would eventually end up getting scratched.
