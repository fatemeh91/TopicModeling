review/text: got mine in the mail yesterday. the finish looks sleek the hinge has a good weld and the internals are brand new. it comes with a wick and a single flint both already in it. the only bad thing is that it doesnt come with fuel. thats understandable tho. i ran out to my local gander mountain to grab some zippo fuel but they DONT stock zippo fuel so i ended up ordering online and need to pay for expensive sipping.
