review/text: I have a 1.8 liter, (61 oz) Thermos bottle and when I bought it from Amazon, this Bottle Brush was suggested to go with it. I bought the brush thinking it would be perfect for cleaning my thermos, but alas, it is too short to make it to the bottom of my thermos. (The thermos will hold an entire 12 cups from a standard coffee brewer, so it's an unusually big thermos).But the brush does come in handy while washing other dishes, and its great for cleaning mesh strainers.
