review/text: I dont know if there is much more to say. ON is already known as one of the best brands out there for whey protein. Chocolate mint doesn't disappoint. I picked it up because it was on sale and i figured I could get through the box even if it wasn't that bad. But it turns out the mint is not very strong and believe it or not this goes great with bananas and milk in a protein shake. It's been about 4 weeks and I'm still enjoying it.
