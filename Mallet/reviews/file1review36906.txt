review/text: This product looked like a good solution to my problems: compression stockings, degenerative bone disease, making it difficult to get the stockings on. Couldn't get it to work -- set aside. Recently had an opportunity to have it checked by a wound care nurse. She was able to get it to work on her (small narrow feet). We couldn't get it to work on my size 9W feet. So, in the trash it goes.
