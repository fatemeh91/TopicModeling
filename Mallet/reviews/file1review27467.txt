review/text: This stuff is awesome. I mix it with water, about one scoop - 6-8 oz of water and I make sure to mix it right when I dump in the scoop. With fifteen seconds of mixing you let it sit for 30 seconds and you have the most delicious almost milk shake you could ever have. It tastes like melted french vanilla ice cream, which is amazing. Mixing it like I do I rarely if ever get chunks and when I do they're small and still taste great. I would highly recomend this product. It is super awesome. I would ask anyone to find a downside to this product, for what it is(whey protein) it could not be better. It's perfect and I love it. Now only if I could affford an unlimited supply........
