review/text: I had done quite a bit of research on carpet sweepers...I thought I had looked at some ok reviews on this sweeper. it is awful. it is loud, moves things around on the floor, whether it is carpet or tile. Didn't work worth a lick. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in bissell. Please don't waster your money. If you can go to a garage sale or a thrift store, get one of the old ones that just pick up everything, you only have to go over an area once and you don't have to pick the stuff up yourself.this sweeper has two rows of brushes and rubber at each corner. it didn't pick up anything and the noise it made was as loud as a small vacuum...horrible, DO NOT BUY IT.
