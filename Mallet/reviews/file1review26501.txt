review/text: This bracelet, although relatively inexpensive, is too cheaply made. The links from bracelet to chain are cheap and can be pulled off. The emblem comes off (as mine did) as it is just glued on. The word DIABETIC lightly engraved on the back is barely readable and in less than good lighting conditions may not be able to be read at all. Not recommended at any price.
