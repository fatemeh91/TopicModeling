review/text: These taste great, but I wish they had the no added sugar varieties. They're still a steal from the price in the store, though.The taste is great and not chalk-y, and this mixed pretty well (some of the Slim Fast shakes have an issue with the whole "mixing" thing). Great purchase, and will buy again in the future :)Edit: I am as gluten free as I can make it. While this product doesn't technically list gluten in the ingredients, there is a chance of cross contamination. I was drinking these pretty regularly and after a few days of shakes could tell that the small amount of gluten from the cross contamination was enough to affect me negatively. This said, unfortunately, I won't be buying these shakes again. It's a shame, too, because these were working out for my diet really well, actually.
