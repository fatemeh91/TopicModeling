review/text: I found this product by accident. I was looking for something I could give my dog for her arthritis pain and Cerecomp came up on Amazon's 'people who bought Heel Zeel also bought...' list of products.I always had a very good memory and never had any trouble focusing but over the last 6-8 months or so, I noticed that it was getting harder and harder to remember names or songs, concentrate at work, even remember to do simple things I've done every day for years. Some friends told me it was probably hormones/perimenopause and there wasn't much I could do about it unless I wanted to find an endocrinologist and see if he'd prescribe hormones. Other friends wrote it off as the effect of long term stress. Well, I don't really want to start taking hormones and I haven't been able to figure out how to live stress free so when I saw the Cerecomp write-ups, I figured it was worth a try.It took about 5 days, taking 2 per day, before I really noticed a difference. I've been taking it about 3 months now and my memory is almost as good as it was several years ago and I'm able to concentrate for hours at a time again. My husband has even noticed the improvement and has started taking it, too. I've had no negative side effects at all. I never thought it would work as well as it has -- it's made a huge difference in my quality of life.
