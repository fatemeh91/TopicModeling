review/text: I use these in my single aaa battery powered trimmer (beard). I had been trying to use rayovac cheapos, but in the trimmer they would only work for a min and they would either stop or start pulling hair, and I would have to change the battery several time just for a single trim. So I bought the energizers on sale and they work great! A few trims now on the first battery and still going strong!
