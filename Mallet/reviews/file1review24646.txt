review/text: This product does what it promises. You definitely lose weight when you use it. BUT, after using it you feel horrible, especially 10 minutes after you eat. You get very nervous and nauseated. I hate it and love it at the same time because it has definitely helped me lose weight but while I'm under its influence I swear I will never take it again because it makes me feel so sick. However, I always go back to it when I need to lose some weight. No wonder Britney Spears was seen with this stuff, its a miracle worker if you can stand the reaction.
