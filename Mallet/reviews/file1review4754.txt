review/text: So, I'm on Atkins, and some days I feel a bit tired. I was half-assing the "take your vitamins" rule, but after browsing a local hippie shop I decided to pick up a small bottle of these....Normally I don't feel much of a boost from vitamins, unless they are packaged with a horrible amount of caffeine.These... are killer! I took them at night, and woke up feeling great. I am usually a zombie in the morning, so it was extremely odd, and refreshing. I wasn't expecting to feel any different after only 3 tablets, but wow! Total energy boost.Very mild taste for a multi-vitamin too. Certainly worth a try if you feel like spending a bit more for multi-vitamin.
