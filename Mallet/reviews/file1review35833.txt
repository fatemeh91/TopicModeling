review/text: This is the blackest, gooiest, waxiest, stickiest stuff. Very odd that it comes in a dropper bottle. Do not let this concoction touch your teeth!! It has to be manually scraped off - and did I mention that it is very black?That said, I could really taste the "beeness" and it worked great for the use I intended it for, which was to protect my throat while I traveled on numerous flights half way around the world. There were coughing, sneezing, snuffling people all around me but my immunity held up, and I attribute that, at least partly, to using this product for about a week before my departure.
