review/text: It was really great while it was working. Then, the trimmer adjustment broke. Didn't even make it to month 3. I only use it once every two weeks. It wasn't abused or anything... just garbage.Update: Remington must have missed my first email, but promptly responded to my second. They are sending me a new unit in 7 - 10 business days. If the new one works out, I'll update my review. Regardless, not being able to use a trimmer for over two weeks is extremely inconvenient.
