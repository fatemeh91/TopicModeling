review/text: I have had this shaver for several years and it is simply the best shaver I have ever owned. The blade and foil need to be replaced about ever year and a half to keep it cutting like new. I always buy this from Amazon and am VERY happy with the price and very reasonable shipping charges. I hope they continue to be available for years to come!
