review/text: I had been using this product for years after finding them in a local grocery store with shelved medical type items. Then both the grocery store and Walmart discontinued stocking them.I found them at Amazon, and ordered some spares. These are easy to use, can get between closely adjacent teeth and the reverse end has tiny brushes built in that are very helpful for certain uses when cleaning teeth. Also, they are washable/reuseable. They beat any wood toothpick I have used.
