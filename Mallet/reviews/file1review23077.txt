review/text: I was surprised at how swiftly this swept, especially all the dust particles that I can't even see. The roller in the middle and two collection compartments on either side really maximizes its pick-up efficiency. It also picks up lint and bits of paper, but not "heavier" or bigger objects like paper clips. I am grateful it doesn't need any electricity, because I can't stand the tornado-like sound of regular electric-powered vacuums. (Although this sweeper isn't entirely silent--it sounds kind of clunky rolling around, but it's not a big deal.)One vice is that the roller is in the middle, so you can't sweep in dust/lint 2-3 inches from the wall and corners of anything. Also, the rubbery square band fell off after about 3 weeks, and I'm still not sure whether I actually need it or not. But it's not sticking back to the unit... Oh well...All in all, really fun. My 21 year-old boyfriend wanted to sweep and ran around the hallway with it, dancing all the way.... Haha, weird sight.
