review/text: I bought this seat for my daughter so I could save myself from cleaning out a stand alone potty. She loves it and isn't afraid of the big toilet at all. The seat fits any shaped toilet seat unlike some other brands that claim they fit all toilet seats. It may cost a bit more, but you won't waste your time buying or searching for another seat. Make sure to get a step stool that is the proper height so your little one can climb on and off the seat by themselves.
