review/text: This product has worked well for me. Get a close shave with just a little stubble left. I've used it 4 or 5 times now without having to recharge it after the initial charge. Easy grip, easy to alter the lengths of the shave. Product arrived promptly. Don't know what else is needed, hence the 5 stars.
