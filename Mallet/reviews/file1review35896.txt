review/text: Histamine is a major ingredient in a recipe for allergy symptoms. Quercetin tells the body to not bother producing histamine in the presence of the allergens. The results of taking quercetin can be quite calming and can create a physical sense of serenity all the while seriously reducing any allergic response to pollen (for example). I've been taking this for years now as a powerful tool in my allergy fighting arsenal.Two or even three times a day (with or without food) during peak allergy season works wonders for me. Can't recommend this particular product highly enough!!!
