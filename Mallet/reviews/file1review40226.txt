review/text: It really works! My teeth are whiter, definitely. The one slight problem with it is that you're required to brush your teeth for an extended period of time. Then, you're not to rinse for another period of time. This is a problem if you're accustomed to brushing right before bed, and falling asleep before the required time has elapsed. Overall, however, I would recommend this product if you have discolored enamel from smoking, coffee drinking, age, etc. It does the job. I'm very happy with the results.
