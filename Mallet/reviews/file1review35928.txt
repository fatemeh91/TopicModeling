review/text: I used to have an ionic toothbrush years ago and my dental hygienist I had then would tell me how little plaque my teeth had.....now it's been years since I lost my ionic toothbrush. My teeth feel ok immediately after brushing with a regular toothbrush, but they definitely were cleaner and felt cleaner longer with the ionic toothbrush. I believe it really works and have always wanted another one.
