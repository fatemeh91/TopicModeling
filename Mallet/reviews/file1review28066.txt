review/text: I knew that I had a protein deficiency in my diet because I mostly eat vegetables. I work out about 5 days a week and muscle is important to me. Not so much bulking up, but I want to have a really toned body. I was toned to begin with, but my abs were never quite getting there for the amount of ab workouts I do. I started incorporating this into my diet. I have one scoop with 12 oz. of water every morning and I am already seeing results. I think I have been taking this for about a month. It's done wonders for my abs. They feel so solid and definitely did not feel like that before! I didn't switch up my workout routine or diet at all. I just drink this every morning and it's really done the trick. It dissolves completely in water. I have the double chocolate and it doesn't exactly taste like a milkshake, but since I don't drink milkshakes, it's close enough. I look forward to it every morning!
