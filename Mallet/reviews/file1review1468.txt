review/text: I went to the dermatologist to get what I was told was a wart, frozen off. It had been there for years so the dermatologist said it might be a tough one to treat, so after freezing it she gave me this wart stick, and told me to apply it every other night and cover it with duct tape. What she didn't tell me, and what was NOT listed on the instructions on the box, was that this stuff needs to be applied exactly to only the wart, because if it gets on any of the surrounding skin, it will burn it off. I can't tell if the product is working because it is just burning off more skin every time I use it and I don't think I'm going to continue using it.
