review/text: All I have to say is WOW! This is the third type of ionic mineral I have bought in the past 3 years,and I have finally found a good one!! The first one was brown - so it turned the water brown - and second one recommended 40 drops which I was never able to get to and the kids didnt like the taste.We have Reverse osmosis water and it takes out the smell as well as the good and the bad minerals so I add these to a crafe and we drink that - the FIRST day I noticed way more energy ( I bought the immune support as well and got the silicea as a free trial bottle when I ordered direct from the company- so I add all threeto the carafe which is about a half gallon or so) I took a teaspoon full straight and could taste an aftertaste of minerals but nothing horrible at all- and the kids cant taste it- (they had previously refused to drink out of the crafe because the water tasted bad) I have NEVER noticed such a noticable increase in energy and general wellbeing from ANY supplement before as with this. I look forward to more signs of increased good health. I came to Amazon to check pricing on getting more and just had to share my experience since it is such a good one.
