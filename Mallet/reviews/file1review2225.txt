review/text: Does exactly what it needs to. Plucks out the hairs fast and easy. The shaver head is also nice for touching up areas too sensitive for pulling out hair.This product is worth the good reviews. It's simple, without any unnecessary gadgets that will make it cost more than it's actually worth. The massager doesn't do much for me but it really won't be needed once you get used to the pain. One fair warning though, don't let hair grow out too much, or it WILL be painful.
