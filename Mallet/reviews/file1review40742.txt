review/text: I adore this lotion! I made sure to smell it when I was in the store to make sure I enjoyed the smell. I find that it is really calming and does go on my skin well. In the winter months, my legs get really dry and itchy. I now use this every night after a shower and my legs haven't been as dry and the lotion also calms the itching. With the subscribe and save, the price is cheaper than my local stores as well. I highly recommend this lotion.
