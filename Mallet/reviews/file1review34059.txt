review/text: ...I'm surprised at Paul's review. I took this stuff for about six months, along with cutting back on animal fat (which I had done previously with limited success). I had quit taking a statin because I had memory issues, and it really scared me. As I recall, it brought my cholesterol down another 30+ points, enough to squeak by without having to go back to statins.There are genetic issues at play here, as well. My sister-in-law was down to eating sawdust, to no avail. Her cholesterol levels were all due to heredity, not diet. So if controlling your diet helps your cholesterol level some, then I'd say this is definitely worth a try.
