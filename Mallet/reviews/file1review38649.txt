review/text: I've been passing this after shave by for a long time thinking it was too "old man" or whatever. I picked up a bottle on a whim and man was I surprised how good it is! It feels great after shaving with just the right amount of menthol for that cold tingly feeling. The scent is pleasant, not overpowering and it lasts for awhile. Very good product.
