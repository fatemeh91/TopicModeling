review/text: I was originally taking the liquid because I can't swallow large pills ... I was very hesitant to take these, as vitamins usually make me sick to my stomach. I have started blending these up in my vitamix with my morning green smoothies. I can't really taste that they are there, and I get all my vitamins at once. Very satisfied.
