review/text: My son has been struggling with athletics foot fungus for over a year. The doctor has given him multiple prescrition medicines with very little help. He has been using this wash on his feet twice a day for a week now and they have improved greatly. He likes the smell of the soap and says it leaves his feet feeling refreshed and clean. My only complaint would be that the cap is not very sturdy. As mentioned he has only used for one week and already the cap has broken off from bottle. Great product. I would reccommend to anyone.
