review/text: this product works well for me. Too bad it didn't also come in a bottle like other pre shave lotions. I use it most of the time as I've been in a hurry at times and use my Norelco shaver dry, but I like it with the lotion better. Shower shaving is nice too. The steam in the shower helps set up my beard. All in all it's very convenient for travel too. I recomend it highly.
