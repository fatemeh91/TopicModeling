review/text: I ordered this eye-mask upon recommendation. It is certainly light-weight and does not press on one's eyes, which is nice, and the velcro closing strap allows for one's fitting preference. One draw-back to this product is that I found around the nose area, it is not necessarily flush, so there can be cracks of light sneaking through. However this small drawback does not much hinder the overall enjoyed quality of this product.
