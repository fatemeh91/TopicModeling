review/text: I first started using Welness Formula a couple of years ago. Being from New England and working in an office environment I catch cold constantly in winter. It was recommended to me by the sales staff in Whole Foods. I got the tab version, not the capsules. You need to take 3 caps every 3 hours and they smell strong, very strong. Last year I had to go to a business trip in the middle of winter and I was feeling terribly sick, during the trip the only thing that made me continue was my Welness Formula. It definitely makes you feel much better within half an hour. Of course you need to still rest and try to recover, but when you do not have the time to do that it gives you the strength to continue your day. I love it and I recommend it all the time to my friends and coworkers.
