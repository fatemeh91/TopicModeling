review/text: The Oxo Good Grips handle is wasted on this duster since you will not be gripping a duster hard enough to get any benefit from the handle design. Go with Oxo when buying knives, peelers and paint brushes. For a feather duster, you might as well get something cheaper.Also, the photo makes this duster look larger than it is. The duster is only about a foot long and more than half of that is the handle. This is a good duster for shelves cluttered with knick-knacks, but for larger areas (blinds, top of the fridge, cabinets) you'll want a much bigger duster.
