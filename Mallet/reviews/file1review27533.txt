review/text: I'm a newb in strength training, but this product has helped me to achieve my daily required protein intake, which is not possible just by eating "real food". And the cal-carb-pro-fat composition is just perfect for someone like me who's in a cutting stage.Side effect: I have been taking this for about 3 months and I didn't notice any harm side effect, except that for the 1st-2nd week I felt a bit sleepy after consuming this.. but it didn't recur anymore after 2 weeks.Good Stuff!
