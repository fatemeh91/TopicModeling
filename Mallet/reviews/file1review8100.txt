review/text: As anther reviewer said, the brush head falls off. I examined it with magnifying lenses, but cannot make it stay on. A simple tool should simply work. If it needs writen instructions/can not easily be made to function, it's pointless. I'm a fan of OXO design, but this one seems to have a high fail rate. The design and materials of this are very nice, too bad this goes in my trash.
