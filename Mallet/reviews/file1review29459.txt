review/text: I expected these to at least have somewhat of a tarter flavor and to last longer, but they are instead very sweet and don't last long at all. I usually put 3 or 4 mints in my mouth at once and they're gone within a minute or twoThey're still quite delicious, I was just hoping for a more pervasive flavor that lasted a little while longer.
