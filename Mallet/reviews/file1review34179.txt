review/text: I debated on buying this product, but it really worked well for me and quickly. I struggled with a very stubborn anal fissure problem {thought it was minor hemorrhoids} and tried several products that had worked before but had no luck. Normally petroleum jelly for a few days solves any of these butt issues {itching, burning, minor pain} but not this time. I tried the prep H creme and ointment and noticed some minor bleeding. I then saw my doctor who prescribed hydro-cortisone suppositories. I went through 11 refills of these for over a 6 month period. I experienced minor improvement, but could not get the fissure to heal {still didn't know it was a fissure either}. My doctor sent me to a GI specialist who finally told me I had an anal fissure and I was prescribed nitroglycerin ointment. I was just about to start using that when the Ma Ying Long ointment arrived in the mail. I used it for one week and my fissure is completely healed and I still have two tubes of ointment if the problem ever returns. I never used the nitroglycerin ointment {that stuff sounds scary}. I know it's hard to believe all of these reviews, but I'm telling you this stuff is the real deal and probably better than any of the junk they are giving us here in the US. On top of that it is very cheap so you don't have much to lose to just give it a try!
