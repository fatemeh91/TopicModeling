review/text: In an effort to get more fiber in my diet a tried Metamucil (which was disgusting) and then I tried this. How they manage to get grit free, tasteless fiber is beyond me, but I'm just glad they did. I add it to my baked goods, milk, juices, smoohties, tea, yogurt, and even my jam over toast or english muffins. It has no taste, no grit, and dissolves in everything, hot or cold. Also, there were no bloating or gas issues which I was expecting based on other fiber supplements. 5 STARS all the way!! Thank you Benefiber.
