review/text: A sore throat in the area of my left tonsil prompted me to try Quick Defense. That symptom almost always means I'm coming down with a head cold. I started the 2-day regimen as directed within 30 minutes of feeling that first symptom. The next morning, the symptom was gone, and it didn't come back. I did not get a cold. Did the Echinacea boost my immunity to fight off a viral infection? I can't say for sure. But in at least this one instance, I followed the product directions and got the result it purports to offer. Quick Defense can't legally promise anything because the product hasn't been evaluated by the FDA, so if it doesn't work for you, don't expect to get your money back. One suggestion: swallow the caps one at a time, not both both at once. They're large and float in your mouthful of water, so they go down easier one at a time.
