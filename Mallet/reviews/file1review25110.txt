review/text: I eat it with every meal. My favorite is a half-scoop in a cup of cooked oatmeal, or a cup of cooked oat bran. I skip the animal fat milk and eat it like pudding. A cup of frozen berries brings the temperature down quick so I can make it and eat it. Sucralose or couple shakes of stevioside.Next favorite is a smoothie:1/2 scoop1 sandwich bag full of veggies (broccolli, cauliflower, baby carrots, whatever else).1 banana or cup of frozen fruitTon of ice.2 packets sucralose, or couple shakes steviosideapple cider vinegar if I have anytotal ww points: 3. . . . . huge smoothie.sip of coffee between smoothie gulps, or oatmeal bites--for some reason tastes really good.The think about this protein powder is that it doesn't have a bunch of vitamins to get in the way of your normal vitamin regime. It is also gluten free, almost totally lactose free, and is a combination of whey and casein protein. Whey is fast burning, casein is the slowest so you have a long burn time on this stuff, well into the night.Forget it tasting bad. I like it in a blender with just water. All protein powder tastes bad, IMHO. If you can get it mixed, it makes an excellent fake Latte when added to coffee or tea.I'm a vanilla guy, someday might try chocolate.
