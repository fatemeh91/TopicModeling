review/text: Initially, I had a boost of energy with first time.Later after couple of days , I noticed intestinal pain. I tried product at half dosage every other day, but still had intestinal pain , but also inflammation in nerves in sinuses, and teeth.All my symptoms went away after discontinuing the the usage of the product.I have read on internet that some Cordyceps may be contaminated with mold. I do have mold allergy, and this may explain my reaction. I have use Reishi, Shitake,and Maitake mushrooms extracts without problem.
