review/text: I love spicy food. The more garlic, the better. However, my wife can't stand the way my favorites make my skin smell. I was hoping that this product would give me free reign to eat the foods I like without getting "the look" and "the sigh" for days afterwards. While Cholorfresh did improve the after-effects, it didn't completely eliminate the body odor I normally project after certain foods.
