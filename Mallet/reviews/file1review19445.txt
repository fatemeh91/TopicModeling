review/text: I have battled my weight since puberty and have always needed to exercise to keep the muscle up and the fat off. I have never been more than 25 pounds overweight, but mostly physically fit. Having said that, I tried T3 for the first time in 2006 when I really started getting back into a regular exercise routine (weight training 3 days / running up to 3 miles 3 days). I found that T3 gave me extra energy and my muscle gains were definitely improved over the period of weightlifting when I didn't take T3. As I have approached my mid 30s I notice my metabolism has slowed considerably and it has been harder to keep the fat off. I just started taking T3 again this past Spring (2008) and again, I notice muscle gains in a very short period, which again, I never achieved in the same period without taking it.
