review/text: I was getting tired of paying $12/haircut and spending the time waiting to get it cut. This kit cost $27 total and I'm really enjoying cutting my hair myself. It's easy to do and I cut all but the very back, which my wife cuts for me. I've used these 3 times so far and am very happy I purchased these. No more waiting and I'm done in 10 minutes all while saving $12 each time. I have thick hair and these cut right through it with no problem.
