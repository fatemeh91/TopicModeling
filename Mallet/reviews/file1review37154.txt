review/text: Really helped because I am a student who does a lot of work on my laptop and so my hands get really fatigued sometimes. I wear it to bed and has greatly help my hands recovery time since I sometimes wake up with poor circulation in my hands. Would recommend to anyone suffering from the same condition. Also, like the fact that the finger tips are open allowing to continue my work.
