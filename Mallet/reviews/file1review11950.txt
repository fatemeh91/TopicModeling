review/text: I think most prenatals will do just fine. My first baby was a cinch on prenatals from the local drugstore brand. However, when I was pregnant with her I became gestational diabetic, and after having her it stuck around so I am diabetic and more sensitive to health supplement issues. I was looking for an option that fit my budget, was once a day, food based, and had real vitamin e. I am heavily monitored and supervised as much as I wanted a low-intervention pregnancy both times, but that was not an option for me, so this is as close to my "natural" pregnant self as I can get. I am on a very restrictive, very medically monitored high protein/low carbohydrate high vegetable/lean meat diet for managing my infant's size and health (diabetics have higher infant mortality and fetal demise due to "large body" infants born with low lung and brain development, so I have to be extra careful), so I am not worried about vitamin A and Iron, which some people have said are low in this particular vitamin.I liked the fact that these were available at my local high end grocery, and when I realized they were on Amazon, I bought the bigger bottle. I don't have problems with big pills. I was shocked that these have low level lead, but since then, I've educated myself. I probably had more lead in the prenatals I had taken for my first pregnancy, and my daughter is fine at age 5.5, plus I live in an older home.With this pregnancy, I was nauseated for the first 4 months. That was when I switched to these tablet vitamins, because I was already on zofran and wanted a supplement with ginger in it, and only once a day (my prior vitamins were 2X a day.) I think they work great, don't nauseate me, don't interact with my food or my medications (insulin, labetelol, pepcid)So far so good, we are scheduled for induction tomorrow, and I plan to take these for the year I breastfeed.
