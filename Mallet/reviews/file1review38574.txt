review/text: They are charging a little too much for this since it is $1.99 at our local stores and with the 50 cent coupon on the bottle, it is only $1.49. It is basically a natural product. I do not know what all is in it, but the active ingredient is citric acid, the same stuff that is in citrus fruit, and it is at the recommended 6% solution. My powdered coffee pot/teapot cleaner is also nothing more than citric acid.This stuff is great. I bought it primarily for getting rid of hard water stains on our glass shower doors. We have very hard water. Sometimes the landlady is slow to put more salt in the water softener and the result is we have (had) a really bad mineral buildup on the glass shower doors. I tried everything over the years to get it off - vinegar, KABOOM, SOS pads, Lime Away - you name it, I tried it. Nothing worked. The glass always looked like it was frosted glass instead of clear glass because of the mineral buildup. Until I tried this stuff. More than ten years of mineral buildup from the hard water melted away as if by magic. The buildup on the metal frame dissolved easily but that on the glass doors took repeated applications of the Comet over several hours (mostly letting the stuff soak in). It was worth the effort. For the first time in more than 10 years, the shower doors are clear glass instead of clouded over by hard water buildup. I think now that the old, really hardened on minerals are dissolved, it will be easier to keep the shower doors mineral buildup free by using this product every time I clean the shower.
