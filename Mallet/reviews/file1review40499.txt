review/text: These bars are by far the best tasting nutritional bars I have ever tasted. I am a fitness enthusiast and nutritional bars are a regular part of my daily meal program. I have tried a variety of other bars and flavors...but I liked these ones the most. The price is great (just $9.99 for 12 bars!) and each bar packs 13 grams of protein besides all essential nutrients. These are so good compared to the EAS MYOPLEX Lite bars (15 grams of protein/bar at slightly higer price and tastes just OK!), which I have been taking for a while now. I am planning to buy a whole lot of these bars and stock up, as I know with that irresistible taste, I would be eating them like crazy.
