review/text: I bought this as a gift for Christmas, and I'm almost embarassed to give it. I don't know how it can be called deluxe, when it's just thin pieces of aluminum that look like they will bend with use. Of course I can't try it out to see if it works, because it's a gift. And it's advertised as a 2-pack, buy one & get one free. Well, I only received one. I do hope it works...
