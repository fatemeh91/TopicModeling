review/text: I bought this because I've had another one like it for years that I needed to replace. I feel it is the best pill dispenser for pets (specifically for my cat) because the opening where you put the pill is unusually large so that you can put multiple pills in at the same time. Also, even if you only have to administer one pill, this is a good piller because it doesn't grip the pill like some of the smaller ones do. It just provides a large area where you drop the pill in and then you insert the piller into the pet's mouth and push the plunger to administer the pill. This piller is MUCH easier than any other I've ever used.
