review/text: I'll be frank.....I generally sleep with up to four furry feline friends, depending on the weather outside; a few are old, and sometimes have accidents. I am also likely to have a cup of tea in bed b/4 going to sleep, and sometimes spill. WHO, ME??????I bought two of this size and two larger Priva mattress pad protectors last year to cover (most of) my new king-size mattress; if an accident happened, I was just washing one pad, not whole mattress protector. Although they were under my bottom sheet, they were great to sleep on, made no noise, did not move around much, and did not make bed hotter to sleep on. The pads have now graduated to protecting my new couch, where my 19-year-old cat Sabrina resides until I get a more appropriate 'camping place' for her in the den. Sabrina is mostly blind and with her advanced kidney disease, she blesses these pads daily. I wash them on delicate in warm water, and dry on normal. THEY ARE WONDERFUL. Have been washing twice/week for five months now; they are still as good as new, wash and dry beautifully, and still protect the couch perfectly. Whenever I do need more of these, I'll certainly go back to this brand! HAPPY SHOPPING!
