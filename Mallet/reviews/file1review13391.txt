review/text: I use this larger size, as well as the smaller pads, to protect the carpet from my dog's urine. One of my dogs cannot always "hold it" overnight, and she instinctively knows to use the pads. They hold a high volume of liquid and never drip when picked up. I also use a pad under the dogs' water dish.I use detergent and bleach in the wash and these pads get washed often. They seem to be holding up extremely well. I would definitely recommend this product for use with any kind of anticipated or othwise liquid accidents.
