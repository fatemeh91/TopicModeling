review/text: After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, I was sick with bronchitis, sinusitis, walking pneumonia (requiring antibiotics), and finally, fluid behind the eardrum for over 3 months. I had to continue working since I was the Claims Officer for Keesler AFB and we had to investigate, process and approve hundreds of hurricane-related claims by servicemen. One of the sergeants from another base, recommended the Wellness Formula along with goldenseal. After recovering from the above ailments, I began taking the pills as directed. I take at least three per day and have not been ill for 5 1/2 years. Due to an old injury to my sinus wall, I used to get one or two sinus infections each year, but I have been symptom-free these many months. I have recommended it to friends and family with positive results. Along with the many herbs, the formula contains vitamin C, echinacea, and zinc. I highly recommend it to everyone.
