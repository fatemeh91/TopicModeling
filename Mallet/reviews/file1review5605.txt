review/text: I have seen this (or a VERY similar product) on other sites for $[...] and up. I bought this one because the price was low. The jelly MIGHT rip if you're not careful, but I just took the straps off and wear it with a tight pair of panties instead. It is just the right amount of vibration, not like an industrial-strength vibe. It drives me bananas, and I can't wait to pounce on my bf. The remote works great from more than 25 ft away, and we love wearing it out to a club for discreet fun. I have even used it on my bf before during oral sex, and it drives him wild. The shaft is just right for females or males. I recommend this product for couples who want to have some fun together in public and in private. Just be careful when you're adjusting the batteries or straps, or you might rip the jelly.
