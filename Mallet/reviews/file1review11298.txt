review/text: ...Finally something that works. I've only been taking it for about a week but so far I'm feeling much better. I've had a serious problem with Candida for the last two years. After trial after trial of diflucan with NO IMPROVEMENTS at all I had to take things into my own hands. I've also tried candex. Works well also but is really hard to take on an empty stomach on my schedule...I only rated it a four because I don't think my problem is completely gone but it's deffinately improved from SEVERE to mild symptoms. Best of luck.
