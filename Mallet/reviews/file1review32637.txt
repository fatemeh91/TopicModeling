review/text: I got so sick and tired of dry bars for sustenance on the go. I am so happy I found these. They are moist, delicious and nutritious.The company has excellent customer service as well. I had an issue with one of their bars and they were quick to respond and replace the product. I have consumed over 200 of these bars and I have not had any issues before and most importantly, I have not yet gotten sick of them and don't think I will for a really really long time. Especially with all the other flavors available. I think this is very important as I have purchased energy bars, candy bars, protein bars but hardly ever stuck with one type for a very long time because they are very difficult to eat day after day.Some have mentioned "high calorie" issues, but this is like a meal replacement bar, so I am not sure it is an issue....it really has the right amount in my opinion, but this is obviously up to personal need.I have seen these in stores for $3.89 per bar, so obviously Amazon price is great. But to me the cost isn't all that high as this replaces one of my meals, or supplements meals on late nights. I used to satisfy my 2AM hunger at fast food restaurants, but now I can just pop one of these and feel satisfied.
