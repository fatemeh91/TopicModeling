review/text: We decided to buy this product despite being told that only rectal thermometer is accurate for infants. Nevertheless, knowing the usual high quality of Braun products, we gave it a try and are very happy about it!It's one of the best investments we've ever made. We loved the following features:- You do not disturb the baby and can measure the temperature even if the baby is asleep;- The result is displayed in 2 seconds;- Very ergonomic;- With an easy used lens filter ejector, can be used for the whole family.The thermometer has a convenient feature of switching between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales. Also, if you need more than 1 temperature measurement stored in the memory, you can consider Braun IRT 4520 - it saves 8 readings.Excellent gift, especially for baby shower!
