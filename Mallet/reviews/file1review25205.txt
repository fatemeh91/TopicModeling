review/text: I love my Sennheiser wireless headphones -- except for the battery. This battery rarely lasts more than 2 hours. That's why I have a charging unit that charges two batteries. Also to keep in mind -- these batteries wear out fast. There's only so often you can recharge these things before they die completely. If I'd known how many of these $20 batteries I'd be going though, I would probably have picked a different brand of wireless headset.
