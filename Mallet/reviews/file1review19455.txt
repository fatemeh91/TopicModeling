review/text: We used this seat to train our daughter & she LOVED using the big potty just like mommy. It easily fit the elongated bowls that the house we use to live in had. We have since moved & it won't fit the kid's bathroom bowl that we currently have, so I will have to buy something else to potty train my son. The (new) lid has a very curvy shape & a safety lid that won't slam shut and this potty seat won't even go down into it, even at the smallest adjustment. It does fit a standard size bowl fine so we may still use it in another bathroom. Otherwise, I would have given this seat five stars. The only drawback I noticed the last time we used it is the adjustment (to fit it to your toilet seat) tends to move and I would have to retighten it every few days to keep the seat stable. Another excellent product from Baby Bjorn.
