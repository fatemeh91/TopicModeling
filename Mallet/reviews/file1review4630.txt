review/text: I typing this with 9 fingers, having nicely cut the 10th while mishandling this massive, unwieldy razor, which I received as a gift. My face has nicks on it for the second day running - corners of the mouth, where it's hard to maneuver this brick. I shave my head as well as my face and frankly this razor scares the heck out of me, it's an unnecessarily complex and overdone gadget brought to you by the company that in the 1960s (and this is a quote from Wikipedia about a well-known fact) "was accused of exploiting customers by forcing them to buy rust-prone [carbon steel blades]" because it "held a patent on stainless blades but had not acted on it".Thanks Gillette, for putting profit before product and customers. I never had a problem with the Mach 3. Hopefully my finger will heal in a week or so but this razor is going in the trash today.
