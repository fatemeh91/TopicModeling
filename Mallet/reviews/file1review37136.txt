review/text: I thought this product worked well, but I wouldn't call it the best deodorant I've ever used. Even though it says it goes on clear I noticed when I took off my shirt the white residuals of deodorant were left behind. As an antiperspirant and deodorant it does the job adequately and the price is very reasonable comparable to other brands.
