review/text: My dermatologist had frozen off the warts on one of my toes before, but they came back multiple times. I had tried the do-it-yourself freeze off products, too. Nothing worked long-term until I tried the wart stick. It's very important to apply the product to the wart and ONLY the wart. Getting the product on skin around the wart will lead to irritated skin...My only other advice is to apply the wart stick as directed. I used it every morning until my warts went away. They're still gone six months later!
