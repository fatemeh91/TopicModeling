review/text: My brother put me on to this and I was VERY skeptical. I had tried many different formulations and none of them seem to work. But I was desperate and ready to try anything. After just a few days, I noticed an improvement. My knees feel stronger and there is less pain. Swelling is definitely reduced.The pills are large & difficult to take whole, but I've been biting them down into fourths (has a citrus taste) and have been able to easily swallow them. It is cheaper to take a Vit. D supplement than buying the Vitamin D formulation and it was cheaper to go through Amazon Prime and subscription than to order from another vendor. Also, the Osteo Bi-flex website has a "club" that you can enter codes on to get up to a $5 coupon.
