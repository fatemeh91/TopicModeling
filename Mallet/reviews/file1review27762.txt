review/text: The "Delicious Strawberry" product tastes too much like Pepto-Bismol. Not that I don't like Pepto-Bismol but that is for when you are sick, not well. It makes it hard to drink for me. Also the body of the product seems inconsistent for me when prepared either in a blender or shaker. I am not really sure about this but it just seems that there are portions that are more viscous, almost like lumps, but not quite.As far as the nutrition effects of this product I am unable to say.
