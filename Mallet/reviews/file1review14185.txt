review/text: I, too have undergone treatment for throat cancer. At different stages liquid nutrition is all that I could or can manage. This is my favorite flavor and is impossible to find locally. I can't consume chocolate or coffee so my options are limited.Before radiation treatment I preferred Scandishakes which have more calories, are powdered, you make them with real milk and they taste more like real milkshakes, however, after radiation with a sore throat I found that the Scandisahkes, even with almond milk as a substitute for real milk, aggravated my sore throat.I've tried Boost, CVS' copy and a Carnation product (in vanilla flavor) and like the flavor and consistency of Ensure the best.
