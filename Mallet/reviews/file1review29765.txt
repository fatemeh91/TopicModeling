review/text: I got these washable pads, as I was loathe to have to use disposables. But while these are fine for a home, I really can't wear them in public, as they're too obvious. They might not be so visible under a padded or molded nursing bra, but under a soft-cup one they're totally obvious since they aren't at all contoured (in fact, they kind of contoured a bit opposite, toward the lace side).As far as size (I'm a C/D cup now, with average-sized nips), comfort, and absorbency these are great, but I'll be reserving them for use at home and during the night.
