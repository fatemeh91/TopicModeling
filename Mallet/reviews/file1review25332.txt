review/text: Very cheap and doesn't work. When you blow into the chestpiece you can hear it, but you can't hear a heartbeat or breathing when placed on chest. It's just not sensitive enough. I bought it as a child's toy, hoping they could hear their heart, but doesn't look like that will be possible. Very disappointed!
