review/text: I'm not sure how other people can give these a good review, or maybe I don't know what they're supposed to be used for? Certainly not diapers! My mother recommended that I get some flatfold cloth diapers just for cleaning up messes, using for burp pads, etc. The ones she meant were the cushioned ones, however. These are the consistency of cheesecloth - I mean like, see-through! I'm returning immediately.
