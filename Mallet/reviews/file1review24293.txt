review/text: Ordered WalkFit inserts for myself and my fiancee. Followed their instructions for about 10 days (3 days past their "break in" period). I couldn't wait to get them out of my shoes by the end of the day. Foot adjusted somewhat, but not that much. Same with my fiancee. Decided to return them.Sent them back via UPS with deliver confirmation and signature. Walk Fit received them back in mid-September, 2005. No refund given as of yet. No returned emails or phone calls to customer service.Bottom line: WalkFit doesn't live up to ANY of their statements, including their refund policy.I should have known better at the time to buy something off of the TV, but I learned my lesson again.
