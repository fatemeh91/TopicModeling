review/text: The whey protein by Optimum Nutrition works great for me as I have compared it to other whey protein shakes that I have purchased before. I seem to have adequate energy for work outs and recover fairly well when drinking this ON shake. It may not be for everyone especially if you prefer more tastier variations, but I can attest that this product is of fine quality and you surely will not regret purchasing it.
