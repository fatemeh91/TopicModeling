review/text: We purchased this sweeper for quick cleanups, especially for the messes made by our baby during feedings. Without much effort, it picks-up the majority of the crumbs and leaves the floor looking halfway decent. Does it do as a good a job as a powered vacuum? No - nor were we expecting it would. Does it do a respectable job of keeping the floor clean enough between "real" vacuuming sessions, sure does. It's worked for us on hardwood floors, our low-pile carpeting as well as Oriental rugs. For the price we paid (low $20s), it makes it easy to do light cleaning with one hand while holding the baby and was well worth the cost.
