review/text: Bought these along with a charger 9 months ago and they've performed flawlessly. They're used in my kids' video game controllers and accessories so they've been recharged several times and last quite a while between charges. I'm ordering more now for other electronics in our house.Pros:Saving money by not buying disposablesLong life in electronicsNo noticeable shortening of battery life span after 9 months of useCons:Recharge time is considerable with standard Sony charger, at least 6-8 hours if not more
