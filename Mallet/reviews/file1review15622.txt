review/text: This is my favourite recent discovery! A friend recommended this product & I have been using it for about a year & a half now and I would hate to be without it.I apply the cream under my arms every 6-9 days and the smell goes away! (I sometimes forget to re-apply periodically and I am reminded by a bad smell that is there even after bathing). I really appreciate that my body is allowed to eliminate toxins through sweat as nature intended but without the smell!I find most traditional antiperspirants with aluminum derivatives in them make my fingers tingle after application (That can't be good for me).I am very pleased with this product and I find it works well! I like to buy the Larger Size because I find it to be a better value! Lavilin Underarm Deodorant Cream - Large Size, NOW FoodsI typically get 6-9 days out of each application.BRAVO Lavilin! Keep up the good work! Thanks for creating & selling a product that helps me stay healthy & smell good at the same time!
