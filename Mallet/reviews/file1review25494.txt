review/text: This will shave all nose/ear hair. Wet/Dry and waterproof, completely portable, there is nothing not to like. It does everything it should with no errors. Hard to imagine this product any better.Edit:The above is my original review. One year later, it is broken. I have since switched to the Grommmate stainless steel and manual trimmer, which is cheaper and just as effective, albeit slower; it is also less likely to break.In short: this device works great, until... it stops working.
