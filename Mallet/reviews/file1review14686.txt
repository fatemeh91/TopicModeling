review/text: I would like to second the concern about this product's effects on depression. If you have a history of depression please consider staying away from vinpocetine. If you do decide to go ahead and get it, start with a low dose for a week or so and stop taking it if you notice increasing irritability and other symptoms. If you keep going it can get really bad really quick and take quite a few days to recover. That said, this is really vinpocetine and for many people it is beneficial. So, I'm giving it 4 stars anyway. Product fine, shipping quick. It isn't the seller's fault that different people have different biochemistry.
