review/text: Good product for the price, tastes nasty like the smell of semen or something. Maybe fish paste. I reccomend buying empty gel capsuls instead of drinking it. This, in combination with the NOW amino acid capsuls (I bough those in capsul form) and jack3d have helped me put on five pounds in curls and mil press and fifteen in squats. Overall I've gained around 7 pounds in weight in the month I've been taking it. With just the jack3d I was only putting on 3-4 a month, so it seems to work good in combination for sure.
