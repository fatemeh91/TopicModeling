review/text: I purchased 10 of these, had them engraved with the recipient's name and gave them as Christmas presents to clients who are generally corporate executives (Pres., CFO, etc). They are the perfect combination of attractive appearance and great utility. CFO's in particular like the mechanical pencils and the red ink for marking up reports. I visited one customer last week (where I had given several of these) and found that both the President and the CFO had them sitting in the middle of their desk and were using them regularly.
