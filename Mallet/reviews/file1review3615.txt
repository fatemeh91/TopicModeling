review/text: First, please realize that any review of a personal lubricant is going to be subjective because everyone has different expectations of a product like this. With that said, I do not recommend this product. I am working my way through all of the top brands of silicone-based lube in order to find the one I prefer. So far I've tried 4 of them: ID Millennium, Swiss Navy, Wet Platinum, and Gun Oil. Of these, ID Millennium ranks dead last for the following reason: it is too viscous (thick and heavy), allows too much friction, a lot more of the product is needed to remain comfortable, and is not at all "silky" as I experienced with the other silicone-based products mentioned above. The ID actually reminds me of using heavy petroleum jelly when I was a kid...not pleasant! I would recommend any of those other brands before this one because they are all much more silky than the ID, which enhances sensation. This product actually seems to diminish sensitivity. Of the 4 I've tried I would rank them as follows (best to worst): 1) Gun Oil 2) Swiss Navy 3) Wet platinum 4) ID millennium. The ID was so uncomfortable for me that, after 2 or 3 uses, I gave up on it and purchased another bottle of Swiss Navy, which I think is the best value because it seems to last the longest. Hope this helps.
