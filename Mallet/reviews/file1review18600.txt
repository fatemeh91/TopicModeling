review/text: NOW Sports Chocolate Whey Protein Isolate is the best protein supplement I've every used. It really does dissolve well and it's the best tasting protein powder I've every had.I don't get fancy with my drinks. My impatience prohibits me from using a blender, so after every workout I just throw a scoop and a half into a measuring cup and pour some Horizon Organic Chocolate Lowfat Milk over that bad boy (to equal 16 fl oz.) and mix it lickety-split with a fork and I'm left with little-to-no clumping (make sure you use enough liquid for the powder to dissolve in). In a blender, it would probably be smooth as silk. And if you wanna get silly with your concoctions, I'm sure this protein powder would do you right.What I also love is that it's all natural which means no starch, yeast, wheat, gluten, preservatives or artificial sweeteners. I've no doubt this contributes to my lack of gastrointestinal discomfort while taking this supplement.So, there ya have it. Live whey larger, NOW with a healthy peace of mind. You know you like it!
