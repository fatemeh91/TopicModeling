review/text: This monitor is much more accurate than my old "pump" type Omron - spot on with the doctors office every time so I know I can trust it at home. Standard cuff fits my arms just right (I'm 5'2" and 128 lbs at 49 years old - just saying since this is something I wished was in more reviews to help me know what size cuff to buy). I've had no problems at all with error readings - I suspect those that have maybe had the cuff on wrong (or wrong size cuff) or moved during the process - you do need to sit still so be in a comfortable position before hitting start. Love the memory feature and irregular heartbeat function. Blood pressure readings almost always vary from reading to reading, even at doctors office, so you have to realize that is normal and not any fault of the machine. Take a few minutes to relax after setting up before hitting start to get most accurate reading. Don't cross legs and breath normally. Unless you got the occasional "lemon", this BP monitor works great!
