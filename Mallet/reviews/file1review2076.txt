review/text: After surgery on my hip, I needed a cane that provided me with better support than the generic ones sold at CVS. This cane provides additional support as I go upstairs and downstairs, or off and on pavements. The case was very easy to adjust to fit my height, and has become a permanent part of the equipment I use to get around. Though the cane is little pricey, it is worth it. Please note that if you buy a right hand cane, you can only use it in your right hands. you won't be able to use it with your left hand comfortably. So think before you buy. Which hand will you be using your cane in? IF you are having surgery on your left hip, then a right hand cane will work better and prevents you from limping around, and vice versa for surgery on your right hip--according to my physical therapist.
