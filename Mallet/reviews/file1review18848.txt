review/text: When I first got this product I use the recommended serving 1oz. It tastes good, I took it with the 8oz of water they suggest. Later in the day I started having lots of gas. I thought maybe it was something I ate with it so I decided to take it by itself in the morning before I ate breakfast and I had the same experience. I decided to reduce the serving to 1/2oz mixed into 8oz of water. That seemed to work better. It still gives me gas but it is not as severe. I will continue to use it but not everyday, maybe 2 times per week because I can't take it daily.
