review/text: Don't get me wrong, our Bjorn trainer is a keeper- has a great seal, extra pee guard in the front, adjustable fit, and the handle makes for easy storage and cleanup. But, when it comes to toilet seats for training...let's be honest...you can find a cheaper one that does the job. This one is just maybe the Cadillac of trainers? I wouldn't buy this one again, but would certainly want one as a gift!
