review/text: This modest-sized plug stands about 4-1/4" tall (3-3/4" insertable), with a maximum diameter of about 1.4" (just under 1-1/2"). This size definitely does not require "power user" status for insertion. Lubrication is essential, of course, and one should always take things slowly and patiently. But with gentle persistence and relaxation, insertion should not be difficult for anyone with some experience. The smooth taper enhances ease of insertion.Once inserted, the plug tends to stay in place. I was concerned that the taper nearest the base might be too modest for secure retention, but that doesn't seem to be a problem. Tantus claims that this gentle taper enhances the wearing experience, and there may be some truth to that -- its presence seems to be more noticeable than others I have tried. But it is very comfortable to wear. The silicone surface is mirror-smooth and easy to clean. The flanged base is small enough not to become annoying.This would be the "desert island" plug to have, in my view -- not too big, yet big enough to make its presence felt.
