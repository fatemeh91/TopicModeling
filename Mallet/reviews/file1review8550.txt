review/text: I have been buying OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature 2-in-1 Bottle & Nipple Cleaner prior to getting this brush. I thought the Oxo was great but brought the Tommee Tippee on sale for only couple of dollars. I wouldn't buy the Tommee Tippee for $1 after using it since it really doesn't clean all that well. The OXO Tot Brush is nice but the top gets destroyed after a few weeks so I keep finding myself buying more and more. The OXO Good Grip has held up very very well and cleans well also. It looks like it'll last me a few months each so I'm saving money buying this vs the other OXO. What I do miss is the Nipple Cleaner but I saved the ones from the other one and use it separately. I can't be finding myself buying brushes all the time so Good Grip it is.
