review/text: My 1st Shave Pro Cordless Shaver failed due to my fault not reading the instructions and letting it be overcharged. It should not be charged more than 2 hours max! It's so cheap, I bought a 2nd one right away and it is even better than the 1st one. Very quite and powerful! I am very happy with its performance and price! The only con is that it must be charged before shaving. Using a cord will not work like some other cordless shavers such as Braun Series Men's Shaver, which I also happen to own as a backup. Great price! Great performance!
