review/text: I bought this product for my mother, whose cabinets have always made me want to take a brillo pad to them. I have used several cleaning products on my mother's cabinets over the years that either didn't get them clean enough or damaged the finish on the wood. Parker and Bailey Kitchen Cabinet Cream removed the greasy residue from my mom's cabinets without having to scrub too hard and it didn't damage the wood. The only thing I would change about it is the size of the bottle. I need more!
