review/text: For years I tried finding an after-shave lotion that actually did something for the ferocious razor burn and irritation that plagued me after a shave. I've used other Nivea products for a while, and when I heard about their Men's line of shaving products, I hoped for the best.Without a doubt this is the best after-shave lotion I have ever tried. I've tried name brands and generics, but nothing comes close to soothing my skin without smelling like a chemical vat. There is a faint scent with this product, but it's a mild, clean smell that doesn't threaten to offend.I think the bottle design is great, though the chump who gave it a bad review because he dropped it should probably invest in some hand towels for his bathroom before he hurts himself again. I mean, who applies a product with wet hands to dilute its effectiveness?Great stuff, Nivea. My skin thanks you.
