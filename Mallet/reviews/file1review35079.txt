review/text: I didn't expect it to work to be honest. But somehow it did really help. Maybe it's physcological I don't know. A couple sprays on the tongue and I was very calm for at least a few hours. It does taste like alcohol a little bit but it's not unpleasant at all. I was able to travel with it internationally in my purse as well so that was helpful. Give it a try you might be surprised.
