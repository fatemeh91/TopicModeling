review/text: We have not used any of the batteries in this package - not even to "power" the little free electric car that was included in the wrapper.I chose the Energizer brand and this size pack because we've been quite satisfied with Energizer batteries in the past, Amazon has the best price per unit and I know we won't run out......unless my 81 year old husband suddenly develops a great interest in playing with tiny little electric cars..........In fact, it is possible the batteries may be in the drawer long after their expiration date.But, heck, Amazon keeps asking me to write reviews on what I buy, so I did my best for y'all out there.
