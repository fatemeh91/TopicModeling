review/text: I bought this (at a store) for my husband who has sinus-induced migraines. It smells like old corn when heated. I thought the smell would go away after use or at least after washing. Not! When you have a raging migraine, who wants to smell that awful smell?! I am geting him something else - preferably with no odor!
