review/text: I've been using green vibrance now for 3 years and it's kept me feeling healthier than ever. I rarely get sick and I feel good knowing that I'm taking all the stuff that helps to build a strong immune system with tons of cancer-fighting agents. I mix it up with an emergen-c packet along with some liquid vitamins, and protein powder in a little juice and it's delicious. You can also ad some frozen fruit and it's like a berry milkshake. In my opinion, it's an an essential part of anyone's diet!
