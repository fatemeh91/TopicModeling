review/text: After hip replacement, a sock aid is a necessity. The Terry Cloth Sock Aid is wonderful, and easy to use, and friendly to nylons. I'd like to offer a little tip: when your toes reach the stocking toe, press your toes to the floor and hold them there so when the rest of the stocking is pulled on, your toes will not be too tightly encased.I have 3 types of stocking aids, but this is my favorite!
