review/text: I just finished using this product. It took me 9 days instead of 7 since I would only use one strip on certain days when I experienced some sensitivity in my teeth.I really liked this product, I posted my before and after pic in the customer gallery up there, check it out and you can see my results. As you'll be able to see by the pictures, my teeth are obviously less yellow and much brighter.The bottom half of my teeth are still a bit yellow, but with another pack I might be able to get a shade whiter if I want. Overall, this was a great product for the price.If you do experience sensitivity like I did, cut it down to one strip pack a day like I did and I think you'll find that it still works just as well. Definitely check out my before and after photo and see the kind of results I got!
