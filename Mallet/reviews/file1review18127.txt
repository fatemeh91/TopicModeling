review/text: I bought this mask in April and while traveling in May it fell apart. Just like other reviewers, the mask separated in to two. I had one I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond 4 years ago that never had this defect. The only reason why I bought a new one, was the elastic on my old one was not as snug. I would recommend buying this else where as it was defective.
