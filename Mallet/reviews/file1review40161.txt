review/text: I purchased this yoga set because I needed a mat, but thought it would also be nice to have the blocks and the straps. I used the mat once, but it was so slippery that I found it distracting during my yoga classes, so I ended up getting a better, less slippery mat. It was more expensive but worth it. Instead of returning this set, I'm using the mat & blocks as a back up for my at home practices.
