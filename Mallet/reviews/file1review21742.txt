review/text: These are decent filters for the money. Unfortunately (for me) they decided to make the 12x25x1 filter 11x24x1 which proved to be too small for my unit. I tried shifting it every way possible but the only position it seems to fully cover and not allow dust and debris into the coils is shoved way down. Problem is the filter then gets soaking wet from the condensation channel that runs below it. Shame this company didn't decide to go ahead and make the filter the TRUE size stated on the package. I have no use for these now. Yes, I am blaming the maker for something I knew when I ordered them, but when I really think about it, it is the actual size that should be listed on the package. Not a fictional size.
