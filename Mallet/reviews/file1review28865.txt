review/text: Great price for a tub of this size. Warning, tastes horrible in water, but tastes JUST like regular chocolate milk when mixed with milk. It says to only mix one scoop, but that's only 25g of protein. Mix two scoops every time you drink it. You can mix the two massive scoops in as little as 8 ounces of milk and it will taste just fine without any undisolved chunks.
