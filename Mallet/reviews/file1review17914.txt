review/text: The price on this seemed too good to be true, and that is the case. This is not the same color as my previous bottle and does not have the same scent. I gave it to my teenage son, because I didn't want to bother with a return (and the box was open). I don't recommend this particular purchase, even though this is my favorite scent.
