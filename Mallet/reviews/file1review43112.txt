review/text: I am 29 weeks and I work on stand on my feet for work at least five shifts a week. By hour 3 or 4, my back is killing me. At the end of the day, I get some intense contractions, so I sought this out after reading about it in Baby Bargains. I want to love it, but it's way too big. Pre-pregnancy I was at least a 16/18 or XL/XXL. I wear a medium or large at Motherhood/Pea in the Pod in pants and large or XL in tops (baby is all hips and up - have lost weight). On the tightest/smallest setting, the large is WAY TOO LARGE. TOO LARGE as in feels the same as my pants panel's. I'm not even sure a medium would be small enough? I may have ordered the wrong size prenatal cradle, but I followed their guidelines; I was worried the large would be too small. Disappointed that I need to return it, and that I had to buy one from Motherhood out of desperation.
