review/text: Im a new into the field of body building and im starting off with the 100% whey double choco. Ive only had 2 or 3 shakes, because i just got the 10.37 lb bag yesterday. They taste GREAT. Literally tastes like a mc. donalds shake. (could be good or bad to somepeople, but definetely drinkable) The only problem i noticed, when coming back to this site is that it doesnt look like you can order 10 pounders of this anymore? Did I get the last one or what? Ill keep you updated every month or so on how its workin.
