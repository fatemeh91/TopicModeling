review/text: There's a reason why it's rated #1. This is the only way to go and has great tasting flavors, well so far I have only tried chocolate and vanilla, but it's perfect.I have had probably about a dozen different brands of whey protein and this is hands down the best. No foamy or synthetic tasting stuff here.Nothing left to say except "buy some".
