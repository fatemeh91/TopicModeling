review/text: The C-Plus Cold Tablets are a godsend! My kids, now 3 and 4, have started taking these at 1 and 2, from the first sign of a cold all the way to the end. There have been times when I ran out and the difference is clear. The colds seem to be of shorter duration and not as severe. Plus, my kids LOVE them and always ask for them when they start sniffling with a runny nose. They were SO excited when at 3, they were allowed to take 3 tabs instead of 2!These work. I don't think you have to be adamant about giving them to your child every hour like the directions say, though. I keep them in my purse and at home and give it to them whenever I remember, which averages out to about every 3 hours or so, and they've still worked fine.I don't like medicating my children at such an early age, so I'm glad that these are all natural. Take with the Hyland's Cough and Cold and your child will be symptom free in no time!
