review/text: I just received this product today and had to rush home to try it out! I tried it out on my underarms and one of my lower legs. The legs were a bit painful, but nothing too bad. Like past reviewers felt like a mix between rubber band snaps and electrical shocks. But it was completely bearable. The underarms were a bit more painful, but completely worth it! I had 2 days worth of growth and it ripped the hair out right from the roots, shaft and all! I was amazed at how thoroughly it removed the hair. Less than 2 min per arm and I was 100% hair free! Waxing normally took me 20 min per underarm and I had to spend another 20 tweezing out the missed hairs. This is a definite timesaver and as long as the results last as long as waxing, I'll be very happy!! I highly recommend!
