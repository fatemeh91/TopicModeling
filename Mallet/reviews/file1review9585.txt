review/text: Bought a box of these (different flavor) from my local BJ's and thought they were terrific. Lots of protein and only 9 points on the weight watchers plan. Ordered these off amazon even though they were more expensive because I wanted to try a different flavor. I've only opened two of these so far, and both were kinda melted then hardened back up, so the gooey creamy stuff was on the outside and the chocolate had a dusting of white specks that usually indicates that chocolate is old. Normally if I open a candy bar and it looks like that I either return it or throw it away, but these are NOT candy bars, and they can be quite expensive. So I ate the first one, and it was ....... just ok. Not horrid, but not great either. Dry, chalky and heavy. (drink plenty of liquid with these)Just opened the second one, and it was even worse than the first. It didn't taste right, and I couldn't finish it. Probably going to end up throwing most if not all of the rest of the box away. My advice? Buy these locally (at BJ's and Sam's club they're about $20.00 a box), they'll be fresher and not all melted.
