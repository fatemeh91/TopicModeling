review/text: I bought Perfect Food to up my greens intake and to accompany a detox/cleanse that I am doing. The taste is so bad, I just can't keep drinking this stuff! The first time, I mixed it with some blended veggies and fruits and was able to choke it back. I tried it with plain water and YUCK!!! I tried regular bottled, organic apple juice and NOPE. Finally, I tried mixing it in with unsweetened almond milk. After being close to gagging every time I drank this stuff, I finally gave up. I consider myself pretty tolerable of "gross" foods, especially when it comes to better health. But this stuff is just nasty! On another note, Garden of Life makes an antioxidant berry mix and this one isn't bad at all. But I'll be looking for another brand of green food to try.
