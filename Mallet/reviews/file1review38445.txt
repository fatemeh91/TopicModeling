review/text: I just recieved this item yesterday. I tried it today, I couldn't wait but, when I saw it, it was a little frighting. Let me tell you it is great!!!! I have hair on my chin that I have used everything to get rid of and nothing worked, I would either break out which made it more noticable or it didn't work at all. It does hurt a little, not as much as I thought, but the results are worth it. The only drawback is that it does take a few tries, what I am doing is, I did it once, waited an hour did it again and then once more. I would say it got 85 percent of the hair which for me was a tremendous improvement!! I am so happy that I finally got the nerve to spend the money.
