review/text: This shipped in a 100% frustration free package in a little paper box, unlike the burglary proof plastic-sealed retail cases you find locked up behind glass in your local store that treats you like a would-be shop-lifter. For as long as I live in the US, I don't think I'll buy razor blades any other way again; this is perfect.
