review/text: I purchased this item for a family member several years ago, and have not used it very much because it seems more flimsy and less comfortable than others that we own. The real problem is that it retains odors after usage, despite washing and soaking in baking soda. The only way I can get the odor out is to spray the pad with an odor-eliminator spray. We have other pads, inclulding some made by this same company, where odors wash out easily and completely with nothing more than detergent. Perhaps they have improved this since I purchased it, but based on my experience I would not recommend this item.
