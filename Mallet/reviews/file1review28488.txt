review/text: Short and sweet, this is my routine:1. 1 serving with almond milk first thing in the morning2. 1 serving with water (room temperature) after breaking hell loose in the gym.3. 1 serving of syntha 6 with almond milk before bedtime.I take double rich chocolate which is decent tasting, sometimes add torani sugar-free raspberry syrup. If you're going through the amount of pain I go through at the gym, you couldn't care less for the taste. If not, why are you reading this?
