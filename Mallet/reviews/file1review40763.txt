review/text: I don't like to leave negative reviews, generally...but here's one:This razor could come in handy under certain circumstances, but I stopped using it after my fourth or fifth time. I rarely cut myself with the inexpensive (generic double blade) razors I usually use, but with the Intuition Razor I've knicked myself every time, often more than once. Also if your hands are soapy it slips out of grip frequently. That's very annoying when you're trying to take care not to cut yourself. (Didn't they use a focus group who could have clued them in on that?) Lastly, after a few uses the soap part wore down substantially.
