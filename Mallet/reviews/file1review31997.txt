review/text: I have tried this product at least three separate times. Each time I have the same problem; I get diarrhea that takes weeks to get rid of. I don't mind the taste, am confident of the company (I've taken their probiotic for years) but for some reason this particular product, which I would like to take because of its alkaline nature and "green-ness," just causes havoc with my system. I can take a very small amount, like a half teaspoon, without a problem, but if I work up to half a scoop, I get the runs. I've encountered one other person, a medical professional who has a *very* good diet, who had the same problem.But it won't hurt you to give it a try; just don't buy a huge quantity to start with. If it works for you, it should be a great product.
