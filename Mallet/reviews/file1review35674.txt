review/text: We have been a fan of the BodySox for several years. It is an excellent idea developed by a movement therapist who actually makes a living from selling them. Therapy Express has knocked off the BodySox as have others who try to get away with it by spelling it differently-BodySock. But these are not the original product..don't be fooled by the stolen name which by the way is trademarked. Amazon should not support this kind of behavior.
