review/text: This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more. The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: rice, allspice, mustard seeds, juniper berries, black pepper, ginger and cloves.Uses beyond home comfort include, taking this with me in the car when I go out to do grocery shopping in the winter. I won't leave home without it! It works well to warm your feet on a cold night and can be placed inside pillows for added comfort in the winter.If you get a lot of headaches, you can keep this in the freezer. Fold in half and thenput it behind your head (like a pillow behind your neck) to get rid of a migraine faster.~The Rebecca Review
