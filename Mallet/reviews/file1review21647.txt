review/text: After he outgrew the plastic tub in the kitchen sink, we decided to try the snug tub. It is a great product and I highly recommend it. It fits right into the regular tub, yet requires much less water and the water stays warmer longer. Our son loves to play and splash and can lay back and rest his head comfortably while we wash his hair. It is also great for travelling to grandma and grandpa's and stores easily. It is one of the best baby products we have found.
