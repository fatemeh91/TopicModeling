review/text: I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift. I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right: it applies easily and the sent lingers but isn't overly powerful. I personally got 'Peace of Mind' and it's a refreshing scent that makes me think of a 'i-just-brushed-my-teeth' feel. The price is affordable and my order came in 2 days instead of the 3-5 which i expected, especially since Christmas is so close by. You won't be disappointed.
