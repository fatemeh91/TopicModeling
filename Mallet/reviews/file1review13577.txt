review/text: I'm using DryIdea for a while now as deodorant, my skin is a bit sensitive so I prefer scent-free ones. And unfortunately everything else leaves very annoying spots in shirts - especially white ones - which are hard to wash out. I don't have that problem anymore since using DryIdea and it works for me well all day too. So I would absolutely recommend it.
