review/text: This was a replacement for an earlier OXO soap/scrub brush because the bristles on the prior one had worn out and the soap was impossible to get out; it lacked the push button feature on the lid and relied upon you putting pressure on the entire brush to dispense soap. Sometimes it worked, most times it didn't and became worse as time passed. Eventually, this brush began leaking. The replacement subject brush (36481) didn't leak and had the great push button feature on the lid, however, the lid kept coming off as its locking part locked in a manner that would unlock with my circular scrubbing motion causing a majority of the soap to spill out. I discontinued putting soap in it. This is a feature that is sorely missed and was the main reason I had purchased it. So now, I am looking for my 3rd OXO scrubber that doesn't leak, has a push button soap dispensing feature and a lid that stays locked in place while in use. I am reading the reviews of the newer, more expensive scrubber and am arriving at the conclusion it might not serve my needs either.
