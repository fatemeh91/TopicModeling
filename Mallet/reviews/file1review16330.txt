review/text: I was a bit hesitant about ordering these given that there's a review sharply critical of the scent. I've used them for a few loads and have had no problems at all with the scent. It just smells like soap, and it is very hard to tell the difference between the orange scent (this product) and the "fresh scent" and normal versions (which are the two versions I normally buy). The Fresh Scent and the regular versions smell a bit more soapy than the Orange Scent version, but it's a very close call.It works just as well as the fresh scent and regular versions - gets all my dishes and glasses clean with no film or spotting.In general, Finish Powerball is less effective than Finish Quantum, but not by much. I keep a few tabs of the Quantum version around for when I have a really bad baked-on mess for pans. For normal use the Powerball since it works great and costs less. Both the Quantum and Powerball eliminate the need to use a rinse agent to keep spots off glasses and silverware, which further adds to the savings.Works great and smells just like normal dishwasher soap. Highly recommend.
