review/text: BAD-BAD-BAD PRODUCT EXPERIENCE. THIS IS THE LAST MODEL WATER PIC; I DON'T KNOW IF THE 2 EARLIER ONES I USED WERE EARLIER MODELS (WITH SEVERAL YEARS' LIFE)WERE MADE IN CHINA, BUT THIS ONE WAS MADE IN CHINA. IT LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR---WITHIN WARRANTY. THEY SENT 3 REPLACEMENTS FOR A TOTAL LIFE OF THE 3 A TOTAL OF ONE YEAR MAXIMUM; AND I RETURNED 2 OF THEM SO THAT MFR. COULD "INSPECT" THEM. THEY ALL SEIZED. MFR CLAIMED I SHOULD EXERCISE MORE CARE IN RINSING AND USING. I NEVER RECEIVED THEIR "INSPECTION" RESULTS.I FINALLY REPLACED WATER PIC WITH A CONAIR "INTERPLAK" (MADE IN CHINA) MACHINE WHICH I HAVE BEEN USING OVER 2 YEARS---RELIABLY!!!---AT BEDTIME, SAME USAGE PATTERN AS I USED WITH WATER PIC.
