review/text: Ok... I was going to wait until I was actually pregnant to write a review but I couldn't! Im not pregnant yet but I can tell that this product is DEFINITELY doing something! I bought two bottles and started taking it on July 5 towards the end of my period. I experienced cramping in the beginning but they went away in about a week. When I came on my cycle again, July 24 in noticed way more fluid around ovulation time than usual. Now that I am on my cycle again, which started August 17, I noticed a change in my menstrual flow. The blood isn't dark, syrupy, and offensive in order like usual. So, I can definitely concluded that fertile aid is doing something! Oh... My cycles are very regular and fertile aid didn't interfere with that at all! :-)Now I am going to start trying to make a baby this month. Keep you posted. And wish me luck!
