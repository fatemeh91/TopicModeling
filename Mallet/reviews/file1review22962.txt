review/text: We needed something to help keep our carpet clean between vacuuming. I remembered that my mother had a carpet sweeper and I knew that would do the trick. As it is becoming more difficult to buy a lot of old school products locally I came to Amazon, I knew they would have them.Have been using it since it arrived at our door. One complaint, the top portion of the handle has a habit of coming off and you have stop to put it back on.
