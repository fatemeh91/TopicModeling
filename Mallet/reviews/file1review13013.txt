review/text: I purchased the Elasto-gel Cervical Collar. It was a god send. I have a bludging disk in my neck. Was so nice to get some much needed releaf. I love it. My neck is much better now thanks to a Cortizone shot and the collar.But it is in the freezer waiting for a flare up. Good job guys. Love your products.Lois
