review/text: TheSony Cycle Energy 2000 mAh Pre-Charged AA Rechargeable Batteriesare low-self-discharge NiMH type, similar to the more well-knownSANYO eneloop. Even their marketing claims sounded almost identical, such as:- 'Stays 85% charged after 1 year of storage'- 'Recharge up to 1000 times' (2nd-gen eneloop cells actually claim to achieve 1500 cycles)- 'Battery Capacity: 2000 mAh'Naturally, this leads to speculation that SONY Cycle Energy is just Sanyo eneloop under a different wrapper. But apparently it is not the case, based on the following observations:1. There are minor differences in shapes of positive and negative terminals between those two brands. (See my Customer Images uploaded, and judge for yourself)2. SONY Cycle Energy cells are made in China, while Sanyo eneloop cells are only manufactured in Japan.Of course, the real important question is: Do SONY Cycle Energy cells perform just as well as Sanyo eneloop cells? The answer is YES - based on my own test data so far.I have tested a set of those SONY Cycle Energy AA cells, using myLa Crosse BC-900. Here are my findings:- Right out the box, the average remaining charge in those cells is 1431mAh, or about 70% of rated capacity- After the first recharge, their average capacity improved to 2032mAh- After one more recharge/discharge cycle, the average further improved to 2082mAhDate code imprinted on those SONY cells is '1005', which I interpret as 'May 2010'. That means they were manufactured 7 months ago. Note that similar to eneloop cells, those SONY cells were probably not charged to 100% when they left factory. That explains why they arrived with only 70% of full capacity.Also note that on each SONY cell it says 'typ 2100mAh, min 2000mAh', while Sanyo cell says 'typ 2000mAh, min 1900mAh'. But in my experience, the measured average capacity of eneloop cells is actually around 2080mAhSo my conclusion is: The electrical characteristics of those SONY cells are practically indistinguishable from that of Sanyo eneloop. Therefore just pick whichever brand is on sale, and you can't go wrong.[Update on Feb 14, 2011]Do not confuse this product with the newly introducedSony Cycle Energy NHAAB4RN 1000 mAh AA Pre-Charged Batteries. The latter is currently priced at about 25% less, but its capacity is 50% lower![Update on April 15, 2012]I have to downgrade the prodcut rating from 5 to 4 stars, because its long term self-discharge rate is disappointing. I tested two pairs of those SONY Cycle Energy AA cells after 11-12.5 months of storage. The avergae remaining charge is only 69.5% of original. In contrast, Sanyo eneloop cells were tested to hold ~85% of charger after one year, as advertised.
