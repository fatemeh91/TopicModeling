review/text: I love this toothbrush! I previously had a Sonic Complete Pro and it lasted 4 years. It was a great toothbrush; however, the battery died and since you can't replace the batteries I had to buy another. Amazon offered a great deal on this toothbrush. Now it's not the Pro but I really don't need the extra toothbrush compartment which is pretty much the difference between the two models. I love this toothbrush! When I go for my annual cleaning to the dentist they always comment on how clean and tarter free my teeth are.
