review/text: I did not have a good experience with this product. It smells good but I used it (sparingly) in the bath and experienced sensitivity/irritation from it (feminine region). I can't use drugstore brands like Olay, Softsoap, etc...I normally use Body Shop, Neutrogena, and Bath & Body Works and never have problems. I incorrectly assumed Alba products would be more along those lines. Beware if you have sensitivity issues with bath & shower gel and body wash.
