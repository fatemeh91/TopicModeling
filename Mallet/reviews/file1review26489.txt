review/text: This works just like it says on the box. I used it on my bathroom sink and it was unstopped in seconds. I had used other chemical drain openers that just did not work to unstop my sink. Only thing, make sure you stop up the overflow hole with something so that the gunk wont splatter on you. Also, I tried using this in my bathtub but did not work well for me. I found it awkward trying to use this while trying to cover the overflow drain in my tub. Great for using on sinks but not so great for tubs.
