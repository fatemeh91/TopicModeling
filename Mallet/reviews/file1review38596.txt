review/text: Well not quite Superman but for those who need to rebuild muscles after a long workout or strength training, use this stuff. I was turned onto L-glutamine when I had to be treated for Leaky Gut. It literally rebuilt my intestinal walls (thank god for transparent skin to see this in action) and I was able to absorb the right amount of nutrients from my food. I like Jarrow better than other brands because of the purity. I will continue to buy from them especially for this product.
