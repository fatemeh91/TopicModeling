review/text: Kicking my self for not buying this years ago. Quicker than taking out the vac for annoying little items.Reading the reviews, I simply glued the handle pieces so there is no problem.This does the job quickly and priced so its a trivial purchase. Beats the heck out of plugging something in the wall and messing with the cord.I was tempted to extoll the virtues of this being a green product with no electricity but could not do that with a straight face.Bottom line, great little product.
