review/text: We have a 25 year old water pik and a 5 year old one in a different bathroom. Guess which one fails? The new one. Every time I turn it on, there's a 90% chance there'll just be a buzzing sound. If you bang it against the counter and suck on the hose while it's buzzing, the motor might start spinning (or it might not). then you can put the reservoir on and do your thing. Other than that major offense, it does what it's supposed to do.
