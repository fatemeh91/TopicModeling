review/text: I love my heated stone spa set - the stones are so relaxing and are wonderful, especially when you're so tired and tense.The stones need to be kept in the heater, until ready for use. If you use one and take it off, place it right back into the heater.If you cover the stones on your body with a light towel, it will help retain the heat much longer. I truly recommend this product, but alsorecommend that you shop around and get it a bit cheaper - I would pay up to $60.00 but not $110.00
