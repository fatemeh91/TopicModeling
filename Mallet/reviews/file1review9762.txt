review/text: I bought these after suffering through scads of lame-o drugstore tweezers. The points of these STILL match perfectly even after several accidental drops into the sink. They're nice and sharp, but not so sharp that you'll accidentally hurt yourself. And the metal of the tips is just rough enough to get a good grip without serrations. Excellent all around.
