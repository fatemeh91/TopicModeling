review/text: I though by the 1000g bottle from amazon just from vitacost (which this item is sold and shipped from) I first started with creatine from Optimum Nutrition which is a great product. I wanted to try other creatine products and i tried universal creatine (on my second bottle now) and i think i am going to stick with this product for a long time. Not only does it last, good value, it does work! i am amazed how much power this stuff gives you.I have yet to hit a plateau and i am gaining strength each month. I work in a distribution center and i am constantly working hard, and once i get home and relax for 2 to 3 hours i hit the gym and do my workouts and this stuff will turn me into a beast!
