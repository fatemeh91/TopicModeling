review/text: These cases are so helpful for people who have to take multiple medications a day. Large containers to fit several pills in each side (am/pm) but not too big to become bulky. Easy to measure out a weeks worth of pills, and take the appropriate container and throw it in your purse so you can have your meds while on the go. Containers also snap closed securely so I am not worried about it opening up in my purse. This product would be helpful for people with sight problems as the writing is very clear, and each day of the week has a different color case. The cases are also easy to open for someone who may have arthritis.
