review/text: Bought NOW Amino Complete and Nature's Way Astragalus Root because I saw a show on Dr Oz about lack of energy.Took both at the same time and was "sicker than a dog" with flu like symptoms for about 12 hours.Later tried Nature's Way Astragalus Root alone and it seemed okay (didn't get sick)Could have just been the combo of the two together???Use caution - herbs are medicine too ;)
