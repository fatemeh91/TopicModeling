review/text: I ordered this tonic initially from another source, then found it for less through Amazon. As this is my second bottle, I have to say I like the energy it gives me. It's not a jolt, but rather I notice a sustained type of energy throughout the day. Take 1/2 an ounce before breakfast and 1/2 an ounce before dinner and notice that you eat less.
