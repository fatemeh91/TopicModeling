review/text: As far as wound care goes, this tape is mediocre at best. The tiniest amount of sweat or moisture on the skin causes it to peel right off, rendering it fairly useless for holding a dressing in place.The one area where this tape really shines, however, is in binding orchestral sheet music parts. The 1" Micropore tape is absolutely the best solution I've found for taping orchestral music parts together. It sticks just enough to hold the pages together perfectly, yet not so much that it can't be repositioned without destroying your parts. It's extremely thin, easy to tear to length, folds perfectly, and doesn't stretch at all. It's about as sticky as masking tape, but much thinner and much stronger.I'm constantly being complimented on how my parts are bound, and it has everything to do with this tape!Stop using Scotch or masking tape -- and buy this immediately. You will not be disappointed!
