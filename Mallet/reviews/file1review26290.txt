review/text: Oh my goodness, the taste of this brings me back to my childhood and the cake my grandma used to bake. This really echoes of mango cheesecake for some reason and even thought I haven't tried it in ten years the first bite teleported me back in time. Hers had candied orange peel in it and that hits similar notes with this bar. It's actually small, like a thick square french fry but makes for a great snack in-between meals. The bar is breakable and not as dry as other reviewers stated, I found it to be perfect balance of taste and texture and the coconut was very subtle, a whisper compared to the golden ripe mango.This is a biscuit like type of bar, with fruit inside and I just love it, I can't wait to try the other flavors although this one completely stole my heart. I also love how each has 4 grams of soy protein but they aren't too filling, I wouldn't say this would replace a meal but it quiets the rumbling tummy for a little bit.- Kasia S.
