review/text: I do not like pre-packaged survival kits or first aid kits. They always seem to include a bunch of junk that I do not need, and leave out important stuff that I do, so I make my own. This kit is an exception: it is the only pre-packaged kit that I have ever carried, and I and my son have one in our pockets anytime we are off the asphalt. The designer got it right, with tools that work and meet real needs. The tools are also high quality, which is not the case in a lot of kits. I still added a few items to the kit to make it more specific to my skills and emergency plans, but only a few, and I saved some money buying this kit and using it as a base rather than purchasing each component individually.PS: All survival kits and tools are useless unless you learn how to use them in real-world circumstances. If you are not willing to take your gear out into the world and learn to use it (preferably in lousey weather and when you are hungry, cold, and tired) don't waste your money. When the stuff hits the fan, only what you have practiced in realistic circumstances will work for you.
