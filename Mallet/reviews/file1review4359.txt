review/text: Do not trust this vendor, these blades are pure junk. I bought these in September, and finally got around to using them today (I buy these in bulk and these finally got into the rotation). These blades are dull, and do not lubricate the face when used. I suspect these are fake Gillette blades due to extreme poor quality. Since I bought these a few months ago, I have no way of returning these for a refund. So I lost my money on these junk blades. When a deal is too good to be true, it is.DO NOT BUY THESE BLADES, THEY ARE FAKES AND WILL RIP YOUR FACE OFF WHEN YOU USE THEM.
