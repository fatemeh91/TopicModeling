review/text: As someone who has always used a Braun electric shaver I must say that it was an easy choice when it came time to replace my old Flex Control model. However, even for a longtime Braun fan such as myself I have been blown away by the quality of the new self-cleaning Activator 8585. The new foil system gives me a much closer shave, particularly in those tough spots on my neck and the cleaning system eliminates the need to brush out the whiskers and clean the cutterblock myself as I did before. The cleaning fluid is good for a month if cleaning daily, but I only clean 1-2 times per week so it will last even longer.Perhaps the ultimate compliment for this product came this past weekend on a trip with my dad. A longtime razor user, he tried the Activator and liked it so much he said that he was going to buy his own when he got home. Anyone who says an electric shaver can't compare to a traditional razor for closeness has not tried this product. 5 stars!
