review/text: I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor. I have found the Fusion blades to be the best of the bunch. I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades, but personally don't think they are worth the extra money. In fact, I think the Proglide blades tend to dull faster. I also opt for the manual blades as I didn't notice a difference when using the power blades, which are a bit more expensive. Thanks to Amazon for frustration free (and less) packaging!
