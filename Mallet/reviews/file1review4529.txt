review/text: If I was very disappointed with the powered Fusion razor (which I reviewed much earlier) then I must say that I'm extremely well-pleased with the manual version. Unlike the powered Fusion the manual one allows for incredible flexibility and a truly close but comfortable shave. In retrospect, my problem with the powered version is that the "micropulses" take away your control and the vibrations will cause you to press harder on your skin (leading to nicks, cuts and razor burn). I've been using the manual Fusion razor for almost two weeks now and am so impressed that I've stopped using the Schick Quattro Midnight altogether. All in all I give the manual Gillette Fusion razor my highest recommendation.
