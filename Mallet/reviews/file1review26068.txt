review/text: Finding only a couple of extremely brief reviews of this product on the entire Internet, and noting that it doesn't say "Made in USA" or made anywhere on the label, I decided to e-mail the manufacturer, asking them to tell me where it was made and where the ingredients came from. This was important to me for a few reasons: (1) These probiotics must be kept refrigerated from point of manufacture to point of sale to maintain their potency - if they come from overseas, the maintenance of refrigeration and potency on arrival are much less certain;(2) I do not ingest products made in countries with a recent history of major food contaminations;(3) I prefer not to support outsourcing if possible, considering the unemployment in this country.Their reply to my inquiry (and I quote): "...we cannot respond to your inquiry unless you call." I wrote back saying that I did not understand this unusual policy, why they could not answer by e-mail (it would require only a very short answer). They have never responded again.This is the ONLY time - out the numerous written inquiries I've made to nutritional supplement companies - that I was answered with something that basically translates as: 'We can only tell you over the phone.' Could their reply mean that they are afraid to state the product's origin in print? I would hope not, but what else could this mean?This product may be perfectly fine. I did not suffer any apparent negative consequences in taking it.However, a customer service that will not state in print the origin of its products casts a shadow of doubt over the whole company. I will henceforth consider purchasing only from companies that do not hesitate to state the origin of their products -- in print.
