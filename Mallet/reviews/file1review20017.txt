review/text: This tub's compactness is great. I just put it in the kitchen sink and use the hose. I like being able to rinse her clean while she's still in the tub. I just leave the drain hole open. I got one of the bigger tubs that doesn't fold up at my shower but didn't like how huge it was. I didn't really have anywhere convenient to store it. My baby is 6 months old but my pediatrician says she is the average size of a 12 month old. But I'm still able to bathe her in this tub. I'm just sad that she will eventually outgrow it and I'll have to be hunched over the tub.
