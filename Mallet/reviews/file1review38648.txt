review/text: the product is magnificent smells awesome and is great on the skin everyone who has used AV knows that but i noticed alot of people dont like the plastic bottle i do hears why. about a year or 2 ago i bought a big bottle of aqua velva i think 7.5 oz glass bottle i kept in in my dresser somehow it cracked and by the time i noticed the stuff was gone it leaked into my draw so i prefer the plastic
