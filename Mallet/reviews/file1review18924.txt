review/text: Bought this brace for BOTH knees as I am getting back into skiing with my kids (I have not been on skis in 20+ years) and I have a torn meniscus and a partially torn Medial Cruciate Ligament. My orthopedic surgeon recommended a level 3 brace for preventing additional injury and thusfar it has been working as advertised.
