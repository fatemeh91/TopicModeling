review/text: I bought these to go with my plus white teeth whitener. They worked great. I put them in boiling water since it didn't work if it wasn't and they fit great. They are a little thick but still for the price they are great. Oh but be carful not to put them on too fast in your mouth to mold them since I did the first time and cut my gums, my own fault. Live and learn. :)
