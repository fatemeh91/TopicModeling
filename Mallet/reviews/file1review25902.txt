review/text: I use the DigiPower charger and DigiPower AA batteries to power my Nikon strobes, both primary and slave unitsDigiPower DPS-3000+ 3-Hour AA/AAA Rechargeable Battery Kit with 4 AA 2700 mAh Batteries and Car Charger. Slaves typically have to remain on constantly for long periods of time and the power drain on them is high. My DigiPower chargers and batteries perform without a hitch and bring everything back to full charge in short order, usually less than a hour.
