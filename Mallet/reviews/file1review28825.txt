review/text: I've been using this product for more than one year and it's done great things. The quality of the protein is really good and the taste is great. If you want it to work for you, just make sure to know how many grams of protein you need each day, substract those you get from meals, and have the rest with whey protein. I take 5 servings a day and I don't gain any fat, just pure muscle.
