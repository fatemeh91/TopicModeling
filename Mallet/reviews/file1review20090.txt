review/text: Hello all!....this product, combined with my natural progesterone has just been nothing short of a MIRACLE....for years Ive had trouble with either periods, moods, bloating...heavy bleeding leading to anemia (had to get weekly iron infusions), infertility....every doctor I went to throughout the years always tried to get me on either birth control or for me to consider a hysterectomy...good grief!...is that my only options???...so I began taking my own health into my own hands and researched, researched, researched...tried different natural alternatives...eating better (YES organic and 100% grass fed meats DO help)...i had been reading about the benefits of natural progesterone...have been using it for 3 months now and have seen dramatic differences in my daily feelings (increased libido, for instance..my hubby sure is happier!) and menstrual cycles, then I began reading about estrogen metabolism and DIM...After reading so many positive things about it I gave it a try...well....Im so impressed...my skin is clearer, smoother....my cycle?..lighter, no cramps and came normally (26 days vs 23!)...ive even lost a inch or so around my abdomen area (bad bad estrogen!) without working out! (have finally enough energy to start zumba classes soon)Today, I cried a little because I finally feel like Im getting my life back and not a slave to my body....so women, don't give up and just believe what the Dr. says especially if you are only being offered drugs or major surgery...there is an in between...poor estrogen metabolism affects SOOO much in our bodies and its caused by so many everyday things we use....soaps, shampoos, lotions, foods....but change a lil bit every day...in some cases its a bit more expensive (like organics and grass fed) but in the end it will be worth it...vs. a costly medical procedure that you may not even need...or can pay for.
