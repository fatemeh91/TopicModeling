review/text: My wife has been trying for about 6 months to get pregnant. We have been charting her BBT's which has been all over the map! We have spent thousands of dollars on inseminations, been on clomid taken fertility injections every day, tried Evening Primrose... We have had no success getting pregnant. A few issue's came up that I believe are due to progesterone issue's from her Marena IUD.I read about Vitex (fertilaid) and thought we would give it a try. SO FAR this is our first month, she has had her most stable consitant BBT chart temping and has what looks to be a nice healthy ovulation.Now, actually getting pregnant may be another story.... ? We will seeUPDATE....After the 2nd month my wife DID end up getting pregnant. I know her progesterone was still inefficient so we had her on progesterone, but we credit Fertilaid with this one! GREAT PRODUCT if you are having trouble getting pregnant and cycles are not regular.SERIOUSLY, I would work for these folks and sell the heck out of this product!
