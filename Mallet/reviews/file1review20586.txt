review/text: I have had my Braun 8585 shaver since April 2005 and it works well although I have noticed that the shaver heads do not last as long as purported by the company. The head that came with the shaver last 18 months easy, the heads since then that have come on the market are not as good in quality and do not last as long. My most recent shaver head was purchased in June 2009 and already it is worn out and this month is January 2010. This shaver head pulls my hair out without cutting it and it takes sometimes up to 10 minutes to shave. With the pricing and that Braun and retail outlets charge me, I am displease with having to purchase a new one. As of this week, I will need to replace the shaver head because it is worn out.
