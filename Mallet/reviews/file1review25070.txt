review/text: The battery in my house security system finally quit holding its charge and I needed a replacement. After checking with the alarm company and a couple of local sources, I decided to go online for a better price - and did just that! This is an exact replacement and the cost was about half of the lowest local price. Shipping was quick and the battery arrived in perfect condition.
