review/text: I loved this pacifier thermometer! I say &quot;loved&quot; because it no longer works (very disappointing). My two-month-old son spit it out one time and before I could catch it it had fallen onto our hardwood floors. Now it doesn't work! Just one time of being spit out and it's broken?! I think if they're going to improve on this product, they should improve on its durability. Otherwise, I really do believe it is a great product!
