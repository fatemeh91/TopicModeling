review/text: I love the design of this type of brace. I have pretty chronic ankle issues and the strap system prevents my ankle from rolling when playing sports. I have used this type of brace before (from another manufacturer) and this one isn't as good for a couple reasons. 1) The materials are a little to stiff (both the straps and the laces). Mind you, this design doesnt need the materials to be stiff for support. That is all accomplished by virtue of the straps being there. The extra stiffness just makes the laces unwieldy and the fit more abrasive (ie. blisters on my achilles). 2) I think the velcro on the straps should be lower on the straps. because of where the velcro is, only a small portion of the velcro makes a connection with the other half on my ankle. The rest is left flopping in the wind above my ankles and the brace. If my foot was 2 inches wider, it would hit in the right spot. SUMMARY: it gets the job done, but not as well as it could/should.
