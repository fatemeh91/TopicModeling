review/text: Thank goodness I found this product it has been heaven sent! I used to have the worse ring worm problem behind my neck. Since I was always surrounded in moist areas due to swimming and working out. I had to be on a strict regimen of apple cider vinegar and putting that on the affected areas with a cotton swab everyday and it stung a lot. It comes and goes but since I started using this product I dont always have to be on the apple cider vinegar because I can wash my neck and my face with it (since I have the same small problem near my eyelids. It really is a relief and I tell you what, it is a great product for the money. My fungus problems are almost gone which is why I definitely recommend it.
