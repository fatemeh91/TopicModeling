review/text: Conveniently enough, just about a week after I received these, I found I had a splinter in the sole of my foot. I couldn't get to it myself, and I had to wake up my husband, since--INconveniently enough--it was the middle of the night. But as bleary-eyed and sleep-fogged as he was, he was able to isolate the splinter and remove it without any struggle or pain on my part. And this is usually NOT a simple procedure, despite the fact that we have a whole arsenal of tweezers around the house. I'm very happy with my Tweezerman tweezers, and I hope they make every splinter encounter as easy as this one was. (He's happy, too, since I'm the idiot who always walks around barefoot, so this is a tool more for his use than mine.)
