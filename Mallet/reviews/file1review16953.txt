review/text: This seemed like a very cheap knock off of a better product. The whole thing falls apart if you undo one screw to far, I might add it's the main adjustment screw for it. That in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if it didn't come apart while you are using it. Can you say 'Pain?'The materials seem flimsy and the quality low. Sorry I bought this, now I have to search for a higher quality one.Can you give ZERO stars?
