review/text: This is a good value for the money overall, but I was disappointed when my kit arrived that the mat and blocks were a different color purple from each other. The yoga strap is natural in color as well, not white, as pictured. Also, the poster is pretty lame. I've had the kit for over a year now and it's holding up well to my almost daily use. The mat is showing lines where it will eventually split all the way through, though. I don't know how much longer I have until that happens, but that happens to the best of mats, I'm sure.This is a good deal for the money. It would have been nice if the color was that as represented in the picture on the website. I did end up contacting amazon and Valeo about it. I would have had to take a $10 loss through shipping costs to get any refund, so it clearly wasn't worth it. In the end, this works just fine & looks aren't everything.
