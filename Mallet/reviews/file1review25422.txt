review/text: I Looked Everywhere Online for a Nose Hair Trimmer with Good Reviews at a Good Price. I Found This One Here on Amazon about 7 Months Ago and I'm Very Glad I Did, So Far. This Trimmer Appears to Be an Older Design by Panasonic, but Thats Not a Bad Thing in This Case. As Soon as You Put the Batteries In and Turn This On for the First Time, You Know that This Has Plenty of Power to Do Its Job. It Does an Overall Good Job at Trimming the Hairs and is Easy to Handle and Use. I had Bought a Newer Nose Trimmer from Panasonic which I was Very Disappointed With and Broke After Six Months of Occasional Use. Therefore, I Was Very Nervous About Taking Another Chance on Panasonic. Bottom Line is That This is a Great, Well Made, Powerful and Inexpensive Trimmer for the Money.
