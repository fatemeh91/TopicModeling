review/text: I bought this product due to an article in First womans magazine. Supposedly, Slimfast is patenting the Optima formula, because it isso great as a weigh loss aid.You are supposed to replace 2 meals with shakes and eat a regular dinner. Optima is different than regular Slimfast, and you are supposed to stay full longer thereby not eating bad snacks nor suffering hunger pangs in between meals. blah blah, blahMost of my weight is due to the getting older syndrome" and the metabolism slowing down and not over eating. I am not used to eating large amounts of food, nor am I a heavy snacker, but let me tell you. I would drink my shake, and in less than 2 hours I was starving. I mean stomach growling so the neighbors can hear, pangs so strong my gingerbread village was not safe.I gave up on this plan after 3 days. I was either miserably starving most of the day, praying for my next meal, or eating the Optima snacks in between shakes twice as often as I was supposed to.Bottom line, I was either starving, or gaining more weight from having to eat more often to get rid of the pangs.Don't understand it, and not saying that it will work for you. It might. I quess if you are used to 3 large meals each day and snacks in between it may make a difference, but I'm not hopeful for you.I hate to diss a product like this, but it really did not work, and actually did the opposite of what it is supposed to do.I have quite a bit left, since (like an idiot) I bought a month's supply to faithfully do the "Plan". Maybe, my mother n law would like some. (She goes on a different diet every other month and seems to get larger every year-so apparantly she does not care if they work or not.Kim Schild
