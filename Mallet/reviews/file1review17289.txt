review/text: One of the main reasons I purchased the Remington MB-200 Trimmer was the large number of highly favorable reviews it received; well, here's another! This is a great product that exceeded my expectations. It holds a charge for weeks with light use, it easily adjusts to trim a beard or goatee perfectly even to almost any length desired and it's quiet and well made. The number of attachments that many other products come with is cumbersome and confusing. With its simple adjustable built-in trimmer guard, the Remington eliminates the need for any other accessories, except the compact re-charger. I am very satisfied with this trimmer and would highly recommend it to any guy who wants to keep his facial hair neatly groomed.
