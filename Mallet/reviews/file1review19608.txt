review/text: We've been potty training my son for several weeks now, and he showed signs of being interested in using the big potty. So we bought a well-rated fancy potty seat with all sorts of "features" that was absolutely terrible. It was quickly returned, and replaced with this one.This seat is SO easy to use - there's a dial that's accessible from the top back to adjust its fit, and it's snug as could be. We have one of the long oval toilet bowls, and that didn't cause any trouble with this seat. It's secure and doesn't move around, but really easy to take off again for adults and older kids to use. This only showed up this morning, but already my two and a half year old has nearly figured out how to get it on and off the toilet seat by himself. It has a nice pee-guard for little boys, and sits down into the toilet a bit so the pee doesn't end up coming out between the toilet and seat. We put a big sturdy step stool in front of the toilet, and my son is so excited now that he can get up there and down again by himself!
