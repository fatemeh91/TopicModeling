review/text: Let me start this review by saying, I am not a huge fan of vitamins. In the past I have taken vitamins and would feel nauseated(hope I spelled that right) afterwards. So, I gave up on vitamins all together. Until I visited my GrandMa, she gets these senior books in the mail, you know that one, where you can order anything to cure everything. Well to my surprise, Seniors rock, these are the best and only vitamins that make me feel great! I don't feel sick at all, these vitamins actually give my a boost of energy. I take these vitamin everyday, my GrandMa calls them blessings in a bottle because they have like a scripture or something written on the bottle. I'm not deeply religious but I am a spiritual person, these vitamins make me feel great, and keep me recharged what a blessing. I am going to have to start buying a bigger bottle, my Sister has started taking the vitamins with me and loves them.
