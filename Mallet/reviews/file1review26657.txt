review/text: I have purchased the back booster two times. I was disappointed that the first one failed, but pleased at it's portability and support so I decided to take a chance and get a second one. Now, the second was has failed as well - only 4 months old! I am hesitant to order a third one. I use this on long flights which I only do two to three times a year and I am having to buy one every time I fly so, not such a great financial solution to lower back pain. Will try another product
