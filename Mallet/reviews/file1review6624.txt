review/text: This is one of those items that has the appearance of "snake oil" but isn't. It's an amazing product. While it's really great for "spot" issues, if you put some lotion on your back and use ball end, it's pretty incredible for an entire muscle region. Totally surpasses all of those other hand-massagers.
