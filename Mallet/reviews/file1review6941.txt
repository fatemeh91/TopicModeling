review/text: This massager advertises heated massage. It does both. However, the heat isn't very warm and the massage isn't very powerful. This is a better unit than the handhelds that you can pick up in walgreens. It uses a power cord rather than batteries. If you are using it on someone else it is easy enough to hold in your hand but grips around the head would be better. The switches are easy to flip off accidentally. If you press down hard it will operate slowly making it a little less effective for deep tissue massage. The heat isn't worth mentioning. The price was too high. I think it will last but I would like to see another model with more power. I have not treid the attachments.
