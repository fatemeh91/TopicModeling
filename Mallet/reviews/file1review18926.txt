review/text: I have a bad knee from an old ski injury but also play roller derby so it was getting aggravated occasionally while playing. I ordered this knee brace and it hasn't bothered me since. Recently I twisted my other leg funny and hurt my left knee, without hesitation I ordered another brace to wear. So now I wear one on either leg and my knees stay strong and healthy and feel great!
