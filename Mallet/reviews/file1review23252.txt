review/text: I have 2 very old dogs who seem to be losing more hair and have kibbles stashed on the carpeting. I love having a clean rug, was vacuuming daily, and was getting frustrated when I remembered that my mom had a Bissell carpet sweeper for quick cleaning. So, I bought this more than reasonably priced product and have been extremely satisfied with the results. It picks up virtually all surface flotsum and the carpeting looks terrific when I'm through. I love this product for its quality brush system and ease of use. It easily empties. It has genuinely simplified my daily housekeeping routine. It is my favorite Amazon buy of the year.
