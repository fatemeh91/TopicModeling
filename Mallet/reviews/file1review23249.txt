review/text: I just assembled my Bissell. When I realized that the handle pieces didn't lock in, I knew there was going to be a problem. I hit each piece with a hammer, and now they are jammed in there pretty good. If they somehow come out later, I'll just stick some crazy glue in all 3 sections (the 4th one screws in).When I ran it over my low pile carpet, it pushed around a few pieces of lint before the top handle fell off. This frustrated me, but after I got a good lower grip and put a little pressure on it, it picked up all the lint and things sitting on top. The best it that it easily picks up the many pieces of my long hair that fall out everywhere.I originally was going to right a bad review out of frustration, but after a few hammer swings and a little pressure while rolling it, it's doing it's job. I hope it does well on the hardwood and marble tile.
