review/text: My friend and I were picking blackberries. I didn't notice the thorns had punctured a hole in my bag. Dark red juice stained my pants... it looked like I had been shot in the leg. About 3 hours later I used the tide pen with doubt that it would work. It took me about 2 minutes of "writing" with the stain pen but it worked beautifully. There was no trace of the stain and my friend was amazed when I wore the pants the following week.
