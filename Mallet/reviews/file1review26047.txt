review/text: I bought this pocket watch for my legally blind father-in-law. The watch is attractive and keeps good time. The alarm (especially the rooster) is reasonably loud. The voice telling the time (upon pushing a button) is clear and speaks slowly enough to be easily understood.However, I can't recommend this watch because the voice telling the time is too quiet. Since many of the intended users will be elderly, with failing vision AND failing hearing, this is a serious problem. My father-in-law still has decent hearing but in any kind of noisy environment he can't hear the time.
