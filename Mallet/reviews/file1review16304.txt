review/text: I have been buying a brand of unscented dishwasher detergent here on Amazon because the top-rated brand leaves my silicone spatulas, plasticware and nonstick pans with a perfumey aftertaste. This "green' brand is not quite as effective at cleaning said silicone spatulas (I use them to make scrambled eggs and cheese, so...) or plasticware and fails to remove traces of lip balm on glasses sometimes. This Finish product works great on all these and doesn't leave any scent behind! Yay!Your mileage may vary, but we have moderately soft water here. Good stuff!
