review/text: I am an active older individual (64) with a heart that is prone to an irregular hearbeat, even atrial fibrillation. I felt this was a godsend for someone of my condiition and who was not ready to become totally sedentary. It worked as advertised for a while but would occasionally refuse to inflate and return an Err -2. Until today, I could just try it again and it would work fine. Well today, it just stopped inflating at all. All I get is an Err -2 and the instructions say contact the retailer. I would like to exchange it for one that works but it failed not quite 60 days after purchase. However, after I little determined digging I finally found the right button to push. I got an almost immediate exchange, have received my new one and all is sweetness and light again. I'd change the rating to 4 stars but won't let me.
