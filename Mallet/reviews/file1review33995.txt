review/text: I have eczema on my hands (fingers only really) that is usually spurred on my stress and takes a long time to heal.I bought this on here due to the good reviews but it actually worsened by eczema and burned upon application. I was in denial that the new cream was causing this and continued to apply for about 5 days while my spots got worse and worse.I stopped using this and applied pure aloe for a while which helped to reduce the pain and redness by a lot, but didn't clear the spots to normal condition. I use this cream on my legs as regular lotion as to not waste it. It works decently well for that purpose, but so would a $1.50 tub of vaseline.The search for a good eczema product continues... -_-
