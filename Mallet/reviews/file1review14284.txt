review/text: Please do not take this stuff off the market. My shower is counting on you. If its not working for some people, they must not be using it correctly. I've NEVER had to clean my shower since I began using this. Also consider things like not everyone's water is quality. It depends on the extra crud that is in some households. Believe me, it DOES WORK!!! And it works well. I haven't had to clean my shower in the past 2 1/2 months!Sincerely,Quinn Herman
