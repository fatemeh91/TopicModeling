review/text: These provide some arch support at perhaps 1/10 the cost of medical orthotics but cannot replace the real thing for those who need it.They are soft and comfortable under foot and the real support largely comes from the the plastic tabs (medium or firm) that the user inserts.I do not believe these are as good as that company's previous supports that were discontinued some years ago but they are adequate and given the price, worth a try first before moving to something more expensive if required.Recommended.
