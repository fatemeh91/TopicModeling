review/text: Before my gallbladder was removed, my stomach/diaphram would get enlarged after any-sized meal. After my gallbladder was removed, my entire stomach would get enlarged, and bloated, as if the tissues were inflammed. And my stomach seemed very sensitive to wheat products... even a dash of soy sauce.I did research online and found that ox bile could help. I ordered another brand for about 6 months. And it worked alright, but the price was too high. So, last month, I purchased a bottle of Nutricology's Ox Bile, 500 mg. And I'm pretty happy with the product. I've gone through a bottle, and can say that this seems to work a little better than the other brand. I like that these are capsules, rather than tablets. And though I still try to avoid wheat, when I do have wheat, with this product, I am not suffering afterwards. That means a lot to me.So, I'm ordering my second bottle. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has had their gallbladder removed and is suffering from stomach issues.
