review/text: Our first dentist gave us this flosser to use with my daughter, who is disabled and can't floss herself. It makes flossing her possible! Anything else and she'd involuntarily bite down and there goes my fingers! I could not find it in the drugstore very often and while they are sturdy, eventually they do need to be replaced. I am so grateful that I found this online. I bought a Reach flosser and after a week needed replacement heads. I went to two stores. One was out entirely and in the other they had only mint. What a hassle. I did not like that I was creating plastic waste on a daily basis with those replacement floss heads anyway. I am glad I found a source of this low-key but very effective flosser here. I should buy a lifetime supply now!
