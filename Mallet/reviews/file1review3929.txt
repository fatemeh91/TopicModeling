review/text: These do NOT whiten teeth. I've tried them and the commercials are deceiving. You will NOT get the results they show on the commercials. I was very disappointed in this product.Save the money from these and go to the dentist and have a professional zoom whitening. There is no way you are going to whiten your teeth at home using these. The peroxide isn't strong enough. The dentist uses over twice the strength of these. I don't care how many packages of these you use, it will not work.Also...The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva. You're basically ingesting peroxide from them. I don't know how safe that could be, but it's not very promising to me. The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting. Save your money.
