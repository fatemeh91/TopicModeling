review/text: If you life sport and dont know what to buy for deodorant, this is the product for, i try this product when they first came out, and i still use it, well not the same bottle, lol it ran out long time ago,haha.I used axe before, but if you apply it on before the game, after the game it dont cover the sweat smell, so you have to apply it again, but red zone, it cover the smell. so pick your deodorant.
