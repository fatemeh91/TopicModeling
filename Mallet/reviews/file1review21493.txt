review/text: I have been very satisfied with these. They are hard to find in stores so I was excited when I found them. They have a regular shape like a real toothbrush, only smaller. Make sure that you know what type of oral b toothbrush you have before you buy any replacement brush. Certain brushes fit certain model toothbrushes.
