review/text: This is a good support garment, but I have to wear something under it so it doesn't dig into my skin. Also, the shoulder straps show with almost any shirt except crew neck. Basically I can't wear it to work with nice shirts, but I can put on a tank top, then the cradle, and then a T-shirt over it and it's great for running around on the weekends.
