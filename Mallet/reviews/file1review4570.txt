review/text: Not a significant improvement over the Mach 3 in terms of closeness of shave or less nicks/irritation. Underneath my unfortunately tough & wiry facial hair is very soft & sensitive skin prone to redness, nicks and the whole gamut of after-shave horrors. For my money (excuse me if I choke up here) the Mach 3 gives the best results all around of an unavoidable daily experience.
