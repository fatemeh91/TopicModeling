review/text: The item arrived with a hole or bad seam that let the seed content leak out. We tried it anyways to see if it would suit. It takes several minutes in the microwave to get warm, and the "cape" design causes it to slide down the back if you are sitting upright. I had hoped for a neck band with a few inches of extension to cover just the upper back and shoulders.Also, the smell is a bit much, although that would probably fade with time?
