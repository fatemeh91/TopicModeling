review/text: I started taking this when my local health food store ran out of the Lifetime Basics liquid Multi, when I tried this I instantly liked it so much more. It was a little more expensive but worth it, most local store has 25% off for Lifetime products, no discount for Nature's Plus products. The other brand I used tasted horrible, like bad seaweed, I also had to eat a fairly big meal before taking it or I would start to feel like I needed to vomit about 15-20 minutes after swallowing it. I don't get that at all with this product. I can wake up and take my one capful and not feel sick or anything. I don't mind the flavor either. Most of the negative reviews are because of the taste, so its really your preference, some people don't like the flavor, others don't mind. My thing is, its one capful/2 tablespoons a day. If you can't even do that for your health, then, well.... Water doesn't taste as good as Soda, but you aren't gonna stop drinking that are ya?
