review/text: I have IBS and have had it for many years. I was told nothing would help from Walgreens. It has been so bad that sometimes I have not even been able to get out of the house without taking something to make me stop using the restroom. Then My boss recommended Primal Defense. Since taking it, my system is more normal then ever. Don't get me wrong it doesn't stop the IBS but, it helps maintain a healthy system where there is less incidents and I can focus on more important things. It takes a couple of weeks to get in your system. Also note, I stay away from things that trigger the IBS and I take primal defense once a day.
