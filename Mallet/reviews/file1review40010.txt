review/text: I have suffered tennis elbow several times from my style of tennis play, and once had to stop for an entire year. This little device has worked wonders for a recurrence I was recently developing. Although my muscle will be sore directly under the compressed area immediately after play, there is no immediate or delayed pain in the elbow epicondyle. Playing 4 or 5 days a week is not a problem.
