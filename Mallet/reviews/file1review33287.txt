review/text: This wrap - while nice for neck, shoulders, and back - does not smell nice after a few uses. It's supposed to have twelve soothing aromatic herbs. Unfortunately, after a few uses, it smells like nothing more than cooked rice. Over the Christmas holidays, I took it with me to a party. One person said it smelled like sausage while another said it smelled like chili and another said it smelled like urine! I kid you not! And then whatever clothes you are wearing when you use it also smell horrendous. It's a great style and provides warm comfort, but unfortunately, they sooo missed the mark on the aromatics!!!
