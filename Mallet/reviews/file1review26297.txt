review/text: This is such a delicious treat! I was introduced to them by my friend who didn't like them. I'm so happy I tried them anyway. These bars have replaced my Snickers and Reese's Candy addiction. The Mango Coconut is by far the best, but the others are really tasty as well! It would benefit anyone who is reading this to try these bars.
