review/text: I have tried about 5 different trimmers. And I always came out disapointed. This one is the best by far. I want a trimmer not a massager. I want something that cuts nose hair as hard as steel. This one cuts and that's what really counts. Easy to hold, cuts great, works on nose and ear hair. Buy it you'll be happy you did.
