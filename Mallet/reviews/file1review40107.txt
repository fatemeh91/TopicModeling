review/text: I needed a yoga set for my yoga class. Most items are quite expensive and I wasn't looking forward to buying them. I found this for a good price that had everything I needed. I also liked that it had a bag to carry everything in. The only downside is the mat. It is a little short and on the thinner side. It works for me, but may not be the best quality for intense yoga participants. I haven't used the blocks or strap yet, but I assume they are the same way. Either way, it works for my beginner's yoga class. Also, this product shipped rather quickly. I used the super saver shipping and it came very soon.
