review/text: Before purchasing this beard trimmer I checked out many of the other reviews on Amazon. The majority of the reviewers felt as I do that this beard trimmer was a four or five star product.I agree!It is easy to charge, and it holds a charge for quite some time.The beard trimmer was also very easy to use, especially the adjustments and trimmed my beard quickly and properly.Bottom Line...This product does what it claims.
