review/text: I have been a user of Optimum Nutrition's protein powders for many years. They usually have a good flavor, and mix well. I used to really like the dutch chocolate flavor of their "pro complex" formulation, since the early 90's or so.Well, lately have been trying some new flavors to see how it goes, you get tired of just chocolate and vanilla. Well, just tried this Chocolate Malt, it is good! It tastes like the Whoppers candy does. Good taste, and not aftertaste.Also very good is the extreme milk chocolate. I like these 2 chocolates better than the "double rich" chocolate, maybe am just getting tired of that one after several years.Cookies and cream sounds good but is not. Good at first, but odd aftertaste. Same thing with Rocky Road, I just didn't like the taste.Vanilla ice cream is very good. I like to add protein to some milk and take it with me in my lunch. Also good is the "Cake Batter" - funny name, but tastes good.My wife says the Caramel Toffee is a good choice too, it smells very good at least.The strawberry I've tried in the past, that was a good flavor too. Have not tried banana, coconut, etc.So in summary there are some good flavors Optimum makes, and it is cheaper to order online vs. the retail store. Oh yes - and get a good shaker or too. My favorite is the smaller sized (16 oz?) "Blenderbottle" - it is sturdy, mixes things smoothly, and is easy to wash out. And here on Amazon it is around $6. Order a couple so you have a backup. Also great to take when you travel. Also like the Tupperware shaker bottle, that is around $10.So I hope this is helpful info to the reader. My newer policy is to try a new flavor in as small a container as you can order. Then if it is crap, you can try to give it away, or throw it away, and you are not out so much $$. :)
