review/text: I used a generic brand razor with the three metal pieces that form to your face to shave for 10 years until I got this. I recently started maintaining a short beard so I needed something adjustable to shave with. For trimming and such it is great! Works fast and is easy to adjust.However, for shaving (all the hair down to your face) it really sucks. Its rough as heck, hurts, and is impossible to do without getting some surface skin and leaving marks. I strongly suggest not using it to shave but just to trim.
