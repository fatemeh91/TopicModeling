review/text: Love, love, love this product. MUCH better than waxing. I used it on both legs and a substantial area in the bikini zone. Yes, it hurts, but not so bad that you need to stop. Also, be sure not to have the hair be too long - the length that is right for waxing is a bit too long for this IMO. Once the longest hairs are removed/thinned, the pain subsides. And, really its not what I would call "pain." I did this Thursday night and on Monday afternoon (today) its still great! If I'd gotten waxed, I would already have regrowth. I will post again after my next experience.
