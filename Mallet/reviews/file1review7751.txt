review/text: I had decided to write a review about this brush if amazon carried it, because I was certain nobody would bother to write a review about a lowly dish brush - and this one is worthy of some attention. So it was gratifying to find so many other fans. As one who appreciates design it must be said that this brush has great style, but what matters most, of course, is how it works, and how well it holds up.It appears from the other reviews that my dish routine is a little out of the ordinary. I see the word scrub and sticky and elbow grease and it causes me to recoil in lazy horror - because I'm lazy about cleaning up after dinner, despite the fact that I had the same old Protestant work ethic training you all had growing up. But to me there seems no point in ruining a perfectly good dinner - and its stuffed and sassy aftermath - by standing at the sink scrubbing and sweating. So I rinse out the pots and pans and fill them up with soapy water and wait until the next day to wash them. And because water is the universal solvent (remember chemistry class?), and because with time even the most adhesive baked-on rice softens right up - even though I don't use hot water - everything comes off with no effort. It takes a fraction of the time.Another advantage of using cold water is that the bristles seem to last forever. This brush is going on year 10.2 and gets used an average of 320 days a year, twice a day. That means it's been used 6,528 times - and the brush and bristles still look almost new. So why am I thinking of ordering another one? Well, it's mostly because I worry that if I don't, the company will feel it's not obsolescent enough and will cut corners in the manufacture, or take it off the market - and great sadness will ensue. This is a terrific brush with a great design - it should live on forever.
