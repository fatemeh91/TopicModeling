review/text: As an medical resident, I am strongly in support of this eye chart. One major advantage of this chart over other charts on amazon is that it has pupil size -- very convenient. The paper was thick and the printing was clear (as you would hope for an eye chart), and the price is great. I just got this same one for my niece in the hopes that I can convince her to go into eye medicine :)
