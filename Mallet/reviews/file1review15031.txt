review/text: If you want to stop smoking this works well. I continued using these patches for MANY months (about 7months) after the directions told me I should get off of them. I believe this is what made the product work for me. I initially followed the recommended timetable but strongly felt the urge to start smoking again during the stepdowns to the weaker patches. I decided that going back to smoking was much worse for my health than continuing the use of these nicotine patches until I was good and ready to give them up. I figured the patches only have transdermal nicotine...whereas cigarette smoke has even more nicotine as well as hundreds of chemicals which are inhaled.I saved a lot of money over the months by cutting the 21mg patches down as I very slowly stepped down to the lower doses...first into halves and then into quarters for as long as I needed to. (You can also save a bundle of dough by purchasing the generic patches made by Safeway grocery stores...they are identical to these and even somewhat more comfortable to wear as the plastic is softer on the skin.) I always got a slight ache and some redness when I put the patches on my arms or legs...I discovered the best place to wear them is your back...alternating sides each day you use them.One fine day I didn't need a patch anymore!!! I haven't smoked for over a year and smokers and cigarette smoke now give me serious nausea. It is hard for me to believe I ever smoked! (I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 30 years!) It is real pleasure to breathe and taste and smell again as well as to wear gorgeous perfumes which I buy with the money I save from being addiction-free! It is a self-esteem booster to kick this habit too! So many benefits!Good luck, make your own timetable and persevere for as long as it takes you to no longer need nicotine...it is 100% worth it!
