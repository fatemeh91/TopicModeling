review/text: Purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend. It was only afterwards I spoke with a doctor who stated that vinpocetine has anti-inflammatory properties, but that he saw no medical reason for it to work as a nootropic (ie, smart drug/supplement). Worse, there was even the possibility of it decreasing dopamine levels, worsening one's concentration. Wish I had consulted the doctor first.However, I am a firm believer in placebos. So if it works for you (for whatever reason), then continue using this product however you like and ignore my review.
