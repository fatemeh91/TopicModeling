review/text: My OBGYN recommended this support for me, not for back pain, but for some relief from vericrose veins and varicrosities that have plagued me this pregnancy. She had the same issue with her own last pregnancy and used this support so it was a personal recommendation.Based on reviews here, I ordered up a size from the sizing chart, which was the way to go. I'm 30 weeks and currently weigh about 160, and the medium was definitely the correct size for me.First, this device is VERY comfortable. I could wear it to bed! I was worried it would bother my skin in the hot weather but it is comfortable. More importantly, it really, really has helped my discomfort from the vericrose veins.The only reasons I gave it 4 and not 5 stars are:1) It is impossible to wear under many tops, due to the positioning of the upper straps.2) It could be more adjustable at the belly - it has three sets of hook fasteners (like a bra) but they're SO far apart, so it can be hard to get the correct level of tightness depending on your size. Velcro or more rows of hooks would have been more useful.I might never have tried a product like this if my doctor hadn't suggested it, but now I'm telling every pregnant woman I know about it.
