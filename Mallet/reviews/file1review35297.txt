review/text: I bought this item and tried it at home around my eyebrow area. How it works is you're supposed to touch this salty water with one hand and then use the machine on yourself. Stick the machine's needle into the pore from which the hair grows and wait (tearing up from the slight stinging pain) while a little white bubbly mess starts forming around the pore. Then you're theoretically supposed to pull out the hair easily.Ok, and the reality is that I don't recommend people to buy and use this product. Let a professional do it if you must, TRUST ME. It is very hard to get the little needle to go properly into the pore... you end up damaging skin on the surface of your skin and under it as well. Also, the needle gets bent pretty easily. My eyebrow area ended up looking pretty mangled up after my attempt-- there were small red craters in various places between and around my eyebrows.Oh, and the hairs grew back anyway because the settlings don't go high enough.The needle is too weak to work on the really dark hairs, like those on my underarms. I killed a needle that way and I still couldn't not get the hair out easily. I also tried it on a few light hairs on my forearm too, which was easier to work with since I have a clear view of my arm, but I honestly don't think that made a difference either long term. Oh, and short term I left some small scars on my arm as well.This machine is not very expensive, so I thought I would give it a try, but honestly just save your money and save your cabinet space as well.
