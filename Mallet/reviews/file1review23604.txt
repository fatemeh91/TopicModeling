review/text: I have only been using this product for two weeks.....it does burn and feels itchy on the skin immediatly after applying the peel.....might want to sit in front of a fan to tolerate the 5 min your supposed to have this on the skin. I have acne prone skin with blotchy marks so I'm hoping with regular use.....I can get the blotchy marks to lighten up. My advise, use this product once a week...the first week, I used it 2 times and I noticed a small breakout around the corners of my chin. This product might be too strong to apply a couple or few times a week. other than all that....the smell and texture of the peel feels luxerious. :-)
