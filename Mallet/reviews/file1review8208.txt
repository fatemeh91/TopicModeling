review/text: Using this brush on a regular basis at home allows me to quickly wash things off without putting my hands in the soapy water. On a recent trip I decided to take it along with a little dish soap to wash out water bottles and baby's sippy cups. it worked great in the hotel rooms and at our destination. after use, i put it in zip lock bag until we reached the next destination.I bought one for my daughter (the mom of baby). I also bought one for my son, who commutes to work and stays in a remote location, so he could wash out water bottles and other dishes easily. Very handy. i store upside down in a small utensil crock when at home so it dries out between uses.
