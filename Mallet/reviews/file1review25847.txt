review/text: When I first got this razor I thought it was the greatest thing ever. It's completly waterproof, so cleaning it is simple, you just run it under the water and add soap. It also gave me a really close shave, which was what I was looking for.Unfortunatly the razor refuses to charge, and I'm not sure why. Because the razor cannot be pluged directly into the wall, it is completly useless. Hopefully I just got a bad one, and everyone else's works fine, because this was a very nice razor, when it worked. I would however not recomend buying a razor that cannot plug into the wall.
