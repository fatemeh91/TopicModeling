review/text: What a great surprise these bars were! I'm a hiker and have used other brands of energy bars -- most of which do the trick but taste like sawdust. The Balance Bar is moist and tasty with the added bonus of a yogurt coating. I had one for breakfast and it lasted me well into lunch with no hunger cravings. I love that they are nutritionally balanced and I will certainly take them along on my next hiking trip.
