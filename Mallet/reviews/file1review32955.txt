review/text: I have used Joint Movement Glucosamine with chondroitin & MSN for years, with the blessing of my orthopaedist. Having this in liquid form is much more effective than pill form. You don't 'notice' less pain or any physical results, just know that it keeps your cartilege from deteriorating. I've had one hand and wrist operated on in 2003, and I believe since I take this product, my left hand and wrist will not need surgery.
