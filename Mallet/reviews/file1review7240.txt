review/text: a foot like that was one of my dreams i though had finally come n true.the food blew my mind when iopend it,it like hsving having the car of your dream,but for your feet,when on it suggested two item most people bought when they ored thr foot tub for total pampering i had a bundle price if you got the foot soak with it.when you purchase something you wish they made so you could soak your feet in soothing oil and pampering foot soaks.i pulled it out read the directi9ons and my new car became like my old care you the old car you could put foot soak and things to make yourfeet nice and soft total relaxation,but that old car you had to keep adding hot water that was a pain. but my new car keeps the water hot but you cant put any foot soaking oils or salt noth for dooth the feet ,all you can do is put you feet in nice warm water,i bought even though i really coulnd afford it that day,i though they would be all gone i ordered it in august birthday slash christmas ppresent,so i didnt open it until october.so its in the closet,and im using the old car again,i wasted over a hundred dollars..let others know its only good for plain water soaking
