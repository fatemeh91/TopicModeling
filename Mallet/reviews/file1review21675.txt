review/text: I had bought the safety 1st inflatable tub first and that lasted for quite a while before it started to leak. It probably would've last longer if my little girl didnt play with it too much. Outside of bath time, she treated it as a play boat and pushed it around the house. =DCompared to the safety 1st inflatable tub - Length is slightly longer and it's also slightly shorter so the body is not covered by water as much. My 1.5 year old loves both. On this one, she can lie down and rest her head when I shampoo and rinse her hair and she really enjoys that. Not sure how long this one will last.Love the suction cup feature. Once you're done, just stick it onto the bathroom wall and is a huge space-saver. The safety first has a hole (to hang) instead of the suction cup. Like the suction cup better.It is a bit more slippery. Don't let your toddler stand by him/herself.
