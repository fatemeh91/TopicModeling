review/text: After almost four years heavy use with the original battery, AB 151, powering my wireless HDR 30 earphones, the recent replacement hardly holds a charge. It came with no instructions for precharging, or for the need. I did so at the risk of warranty infringement.Of several sources at lower prices, I chose the unit sold directly by Amazon, I perhaps fell victim to the 'free shipping' enticement. At $25 plus change it was no biggy.....but perhaps of interest to a few remaininggood music afficiandos.
