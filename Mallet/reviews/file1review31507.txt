review/text: This is the perfect size for taking along on any adventure when pack weight is important. Basic necessities for burns, cuts, and scrapes. Great for the price. If you allow the kit to catch fire and base part of your review on that, you probably shouldn't be putting up a review, now should you? :) Anyway, if anything is expired when you receive it, I'm pretty sure they will replace or refund the item. Don't sweat it.
