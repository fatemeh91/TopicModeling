review/text: It doesn't really hold the floss taut enough to get in the hard to reach areas, and if your teeth are tight together, the lack of tension might prove to be a bit of a challenge to get the floss in between the teeth. I've had the floss get stuck between my teeth and I had to unwind the entire thing from the Flossaid to pull the floss out. No amount of tightening it made it taut enough. (I don't have a problem with things like the disposable flossers or the Reach Flossers.) That's just the way it is with these type of flossing tools. I've had similar ones in the past and they're all like that. The plastic does bend/flex a bit and if it was a sturdier, harder plastic, it may provide more floss tension, but then again, it could cause the Flossaid to snap. It's a give n take so it's fine the way it is. Just gotta learn to work with it. With a bit of patience this gets the job done and it's more economical than buying disposable flossers.The Flossaid is a bit on the wide side so if you have a small mouth, or if you plan on getting it for children, it might not work well.I still think that Reach Flossers and disposable flossers are easier to use, but having to buy refills for the Reach Flossers for the entire family gets really expensive so the Flossaids will do fine.
