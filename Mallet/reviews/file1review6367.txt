review/text: I work in Law Enforcement, run every morning before work, hit the weights at night and consume a lot of protein powder to help keep me lean. I have been using Beverly Products for quite some time now and have had no problems with gains or stomach problems. For some reason I thought I would be thrifty and buy a bag of the Muscletech protein because you get 5 pounds instead of the 2 pound tub I normally get with Beverly Products "UMP" for the same price. Boy did I make a big mistake!!! The Muscletech tastes terrible, is rather runny with almost no water and it killed my stomach. Vomited the stuff out one end and spent time squirting it out the other end in the bathroom. I am going out tomorrow to get more "UMP". Tastes WAY better and without the stomach problems. Also mixes up thicker which I like as I use it to supplement meals and I like it to sit in my stomach a little longer to curb the appetite. If you read this before you buy, take my advice and try the Ultimate Muscle Protein made by Beverly Products. This one will not do you wrong.
