review/text: I suffer some sever back pain. I attend physical therapy, chiropractors, and pain management. I get trigger point injections, I use electrical stimulation, acupuncture, and an infinite amount of pills, creams, and patches. Through all of that, Tiger Balm relieves pain almost more than anything else I have tried. This stuff is great! You can purchase it at any pharmacy, at a fair price, and one little jar lasts a REALLY long time. The only negative I have at all is the strong, menthol smell and slimy, greasy feeling it leaves behind. If you can get past the smell and texture, the deep and lasting pain relief is unbeatable. It works better than than my prescription lidocaine ointment and lasts MUCH longer. The only product I can compare Tiger Balm to is BioFreeze. BioFreeze works quite well also, but I personally like Tiger Balm better. They both smell poorly, but they both work really nicely. I find that Tiger Balm lasts slightly longer than BioFreeze (on my body and in the jar), however BioFreeze rubs in more and leaves less of a greasy texture. Overall Tiger Balm is and excellent product, and I definitely recommend it to anyone with any chronic pain or for temporary soreness or sprains.
