review/text: After initial start up, this monitor continued to display blood pressure far above my normal readings 120/80. The device displayed readings of 190/88 on numerous readings. Concerned that this reading might be correct, I contacted my doctor who measured my BP at 120/80.Also the amount of force on the arm cuff as so strong that I was reluctant to continue use due to the pain it caused.
