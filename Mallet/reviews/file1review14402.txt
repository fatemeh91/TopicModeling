review/text: Seems impossible that a liquid behind the ears would stop motion sickness but it really works. I learned about it from my brother who used it when on a sail boat in the Atlantic. It worked for him and works well for me too. Take offs and landings sometimes gave me motion sickness -- no more! Good stuff.
