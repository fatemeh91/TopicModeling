review/text: Its unbelievable the amount of junk products on the market today. Most people who intake whey protein are people who are active and wanting to better their health, yet 99.8% of whey is chock full of artificial sugars and other various cancer causing chemicals, this seems counter productive to me. Whey to go goes beyond that and they use protein from cows who aren't injected with rBGH. I love this whey protein, you get more protein per serving so that you're not taking 2-3 scoops at a time which makes it last longer, the flavor is good, and most importantly, its not giving you cancer while you take it! Its about time companies step up to the plate and make a quality product that focuses on health, not taste.
