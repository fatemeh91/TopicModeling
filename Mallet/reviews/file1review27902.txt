review/text: I can't say much in regards to the quality of the product as I have no way to test that. But I can say I feel better when I drink a glass in the morning, and the Banana Creme is the best tasting one I have ever had. It's actually quite sweet, and is not at all gritty.Pro's:Many Flavor choicesGreat Flavor (at least the banana creme)Actually a very sweet flavorNot at all gritty like many of the othersInstantly mixesIt's a drink, not a thick shakeCon's:Price, while not outrageous for the quality, it's still on the high sideIf you are looking for a protein drink, then I would recommend giving this one a shot. Start with the smaller size at only $25 that will give you a good idea what you are getting and allow you to try several flavors. I hear some of the flavors are hit and miss, but the banana creme is great if you enjoy those flavors.
