review/text: I think I like this shaver. There are some downsides: It's not pretty and looks cheap, so if you are into looks this is not the shaver for you. It is also very, very loud so watch out if you don't want to wake up the neighborhood. The positives: it gives a very nice shave, much closer than the Phillips I had been using. My face got used to the new blades in a few weeks and ever since then it has been perfect. The battery seems to last a long time as well, as I will shave for a week before it needs a recharge. Since giving a good shave is the ultimate test of a shaver, I consider this to be a good, solid purchase. It also happens to be the only shaver I've seen that is built in the US. The box says, "Finely crafted in the USA of domestic and imported parts." Doing a little research I found out it is manufactured in Sterling, IL. Even though most of the extra components such as the power cord, brushes and trimmer are made in China, the shaver itself is a US product and I like that my money is going back into an American community. I can't speak for its longevity as I just bought it a month ago, but I'll live with the bad looks and the noise for 5 minutes a day in order to get a close, comfortable shave I will have for the entire day.
