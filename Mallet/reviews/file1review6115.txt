review/text: Hefty is always a good brand to buy. These bags are not very thick so avoid putting pointy waste in them. Regular trash works just find. If you have heavy duty items to throw out, these bags will not work for you. I, myself still was unable to use the bags because I purchase the wrong size bags. I should have purchase 33 gallon bags and not 30 gallon bags. My fault, and Hefty is still a good brand to buy.
