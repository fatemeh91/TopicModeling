review/text: Purchased this product at a Health Food store and tried it as I was encountering problems with Gall Stones forming and read many medical & health reviews that Apple Pectin or eating a lot of Fresh Apples per day can help to break up stones into slush to be passed. Boy, does this product work, with such a concentrated amount of apple pectin in one single pill. Any time I have any meal with high fat, like fried foods, which normally cause discomfort, take one of these pectin supplements and do not get any standard right sided gall stone pain that I used to feel. It is a great fiber source as well and have even lost weight using it and just purchased more on Amazon as their costs are much lower than my Health Food store. Great product!
