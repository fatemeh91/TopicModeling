review/text: I am simply amazed by the results... and the pain is not that bad. I did read all of the reviews and that is why I feel I should right one (I do appreciate them and come here first before making purchases). My legs have never been smoother and silkier... My recommendations are start up near the knee on the lower portion of your leg (don't venture down to the ankle until you are comfortable with the feel). The top of your legs will be breeze. I do recommend shaving (or waxing if you can) and then as soon as you see a few hairs come in, epilate them. Do not wait until all your hairs are visible... (it will be more uncomforatable). Also, keep epilating every other day or so, as you see hairs... they hardly come in at all and they are virtually painless to remove. I've even done my bikini area (more difficult, but not unbearable). I started on the underarms, and that has been the "most" difficult... and I'm doing it in stages. (I shaved, then as some hair comes in, I grit my teeth and epilate it.) This is my second attempt at the underarms... the first time, I tried it on the second day of growth, but I had too much hair and it was too difficult, so I decided to shave and epilate the very next day ... and do it daily to get the new growth. My legs are completely accustomed after only three uses. My underarms, however, may require more time. At any rate, I truly love the epilator!
