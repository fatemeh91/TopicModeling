review/text: I've read some review's that state that this Kava does not work for them. The following is how I prepare and enjoy this Kava and I'd suggest everyone try it was well as it's the only way you will get the full benefit.I hate taking pills, so I empty about 4 - 5 of the Kava pills into a coffee mug. I then mix it will boiling water and make a sort of tea out of it. The key is to keep mixing it as you drink it because the kava will settle to the bottom of your mug.The taste is very earthy and I've grown to love it. You will notice that your mouth will become numb after the 2nd or 3rd sip. This is how you know it is working.About halfway through the drink, you will notice a soothing calm come over you. The calmness will last anywhere from 2 to 4 hours or so.It's a perfect way to end a stressful day.
