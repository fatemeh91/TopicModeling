review/text: I've tried a lot of other whey protein powders, but this brand is the best deal for the money. It tastes great, mixes well (I use either soy milk or water) and satisfies my hunger. It's also one of the lowest carb mixes out there. I've also noticed that if I drink one of these shakes right after working out I don't seem to get sore.Let me state up front - I'm not a body builder - I'm an over 50, out of shape housewife getting ready for lap band surgery. I'm losing the weight I need to before the surgery and this stuff is helping. I was using Muscle Milk light, but it has way more carbs and I wasn't losing any weight with it - just building muscle.The Cafe Mocha is great and so is the Butter Cream Toffee.
