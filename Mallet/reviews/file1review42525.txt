review/text: I had gastric bypass not quite 2 years ago so I need drink a protein shake every morning. The flavors can get pretty boring so I'm always trying different brands to find that &#34;perfect shake&#34;.The Dymatize Elite Chocolate Fudge doesn't taste quite as good as the ON Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate but it's pretty close. The Dymatize is a little bit sweeter but it's that &#34;diet&#34; sweeter. I personally prefer the ON GS flavor which is a little less sweet but tastes more &#34;natural&#34;.Fortunately, I can make just about any shake taste good since I'm not too worried about calories. If it helps somebody, this is my idea of a great tasting shake with right about 50 grams of protein:1.5 (12 oz) water2 scoops of Dymatize Elite (or ON Gold Standard) - Chocolate Fudge/Double Rich Chocolate3 Tablespoons of Peanut Butter1 Banana1 Tablespoon of Flax Seed Oil (if you're into that sort of thing, I think it actually enhances the flavor a bit and it's good for you)1-2 Cups of Ice (depending on how &#34;shakey&#34; you want it to be)Blend until smooth
