review/text: had awesome reviews, i actually got it when it was 17 bucks, works alright, not very even, but then it stopped charging like all the low reviews say so now its worthless.. theres a 2 year warrenty but its honestly not that great, doesnt get short enough for me, i just got the istubble and from my limited use i love it
