review/text: I drink this tea regularly for the most part. It doesn't have the after-taste that I hate about most teas. It is a decent energy booster in the mornings (some mornings when I'm drowsy at my desk, drinking this tea helps to resolve my being tired). I can drink this tea after a heavy meal and it helps 'encourage' the digestive process so that I don't walk around feeling bloated with a full stomach. I workout 5-6 times per week (weights and cardio mix) and I do notice a slight increase in fat burning when I drink it at least twice a day.Also, the shipments arrive VERY quickly.
