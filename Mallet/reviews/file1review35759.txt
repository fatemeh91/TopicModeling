review/text: I am now using this orthotic in ALL of my flat shoes. I am about to order two more for two pairs of new shoes. I was introduced to this product more than a year ago when I was seeking relief from foot/leg/knee pain. My body was totally out of alignment and I seemed to be breaking down more and more. Using this orthodic in some very high quality shoes with good arch support has relieved me of all pain. On the rare occasion when I don't use the insert, I sense a decline in my condition. Of note: this orthotic should be replaced regularly, depending upon the amount of use.
