review/text: Good close shave with much less irritation than a razor. If, like I do, you have thick or abundant hair and sensitive skin and need to shave daily this is really a good option. Granted, no electrical shaver will ever shave as close as a blade, but the difference is barely noticeable (with THIS shaver). I have also noticed that to achieve that closeness I was having more and more irritation resulting in less close shaves towards the end of the week. I was also spending more time and money with the razor shave. Reviewers have complained about the price of the cleaning solution but I don't think it would be much different (or maybe even favorable) if you compare it to the price of good quality blades, gel, and aftershave.The shaver itself is really well designed. It feels solid and comfortable in your hand without being a brick.Highly recommended.
