review/text: After struggling for years to find a vitamin that I could take in the morning without getting nauseous, I finally stumbled upon these! I couldn't be happier. I used them for a year before getting pregnant, and actually never got morning sickness (vitamin B build-up or genetics- i have no idea) and was able to take them even with a touchy stomach a few times. I did partner them with the DHA 250 Smart Essentials in the same brand once pregnant and have been happy with those too. Also, I never noticed any after-taste for either vitamin. I highly recommend!
