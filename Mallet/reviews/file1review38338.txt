review/text: I LOVE this little machine! I expected to only use it on my legs but found it very effective for underarm and bikini line also. A small amount of discomfort, but not as much as waxing and certainly more convenient... without the mess :-) Maybe the pain seemed less for me since I was used to waxing.
