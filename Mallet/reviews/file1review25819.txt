review/text: This is by far the finest trimmer I have ever seen or used.It is quiet, the option to use the cord is indespensible if you are in a hurry and it is not charged, there is also no wall-wort so it is great for travel. The adjustability is fantastic, 12 very precise settings, and the removal of the shield for fine trimming and cleaning is wonderful, just be careful trimming, those blades are truly sharp and stay sharp. It is more expensive than other trimmers on the market, but this is well worth it. Excellent quality. Don't cut costs, cut your hair.
