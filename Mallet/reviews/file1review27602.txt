review/text: I have always been a huge fan of optimum nutrition protein. Theirs is held to high standards and is always a very clean and pure protein that tastes good and is not in huge clumps. I wanted to buy a lot because you get a better deal when buying it in bulk. So when I read that the coffee flavor was a limited time, I went ahead and bought 5 lbs of it. (For those wondering, I use two scoops after lifting weights) The taste of it is just alright. I enjoy coffee for the most part, and this is not really like a cup of coffee (then again, you can not expect it to be). I have had a few of my friends try it and a lot of people like it, but to me its just ehh. It tastes like coffee but its not high end coffee. I honestly prefer the chocolate over it, so I advise you, if you already have a flavor you like, stick with it. If you are going to get this flavor, I would advise first getting a smaller size amount and if you like it, buy more. Like i said, I do not really enjoy it, but I have no problem taking down two scoops every other day.I would not buy again (I would get a different flavor).
