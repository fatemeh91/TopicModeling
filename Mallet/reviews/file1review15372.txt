review/text: This is an amazing massager! I have to walk a lot everyday and with a myriad of foot problems, I end up with very tired and achy feet by the end of the day. And it is then that this massager comes into play! I use it mostly on the soles of the feet and I can feel the vibrations all the way up to my shoulders. It is extremely relaxing and soothes my foot aches a lot. A lot of times I am in so much pain that I can't go to sleep and this massager calms me so nice that I drift off to sleep in a few minutes. I also love the little tingly feeling that lasts for a while after you actually stop the massager, makes my feet feel light and floaty and it relaxes my entire body. I have used it on my back and arms as well, but that doesn't feel quite as good as on the feet, because for one thing, the back and arms have a lot more bones that the footsoles and the massaging head hurts when it hits against my bones. I like to put it mostly against more muscular spots like the calves or thighs. So if you're a bony person like me, you might want to keep the metallic head away from your bones. The best way to find out what works best for you is to try it and see what works best. But all in all, I definitely recommend this product for its muscle-relaxing and foot-soothing capacities!
