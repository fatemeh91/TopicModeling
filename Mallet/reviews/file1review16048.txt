review/text: These vitamins contain herbs that cause loose stools. After taking them for two weeks, and looking up the herbal ingredients on www.fda.gov, I knew it was the herbs causing a type of bowel problem that I had never experienced before. I have normal bowel functioning now that I threw out the vitamins! I happened to have my annual physical exam shortly after this and my internist confirmed my evaluation.
