review/text: Purchased GUM Go Betweens Proabrush Refills after visiting my dentist and having my regular dental cleaning. The staff recommended that I use the GUM Go Betweens Proabrush in cleaning between my teeth and after using them for a while I found them to be very good at cleaning between my teeth. The wide size is a little too big for most of my teeth. The medium size works best for me. I will purchase this product again and recommend it as well.
