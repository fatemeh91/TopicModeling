review/text: I originally purchased this during a freak out over my first abnormal pap smear. I had six weeks till my coloscopy and saw that research indicated this is helpful. My doctor during the coloscopy saw nothing! She took a few biopsies to make sure and they all came back negative! I could not be more pleased.I am 40 and during the last ten years my cycles have been AWFUL. They were socially unacceptable horrible pms, ridiculous bleeding and clotting, and I had several other symptoms such as hair loss, weight gain etc that my doctors always attributed to my hypothyroidism.My first period taking this was so light! I had hardly any cramps and was able to do stuff the first day! It was a miracle. I looked into the information, I had never heard of estrogen dominance. To this I have since added progestelle during my luteal phase and stopped using manufactured lotions and replaced my soaps with castille. My life has completely changed. My periods are back to the way they were in my twenties. This has been a miracle for me.
