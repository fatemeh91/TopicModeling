review/text: I love these bags. They are strong enough to stand up on their own. I use them in my house to toss all of our recyclable items into and then just take it out to the bin when it is full. Sure makes it a lot easier than having a bunch of little bags or bins around, espeically since we don't have to seperate all our our stuff by type.
