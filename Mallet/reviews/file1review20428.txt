review/text: I have found the Tush Cush to be very effective for improving buttocks and back pain during long car trips. It doesn't feel soft and cushy when you first sit on it, but the forward tilt of the pelvis really takes pressure off the buttocks and lower back. I'm no longer in pain when I reach my destination.
