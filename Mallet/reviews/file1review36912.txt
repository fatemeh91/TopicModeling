review/text: My dentist recommended this GLIDE dental floss. The floss performed perfectly on my tightly spaced teeth just like my dentist promised! This floss didn't break or shred, as is the case with most other dental flosses. This floss was able to glide easily between each and every tooth with no struggling whatsoever. I highly recommend GLIDE to anyone...especially people who usually shred their floss while flossing.
