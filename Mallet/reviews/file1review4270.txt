review/text: The Gillette Fusion is a great blade but doesn't last long. I found a secret that makes a blade last 4-6 months. After shaving, rinse the blades well, knock the loose water from the blade by taping on a dry towel and then blow on it until it is very dry. Shaving does not make the blade wear out---rust does. Leaving the blade wet will lead to micro-rust in a few days so figure out how to dry it after using and it will stay very sharp for months. Try it and you will see.
