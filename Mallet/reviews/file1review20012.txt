review/text: I do not recommend this tub. The baby is in an awkward position in it, and if his head turns to the side, it is up against a jutting edge. This tub was too big for my sink, so I used it on the countertop. It only holds a couple of inches of water before it starts spilling out at the folding areas, so the baby is always cold during the bath.
