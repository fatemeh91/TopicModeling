review/text: The Bottom Line On Top@Definitely better than average taste, relatively good nutritional values for this type of product, a little thin on ingredients that one recognizes as food, not organic.Ever since my son was a toddler, toddling around and asking for "cookie bars," I've been unduly interested in this type of snack, especially because the quality and taste vary so much. One of the best taste tests (akin to blind testing) is to put some bars in a bag, shale it up, and pull one out at random. The test--or game--is whether you can tell what kind of flavor the manufacturers and marketers claim for their product. Does it taste true to the label, or do you wind up with a sweet, vitamin enhanced version of "mystery meat."Zone Perfect's "Fudge Graham" somehow has a very convincing graham cracker taste with the usual chocolate overlay. As you can tell, I was more impressed with this graham cracker flavor;; to paraphrase a well known thatrical saying: Chocolate is easy; Graham is hard. In fact, the "nutriton bad" (as ZOne prefers to call it) is just a little too sweet, perhaps because of the emphasis on the chocolate.The ingredietns list doesn't offer me many clues about the origins of the taste, but perhaps you'll fgure it out:SOY PROTEIN NUGGETS (ISOLATED SOY PROTEIN, RICE STARCH, TAPIOCA STARCH, SALT), CORN SYRUP, CHOCOLATE FLAVORED COATING [SUGAR, FRACTIONATED PALM KERNEL AND PALM OILS, COCOA POWDER (PROCESSED WITH ALKALI), NONFAT MILK, SORBITAN MONOSTEARATE, SOY LECITHIN, NATURAL FLAVOR], MILK PROTEIN ISOLATE, HIGH OLEIC SUNFLOWER OIL, MARSHMALLOW PIECES (POWDERED SUGAR, FRACTIONATED PALM KERNEL OIL, GUM ARABIC, NATURAL FLAVOR), FRUCTOSE.Less than 2% of the following: GLYCERINE, COCOA BUTTER, NATURAL FLAVORS, CALCIUM PHOSPHATE, ASCORBIC ACID, GELLAN GUM, SODIUM CITRATE, CORN SYRUP SOLIDS, d-ALPHA-TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, MAGNESIUM OXIDE, SOY LECITHIN, NIACINAMIDE, ZINC OXIDE, CALCIUM PANTOTHENATE, FERROUS FUMARATE, PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE, VITAMIN A PALMITATE, RIBOFLAVIN, THIAMINE MONONITRATE, FOLIC ACID, CHROMIUM CHLORIDE, BIOTIN, SODIUM SELENITE, SODIUM MOLYBDATE, CYANOCOBALAMIN.Ack! I don;t like all those chemical enhancers, but that's par for the nutrition course (and there are no steroids!) In fact, the "additives" give you the fairly high vitamin/mineral content (although most people will agree that it's mroe healthy to obtain these from whole foods (those things that grow in the ground, not the store).

Calories, fat, and sodium seem relatively good, you get 12% of the RDV of protein, and a chemical romance of vitamins and minerals. (Perhaps a nutritionist, nurse, doctor, and/or registered dietician can follow up this review with more information on the body's absorption/metabolism of these ingredients. Heck, I didn;t even take physiology, seduced as I was into those tempting social sciences. One big surprise here is the lact of any dietary fiber, something that's good for you and helps you feel full. Give it a try, but be on the look out (I mean, if you feel like it) for better specs. elsewhere.
