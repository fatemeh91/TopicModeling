review/text: Great item! Exactly as represented. This item is very well made and not likely to fall apart in short order. I've sprayed it with a waterproofing/stain resisting product to help keep it clean and effective for use in all weather conditions. The only drawback is that it is a little narrower than I would like. Great job!
