review/text: I've been up and down (literally!) with many a blade (Schick Extreme 3, Gillette Sensor 3, a regular bic) you get the idea. And so far nothing has worked for me as well as the good ol' Gillette Mach 3. It's been a mainstay in my medicine cabinet for more than 3 years now!It does the job it's intended to do quite well, and the regular 4 pk pretty much does me a week and half. Unfortunately, I only get 2 shaves per blade, and the 2nd is NEVER as good as the first, obviously. But this is more a matter of an individual's facial hair, not so much the blade, and is too open to debate which detracts from the message I am trying to give. To me, the MACH 3 is the best non-battery powered (see MACH 3 TURBO, which I have not tried at this time) disposable razor that you can buy today, that I have triedThe one drawback may be in the price. In recent years the price of the original 4 pack has shot up quite noticeably. I can remember buying one for maybe $6.98 CDN and now I can't find one under $8.98CDN, and this is at WAL-MART, no less! But that really has nothing to do with the quality of the razor, which is awesome.The absolute very best shave may be found in one of those expensive Philips or Braun electric shavers with the fancy bells and whistles, and if you want to shell out extra cash for one, go for it. But for those on a budget and want a great shave, you needn't go any further than the original MACH 3 blade. These days, there are a few spin-offs, such as the TURBO as well as a new FUSION brand (with 5 blades! Pretty soon they'll make one that just takes off a whole layer of your skin!), and I am interested in checking those out, only thing is they are TERRIBLY expensive. For tried and true, grab a MACH 3, and start shaving!
