review/text: Studex is very trustworthy. Every shop in town was out of turquoise studs so I got these. Took it to the lady and got my cartilage pierced. My ear rejected the piercing but that doesn't reflect the quality of the earring itself. The time it took to ship was excellent also. Only thing is I wish the color was closer to real turquoise.
