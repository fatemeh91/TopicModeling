review/text: I'm hooked. Because of my arthritis I drink two eight once glasses of black cherry juice daily. Unfortunately I can not live without it but I am thankful I do not have to take medication. The last black cherry juice I used was a tart variety and it worked great but didn't taste as good as Dynamic Health Black Cherry. The only reason I am not still using it is because the price went up to almost double from where it started. As long as Dynamic Health doesn't raise their prices I'll keep using it. I mix one bottle with one gallon of water plus I add a little apple juice for flavor enhancement.Highly recommended.
