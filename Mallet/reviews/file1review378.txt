review/text: This is and was one of my most favorite vibrators. While the size is a little large the beads and movment of the shaft combined with the tantalizing bunny ears leave a Big O not to be forgotten! Couple of notes they state the item is waterproof not true a few uses in the tub and every time water got in battery compartment. Also this vibrator has a battery compartment that is removed from vibrator and this broke in a very short time rendering the vibrator useless. I tried to contact the company for a replacment compartment but no response thus far.
