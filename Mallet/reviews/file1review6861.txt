review/text: I purchased a Carlson 10x magnifier hoping to view 35mm slides during sorting and quickly learned that this item is almost useless.Placing it right on the slide produces an image that is difficult to view.It is not large enough to view the entire slide image without moving the magnifier and also distorts the image edges.I would return it but it is not even worth that effort.
