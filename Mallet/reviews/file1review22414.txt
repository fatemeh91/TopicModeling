review/text: Well, for the price, you would think that they would atleast stick. There is no adhesive in these. Nothing like a bandaid. I have to use medical tape as soon as I put them on. I read that you have to wash them daily? Kinda weird. I do, but it doesn't help with them sticking. I don't know if they are helping my scar or not, it hasn't been very long. But I'm very dissappointed that I have to use medical tape, cause now I can't wear them during the day without looking like I have a war wound. I was expecting to just put it on like a bandaid and go about my business..there is more up-keep then I had hoped for.
