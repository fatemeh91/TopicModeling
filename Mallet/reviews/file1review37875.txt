review/text: The belladonna question is answered when one looks at how homeopathic remedies are made. There is not enough belladonna in the whole bottle of pills to be toxic. The FDA knows this, so yes, any announcements by them concerning homeopathics are designed to scare the public. I have used homeopathy for 30 years My children and grandchildren have enjoyed the fruits of teething tablets...that is a sane and happy Mommy and Grandmother.I lived in Houston Texas for many years and EVERY mother I knew used them. All of the midwives I knew and every pediatrician recommended them. Now I am in Missouri where people are not as quick to go less than mainstream but every single person I have turned on to camimilla 6x or 12x or a teething tablet has been sold.And the children are so much happier when they feel better.
