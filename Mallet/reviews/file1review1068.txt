review/text: I was thrilled to see what a bargain these replacement heads were compared to the store. I ended up throwing them out and going to the store. Don't waste your money. The top part of the head rotates, but the bottom half does nothing. The "real" ones, both parts of the head rotate. I don't know why this even says CREST on it.
