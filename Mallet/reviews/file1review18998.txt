review/text: I bought 3 of these 16oz flavorless Benifiber containers ~9 months ago, and they was great: had no taste, dissolved fast, and was sold at a great price. ...When I ran out of Benifiber, I came back here to see discover it was out of stock, and I've since tried the flavorless Metamucil: which actually had a taste that I didn't like so much.I'm now juicing my own fruits & veggies - getting my fiber the "natural way." However, I did really enjoy Beneifiber while I was cooking/using it. I recommend this product if you can get it for a decent price. ...However, I don't recommend Metamucil because it just doesn't taste that good in plain-water.
