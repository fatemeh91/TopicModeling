review/text: I have been taking this close to two weeks now & have already seen a difference within myself. I'm not 100 percent sure its because of this product or not, but my hair and nails are a lot healthier and seem to be growing at a faster rate then usual. My overall health is better, I have more energy then I used too. As well as an increased sex drive. So far I have had no side effects. I take 2 in the mornings on a full stomach, then one around dinner. I've been ttc for over 3 years now and am really hoping this is the answer to my prays and I finally get that positive pregnancy test. We will see in a week or two. If not, I will continue to take this product for another couple months. If I do become pregnant I will update and give this product 5 stars. Good luck to all trying to conceive.
