review/text: I have tried many razors and no manual razor is safe for me. No electrics have worked without problems. The norelco razors severly burn and even cut my skin. I can use other foil shavers such as remington but they take a long time and I can't skip one shave or I have to use a blade. The braun activator actually shaves closer than my razor blade and can handle a skipped shave or two. It also causes absolutely no rash on my neck. Nothing else is like this. I am truly amazed at this one. I am planning on buying at least one more in case something happens to the one I have and just in case they stop making them. Electric razor models always seem to come and go over time and nothing is better than this one. Listen to the warnings other people give on the other razors or you will waste money like I did. I don't know why the funny shaped foil would make such a difference but it sure does.
