review/text: I have been taking DHEA for about 6 months now. I have used a number of different brands. I believe most of the pharmaceutical grade products are the most effective. Nature's Plus DHEA however adds 2 additional features that I think make it the best on the market. First it is micronized which means that the DHEA is ground or pulverized into particles that are just a few "microns" in diameter. Also it includes with it Bioperine which is said to increase the bioavailability of nutritional compounds. I am not sure what makes it so effective but this product definitely increase my testosterone levels. The other products work as well, but with this product I can really tell.I have to admit, I have not done any blood test. But as a male my body is telling me that this product is the best on the market.
