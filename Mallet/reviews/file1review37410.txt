review/text: I've used this product twice since buying it, and am pretty disappointed. I got used to the pain, but it took hours just to do (most of) my legs, because you have to go so slow. Additionally, I noticed that both times I had stubble the next day, which indicates that it is merely breaking some of the hair off at the skin, not taking out the bulb. So it takes a comparatively huge amount of time and is less effective than shaving or waxing. I would recommend waxing, and then using the epilator to get the hairs that waxing missed.
