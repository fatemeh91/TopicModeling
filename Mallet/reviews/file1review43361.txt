review/text: The latest research on Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) and it's effect on cancer is still pretty preliminary. Animal studies conducted in legitimate labs have shown that MCP has the ability to limit cancer metastases in a major way. In addition MCP has little or no side effects. So I figured, what the heck. Might as well give it a try. My order was filled and delivered promptly. Is it working? I don't know. My oncologist has given me a good report, but it might be like the New Yorker with the elephant warding amulet. His friend says, "But there aren't any elephants around here." The guy replies: "See how well it's working." We'll see.
