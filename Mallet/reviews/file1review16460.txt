review/text: Really didn't work for me, by the end of the day I was pretty smelly and thats just sitting at a desk typing all day. And I do NOT have a problem with odor control. I think this is the first time I have ever put on deodorant and in less than 24 hours started to smell like BO.The scent to me is pretty mild, not like vicks, not like anything much really. But I can tell you what smelt strong, my pits after a day with this deodorant. Ewww.If the trade off is to be all natural and stinky, or full of chemicals and smell great I take smelling great.Too bad I bought two sticks at once :(.
