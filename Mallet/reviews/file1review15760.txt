review/text: If your trying to get ahead in this world and looking for one of those finer details that will make you respected in the boardroom, keep this pen on you at all times. After working with those cheap plastic pens this feels substantial when you hold it and looks way better. Also, you have the ability to switch between black, red, and pencil which is awesome. Mine fell out of my pocket during a taxi cab so I intend to purchase another replacement.
