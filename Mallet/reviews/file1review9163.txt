review/text: I had been using a standard sized organizer similar in set up to this, but wanted something that held everything I needed and this seemed like a good buy. Not so, at least for me anyway.Pro: Size of each compartment is extremely generous. I have no problem having supplements such as calcium chews and fish oil in this along with medications and room to spare. For those like myself not needing medications at bedtime I find the bottom compartment handy for keeping an extra dose of my allergy medication and the like.Cons: Compartments don't close reliably or snap well at all. I've placed this in my lunch bag actively thinking "I had best make sure I position this so it won't open", but it did anyway despite my planning. This might be an OK product for someone who doesn't plan on taking them out of the tray and just using it at home until they can find a better one. The plastic seems rather flimsy as well and won't likely last too long. The compartments don't snap into the tray very well either and while putting one day's container in it often shifts another one out of place.I'll be able to give this away to someone without a problem and thankfully they aren't all that expensive, though I don't like throwing any amount of money away. I typically find reviews for products sold on Amazon to be very reliable - most people who wrote a review seemed to think it was a very good product with a few dissenters. When many more people than not give a positive rating to a product I'm more inclined to purchase it. This is one of those rare cases in which I wish I had paid a bit more attention to the dissenters. I've only owned this for 3 days and am not impressed at all.
