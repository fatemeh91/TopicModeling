review/text: This is a pretty simple review: these work, but not as well as other brands that I've tried. I don't believe Nature's Secret is one of the villains of the supplement business - granted, their slick packaging and marketing screams MLM and 95% gross margins - but neither do they make the most effective products that I've tried. 2 stars, since they work but not spectacularly.For me at least, Liquid Gel Digestion Enzymes have roughly the same effect as Beano when taken with high fiber foods, but don't really go above and beyond. For some people, that'll be fine, and they're priced appropriately. I don't know if its the non-enteric (e.g. it releases its product in the stomach rather than further down) delivery system on these, but I've found at least one other (albeit significantly more expensive) product that does have enteric packaging. My experience is that the competing product has substantially more noticable effects when taken before questionable meals (but I won't identify them with a free advertisement).For some this will work well. For me it worked a little. Hence, 2 stars.
