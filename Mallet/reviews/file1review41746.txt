review/text: After researching the best toothbrush through the internet and by asking my dentist and periodontist,I concluded that electric brushes were significantly superior to regular ones,and that the line of Oral B Triumph electric brushes did the best job.The best brush head is FlossAction although some feel more comfortable with Precision Clean,so try both brush heads and if they feel similar,go with FlossAction.
