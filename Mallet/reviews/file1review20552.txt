review/text: Great for babies! After a bit of practice, it is very easy to insert it properly into the kids' ears to get a proper reading. Major benefit is the speed. The old thermometers may be perceived as more accurate but I never had the heart to insert one into my babies' rectums and they take forever when done orally or under the arm. This is definitely the way to go.
