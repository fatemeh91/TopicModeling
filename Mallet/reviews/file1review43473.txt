review/text: The Omrom HDM-711AC is very reliable once you come to terms with the correct placement of the arm band.I ordered it for my parents (both of whom are over 80 yrs) and they use it daily to monitor their blood pressure. While it does log the last readings, there's no way to monitor who's reading it was if you're using for more than one patient - therefore a paper log is best.
