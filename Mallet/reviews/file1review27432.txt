review/text: This is a great supplement to take for nutrition. I take a serving after breakfast every morning and it improves my brain function throughout the day. I also take this before my workouts (usually basketball or weights) providing me with extra energy to exercise longer. IMO, it's definitely good to have a bottle of this around to get that extra nutrition. I will always have this stuff around going forward.
