review/text: I floss my teeth every night using tape-type floss. I had tried the regular Glide and really hated it. This is better because it was thicker, but I still didn't like it nearly as much as my regular brand. The two primary things I disliked about it were: it's made of a plastic-feeling material and cut into my fingers when I used it, and because it feels slippery, it doesn't seem to remove plaque nearly as well as my usual brand. I don't expect to use it again, nor would I recommend it to friends or family.
