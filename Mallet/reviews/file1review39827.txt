review/text: I recieved aOntel Products GOPMO2 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool Setfor Christmas of 2009 and it broke in July of 2010. My Mom has owned 3 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools in a 2 year period. I even tried to fix one of her Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools that had a suction cup on the end that kept falling off, that the 30 day warranty was up on. I used a bit longer screw since the other one flew into the unknown when it broke and to try to get a better connection. I also used super glue with the longer screw and it broke again 3 days later. I would NOT reccomend this Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool . There are better Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools out there to purchase. The Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool seems to always break after the 30 day warranty has expired. Amazon.com has much better grabbers for sale.
