review/text: Unlike other users' experiences, my Waterpik has not malfunctioned in the three years that I've owned it. But I usually wipe it down with a clean cloth after use because excess moisture can quickly lead to grime. Regularly maintaining it really makes a big difference. It is extremely loud, however, so I wouldn't recommend using it when people are sleeping nearby.Overall, it's a very good product that helps reduce gum inflammation and bleeding. It has a good range of pressure settings, from gentle to very forceful. When I purchased it, the box included a blue tip, a pink tip, and a tongue scraper.
