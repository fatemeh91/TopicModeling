review/text: This is a good powder. It is tasty and it dissolves quite well in a shaker bottle. Stirring it in a glass it clumped up a little, not as bad as most, but I've never encountered a powder that mixes completely by stirring it. I usually put this in a blender with a banana, skim milk and ice cubes, tastes great.
