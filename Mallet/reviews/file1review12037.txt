review/text: This is my first pregnancy, so I don't have a whole lot to compare to - but I really do love these prenatal vitamins! Prior to receiving them in the mail, I was just taking my regular women's multivitamin. This was the time when I had my morning sickness and nausea throughout the day and I felt terrible. Ever since getting and taking my Rainbow Light Just Once prenatals, I have felt wonderful with little to no nausea! I can't necessarily say for a fact that the vitamins make me feel better, but I think they did. One day when I forgot to take one when I normally do, I ended up feeling pretty awful. These have not upset my stomach whatsoever, they are very easy for me to take, and they don't taste or smell that bad. One other benefit I have noticed is they have kept me very regular, which is always a good thing! If you're used to taking a multivitamin, you should not have trouble with these. I'm glad I made the purchase!
