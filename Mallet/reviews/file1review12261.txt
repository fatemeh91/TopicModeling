review/text: This is my 3rd pregnancy and suffered slight morning sickness as well as pretty bad restless leg syndrome in the 2nd/3rd trimester; these vitamins were recomended to me and I can't believe with this pregnancy I have had no morning sickness and absolutly no issues with restless leg syndrome at night....I did find that I ran out of these and had some pain the few nights I didn't take it but quickly restocked and no more pain ...Love these!
