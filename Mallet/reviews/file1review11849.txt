review/text: Blech!! I have to plug my nose to get this stuff down in the morning. I've been using American Sports Nutrition, American Whey in Chocolate... religiously, but when my local dealer was out of it one day, she talked me into switching to this...telling me that it tasted great. AWFUL, absolutely awful in comparison to American Whey. I can't wait until she gets it back in stock, so I can ditch this stuff. What a waste of money!!
