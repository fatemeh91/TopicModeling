review/text: I had paid quite a lot of money a number of years back for a Sharper Image nose hair trimmer. It worked very well for all these years. A replacement was required and one for that particular trimmer was not available. So I did my research and figured the panasonic 411NC should be a good one. Well it wasn't good.......It was GREAT! Trims very close, the way I like it, and is very easy to use and clean. This is, by far, the best trimmer I have ever owned!
