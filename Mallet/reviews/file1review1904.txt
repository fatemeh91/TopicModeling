review/text: Recently my four year old had a play date who had a ringworm infection that spread to our family unfortunately, and we have been battling them for almost 2 months. After trying home remedies (bleach which makes it spread if rubbed FYI, vinegar, etc) I came across this and have been pleased. It's very effective and everyone in my family can use it, even though my daughter and I have sensitive skin. I even added some to my body wash so that the smell isn't so "medicated", yet it still gives the tingling feeling that I call effectiveness. Not that the smell is unpleasant, it's very clean, I just found it a lot nicer when mixed with my own soap. Hope this helps!
