review/text: I have a Mach 3 and an electric. I'm not entirely happy with either of them. Electric sometimes doesn't cut sufficiently or else chafes off skin as well, leaving it flaky and the Mach 3 occasionally cuts me. Bought this Fusion a while ago and just got around to trying it. First impressions is that it's terrible. I'm glad I didn't buy any replacement cartridges. Cut my face all over the place. If manuals have a tendency to snag on your hairs at all, it's five time worse with this (since there's five blades to snag). Additionally, there's more space between the blade guards so it's easier to cut yourself - that is, I found it hard to shave along the curve of my face/neck etc.. It kept snagging and cutting me, despite the fancy vibration. I may give it another try without the battery on to see if it works any better, but so far less than impressed. The only positive feature is that the vibration makes it easier to rinse out hair than the Mach 3.
