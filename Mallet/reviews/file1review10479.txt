review/text: The Corona Carbon Fiber cigar case is a very understated yet sophisticated way to show you know the best when you see it. This case is very classy and holds two good sized cigars -- up to a 52 ring gauge cigar will fit inside and length can be up to about 6.5 inches -- depending on shape, sometimes you must precut a pyramid cigar, but that's no problem as you're going to smoke it anyway....
