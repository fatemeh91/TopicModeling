review/text: Reason for purchasing:First one failed after about 6 months and this was a pretty cheap watch to replace.Not New:Item did not appear new, it appeared the item had been returned by someone else then sent to us as a "new item". The watch was taped to the stand with scotch tape and everything practically fell a part. The box inner box and watch were just stuffed in the show/retail box.Customer Service:Contacted the number, well tried to contact customer support. They are only open between certain hours and did not return our first 2 voice messages. The third time we called we got a person who just kept repeating well does it work, and there is nothing I can do about it. Finally after about 30 minutes on the phone she said we can send the watch back and after they get the item back they would send another which would take about 2-4 weeks.Final Thoughts:I will not buy a third watch from this company.
