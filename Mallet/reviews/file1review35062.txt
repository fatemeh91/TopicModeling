review/text: I'm sure this work for some people, and if so it's entirely the placebo effect. Not that that's a bad thing - it's actually an enormously powerful effect that can do good in a person's life. However, for whatever reason - and against my better judgement - I bought this product because it was listed on a breastfeeding website as a tool to help a low (or non-existent in my case) let-down of milk. I used this spray as directed, and also dozens of times more. Nothin.So - nothing against Bach's. I just blame myself for letting the stress get to me to such a point that I actually spent money on this stuff.Actually I watched a Tony Robbins DVD and that took care of the problem quite well!A happy day to you -
