review/text: I may be weird, but I actually LIKE the taste of VitaMineral Green. It isn't bitter like most green supplements - it tastes like Springtime. VitaMineral Green fills me up so I don't snack between meals as much, and I do feel alert and energized when I drink it. I use a scoop each day in plain water, and just keep refilling my water bottle until it goes pale green. This causes me to drink substantially more water than I did before. I've tried mixing it in juice but I really prefer it mixed in plain water.I don't know how much I believe in the health claims of green foods supplements, but taking VMG definitely helps me with hydration, and keeps me "regular".
