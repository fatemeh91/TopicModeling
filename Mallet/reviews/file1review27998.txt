review/text: After tasting musclemilk, its very hard to drink this. Instead I mix it with my oatmeal in teh morning. The taste and ability to dissolve are not very good. Mixing with Milk helps, but at that point you may as well get musclemilk.Overall, I would say Musclemilk light is the way to go if you are looking for low calories and good protein and taste.
