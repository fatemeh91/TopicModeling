review/text: I really, really wanted to like this product but I've ended up hardly ever using it anymore because it won't hold the temperature long enough. When heated it often gets too hot, then you have to wait for it to cool or put a towel between your skin and the wrap, and then it's too cool to be beneficial within minutes.
