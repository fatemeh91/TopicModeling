review/text: I read about this product before I bought it. It was recommended by a person with chronic Crohn's disease. I've been on it for around 45 days now and my Crohn's has not flared up once. Of course eating correctly contributes to this but I feel better now, have more energy, and notice my digestive system is regular and rebounds so much faster. I'm able to come off Prednisone now which I was not able to before taking this product. I highly recommend this to not only Crohn's sufferers but anyone with a family history of digestive or auto-immune diseases.
