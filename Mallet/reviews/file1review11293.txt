review/text: This product is incredibly effective for candida overgrowth. It took me a long time to realize candida was basically the main factor in some of my medical issues (namely trouble swallowing and other things). I did the doctor rounds for 2 years and not a peep about it. I'm taking 3 capsules twice a day (every 9-12 hours give or take). My throat issue was better within 24 hours of the first 6 capsules, within 48 hours it was gone completely without even adjusting my diet in any way. This was a problem I had for 4+ years, 48 hours later zip, zero, nada...no food get's stuck in my throat, period. After about a week of taking it my acid reflux has also been significantly reduced enough that it doesn't wake me up when I'm sleeping.About the product itself well it's really strong stuff and you'll feel the effects, taste, and smell of what I'm guessing is the tea tree oil and you will taste the garlic afterwards. The effects of the die off vary but will be fairly heavy with this product (for me they generally hit at night) if you take the full dose such as weakness in my legs. I suggest not driving for at least an hour after taking a half dose (3 capsules) so maybe 2.5 hours after a full dose (6) if that's how you're doing it; it's not dangerous to do but it does make me slightly "wired" if I don't eat anything before taking the capsules.You can't/shouldn't make medical claims about vitamins but it's probably worth a shot if you feel you have symptoms of candida and are getting nowhere with medical professionals. As for other things or worse cases you might want to supplement the stronger ingredients in this product with other capsules particularly the grapefruit seed extract and the pau d'arco (not the tea tree oil however) but that's something to discuss with your health care professional.
