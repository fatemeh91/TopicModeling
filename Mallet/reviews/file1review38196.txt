review/text: This moisturizing foot cream works like magic! From time to time the soles of my feet develop deep, painful "wrinkle lines" from being crammed into poorly fitting shoes. Two or three overnight applications of this cream always take care of the problem by softening the skin before actual cracks develop.This cream also works wonders whenever the skin between my toes gets dry and starts to flake. A single overnight application will re-moisturize those areas, and doesn't need to be repeated for quite a while. From time to time, I use the cream on my legs if the skin gets dry and itchy. The tube says that you can also use it on knees, elbows, and hands.The cream has the consistency of a thick hand lotion, and it has an unusual, fairly strong, but rather pleasant aloe-ish fragrance. Because it takes a little while for the skin to absorb this cream (like many hand lotions), it is probably best to apply it at bedtime.For feet, this works faster and better than the excellent moisturizing hand lotion recommended by my dermatologist,DML Moisturizing Lotion - 16 fl oz. Evidently Dr. Scholl really does know what's best for feet!
