review/text: It's been some time, but I used this product twice over the years when my crowns quit matching my natural teeth. I had used the Rembrandt bleaching gel from the dentist (with excellent results) and had the tray left over. I recommend not putting this product in a mouth tray. I did and it burned/irritated my front gum so badly it quickly receded from my tooth, affecting the look of the gumline. I also recommend not brushing more often than twice a day with this product. It does bleach well, but care needs to be taken.
