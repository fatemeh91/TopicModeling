review/text: Having just received my gloves 2 days ago (due to being delivered to wrong address by UPS) I am very pleased with them. The warmth they create does help with the pain. Also my joints have started to draw and I am hoping this will help with the drawing, or lack of, by keeping them straight. Thanks.
