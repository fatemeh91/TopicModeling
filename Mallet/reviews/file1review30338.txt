review/text: My husband bought me the Dirt Devil PURPOSE for pets. We have white furniture, with 2 black cats, and 1 grey cat. The product lost it's "awesomeness" after a few uses. I went to Walmart to return it, and look for the next best thing. This was it. GREAT price. I LOVE that it's handheld/compact. I LOVE how long the cord is. The rubber electrostatic bristles are AWESOME at scraping up the cat hair that I can't get up with manual hair brushes. The only thing that concerns me is the pivit feature. The attachment just dangles there like a limp hand. I can't seem to figure out why. I think it would be much better if the attachment was stiff so I could get into the nitty gritty in the couch. Also, it leaves a weird pattern on my couch, not nothing that can't be fixed with a once over with the hand. A small price to pay for a handheld that gets the cat hair off my couch.
