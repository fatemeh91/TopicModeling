review/text: I only do vitamins and supplements to make the wife happy. She tells me the best way to get your vitamins these days is in liquid form. So these Gels were suppose to be a compromise, liquid form but no stinky/bad aftertaste. I think the problem with mine is that maybe one of the Gels broke in the container or on the packing line cause they smell 10 times worse than regular hard multi-vitamins with that unique mineral/vitamin type odor and when you look in the bottle it does have a yellow tinge to it. This one is my fault, but if you can learn from reading and not trying yourself then this might help you, don't ever bite down on one of these things!!! They will pop with very little pressure and taste really nasty.
