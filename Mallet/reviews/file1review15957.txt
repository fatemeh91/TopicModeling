review/text: At about week 22 of my pregnancy with twins, I started getting severe lower back pains. My doctor recommended a pregnancy belt. After receiving it and wearing it a full day, my back pain was significantly reduced. Sometimes, even when wearing it, I still get pains, but more often than not, the belt really, really helps.It's pretty comfortable, but can be a little awkward to wear when going to the bathroom. When I'm at work, I wear it under clothes, and at home, I wear it over my clothes.Before the pregnancy, I was a size 14. As I'm carrying twins, I ordered a large, and it fits great. I'm in my 8th month, and there's at least 5" of expansion room.
