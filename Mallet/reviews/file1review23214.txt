review/text: Of all the things I have purchased recently, this is my favorite. I moved to a beautiful apartment not long ago and unlike the home I had, this place is totally covered with carpet. And I have two cats! I had to get a vacuum, of course, and it works very well. However, it is very heavy and adds to the horrible arthritic pain I suffer with especially down my spine. This BISSELL SWIFT SWEEP SWEEPER 2201-2 is used every day and it is awesome at how well it does. Other reviewers did say that they had trouble with the handle staying together, and knowing that, the problem was solved immediately. Consequently, I have had no problem. It is small and very light weight. I didn't think that it would do as good a job as it does including picking up cat hair. I can even use it in my kitchen where my cats spill their dry food on the tile floor and it picks that up too. I highly recommend this product and you will be doing yourself a favor.
