review/text: Well I bought this item and I was super excited. I went ahead and sprused it up with there mehndi oil, lemon juice, and some sugar. I did a small henna design on my foot, put a sealer, and wrapped it in tissue paper and plastic wrap like the website said. It remained on my foot for a solid 9 hours. Much to my dissapointment when I removed it, the stain was no where near the color it typically is. I waited for three days so it could darken and it didnt get much darker. I suspect they either sent me a bad blend or an older tube.
