review/text: Probably not a good choice for me: this was my first vibe purchase. The vibrations were too weak even turned on to max. The vibration speed control wouldn't stay moblie and kept shifting on/off. This product hurts if you insert deeply and try to thrust. I actually got it stuck. I don't think a woman designed this product because the little bottom "wave" doesn't fit. I definitely will not order on-line again. I think seeing the product up close is a better idea. The price is cheap but you get what you pay for.
