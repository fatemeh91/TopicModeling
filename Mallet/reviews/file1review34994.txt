review/text: DGL German Chocolate tabs taste great! It works but obviously not as good as omeprezole. However, taking omeprezole long-term has risk (as doctors and others have noted), so this makes more sense. One still has to be careful what they eat (don't eat trigger foods that cause acid reflex) even while taking DGL. Also, even with DGL, there may be occasional heartburn, etc.. but I think a few minor episodes are not going to cause damage.
