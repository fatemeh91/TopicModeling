review/text: For those like me who tend to carry tension in the neck area, this is a marvelous invention, especially while at the computer; it sits comfortably on one's shoulders and around the neck, and is definitely an aid to relaxing the affected muscles, and relieving stress. I use it for the hour or so when I'm at the computer late at night after work, and it helps me to go to sleep free from that dreaded stiff and achy feeling.Occasionally I put it between the chair and the small of my back, and it works wonders for any stiffness there as well, and could even also be used as a foot rest.Its blue fabric is a "high-dernier nylon-spandex blend with high-fill EPS beads", and is aptly named "Squish". Deliciously silky soft, it also keeps its shape; if you carefully examine the filling with your fingers, it consists of teeny tiny round beads, so small that you can hardly feel them, and it is these beads (along with the spandex in the fiber) that gives this pillow its ability to be so incredibly soft, and to bounce back into its U shape.Because I want my HoMedics pillow to last a long time and be as hygienic as possible, I keep it in a cotton pillow-case, which may not look as nice, but is serviceable and the "Squish" works just as well with the covering.At the end of each U side there is a plastic circle, approximately 1 and 3/8 in diameter. One end is for the batteries (you'll need 4 AA batteries) and the other is to turn it on.There is a humming noise that comes with it, which since it is near one's ears, it is very audible...sounding rather like a single engine airplane flying overhead. I'm usually very sensitive to sound, but don't mind this steady hum at all...its steadiness might even be part of the relaxation.Anything that reduces stress without any medicinal/chemical additives is a boon to mankind, and this gizmo is an excellent value.
