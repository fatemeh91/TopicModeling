review/text: I love every other product I have gotten from baby jogger, but I was disappointed in this cooler. It's about the size of a lunch box, but it really doesn't even function as well as a lunch box.. I couldn't get it strapped on securely, it kept falling forward. Maybe it was "user error" I don't know. Also, it needs artificial ice, regular ice will leak through the seams, which I suppose would be the case for most soft sided coolers, but that's something you'll need to consider with this purchase. I bought this to take on a family trip where we needed to keep an entire day worth of breast milk cold while museum hopping, and since I didn't have access to a freezer at the hotel, I planned on using ice from the machine. This did not do the trick.
