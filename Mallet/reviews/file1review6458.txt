review/text: This product really works! Perhaps a lot of you are familiar with the pain that I'm about to describe: Every once in a while when I turn my neck to the right, I would feel a throbbing pain/soreness shoot from my neck down to the back of my right shoulder blade. I eventually went to the chiropracter after the problem kept getting worse. I suspected that it was probably from the way that I was sleeping because the pain was mostly evident first thing in the morning.The chiropracter did his thing with the biofreeze,massages and also provided his explaination of what was going on. I couldn't understand 90% of what he was saying because he was using too many big words to describe the muscle groups related to my problem. Nevertheless, this session didn't help much because I was still having pain the very next day.I purchased this BACK buddy after stumbling across and reading all of the good reviews. Within 15 minutes of using this device my neck pain was gone!! Basically what I did was applied pressure directly to the pain periodically for 10-30 seconds at a time. Other than a little soreness from the usage, my neck and shoulder blade pain literally disappeared.This may sound sick but for the past couple days I was hoping that the pain would return so I could have a reason to use the Buddy again. To this day still no pain.But I'm sure at some point the pain will return because I never figured out what was causing it in the first place.Until then, Excellent product. (invented by a chiropractor!)
