review/text: If you use the Fusion razorblades this is a great price for 8 blades. The packaging is a little more generic then what the grocery or drug store carries. They still come in the cartridge so you can load them into your shaver holder (they click into the back). Unlike another review stated these are NOT imitation blades, these are the real thing. Exactly the same as what you get at a brick and mortar store, just less packaging at a much better price.
