review/text: If you like dirty dishes, then this detergent is for you. I truly am not exaggerating when I say that my dishes came out dirtier than when they went in. This leaves a yucky film on all the dishes. No actual food removing occurred with the use of this product. I tried and tried for two weeks - now I've given up and purchased Cascade Complete. My dishes sparkle again, and more important, they are CLEAN. I have tried all of the "natural" detergents I can find. Until one actually works, I'll have to stay with the tried and true.
