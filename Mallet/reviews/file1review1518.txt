review/text: I have the most stubborn plantars wart and after about 2.5 months of applying this every night, my wart has finally gone away. It doesn't hurt at all, as the acid just kills the upper layers of the skin cells. I would recommend taking a shower or at least getting the wart moist with a washcloth so that the medication works the best. I left it on over night and just applied it with a Q-tip with the end cut off, then covering with a bandage. Killing some of the surround skin was a huge concern, because in my opinion, the skin on your foot is thick enough to withstand it. While I don't know if I would recommend it for everyone, I used a cuticle clipper to cut away the dead layers of the wart so that the medication would be able to kill the wart faster. When I didn't, the skin wouldn't peel off like it would for some of the other reviews, and it worked fine.
