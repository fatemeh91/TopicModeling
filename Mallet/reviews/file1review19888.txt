review/text: I looked and tried out a lot of toilet trainers and this one takes the cake. It fits nice on both of my toilets and one is longer then the other. My daughter LOVES this seat and was so excieted to start using it. I purchasd two of these so I would not have to carry it up and down the stairs from bathroom to bathroom. This is THE seat to have. Great product.
