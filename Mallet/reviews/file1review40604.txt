review/text: I just can't believe they state on the front label that this product removes coffee and tea stains! I had guests over, all of whom drink filter coffee, so out of 10 cups that I took out of the dishwasher after using this product, two of them went into the cupboard (they were probably the cups that I'd had my very weak tea in). The others I had to scrub because of the heavy coffee stains and put back in the dishwasher. I actually checked all the dishes to see if the dishwasher had actually been turned on they were so stained! Do not recommend this product and will not use it again.
