review/text: It does a great job and is wonderful for the money, definitely a 5 star product. However, you should note that this cloth in the descriptions shows it inside a blue case, when in reality it actually comes with a black case. I personally don't care, because I like black better anyways, but this should be mentioned in case someone is looking to buy this and the color is a factor. The cloth itself is quite large and feels solid when you hold/pull it, great item for the price, with great quality.
