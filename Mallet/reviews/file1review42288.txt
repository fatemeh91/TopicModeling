review/text: I first used this product when I forgot my multi vitamins on a trip to SF. Tried this for 2 years, then researched & found that JUICE PLUS+ nutraceuticals work much better. JP+ is not a vitamin, it's raw food with more than 10,000 micronutrients. Man-made vitamins can't possibly reproduce what nature has to offer.
