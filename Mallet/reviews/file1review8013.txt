review/text: This Tweezerman point embodies the perfect point design. Its finely pointed,rigid design grasps exceedingly well.I have a number of the far more expensive Rubis tweezers, but they are far too delicate and lack the grasping ability of the Tweezerman.Just ask the man (or woman) who owns one! These Tweezerman tweezers are #1.
