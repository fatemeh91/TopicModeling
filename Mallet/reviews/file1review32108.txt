review/text: I figured I would give these a try since the Oxyclean stain sticks I bought did nothing. These did nothing either. We are only talking about dried blood on light cotton too. Nothing too drastic. In fact, one would expect with cold water and a little stain remover the stains would come right out. Didn't do anything. In fact, after watching it do nothing to remove the stain, these sticks actually made the stain more resistant to simple soap and water. Don't waste your money.
