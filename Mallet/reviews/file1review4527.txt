review/text: I am a huge skeptic when it comes to products and gimmicks to sell them. Which is why I was skeptical when I heard there was a 5 blade razor on the market. In short, I was 'blown away' by this razor's performance and longevity of the blades! I have a very tough and thick, fast growing beard, and this 5 blade easily beats the performance of a 2 or 3 blade razor. My shaves are faster and closer, and the trimmer blade really comes in handy when trimming the hair by my nostrils, and 'fine trimming' my sideburns. In addition, i've had a single cartridge last me 4 months, as long as I rinse it clean after each use! Talk about 'cost effectiveness'! As skeptical as I was initially, after using this great razor for over a year now (and comparing to others), it is easily the BEST razor out there in form and function. WTG Gillette!!!
