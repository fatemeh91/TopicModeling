review/text: I can not believe that I have lived to the age of 73 and not explored the convenience and good job that a carpet sweeper does. We have burgandy carpet, of course, every tiny speck of lint or teeny piece of dry grass shows up. Just one pass of this over and it is gone. It is the most inexpensive I could find as when making an initial investment on something that not used before I have a tendancy to want to &#34;try out&#34;. Have used for three or four months now. This one is good and will buy another when this one wears out.
