review/text: De. Andrew Weill touted this product As a wonderful healing agent for the stomach. However, I got a stomach ache both times I tried it. And it was a bad stomach pain. The first time it happened, I thought it could be something else. When it happened again, I decided not to continue using it.So I shall stick with Inulin FOS and ALIGN to help my stomach.I was disappointed.
