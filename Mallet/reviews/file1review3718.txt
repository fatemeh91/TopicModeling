review/text: It was suposed to be a cleanser. It didn't work for me, as I have problems magnesium alone won't solve. I could not tell the difference between this and a bottle of magnesium I purchased from WalMart. This is my personal experience; I would still encourage people who think it might work to give it a try, as it might work for them.
