review/text: Like many americans, I am trying to eat better, I am lowering my intake of sodium, fat, and all those extra calories that condiments can bring! I love soy sauce, it adds so much flavor to my meals and yet the sodium content is through the roof, i might as well spoon the salt right on my carefully prepared dinner. Bragg Liquid Aminos (could the name be more non appetizing sounding?) is a product that claims its just like your go to soy sauce but with no calories and more importantly less sodium, and its all natural.I really love it, and was pleasantly surprised at how it tastes. It is almost undistinguishable from regular soy sauce, it is a bit "heartier" in its flavor but that just means a little will go a long way. I highly recommend it to anyone trying to cut the sodium out of thier diet but not the taste!
