review/text: All of the Lobob Optimum products are great. I've been wearing gas permeable lenses for a long time, and the cleaner they are the more comfortable they are.This cleaner is the best I've used, and I've tried them all. When combined with their other products you may rethink switching to soft lenses or getting surgery.
