review/text: I've been using Cuts for about a week and a half now and say that it has helped me lose about 4 lbs so far. I played offensive line in college and I've now been out for about 3 years, my playing weight was around 275, though this past year I fell off of working out and I haven't really gotten back into it until this past week. But when I got on the scale two weeks ago and it said 305.6, I said I need to change my lifestyle, so I started watching what I was eating and looked for a supplement that would aid in my weight loss, Cuts has helped, at least from what I can tell so far. Right now I'm hovering around the 300 mark and hoping to continue losing more weight.For the reviews that I've read about how it hasn't helped you lose any weight, there is no miracle supplement out there (outside of tapeworms) that will just shed the lbs right off. In reality you need to watch what you eat, workout and be active, Cuts is just something that will aid in the weight loss, not cause it, so do some sort of exercise, eat well and take this supplement, don't just expect it to work.
