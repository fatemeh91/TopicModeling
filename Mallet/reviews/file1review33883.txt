review/text: I cautiously bought this stethoscope, with my fingers crossed, after reading a lot of positive reviews. As a nursing student, I needed something affordable and durable but that would also allow me to actually hear. I was having trouble with our cheap school stethoscopes, mainly because the earpieces hurt my ears so bad that I couldn't leave them in long enough to even try to hear anything. This stethoscope was affordable without being too cheap, the sound is clear, and it doesn't hurt my ears at all. It is actually pretty comfortable to wear. I have not used it in the clinical setting yet, but I am already very impressed with it. It seems to be well constructed, but only time will tell how well it actually holds up. For now, I am a very satisfied customer.
