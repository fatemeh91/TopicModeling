review/text: The monitor comes in a zipper case. The instrument is automatic with either 115v adapter or 4 AA battery power. I would prefer a 9 volt battery (like a smoke detector battery) which my previous Walgreen unit had. The memory and display are very convenient. There is a time and date clock included in the unit. It seems to work well and shows good repeatability. It is appreciably better than the previous unit I had and cost almost the same dollars.
