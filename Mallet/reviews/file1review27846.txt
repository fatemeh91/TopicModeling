review/text: I have been using Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein Powder for a few years now and it is no doubt the best all around protein powder on the market. I workout 6 days a week - weights 4 days, cardio two days and ON Whey is always the first thing I grab post workout. It does a great job helping my muscles to recover and I always feel energized the following day for my workout.Results aside, this stuff just tastes so much better than any other product. I don't like drinking milk, so I only use water and it is still incredibly tasty. Before finding ON Whey, I tried many competing products and they were simply awful. It felt like a chore to get my necessary protein. However, with ON whey I crave it after my workouts. If you are having trouble finding a good tasting protein, look no further.There's a reason this is one of the best selling protein supplements; it gives you the results you're looking for, it tastes great and it's a good value.
