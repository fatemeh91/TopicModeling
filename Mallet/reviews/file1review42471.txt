review/text: I've tried so many protein powders, andevery protein powder has different tastes.Some are sweet, and some are really chulky.I wanna say this is the one that I've been looking for so long.The taste was little bit strange at first, but nowI cannot try other proteins because I'm totally satisfied with this.
