review/text: I began taking Green Vibrance after my third child was born and my husband was deployed overseas for 6 months. I needed something in my life that would be in balance so why not my health?! I have to say yes, the taste is nasty, but I found the right mix for me...I like to mix it with vanilla rice milk...and my children call it horse food since that's what it smells like, but once the right blend was found it isn't too bad. The bottom line is that while my husband was away I not once became sick, not even with the sniffles and I haven't been since he has been home for 6 months either. I am so thankful I saw this product in my Amazon search!
