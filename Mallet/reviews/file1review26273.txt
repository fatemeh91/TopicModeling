review/text: This product is pretty good in my opinion. I am a first time user. The flaws are that it is pretty noisy at times, especially if you just changed the batteries, but this can be worked around. It also does smell a little at first, but after awhile, this goes away, and it's not all that bad of a smell. it's bigger than it seems and insertion is a little painful and intimidating, speed settings are nice, things stick to it a bit, so you have to clean it frequently.
