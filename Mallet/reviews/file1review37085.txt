review/text: Wow! This is really a great device. At first I was skeptical about a "vibrating" flosser, but this really makes a difference for someone with gum issues. I carry the Hummingbird around with a "pick" installed instead of the flosser. It comes with a clear protector that keeps the pick safe and clean. You can carry it in your pocket and you will have it whenever your need it. I have found that it is getting harder to find, so I think I am going to stock up in case it is discontinued. It would be a shame because it really can make a difference for healthy gums and teeth.
