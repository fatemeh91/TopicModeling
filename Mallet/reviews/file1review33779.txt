review/text: so ive been usinh this product on my lower legs everyday....im not really sure if i see my ingrown hairs fading...however it seems to be bleaching my skin :-/ . my knees and legs are noticeably slighter lighter then before.i had a really big painful ingrown hair in which i treated with tend skin for a few days with a cottonball. it went down and stopped hurting after 3 days. definitely not a miracle product but it seems to be doing something so ill purchase again
