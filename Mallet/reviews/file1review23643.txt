review/text: I work part time from home and I purchased this item because I was looking for some sort of an alarm/timer that could be use by my neighbor to remind her to come over to let my dog out several times a day on those days that I do go into the office. I call her from work to let her know it's her day to let him out and she simply pushes the button in for each hour that she plans to come and let him out. The alarm sounds at each hour that she sets as her reminder, it couldn't be much simpler. Unlike other timers that you have only one or two alarms and you have to fumble around to set up the time you want. By flipping the button for each hour, this timer can be set for up to 24 alarms a day. The alarms can only be set on the hour and not on the half hour but that works fine for my purpose. I assume It works great for it's intended purpose also which is to remind someone to take their pills. Think of you own uses for this time, I'm sure there are lots.
