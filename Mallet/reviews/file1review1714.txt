review/text: I pruchase this to help with a toe nail fungus that had gotten so bad that the toe nail had to be removed. I have had bad heel calouses all my life. 1/4 " thick and cracking that I put lotion on every night. I started washing my feet with this product when I had my toe nail removed, and I washed my entire foot with it. Whithin 1 week I noticed a difference with the calouses on my heels. I am amazed, my heels have not looked this good in years, no lotion, vaseline and socks, have ever done this good of a job on my heels.
