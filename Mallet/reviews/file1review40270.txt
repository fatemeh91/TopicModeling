review/text: I was testing with them from 9dpo and on well at 12 dpo I took an answer test to get my bfp because these just kept coming up negative so I thought...just turns out the line is so faint you need a flash light to see it. The line was even very faint three days after my period still needed flash light to see it.It is very frustrating that the line is so faint and looks negative even when you are pregnant. Would not recommend to ttc experts and poas addicts.
