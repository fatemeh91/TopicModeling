review/text: I always used crest toothpaste, until I read the reviews in consumer reports about ultrabrite. I switched around 10 years ago and have been very happy with results. I guess I'm lucky ... in contrast to other reviewers, I'm able to pick it up at local grocery and walmart stores for under a dollar a tube. It's the best bang for your buck on the toothpaste shelf.
