review/text: consumerreports.org rates these as the best - and they probably are. The ones where you read the lines (the 10 pack) are the best. They are probably the most reliable way to check day after day. Don't forget - surges last from 1 to 3 days, so continue to test, day after day, in the mornings upon wakening.The easy read ones- the digital display - ABSOLUTELY USELESS. Dont waste your money. It comes with machines that don't work. I just tried two that don't work. You cant see the result unless you put it into a useless machine. You will just waste a month.The fertility monitor is expensive and just alright, but it is not reliable because it has a machine that seems to have a mind of its own. Some months it won't even let me test. I would use it only as a secondary way of checking.
