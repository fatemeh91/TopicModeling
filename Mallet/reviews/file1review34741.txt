review/text: I am a very stinky woman, having evidently two different bacterial flora in opposite pits, as odor different on both sides. So i had a hard time finding even the toxic deodorants that helped. I had been using toxic Degree for years. But had read about dusting with baking soda. How's it supposed to stay on? I had gotten all other toxins out of my life (baking soda instead of shampoo works great), but I just lived in fear of offending others on the pit department. Finally, itching pits forced me to make a decision.So I bought 4 different natural deodorants. One was the crystal, which also works great but is a pain to apply, and one was this, Aubreys. It works great for me the most stinky and dealing with more than one skin flora. Also applied to skin folds of belly and it eliminates the need to use antifungals.
