review/text: These are acceptable tweezers, but the ends don't quite line up and one tip is larger than the other. They're blunt at the tips, which is probably a good thing to prevent yourself from accidentally stabbing your skin, but they're too blunt to be very helpful for ingrown hairs.Good try, but I'm still going to try other brands to find a better one.
