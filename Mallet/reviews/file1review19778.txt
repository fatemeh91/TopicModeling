review/text: So easy to put on, use and take off that my two-year-old has no problem doing it by himself. I have an oval, enlongated toilet that we use this seat on. A twist of the dial in back simply adjusts it to fit. There's no screwing and unscrewing it each time you use it... just do it once for fit.There's a different brand at church that has handles, so I thought he'd miss not having the them to hold onto. He doesn't miss them at all. In fact, if you are potty training, it's best to imitate the really thing anyways. You're not going to find handles on a public toilet, so why train your kids to get used to them being there?The rubber edge allows it to grip the seat. You put it on there and it's not going to slip.The gentle contour of the front splash guard makes it a great seat for both boys and girls to use. It doesn't get in the way and is still functional.It does what it says and does it well. Very happy with this purchase.
