review/text: I am not a body-building aficionado, or anything like that, but I started taking whey once a day because every health publication you read talked about how it is one of the best things you can buy to help build muscle and curb your appetite. I tried a few different types of powder, and this is the best I have tried. It isn't expensive, and it taste great. I mix 16 ounces of water with two scoops, once a day, and it fills me up. I have only been using it for about a month, but I can already see results. I definitely recommend it.
