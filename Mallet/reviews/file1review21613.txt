review/text: I actually really like this tub. This was an upgrade from our infant tub for my now 6 month old. I could inflate it with my mouth which took about 3 minutes. It also has a built in drain. I have had it now for about a month and I haven't had any problems with it deflating. My daughter loves it too. The bottom of it on the inside has a little bit of a grip feel to it so my daughter isn't sliding all over the place and she has plenty of room. she likes to sit sideways and stuff her feet at the bottom crease which helps her keep her balance. It fits great in our tub. I give it 4 stars because I have one complaint. When she is sitting in the tub and I open the drain I have to hold the drain hole up for the water to drain. Otherwise the hole will sit flush to the bottom of the actual tub and the water comes out really slow if at all. And I do have to pick it up and dump it if I want to get all the water out of the bottom. Its not that much of a pain I just think I was spoiled with my previous tub. So in the end I think it was a good buy. I had a hard time finding a inflatable tub with a drain other than munckins giant duck tub so I would recommend this purchase to mommies who are ready for an upgrade.
