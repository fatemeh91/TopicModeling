review/text: I took this product after a friend of mine and I were talking about weight lose methods of the stars (article she read) She thought it was an ad. Anyway, I went out and bought some to try. The first dosage as directed at breakfast, within 15 minutes I had rapid heartbeat, my skin felt itchy and red and I had a terrible headache. I took some benedryl for the itch and redness and tylenol for the headache. I felt bad for 2 days. I do NOT recommend.
