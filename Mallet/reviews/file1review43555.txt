review/text: This monitor is very easy to use. I like how it stores and averages out all your blood pressure readings. Adjusting all the modes (time, date, etc) is easy to do. I do have a little difficulty putting the cuff on in the proper position; the cuff tends to turn around my arm when I try to tighten it. All in all a very good instrument.
