review/text: There are so many brands from marketing companies that spend a ton of money on advertising in the mags to attract buyers but at the end of the day Solgar is the granddaddy of them all.I've been buying this product at the local health store for about a year and usually mix it in water and I'll add a Splenda packet, drop a half tray of ice into the blender and it's just great.I usually mix it with the Alive! Vanilla vitamin/mineral Ultra Shake and break it up into 2 meals and sip at it as I work though a bag of steamed veg.If you are deathly allergic to soy - be advised there is a minute amount (under 1%) of 'Soy Lecithin' as another poster indicates. For those deathly allergic, this makes this product a pass.For the other 99.99% - it's just a great great product.5 Stars.
