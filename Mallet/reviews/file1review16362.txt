review/text: Even applied directly from the jar to the face, this shaving cream lathers nicely and smells quite pleasant (but not overpowering). I still prefer the Eton College scent, but this does rival the avocado scent for second favorite.This is the fourth Taylor of Old Bond Street tub I've bought over the years. That's not because they run out quickly: only one jar has ever actually done so. I just like their shaving creams enough to have started a small collection.
