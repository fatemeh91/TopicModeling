review/text: I use these batteries in my SB800 Nikon and they are fantastic. Of all the batteries I've tried, these have given the fastest recycle times and the longest life. I'm not sure why other people are having problems - maybe they don't give the batteries chance to complete the re-charging times. I've had mine for 6 months and approximately 50 recharge cycles and they are still great.
