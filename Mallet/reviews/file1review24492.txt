review/text: Finally, a comfort gel pad that works! I have tried numerous pads that you "stick" inside your shoes which never stay in place and ruin your shoes. You can place these gel pads right on your foot in exactly the spot that hurts. I wear them with my designer high heeled sandals as well as my hiking boots. They stay perfectly in place and are easy to remove and wash. They seem to stick better if you wash after each use. I bought some for my husband and they really help him too.
