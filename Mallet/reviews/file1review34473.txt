review/text: This patch works extremely well, I believe it works just as well as the nicoderm cq. There is no burning at the patch site and itching is very slight. I usually buy the 21 mg and cut them down when I'm ready to cut back. The patch stays on and I don't have excess sticky residue when I remove the patch.
