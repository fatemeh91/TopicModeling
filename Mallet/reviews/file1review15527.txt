review/text: I just received this yesterday and have already burned several sticks. I don't know everything there is to know about incense, but I have been using it for 13 years. During that time I have burned many different brands and scents. Auric Blends is definitely one of the better brands I've used. The scent is wonderful and they burn slowly. I can't say I've timed it, but I can guess somewhere between 30-60 minutes. Just how long incense should burn.I was pretty hesitant before this. I had ordered Dragon's Blood incense from another seller on Amazon and Night Queen from Auric Blends. (I had never used either sellers before) The Dragon's Blood arrived first and I was very disappointed after burning the first stick. It smelled horrible! Then 2 days later, the Night Queen I ordered from Auric Blends arrived.... I will be buying my incense from Auric Blends from now on.
