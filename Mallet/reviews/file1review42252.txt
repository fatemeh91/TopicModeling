review/text: Started taking this vitamin religiously 2 years ago based on a recommendation from a friend, and I have not been sick since. I feel like my body is absorbing it faster, and it does not give me any stomach discomfort. The taste is ok, although it gets a worst once I get towards the bottom of the 30oz bottle (I am the only one using it). It's very good mixed with orange juice or in a smoothie.
