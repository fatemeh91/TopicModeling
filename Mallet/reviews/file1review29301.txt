review/text: Oh I love the extra long flexable straws . When I go to a drive through to get a large drink they always give you a short straw . I would always get wet from tilting the cup the liquid would leak through the top rim . Now I no longer have to tilt the cup to drink . I carry them in my car at all times and wash them to reuse them !
