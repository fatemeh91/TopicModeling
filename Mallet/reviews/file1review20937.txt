review/text: This product was delivered promptly and was exactly as described. I have had to delay taking it because after ordering, I read on another internet source that guggul gum (one of the two main ingredients in this supplement) should not be taken by those on prescription cholesterol lowering drugs. I am on Lipitor and was warned that guggul, however effective it might be on its own, will at certain dosages reduce or negate the efficacy of the statin drugs. There was no warning about this at all on this company's website (or on many others I visited), so I felt inclined to submit this review.
