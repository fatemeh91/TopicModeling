review/text: I was going along fine with pregnancy until they gave me the prescription prenatal which had parabens and dyes in it. Don't know why they add that stuff when it's not necessary. I started getting sick and decided to order these. I took them all through the first and most of the second before they decided to try a prenatal that had the "stool softener" in it. I wasn't having problems but figured soon I would. This prenatal actually made constipation worse so I again, switched back to Rainbow Light and all was better. All of our ultrasounds show a very healthy, very very active baby - why rock the boat? I am in my 3rd trimester and doing great. Only negative is that this vitamin may not have as much iron as the prescriptions - I just started an iron supplement of 325mg.
