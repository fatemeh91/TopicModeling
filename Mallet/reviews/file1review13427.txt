review/text: I have been looking for a heavy duty protector I could use (and re-use) for an out of the litter box problem with one of my cats. I wanted to find something I was sure did not have some kind of &#34;attractant&#34; in it - many pet pads are meant to be used for training which was absolutely not what I wanted. I thought something for human would be heavy duty enough, really absorbent and safe. I also wanted to avoid something too bulky and awkward to wash (the size is great and there is no problem washing 3 or 4 per laundry load.I have used two of these to cover my couch (when stressed this cat might pee on the couch several days in a row). It has been several years now since I bought these sheet protectors and they are still as good as new.They wash and dry very easily and do not retain odors or stains.I sometimes cannot get to washing them immediately and will replace the pad and let the soaked one dry out. That has never been a problem either.Because I am using them for cats (and when it comes to pee they probably can detect it even if there is only one molecule of pee left), I first use some &#34;Bac-Out&#34; (it's a natural enzyme product) on the stain and wash . I then do a second regular wash with my normal soap and an extra rinse. I know I am overdoing it but I prefer taking that precaution and making sure there is no trace of smell left!:)
