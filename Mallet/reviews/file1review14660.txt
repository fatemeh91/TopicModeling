review/text: As with any supplement, it is better to check with a doctor first, I took this because there were some theories that it might help with tinnitus, but after using it for over a year I have noticed no difference. In fact I started developing a slight nagging headache that went away when I stopped.It definitely needs to be taken with food and you should know that this is a prescription drug in Europe. It is purported to be an aid for memory improvement and an anti inflammatory drug.Because of these properties you should also be aware that anyone with blood pressure problems or who is taking blood thinners should not take this.So for some this might work well - just did not for me
