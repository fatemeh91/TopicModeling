review/text: I'm now on my third Emjoi Optima Epilator after my previous two stopped operating properly so obviously I think they're great epilators. However, each of my previous two stopped working correctly after about a year and a half, so I highly recommend these epilators with one caveat: expect to receive one to two years of great epilating action but don't be surprised when it stops working after that time.
