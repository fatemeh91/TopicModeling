review/text: This product worked well for about a week. Grandpa's Pine Tar Soap works well for me. The product is great for other types of skin. But I have extremely sensitive oily skin that will freak out if I put anything with exfoliants on my skin. I guess this is too much for me. But with other types of skin it would probably great. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
