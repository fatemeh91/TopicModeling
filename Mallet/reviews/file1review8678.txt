review/text: OXO makes great stylish products, that one can always count on to be durable and useful. With this broom OXO came up a little short. First, when the broom was delivered it looked as though it had already been used. Also the head of the broom was a little small. OXO still delivered with their trademark rubber grips which makes sweeping a lot more comfortable. Who knows maybe with this broom I can even get my boyfriend to sweep for once?
