review/text: I have read a number of the reviews and am very confused about this battery.. Many stated that they lasted many hours . When the unit requires 2 AA rechargeable batteries... how could this battery do anything? I thought that it could fit into the stand.... I have an old RS 120 that is still working after many years, without a battery change . I opened up the unit, and there is no battery in it. The headphones have 2 AA rechargeable batteries.. Are we being misled by Amazon or Sennheiser???When I was ordering the RS 130, I knew nothing about the batteries, relied on the Amazon display.
