review/text: I have been using this shaver for about 3 years now. I use it with no guard to shave my head, and add the guard to trim my goatee. This shaver works great as a "balding clipper" to shave your head bald without worrying about razor burn you get from a razor.I knocked a star off the review because it seems the battery has gone bad, it barely holds a charge for 1 minute now. I came here to find a replacement battery with no luck. I guess for the low price of this shaver it's ok to buy a new one after 3 years, but I plan to try find something with a replaceable battery.
