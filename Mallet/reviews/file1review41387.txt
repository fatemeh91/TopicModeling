review/text: I tried these and the high heel inserts at a local store (Amazon has much cheaper prices, btw), and these were far too narrow for my feet. I wear size 11, but I usually have no problem with fitting into regular shoes. I do not need wide sizes, but the heel cup on these insoles was very uncomfortable. If you have wide feet at all, I would recommend the high-heel version instead. They work well for low shoes too, and in fact, I'm wearing them right now.
