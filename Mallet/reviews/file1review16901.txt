review/text: I had never tried this kind before I bought it but I've always loved any of the clif bars that you can buy in stores. Banana nut bread --- it tastes JUST like banana nut bread. SO DELICIOUS!!! What I love about clif bars is the perfect serving size and also just the right amount of density. It's not too tough a bar to chew but it's not a soft one that you eat right through in a minute and want something else to eat. It's that perfect happy medium.
