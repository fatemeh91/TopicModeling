review/text: This product makes you feel awful. I'm done with it. Stomach aches, headaches, chest pains, trouble breathing, you name it. And I only took 2 a day! The package says you can take up to 6 a day! I can't imagine taking 6. I'm going to try losing weight the old fashioned way....no more diet pills for me.
