review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: JUST READ THE LABEL -- THIS IS HI-CALORIE HEALTH-FOODYes, there is some salt in this, some fat and sucrose too. However, this is an energy snack, not a meal. For an energy snack this snack-bar gets 5-STARs for its natural and organic ingredients without artificial dyes, flavors and preservatives that fill most of the competitions' snack-bars.I'VE GOT SOME SUGAR MONSTERS I'D LIKE TO FEED THESE TO INSTEAD OF THEIR USUAL FARE:Did I mention that they are tasty? Yes, they are a bit rich, but how many do you really expect to eat at once?On this site [AMAZON] or Clif Bar's website you can see just what the ingredients are and all the vitamins and minerals present. Note the natural and organic ingredients, and frankly 210 mg. of sodium is not a bad thing if you are engaged in any physical activity.BOTTOM LINE: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR -- OPPOSITE OF A 'SLIM-JIM'If you can afford the calories and fat in your diet and you like the taste of these little treats, then this is something to eat without fear or guilt. Very few snack-foods on the market today can compare with the purity of these tasty tidbits.
