review/text: I love the taste of the shake that's why I continue to purchase it. Unfortunately it's no longer sold at any of the local health food stores in my area. Its the best tasting of many that I have tried. I add fruit in the morning for my breakfast shake. It also keeps me full until I eat a mid morning snack.
