review/text: Unfortunately, this is the absolutel worst shaver I have ever owned and operated. I have been cutting my own hair for about 10 years, and have been through several shavers, including Wahl products, but this is the worst. Ironically, it is the most I have paid for one before. This shaver vibrates uncontrollably while you are trying to use it, the only question is whether your hand goes numb first or you cut your head numerous times. The only good thing about it is that it does get a close shave; however, at the expense of feeling like your hair is being plucked from your head and scraping your head. I am a Marine so I have been shaving my head for years, so this was not a matter of just never shaving before; the product was a complete disappointment, and if I were not in Iraq I would take steps to try to get a refund but it is too inconvenient at this point.
