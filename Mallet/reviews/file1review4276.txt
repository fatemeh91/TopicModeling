review/text: Not too much to say, but the Fusion is my favorite razor. They cause the least amount of pain, and get the closest shave out of anything I've used. This is probably the best price you will be able to find anywhere ever, except for some knock offs that won't be nearly as good. It may be slightly cheaper to buy them in a larger number, but really.. not that necessary. Just buy enough to get free shipping and you're set. Cheaper than any other website, cheaper than a 40 pack at Costco.These are full of win.
