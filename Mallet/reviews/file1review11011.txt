review/text: I've always been really self conscious about my breath -- not because I have a tendency toward bad breath (I don't) -- it's just something I tend to be really aware of. The reason I purchased Chlorofresh is because lately I've been mouth breathing more when I sleep. I tend to wake up in the middle of the night with such a horrible dog breath taste in my mouth that I have to get up and brush my teeth and tongue just so that I can fall back asleep.Since I started using Chlorofresh (one cap in the morning and one before bed), I no longer wake up wondering what died in my mouth. Now if I could just get my wife to start using them...
