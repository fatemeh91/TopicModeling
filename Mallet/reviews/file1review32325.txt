review/text: I have been using this product for about 8 years now. It is absolutely a lifesaver for me. Due to radiation treatments for head and neck cancer, my saliva glands do not work. At first I had to drink water constantly and it didn't help at all. I always felt like my throat was going to close up, especially at night. Dry mouth hurts. But since I discovered this Biotene gel, I can talk, eat, sleep at night, and feel relatively normal. A little bit in my mouth lasts a long time. A little bit in the mouth, let it melt and you will feel like you have saliva again. There is hardly any taste to it at all. I carry it with me constantly. I am convinced I could not get by without it. I highly recommend it to anyone with dry mouth for any reason!
