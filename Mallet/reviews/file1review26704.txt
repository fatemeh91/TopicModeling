review/text: If it isn't clear from the description, I think this basically fires compressed air down your drain. The idea is it would dislodge any plug. I had a plugged drain and my nearest store didn't have drano so I gave this a shot. It didn't work, but I think it's because the clog was pretty deep in my pipes. The next thing I tried was a 16 food auger, and that didn't reach the problem either.What ended up working was drano MAX. But if you prefer to not use harsh chemicals, I think plumb away could work for some clogs.4 stars for cool idea that should work in theory.
