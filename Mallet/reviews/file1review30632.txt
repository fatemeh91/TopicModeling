review/text: I was a bit spectacular about this razors. I looked at all reviews on amazon on all the razors and come to find out that the Merkur model is the best razor. I was getting tired of the buying new razor blades for my Gillette Fusion at a high price. So I figured I'll give the Merkur razor a try and order it a week ago. As it arrived I was a bit shock how small the device was. I tried the razor immediately and wow did I feel the difference between my Fusion and the Merkur.The only downside is that you have to patients with razor. You may cut yourself if your not careful with this classic razor, but its expected to take your time. I would highly recommend this or any Merkur model razor to anyone. If your still wondering about getting this, watch some videos on YouTube to see if its right for you.
