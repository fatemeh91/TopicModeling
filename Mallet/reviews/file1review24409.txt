review/text: I used to sleep only 3 to 4 hours each night. When I wake up, I used to take a half tablet of ambien to help me make other 3 hours. It was kinda a torture when I wake up very energetic after 3 hours during the night, then force myself to sleep again with the help of the ambien. In my way of looking for an alternate solution, I found Deep Sleep, and I decided to try it out. Since I used this product, I can do now 6 or even 7 hours of sleep in one shot. I take one pill one hour before I go to bed, then I take another pill immediately before I go to bed, and that's it. For almost 4 weeks now, it is working great.
