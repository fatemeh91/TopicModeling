review/text: I purchased these gloves to help reduce swelling in my hands. Unfortunately, they make my hands hot and the swelling gets worse! Then I can't get the gloves off my hands by myself. I thought I'd have to cut them off the last time I tried to wear them. They are not to small when I first put them on, and I measured according to the manufacturer's website for a proper fit.I found another pair on Amazon.com that I love that are made of a stretchy Lycra like material. Much more helpful for me with compression for pain relief!
