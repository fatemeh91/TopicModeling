review/text: It looked like my Mr Clean mop refills but when arrived it was not. They had no metal holes on top to clip into my mop. In fact it was a smooth bar on top and I have no idea what kind of mop handle is suppose to attach to these refill mops. I dont like mopping nor do I like the mopping industry. Every 3 months there seems to be a new mop at the store with new refills and my old refills are just no longer available.
