review/text: I ordered the Cake Batter flavor. I figured it was time to try something new after having used both GROW Whey, and BSN Syntha-6 (both of which are awesome).I should not have dared it this time though.This stuff tastes like S#@%. It mixes fairly well in both milk and water... but the mixing is not the problem. It's the gagging and choking which ensue after you start drinking it.Trust me on this and buy BSN Syntha-6 instead of this crap.
