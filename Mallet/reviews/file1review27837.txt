review/text: Mediocre with water, delicious with almond milk, SUPER delicious with almond/coconut milk blend and at least a teaspoon of instant coffee for a blast of caffeine. This is a great post-workout meal when you need the protein but don't have time for a "real" meal. When I ordered it, I had planned on trying other flavors when this is gone, but it is so delicious I don't want to order something else and be disappointed!
