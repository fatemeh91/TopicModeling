review/text: I've tried this same brand of Whey in vanilla and tropical fruit... not a fan. The vanilla was fake and way too strong. The tropical fruit a little better but nothing to write home about.This stuff though is awesome.What I do is get a big 64oz mug, fill it a third of the way with ice, then water till it is above the ice, then 2 bananas. Blend it all until the I stop hearing the ice break, pour in a scoop of the whey, blend for a few more seconds. Done, great tasting smoothie, 24 grams of protein (plus whatever is in the bananas). Maybe I should try milk instead of water... hmmm....I'm not a bodybuilder really, I am just trying to get in shape, and while I don't know how much the whey is doing for me I have put on a lot of muscle since I started using it.
