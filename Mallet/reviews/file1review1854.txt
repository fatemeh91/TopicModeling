review/text: As many others have reviewed, this product is extremely effective against Athlete's Foot. I've tried medicated powders, sprays, creams, etc and all have only partially helped for years. Tea tree oil is such an effective and natural anti-fungal that I thought I'd give this a go. I use a foot brush along with Pedifix FungaSoap about 3 or 4 days a week and I no longer have any issues. If I get lazy and stop using it for a few days it comes back quickly, so you have to be diligent. Excellent product that I've bought multiple times.
