review/text: I normally buy a different B12 that's more expensive and has a wonderful sweet flavor, without any added ingredients. It's just pure B12. However, I tried this product because I thought the price was great and if I bought in bulk I could save money. Ugh.. bad idea. It tastes like cough syrup!!! I can't even swallow it. Terrible flavor, I'm sorry.
