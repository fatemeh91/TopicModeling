review/text: I've tried whitening strips in the past and had only limited success. On a whim, I bought a tube of this at Dollar Tree, not knowing how well it worked. After just a few days I immediately noticed a difference! My teeth, which have been deeply stained by tea/coffee drinking noticeably started getting whiter. I went back to the store and picked up two more tubes, just so I wouldn't run out in the near future. It's been close to a month now and I'm not even halfway through the first tube, yet there's a dramatic improvement. I cannot be more pleased with these results especially when considering the bargain price. The taste is decent and it doesn't linger after a few swirls of water. My only negative comment about the product is that it's very runny. It's not as thick while brushing like some toothpastes are, and therefore this stuff really splatters while using an electric toothbrush if you're not careful. In spite of this, I highly recommend the Ultrabrite.
