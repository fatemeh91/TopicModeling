review/text: I like this product alot, and I use it for all my baseball hats, and my military covers that need shaped. The Perfect Curve let's you decide between two different shapes which makes getting uniforms ready that much easier. If you use a coffee cup your stuck with one shape that doesn't last long if you have a good bill where the Perfect Curve shapes the whole bill and last longer on a new bill plus the longer you leave it the longer the shape lasts, so if you wanted to store your hats in the Perfect Curve you can. The price could stand to come down but it beats breaking the bill or adding extra time to uniform inspections.
