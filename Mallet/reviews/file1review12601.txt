review/text: Prior to receiving Oxy Powder, I had a hydrotherapy colonic session the weekend before. Without trying to be too graphic, the lady said I needed another session soon because there was something hard that was blocking more stuff from coming out. I then turned to the internet and found Oxy Powder. I liked the reviews and decided to try it. I waited until Friday to take them since I didn't know how my body would react to them. I took four at bedtime and let me tell you; out of all the colon cleansers I've tried throughout my grown years, nothing has worked like this product. It didn't cramp my stomach at all. All I felt was the signals that you receive when you're hungry and your stomach growls. I figured it was removing gas because I started releasing a lot of air at first. About an hour later, I had my first results which were small pebbles. I knew then the lady was right when she said something was hard. However, the second stool released what felt like a hard ball and it was smooth sailing from then on. I had a total of six stools that started around 3am and ended around 11am. I am totally relieved. Bottomline, Oxy Powder saved me about $100 by not having to do another hydrotherapy session the next week as I was told to do. This is my new colon cleansing product from now on but will still do the hydrotherapy colonic twice a year. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!
