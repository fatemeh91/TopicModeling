review/text: Take my word for it....THESE ARE THE BEST! I take a lot of pills...and have had several different types of pill containers, and nothing compares to these. Yes...they are expensive, but once you have them...you will have the best, and you will forget that they cost more. You get what you pay for. I have had 2 sets of these for years. In fact I just ordered two more sets, so I can put my pills together for a month. Yes, the writing on the tops can be a little hard to see, as the writing is small...and it will rub off eventually, but.,.I just took a black marker and wrote on the top..1 (for morning), 2 (for noon), 3 (for evening), 4 (for bedtime). Problem solved. They hold a lot of pills, but are not to big since they are a square. I have no problem opening them, and they do stay closed. When I go out, I just toss them in my purse. Love em!
