review/text: I never understand why manufacturers of a great product have to change the design but that appears to be what happened with this dustpan. My daughter has one that she bought a few years ago and it works beautifully - there are never any small lines of dirt or dust left at the edge of the pan - but hers has a small rubber strip at the bottom of the pan and that must be the reason why hers works so well. I bought one this December because my cheaper dustpan always left that line of dirt but the newer version doesn't have that strip - and it does leave a line. So now this dustpan doesn't work much better than cheaper ones.
