review/text: This product is like chapstick. It goes on so easy. It doesn't damage nearby skin at all. You don't have to be careful with it. I have been using it for a few days, that's all. I would be amazed if it actually does anything. If it does I will come back here and say so. It seems like chapstick. So far, nothing at all.
