review/text: I love how there is a dial to adjust the seat to fit your toilet seat! This prevents the seat from wiggling and moving around. It is comfortable to sit on and easy to clean! We purchased another seat prior to BabyBjorn and it doesn't compare to this seat! The price is a little high but well worth every penny! I recommend it.
