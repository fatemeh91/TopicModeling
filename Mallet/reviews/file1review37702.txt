review/text: I really liked the deodorant. Nice consistency and it was comfortable to ""wear"". I would definitely recommend it. The only thing I would change is the top of the dispenser. The openings are a little too big, making it somewhat hard to dispense just the right amount of deodorant. I ended up getting way too much out the first couple of times I used it.
