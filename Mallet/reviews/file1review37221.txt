review/text: Be very careful with the size you order. Using the size chart, I measured my hand and the chart put me at the high end of the Small size. I have never worn anything small in my life. The instructions suggest ordering the next larger size in this situation. I ordered the Medium.When the product arrived they were too tight to wear so I ordered the Large size. I should have just ordered the Large size in the first place since that is what I normally wear.
