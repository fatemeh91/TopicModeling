review/text: My first shaver was a 3 circular blade one. Only problem was it had no height settings and didn't cut the hair, only ripped it out of your skin.This shaver IS AWESOME. It has bunch of height settings with a height adjuster clipped onto it, and is easily taken off.I took it off and shaved my beard off in 30sec, and I have a HUGE beard. My old "shaver" took at least 5-10min to painfully remove the hair and clean the clogged up "blades".It can even be used to easily shave/trim "down there" or your arm pits.It won't get you baby smooth, but it will get you nice and shaven very quick. If you want baby smooth, just use a razor to finish the job.No batteries needed, it uses a plug just like a cellphone to keep it charged. It should stay charged for many shaves.My only con would be it doesn't have a stand, but I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Fantastic product!
