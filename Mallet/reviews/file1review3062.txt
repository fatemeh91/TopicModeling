review/text: I have never been a fan of condoms, but what man is? I read about "Crown Condoms" in a mens health mag and decided to try them out. The feeling was if I didnt have one on at all. Two different "after the club" experiences and a fling with an ex have sold me with no doubt. I havent had one break even after getting a little rough either. The only issue is that their a little short if your longer then six inches.*UPDATE*Im still not a fan of condoms but I continue to use them... you have too right? Well ive been using Crown Condoms for about a year and even though I may have been a lil over excited in the beginning about them, there still more then decent for the price. There small. Im not huge by any means but they roll on pretty tight and only roll to about five inches. Maybe this is why the sensation is increased, its like wearing an O.J. glove. There cheap and for this reason I bought like 1000 at one time so I refused to not try and use them all. Well a few packs into them, ive given up and started using lambskin. Thats a whole nother story in itself, but ive written a review for them too.
