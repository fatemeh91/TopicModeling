review/text: The doctor recommended I try Spenco or Superfeet 3/4 arches. I bought both and these are definitely more comfortable, however, I saw an ad on TV for another type (one of those infomercials). I had such trouble I figured I'd give them a try and actually like them better! Those are WalkFit. They come in 1/2 sizes (which Spenco do not) and come with 3 different arch heights. I am finding that I use the Spenco on one foot and WalkFit on the other. Just more comfortable. Oh, and WalkFits work great in sandals and in the water (rocky bottom river to be exact - they're entirely plastic, no cushion). Spencos, plastic on the bottom but the cushion is not so good in the water.
