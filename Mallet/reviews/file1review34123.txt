review/text: I loved this jump rope while it lasted. I'm a beginner so I didn't want a rope that was too fast. This one kept great speed, it was the perfect weight and didn't tangle. Only problem is the rope broke at the handle after only a couple of months. I'm hesitant to purchase another because its so much more costly than other ropes. I expected the rope to last a lot longer considering the price.
