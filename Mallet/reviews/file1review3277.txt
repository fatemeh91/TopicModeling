review/text: As per always Amazon Prime delivered on time. I am a great believer in Tweezerman tweezers they really work. I used to buy the cheap drug store ones which never worked really well. I just couldn't overcome my aversion to the price, however my niece lent me hers and I was sold. These particular tweezers are a great size for purse or travel. I ordered two one for my bedside and one for my purse. They have all the grabbing power of the full size tweezers but are compact. The colors are cute too. They also make terrific stocking stuffers as well. I highly recommend them.
