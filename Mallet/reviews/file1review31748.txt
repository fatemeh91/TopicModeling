review/text: I originally gave the product three stars b/c of the faulty compass. After trying the other items, I would give the package four stars.Compass doesn't seem to work. When I turn the entire kit in different directions, the compass needle either doesn't move or it points in the wrong direction. I may ask the company to replace it.The firestarter generates a substantial spark. Other reviews of the firestarter claim it takes a many attempts to generate a spark; my unit generated a spark immediately. I like the one-handed design. I can hold tinder in a high-wind situation with one hand, and generate a spark with my other hand. Also, if one hand is bruised, the tool only requires one hand.It is easy to put the contents back into the sturdy bag.The directions provide clear advice.The white cord is supposedly for fishing. I'm surprised the unit does not include some fishing line. I guess fish are not bothered by a white cord if there's a worm on the hook.
