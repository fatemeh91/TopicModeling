review/text: Has 3 pulsing vibe patterns and the standard continuous vibe with high and low for a total of 5. Operates quietly which is a must when you need to be discrete. First toy that I have owned that uses 9 volt battery. Seems to last longer than the AA or AAA type. Would be even better if it had intensity control for the vibe patterns. Higher quality construction than most similiar type toys I've owned. Hopefully will last a while longer. Can not beat it for the price!
