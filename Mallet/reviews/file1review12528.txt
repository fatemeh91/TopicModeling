review/text: I had horrible stomach pains constantly, i was far from regular, almost going 4 days without any bowel movement and i'm a healthy young active woman, but i could not get over my stomach discomforts. Doctors wanted to put me on all these pills for IBS, but i wanted a solution, not to be on medication forever. If anything, i wanted it to be natural. This is the BEST thing on the market. It's a total flush, you'll go about 3 times a day, you'll never have to sprint to the bathroom, you wont have any stomach pains b/c it really truly aids in digestion like nothing else. For about 5 months i've been using this and I cant live without it. It relieves so much bloat and discomfort and it's not a Laxative, which i love, cause that's really bad for you. I take my dosage about 3 times a week. The only thing i HATE are the pills. IMO, they're HUGE. I wish this would come in powder form, that would be great.
