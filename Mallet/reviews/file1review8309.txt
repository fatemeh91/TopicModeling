review/text: Sometimes a little thing makes a big difference and having the right tool for the job is one of those things. I use a meat grinder several times a week to make pet food for cats and make sausages for myself. This requires scrupulous attention to cleanliness. One of the parts was a little hard to clean on the inside, but this bottle brush makes the job a breeze. It is both flexible enough to easily clean the interior, while the bristles are soft enough not to scratch the metal. I also found it to be an excellent tool for cleaning the square glass containers that I use to store milk in the refrigerator. As you know square kitchen containers can be tricky to clean. This brush is long enough for half gallon containers, but it could be a little short for larger containers. For my purposes, this brush would have been a good purchase at twice the price.
