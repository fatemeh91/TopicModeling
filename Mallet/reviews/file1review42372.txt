review/text: I ordered this product for a friend who recently had a colostomy installed. This product doesn't mask odor, it eliminates it 99%. Can also be used with activated charcoal as an extra measure. His nurse also suggested drinking cranberry juice to reduce processed food odors. This also helps. Personally witnessed!
