review/text: I have 150/80 range of BP. In the last 2 months have taken over one liter daily of hibiscus tea and my systolic blood pressure has not changed at all. Although, the diastolic BP ras reduced 3 points in average. It looks that the hibiscus is not effective as prescribed medications. All is publicity and the evidence is not scientifically validated. Will need to go to my Doctor to ask for medication.
