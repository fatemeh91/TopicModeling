review/text: This personal touch razor was designed in the 1970's and they never changed the original formula for making the razor/blades. The blades are brittle and the "safety" strip can break with as little pressure as it takes to shave your legs, leaving you subject to injury from a straight razor blade. This happened to me, and i had 27 stiches 18 external and 9 internal to hold the wound shut which was about 6 inches long, and an inch deep. I have a permanent scar on my calf. This was all proven in a court of law...i won a lawsuit against Schick. Please be careful if you insist on using this razor, and i am horrified that they are still available at all, as i know i was not the only person this happened to.
