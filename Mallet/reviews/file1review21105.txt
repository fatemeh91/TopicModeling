review/text: After returning a wimpy Sunbeam heating pad at a drugstore due to its inability to get even marginally warm, I am thoroughly pleased with this Thermophore heating pad! First off, this thing is built to last! Very solid construction and materials. And it gets HOT... FAST!! I have no qualms about the trigger-like button that you need to hold down until the desired heat is reached. It's a non-issue with me and besides, I like having control over the temperature vs having to settle for a preset temperature I'm not happy with. And I'd MUCH rather have a heating pad that has the potential of getting hotter than I'd like than one that never gets anywhere near hot enough. I'm a happy customer!!
