review/text: I usually get this ginger hard candy from &#34;Down to Earth&#34; store but they were out of it for over a month. Decided to order it from Amazon. I use it especially when I feel a cold coming on or coughing. It really soothes the throat and clears up congestion. I prefer the hard candy over the chews although the chews are good too. It also helps when your throat is dry. It's worth it with the free shipping.
