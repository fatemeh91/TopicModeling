review/text: I can understand the other reviewers comments about the smell of this product. When I first sprayed it I thought I had made a mistake but I do agree with a couple other reviewers when they said that you get used to the smell. . .and it is, I think, a pleasant smell which does remind me of being in a spa. I do usually keep the overhead fan on for awhile too since my husband showers after me and it's usually too steamy for me to see the mirror.We just put an addition on our home including a new master bathroom with a tiled shower. We haven't shelled out the cash for the glass door yet so I just have a clear shower curtain. I spray this on the tile walls, floor and then the shower curtain after my husband gets out of the shower every day. We have hard water but when I check the shower curtain after it has dried there have not been little to no water spots. I've been using the product consistently for 2 months and I just bought more.
