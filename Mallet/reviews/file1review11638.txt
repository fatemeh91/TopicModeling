review/text: I have owned mine for about 6 months. I had a Littmann lightweight prior to this one. You can hear a lot more with the Delphi, especially in the back of a loud ambulance. Not as good as the top Littmann Cardiology, but pretty close. Only issue I have had is the diaphram on the back keeps falling off, I finally gave up and work without it now. For the price you really can't complain.
