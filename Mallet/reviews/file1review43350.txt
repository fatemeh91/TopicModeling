review/text: Not too soft, and not too hard; just right when used for dishes. Don't scrub the teeth of your pet walrus with it though, too soft for that, Quickie won't cut through the fish-slime plaque. Also, howler monkeys strongly dislike having their beards brushed with the Quickie, it's too firm for that.Check out this two-headed pygmy giraffe neck warmerNeck Warmer for Two-Headed Pygmy Giraffe
