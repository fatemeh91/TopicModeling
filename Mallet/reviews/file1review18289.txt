review/text: As a Physical Therapist with 40 years experience, I can assure you these are a far cry from the &#34;hot packs&#34; I used in the clinic back in the day. These are almost worthless; holds heat five minutes.... at best. Better off buying a good electric heating pad and wrapping a hot, moist towel around it. I wondered why they were so inexpensive; now I know why. I have no axe to grind against Chattanooga Group; this product simply should be taken off the market or be remanufactured to the quality hydrocollator hot pack of the past.
