review/text: I put Speed Stick on in the morning and I am set for the rest of the day; a day which includes walking around work and doing some distance running. However, I would suggest that you reapply after heavy perspiration, just to be safe. The fragrance of Ocean Surf is refreshing and should be unnoticeable to those around you. Although, the odor may slightly conflict with any after shave or cologne causing the ultra sensitive (like me) to feel slightly nauseous. Overall Speed Stick is great and I will continue to use it as opposed to the less pleasant smelling Gillette and Arm and Hammer deodorants I used to use.
