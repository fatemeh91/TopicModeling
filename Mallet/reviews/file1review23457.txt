review/text: I'm just starting a nursing program at a community college and I love my stethoscope! We are working on vital signs and it works well with listening to the heart as well as Blood Pressure. When I saw other students have stethoscopes with a diaphragm AND a bell I got a little worried that maybe I should have gotten something like that, but mine works great, so I am very happy with my adorable stethoscope. It is very comfortable too :)
