review/text: I got this for my elderly dad to get in and out of the car easily. However, I learned a few things about this after watching him use it for a few weeks:1. Someone else commented about this before, and that is when my dad pulls on the handle while getting into the car, the pulling force at times would try to shut the car door, making it harder and annoying to use this as a leverage.2. If you are using this in a place that has heavy downpour or rains often, beware. Part of the strap is exposed to the outside since it loops around the door frame. The exposed strap soaks up rain (or water from car wash). After some time, it could be as little as 5 mins, the water finds its way through the strap into the car. Basically the strap inside the car will eventually be wet, and water will start dripping down on the person's lap who is sitting right by it (in my case, my dad). The more the rain came down and prolonged, the more the dripping in the car.3. I find my dad eventually used this more of a hanging arm rest than an entry/exit aid. I also found myself resting my arm through it too while someone else was driving.All and all, not bad, but watch out for the fine points noted.
