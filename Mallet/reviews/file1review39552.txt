review/text: Was very disappointed in this. The label shows that this is "gel,", but what I got was "lotionized." I prefer the gel and was glad to see Amazon had it, quickly found out it was labeled incorrectly. There is a major difference between gel and lotion. It still does the job, but I just prefer the gel. You don't use as much.
