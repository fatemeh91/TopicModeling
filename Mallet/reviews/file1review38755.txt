review/text: I was looking for a good light meal supplement when I come across this product, Amazon's lightening deal helped me make up my mind on the purchase. The item came very quickly and I of course had to try it immediately. I mixed a scoop full of powder with 8 oz of whole milk (personal preference) and the 'shake' came out heavenly! Very smooth without strange tastes you'd find in some other similar products. I also love the nutritional value it gives, it makes me feel healthy indulging my chocolate craving.I cannot comment on the weight loss effect of this product nor how it compares to the other flavors, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again when this runs out.
