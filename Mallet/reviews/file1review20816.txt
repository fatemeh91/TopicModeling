review/text: This shaver shaves closer than the Norelco I had previously, but there is still room for improvement. This is a good shaver, but I will only discuss my complaints:1) Its noisy. I hesitate to use it or the cleaning feature in the morning when I get up before my wife is awake.2) It doesn't do a good job with the long side-growing hairs around my adam's apple. (I have yet to find an electric that does)3) It rests in its cleaning base pointing to the left and away from the user. Its quite awkward to remove from its base if you are right handed.4) Its expensive and you have to account for an additional $60 per year in cleaning solution if you clean it as recommended.
