review/text: I like to shave in the shower, and Panasonic's wet/dry shavers seem to be the only available choice. They do work great . . . until they fail spontaneously. They have the most amazing warranty expiration detectors. Every Panasonic shaver that I owned managed to fail within 3 months after the warranty expired.There are two varieties. The cheaper shavers have a clip-on charger. On those, the clip will break. The more expensive ones use an induction system. Those will simply fail to charge after the warranty expires.
