review/text: Unfortunately it just doesn't work. Using conductive gel and electric tweezers just isn't practical. The gel dries out too fast and when it does, it is no longer conductive. If you used it in a high-humidity environment you might a tiny bit more success but still dreadfully unsatisfactory. Finding a standard needle probe to replace the tweezers and gel would probably work. Save your money.
