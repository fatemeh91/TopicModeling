review/text: The cervical collar I received is not the one shown on Amazon web site. It is a smaller model. It works pretty well but is not really long enough for my needs. The model shown is available from the elasto gel web site. The one (mistakenly ?) sent by Amazon is best for the upper shoulder area. The claim that is stays hot for 25-30 minutes is exaggerated. After 15 minutes it cools to mildly warm. The fact that it can used a a cold pack as well, is a plus.
