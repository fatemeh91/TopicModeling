review/text: Peppermint was suggested to me by my gastroenterologist and I'd searched for them in local pharmacy and grocery but didn't find them. I knew could probably get them at a vitamin store but didn't want to make a special trip so ordered off Amazon (my preference for online ordering). Pills arrived on time and packaged well...thing is they are too big for me to swallow. Nothing against the seller, my throat is too sore to swallow large pills and I forgot to check if they were capsules, they were not they are solid pill and too large for me. I didn't send them back but will never take them....someday they will wind up in the trash. If you have problem swallowing pills, don't get these. (They are blue and have a strange odor too).
