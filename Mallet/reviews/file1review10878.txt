review/text: I saw where one person said this helped their RLS . Mine was so bad that I was having a very hard time sleeping at night since it seems to get worse in the evenings. Ordered a bottle of the Magnesium Citrate , and received it within a week . Took one pill before bed time , and was a little skeptical . It worked withinn 15 minutes , and my legs just stopped twitching . I thought maybe mind over matter , but it really does work !! Have taken a pill at night for the last month, and have had the best sleep in a very long time. So very happy to have read that review !! Love this product , and would buy from seller again !!
