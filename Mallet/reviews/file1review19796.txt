review/text: Our little one is in the 90% for height and the little potties just weren't comfortable for her. After careful research, I purchased this potty seat and it was miraculous! She liked being able to put the seat on the toilet herself and she felt comfortable and secure sitting on it. We've had the seat for well over a year and it's still in great condition. We store it between the toilet and the sink when it's not in use. I'm an Amazon fanatic and I've made a few regrettable purchases, but this seat definitely does not fall into that category. Believe me, it works and your child will want to sit on it and go potty. We also purchased a potty chart (Dora) and in no time our little one was using the potty on her own! I must mention that she has an expressive language delay and would rather just go do things independently and that is why I think the seat worked: she could go get her seat and put it on the toilet where it locked in securely--the seat stays put and does not slide around like others. Potty training is not easy, so I'm really glad this product exists to help us along the way.
