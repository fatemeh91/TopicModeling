review/text: This product was horrible. It made me so ILL. I was irritable, stressed, anxious, nauseous and jittery on this product at this review for four solid hours. And when I wanted the feeling to end after taking it - it just kept going and going and going. BEWARE of using this on a work night. I'm serious. I've never said "Oh God, please help me!" this many times, in utter dismay, in my life! I am returning my unused product to the store. Celsius Drink is not for everyone and your physician should be consulted before taking something that so significantly alters your body chemistry for such extended periods of time. I will never do this to myself again. Scary stuff. Be afraid and drink at your own peril.
