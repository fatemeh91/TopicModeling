review/text: My little guy had a cold and I found this product is hard to find in my local stores...so I ordered it online. It really helped him. The formula is more delicate than adult vapor rubs which was perfect for my 10 month old son. The product came at a decent speed and the packaging protected the jar from being damaged.
