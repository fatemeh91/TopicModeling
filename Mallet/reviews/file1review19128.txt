review/text: I feel that this is an easy product to use and results are easy to read (when you go to the web site, see below). However, it is very messy to take the test. I also disliked the fact that they did not send instructions on reading the results you had to go to their website to figure out how the test worked and how to read the test.For a dollar would I use again? I am not sure. Sometime less mess is worth the price, sometimes not.
