review/text: Your dishes will probably get cleaner without using any of this soap at all!!Even after pre-rinsing the dishes and not putting anything in dishwasher that was caked on, my dishes still came out very dirty.To me using a environmentally product on dishes that you then have to hand wash completely negates the 'environmental' aspect of using it.What a waste of water (and time! and money!). Shame on an 'environmentally conscious' company for creating such a ineffective product that leads to so much water waste.I got much better results with Ecover which proves you can use natural ingredients and still be effective.
