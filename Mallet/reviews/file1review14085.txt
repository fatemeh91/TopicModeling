review/text: This is a horrible product and the picture should be pulled for false advertising. When you set it up the whole thing sags. The baby wipe containers will not stay in the top pocket 1)because of the sagging and 2)because the pocket is so huge. The pockets on the side of the diaper wipes are virtually useless because of the sag. If the bottom is more than half way filled with disposable diapers the organizer gets so heavy. If you dont have bars on your changing table you need to use the provided stick on velcro straps, but if the organizer gets too heavy it will pull on the glue and come off. In the end I found myself with a half full organizer resting on the ground (because the straps pulled off), wipes on the changing table (because it wouldnt stay in the organizer) and a long line of sticky glue on my changing table because the organizer pulled off.
