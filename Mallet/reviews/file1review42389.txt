review/text: Unlike Aspartame (Equal/NutraSweet) or Sucralose (Splenda) or Acesulfame-K or any of the other dangerous chemicals that have been put in just about every food and drink nowadays, even GUM and vitamins, STEVIA is the natural extract of a sweet leaf.Stevia has been used for THOUSANDS of years without ANY bad health or side effects.Until just recently, Japan had a LAW that no artificial sweetener could be used in ANY food or drink! When you bought a DIET COKE in Japan, it used to have STEVIA in it! Unfortunately, now they too have been forced to put Aspartame in their soft drinks.Stevia not only is safe for diabetics, but is actually GOOD for diabetics and helps diabetes! It does not promote tooth decay, and even though the FDA admits it is safe enough for it to be on store shelves, they will only allow it so long as Stevia does NOT say it is a sweetener, the US law says Stevia has to be called a "nutritional supplement" to satisfy the big money corperations that make Aspartame and Sucralose that pay good money to make sure the FDA does not allow any competition!I was researching this for many years when trying to find a sugar substitute for my diabetic family member. I myself don't like the taste of Stevia because it has too much a taste of licorice, and I don't want everything I sweeten to taste like licorice. Other than that, this would be perfect and solve all sugar free problems.So far, I have found nothing that is as good as sugar, and sugar is all I use, but for people that come over that want sugar free sweeteners, all I offer in my home is Stevia.Not Equal, Not Sacharin.You will never see any WARNING labels on Stevia as you do on all the other "sweeteners" that the FDA approves!!
