review/text: Picked these suckers up at Babies R Us. Tasty, but pricy.There are seven flavors. Lemon, orange and raspberry are all sour. The zip really wakes up the senses and eases the tummy. And they're delish. They also reminded me to drink more lemonade (which was also helpful) and eat more oranges (again, helpful). In fact, sniffing orange peels is pretty appealing these days too.As for the minty variety, the peppermint and spearment are mild but effective. I found mint drops to be essential during my first pregnancy, so I am enjoying these.As for lavender and ginger, well, the lavender tastes better than it sounds. Your tongue tastes the sweet, and your nose breaths out the flowery scent. I much prefer spraying lavender aromatherapy spray on my hand and taking a wiff. Just as effective of chasing away nausea (at least temporarily) without the funky taste. It's not horrible; I'm just sitting here sucking it wishing it were peppermint.The verdict isn't out for the ginger yet. I don't particularly care for ginger, so I'm guessing I'll either tolerate or hate this flavor. I certainly wish you could purchase sour-only or minty-only. I'd drop lavender and ginger in a heartbeat.These pops have certainly generated pricesless ideas for easing morning sickness. They're great to have on hand, but the roof of your mouth can only handle so much sugar before it goes raw, so get creative with the flavors in other avenues. But definately give these suckers a try.P.S. Preggy pops come in sour only, so I'm gonna try those next.
