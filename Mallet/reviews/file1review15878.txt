review/text: I am pregnant with twins and work as an orthopedic surgical nurse. I began having sciatic pain, back pain and lower abdominal pressure early on in my pregnancy (at around 3mths). I had used a similar brace during my first pregnancy 4 yrs ago and it had helped. This brace has been a god send. It gives my body the added support I need in order to perform my demanding job. It has also helped with the added pains and pressures with having twins and growing at an accelerated pace. From the day I started using it many of my pains subsided or dissappeared. I can guarantee that I would not be able to work if I did not have this brace. D. Giusti, San Diego, CA 10/12/08
