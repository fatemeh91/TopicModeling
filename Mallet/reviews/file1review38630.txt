review/text: I am an alternative practitioner who needs this particular product for myself. I first found it at the Lake of the Ozarks when another practitioner recommended it to me. These capsules worked better than the tablets I'd used in the past and I really love it. An easy-going (so to speak) construct of herbs that work well - I would recommend it to anyone who has either an occasional need for it, or more long term use. (Always read the label and do reserach on any alternative product before beginning use)
