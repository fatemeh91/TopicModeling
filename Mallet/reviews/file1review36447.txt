review/text: My father was diagnosed with macular degeneration and subsequently went blind. His physician, just prior to the diagnosis recommended that he take this medication at advise that I start it since I showed no signs of the illness. This medication is designed to stave off a possibility of macular degeneration. I would recommend it to anyone wishing not to go blind.
