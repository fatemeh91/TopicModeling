review/text: The Panasonic ER411NC Nose and Hair Groomer works just as advertised -- it painlessly clips annoying nose and ear hair. The trimmer is lightweight and very quiet.And, it bears repeating -- PAINLESS.The only reason this trimmer gets four stars instead of five: the first one that I bought was dead on arrival. Amazon painlessly and smoothly replaced it with a working model, but this has made me doubt its durability.But this trimmer works just as advertised at a very reasonable cost, so I whole-heartedly recommend it.
