review/text: This is more like a toy than a therapeutic massage device. It's advertised as two speeds, HA! The low speed was the only one you could feel at all. When I switched to high it just hummed. Six different heads do no good at all if the motor doesn't vibrate. It may be OK if you just want it for your face. But it absolutely will not relieve sore muscles or tired feet. Amazon says they will take it back, so you can always do that. But it would be better to not buy it in the first place. Save a trip to the Post Office. Look at some of the other massage units. One of them must be better than this. 'Nuff said.
