review/text: I have been using different types of trojan condoms for months, and was able to last 20 min plus in bed. Then a few weeks ago for some reason I started to climax alot sooner. I was only lasting for 3-5 min, which was pretty embarassing. I did some research and found that these condoms help prevent Premature ejaculation, which I guess I had developed a mild case of. I used this the first time and lasted 20+ min back to where I was before, and sometimes even longer. If your sick of ejaculating to early definitely try it, it works. In some of the reveiws people have said it stings when you put it on. It didn't for me, it just numbed it just enough to take the sensitivity away on the tip. Make sure you leave it on for 3-5 min. before intercourse so it has time to work. This has helped save my confidence and sex life!!!!
