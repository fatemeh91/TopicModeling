review/text: When this showed up at my house, none of the lights would go on - and I followed directions perfectly. Not sure if it was just my luck or a sign that the quality is poor, but keep it in mind! Sent it back and decided not to replace it. I have a feeling for the money I could get a rechargeable battery set of much higher quality (although the car charger is a plus)... Good luck!~
