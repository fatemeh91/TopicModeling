review/text: I am a lip balm addict, and I loved the cranberry/orange flavor of Kiss My Face Organic lip balm so much I decided to get six of the sliced peach without having tried it.This was a great purchase! I love the peach! I gave one to my boyfriend and he loves it, too. I'll probably have to give him another one soon. He always used to use Chapstick and now he keeps this in the car instead and actually uses it all the time. And...his lips are softer than ever. This really has the perfect consistency, creamy and not too greasy, pretty good staying power, and no tint so guys can feel comfortable using it, too. Plus it has a delicious, sweet peachy scent.I do recommend the cranberry/orange flavor as well if you haven't tried it.
