review/text: For us older adults, proteolytic enzyme therapy should be at the cornerstone of our health regimes. My husband and I have been happy with Zymitol and the good results we've seen in treating pain from degenerative disc disease, eliminating acid reflux, carpal tunnel and general pain management. My husband is currently on a 5-week course at twice the dosage to stop the proliferation of kidney stones and lower his PSA and has had no no ill effects. Its fibrinolytic enzyme (Serapeptase) dissolves scar tissue throughout the body which is a major cause of inflammation. I've compared prices and bioavailable ingredients of Zymitol to many other products and this seems to be the best formula for the price. We use much less NSAID anti-inflammatories now and have avoided surgeries to correct problems. If taken correctly, along with excercise and healthy diet it can work wonders. The biggest challenge for us is adhering to the timing - since all proteolytic enzymes have to be taken between meals to reap the most health benfits, it's easy to forget.
