review/text: it is a lot bigger than it seems. I was shocked when I opened the box, however I loved it. It is big but make sure that's what you're into before ordering this item. It is not too hard but it's not flimsy either. It's a great buy for the price and I do recommend this item to anyone who wants this sort of toy.
