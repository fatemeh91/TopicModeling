review/text: Epilators are not for everyone, they can get painful. thankfully I had an overall good experience with this one. At first it was able to get all the hair and leave my leg silky smooth, however, (3 months later) it still leaves little bumps on my legs. i'm not sure what i can do to make that go away, i've tried scrubbing myself down, and lotioning, didn't really seem to help.so now all it can do is to epilate the hair, but does not leave silky legs. kind of disappointing.
