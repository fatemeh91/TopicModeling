review/text: Started journey at 214lbs 22%bf. After first cycle of animal cuts I am 206lbs 14%bf. This was with being very careful in my diet. Limiting carbs to 50g a day maximum and keeping fats under 15g a day and total calorie intake would be about 1700. I spent hour on cardio 3 times a week burning 800 calories a shot (says my polar ft7 hrm which are very accurate). I also lifted weight 3 times a week. Idk how much I owe to animal cuts but I do think it helped in regulating my metabolism and appetit suppression. Only down flaw is it didn't increase energy levels at all. I was still very tired even after taking this. I know it increased my core body temperature though because I sweat alot during cardio. Real lot!
