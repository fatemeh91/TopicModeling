review/text: My husband was diagnosed with a varicocele that was blocking sperm production once we had already purchased this product. While waiting for it to arrive, we used zinc vitamins and folic acid vitamins (2 a day) as we had been told they could increase sperm count. We had been trying to get pregnant for over 11 months, and my husband had had two semen analyses that came back low (14million/mil), but with good morphology and motility. He took the vitamin for two weeks and three weeks later i found out I was pregnant! This was the only change he made in his diet, exercise etc. He still has a varicocele that needs repairing and he hasn't had a semen analysis since, so I can't tell whether this product had an effect or not, but 5 weeks after taking this product, I had a positive pregnancy test.
