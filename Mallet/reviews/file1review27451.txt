review/text: This is the second 5 lb tub of protein powder I have purchased from Optimum Nutrition. I also purchased the Natural Whey they offer. They both taste really good, but I would say that the Natural version tastes a bit better. The Natural also seems to dissolve more quickly in liquids, which results in fewer powder chunks if you are mixing with a shaker bottle. Both versions are absorbed quickly and cause me no digestive problems. I really like both, but if I buy another tub, it will be the Natural Whey.
