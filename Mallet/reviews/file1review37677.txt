review/text: This anti-perspirant/deodorant has a creamy application and did not leave a powdery residue on my shirts after use. It left no sticky feeling. The claims that you can even skip a day are a bit overwrought. While I didn't offend friends and family with an odor, I wouldn't go on a job interview without using it each day. While it works well, it's hard to distinguish this from other similar products.
