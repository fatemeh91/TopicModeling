review/text: Because a friend of mine had used this brand and as a result, lowered his blood pressure, I googled it and learned about Nattokinase and it's benefit on how it helps reduce HBP, without the side effects of regular medication. I search for the exact match my friend recommended and found it on Amazon. The cost on line was a lot less from what I got elsewhere. I have been using Nattokinase 100 mg three time a day for nearly a month now, and my blood pressure came down from 165/102 to 138/85. I'm nor quite there yet, and I'm still taking my daily prescription, but it's my hope that by using Nattokinase as an alternative natural "treatement" I will eventually be free of prescription drugs.
