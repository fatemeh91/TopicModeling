review/text: This was first a gift to me to use per doctors orders. It is a wonderful product and has lasted a year without any major problem. The only downside is the the rubber grippers may come off due to the screw loosening. However when this happened and I lost the rubber gripper, I called the manufacture and they, without hesitation mailed me a pair of rubber grippers without charging me...That is outstanding customer service. By the way, this tool is great for getting a ball that the dog rolls under furniture or for even throwing the ball in the yard...
