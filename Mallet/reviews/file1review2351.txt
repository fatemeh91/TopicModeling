review/text: I had severe dry eye and found this to be the best product to help restore my eyes to health. I did have to have punctal plugs inserted, but I feel that I would not have been able to go back to wearing contacts without these supplements. I tried other fish oil products, but they did not work nearly as well, leaving my eyes more irritable and itchy. Good for blepharitis as well!
