review/text: I received this chair in four days and I used standard ground shipping. Also, this chair is great for someone that works at an office all day, or has alot of tension in their back. Also, it is great on the legs as well! I would definitely recomend this chair if anyone is considering it! I am not sure if the woman with the first review just didn't pay or what happened with her shipment, but I just didn't want anyone else to be scared of not receiving their chair if they ordered it. I received it in 4 days.
