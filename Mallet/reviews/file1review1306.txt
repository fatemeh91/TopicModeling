review/text: I could have sworn I read someplace that these pills were easy to swallow, maybe that was for the 50mg because I just received the bottle yesterday and they are huge. Oh well it's too much of a hassle to return so I guess i'll pierce the pill to remove the liquid eventhough it probably defeats the purpose.
