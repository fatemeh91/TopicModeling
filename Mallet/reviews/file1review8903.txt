review/text: I thought about juicing. But, this is so much more convenient. It would be very hard and maybe even more expensive to juice so many fruits and veggies every day, along with adding probiotics. This powder covers it all. I take it on the road with me too. The taste is also fine mixed in a smoothie. I feel like I'm staying super healthy this way. I just bought the all greens version (dogs can't eat grapes, etc.) for my elderly dog. He is a cancer survivor and has weak kidneys. So, I think this will help him too. Now, I don't need to worry about making him fresh veggies every day either. He lapped it up, mixed in with his goats milk yogurt and dog food.
