review/text: It's advertised for older folks who can't reach far, but we found a different use. We have two young children who are forever dropping things in the car. Rather than stop, pull over, get out and give it back, we can hand it to them directly (not the driver of course). We saved valuable start and stop time on our eastern seaboard vacation - besides it's much safer than pulling onto the sholder of a major highway! It's not flimsy at all and it can pick up things as small as hair barretts or a piece of paper without trouble!
