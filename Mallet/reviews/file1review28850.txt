review/text: I chose this protein powder because I thought it was a healthy way to increase my protein intake and because of all the rave reviews it had. After I ordered it however I checked the ingredients and saw that it contained Acesulfame Potassium in it, which is an artificial sweetener that has been linked to stimulation of insulin production.It is my fault for not checking the ingredients picture provided but I now opt for the all natural optimum nutrition which they only have in the 5 pound case for some reason. If you're a health nut and artificial sweeteners bother you you should avoid this and go for the all natural version or some other brand.
