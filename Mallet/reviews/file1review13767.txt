review/text: I have finally found my Survival Knife. I have purchased several other "quality" knives whose features have in one way or another not been satisfactory. The Gerber is great. Size, weight, and construction are perfect for me. Excellent sheath design that allows for quick one-hand deployment.( doesn't have to be snapped in.) I like it enough that I have bought the black one and green one as well!
