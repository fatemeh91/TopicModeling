review/text: Plenty of room for large vitamins or the occasional cold pill when necessary, it works great for helping me remember my vitamins. I simply get the week ready and grab the proper day in the morning and go. The only negative thing I have to say is I wish there was a separate door for AM and PM so it was easier to dump your morning and evening meds out. Other than that, glad I bought it
