review/text: First of all the biggest strike against these is that they are constructed of polyester and despite the warning on the package that they should not be heated for longer than a minute or two the fabric will ultimately melt. The herbs and flax retain heat to the point of ultimately burning their way thru thru the cheap and highly flammable fabric.Mine developed a hole after one two minute heating.Had these been made of cotton or wool or a natural fiber this could be a decent product.
