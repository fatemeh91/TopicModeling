review/text: ...although I like the minty chocolaty flavor just fine. For me, it's about dosing myself with JUST a touch of caffeine when I need it on occasion. As in, ONE MINT. I don't care to drink sodas or coffee, and I don't need that much caffeine. I'd rather eat a mint and drink a glass of water.
