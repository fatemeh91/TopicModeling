review/text: I used this eye mask on a recent trip to France. First, I used it on the airplane. Then in various hotels. Sometimes the LED light on the TV was directly across from the bed, at other times the curtains were not sufficient to block all the light at dawn. It is sometimes hard for me to simply relax at the onset of sleep and I certainly wanted to be rested to maximize our time during the day! The mask was comfy and provided complete blackness which helped me relax. (I must say that I also used ear plugs.) My only possible negative comment was that this mask was a bit warm. If it had been summery weather (it wasn't) it would probably have felt too warm.
