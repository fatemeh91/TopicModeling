review/text: This comb is for any stylist who enjoys doing razor cuts. This is by far one of the most exciting tools to work with. I've been useing this style of comb for the last 20+ years and I've had unbeliveable response to the results achived. The flipping action really grabs the attention of people waiting. It's fast and easy to use and really cuts {no pun intended} down on time. What a fun way to add excitement to our industry. Thanks for providing a wonderful and useful tool to help stylist create fun and exciting styles. Lindy
