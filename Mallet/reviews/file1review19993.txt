review/text: CON: The folding causes a weird gap - where little fingers or toes can get caught. This is really scary for the baby & parent. The gap in the fold is also quite sharp feeling & I'm afraid you could get cut or possibly lose a finger if you were not paying attention.PRO: I bought this to save space. Which is great - because it folds up nicely & fits on a shelf.That said - I am very disappointed & will be purchasing something else. Don't waste your money if safety is a concern. The Con outweighs the Pro for me - and I will lose space, rather than a finger.
