review/text: My sister and I bought each other epils for Christmas. I have had it for three months, and I have used it three times. Here is the ugly, the bad, and the good:Ugly:*Like after waxing, there will be red little bumps on your legs for about 24 hours.Bad:*Epilating hurts, but I got used to it.*Epilating takes a fair amount of time. It takes me about 2 hours to do legs and bikini line. I usually shave during the week and use the epil for special occasions.Good:*The hair grows back very slowly. For my sister and I, it takes about two weeks to grow back. This really comes in handy when we are going on vacation. We epil a couple of days before vacation, and then we don't have to shave our legs the WHOLE VACATION!!!*The shaver head is very useful for other areas (let your imagination go :-)*Unlike waxing, there is no nasty wax everywhere*It's very sturdy. It seems like it will last for a long time.*It's very well designed. I give it five stars for ease of use.I gave it four stars instead of five because of two drawbacks, the pain and the time it takes. However, if you wax at home, this is a million times better!!
