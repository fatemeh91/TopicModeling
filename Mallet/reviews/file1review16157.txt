review/text: There is an appropriate number of toothbrushes for the price and they are effective. For this I give them 2 stars. Yet, the brush (bristles) are very small. The bristles don't hold up well, so you have to change the toothbrush more often then the 3 months, even when only brushing 3x/day. It is great that you have a pack of 6 because you will need to change them more often than other toothbrushes. The Indicator bristles are supposed to change to a lighter color when time to change, which is usually around 2 months with these toothbrushes. It's a good purchase if you want to have extra toothbrushes for visitors, but not for everyday use. Hope this review helps you.God bless!
