review/text: This product is great. Your milk supply will increase just like promissed in 1 - 4 days. The only down side is the taste. I recommend positioning the dropper way at the back of the throat so you don't taste it as much when you drop it in your mouth. After a little while, the taste doesn't bother you as much. It really works, so I truely recommend it.
