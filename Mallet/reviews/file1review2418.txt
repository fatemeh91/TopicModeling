review/text: It costs more but it's worth it. Ultra slippery but none of that nasty feeling "during" or "after". Areas its used on seem to be in better condition as well. For those that are curious, the taste is rather neutral too so you don't have to worry about being grossed out by getting it in your mouth. Get the big bottles, they're worth it. Have fun.
