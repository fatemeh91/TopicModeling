review/text: In the past, we have loved Metab Herbs (capsules). I never dreamed this would be in a form other than capsules. It is like eating grass! We haven't been able to come up with any way of taking it that doesn't cause nausea. I thought about sending back the second bottle which was unopened, but I thought we might figure out how to get it into our system. My suggestion would be that the company should never attempt to sell this in "grass" form. Guess we are wimps.......
