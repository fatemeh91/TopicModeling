review/text: I think the most important part of any cleansing regimen is the moisturizing. It dictates whether or not your skin will produce more sebum, which, in turn, dictates whether the oil produced will be enough to moisturize or clog your skin.This product, one of my many moisturizers, is very good to not leave your skin dry or clog it up. It is a very light moisturizer, easily absorbed into the skin. The pleasant orange scent is very refreshing as well.The only downsides to the product, in my opinion, are the lack of product and the high price. Don't let the decent size of the container fool you. It is a mere 1.7 ounces, which is enough for a few weeks if you are conservative about it. It retails for about 35 dollars, which is not cheap.Granted, it is a great product, but at that price range you can really get a wider variety of higher end products. Billy Jealousy, Anthony, Lucky Tiger, all of those are just a few other brands with great moisturizers for a much better price.Conclusion: If you have the money, you will love this product regularly. For the rest of us, it is worth trying at least once in your life. You could even ask for a sample from Nordstrom to see if you think you will like it.
