review/text: I've had this trimmer for like 2 years and I only used it because I was too cheap to buy a knew one, however since it stopped working completely, now I have to get a new one. It wouldn't stay charged that long for one.For two, it just cut horribly. I wouldn't suggest this product to anybody. Hope this helps.
