review/text: first also get a stand up handle dust pan . However this is great . I like it for my small home it is not very large , Perfect for a tight room and or small quick clean ups . They make a larger commercial one for around $60 you might want to consider . This is fine but buy a roll of black electricians tape and neatly go around all the joints in the put together handle . Can be purchased cheaper in store but I cant get around well , needed it and Amazon as always delivers . You can clean up a lot of little crumb , cerial , sugar , leaf , dirt , grass messes or spot clean without a fuss it goes under furniture and close to corners . I love it .Thanks .
