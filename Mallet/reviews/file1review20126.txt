review/text: I had started getting hot flashes so I ordered this product and Estrotone and within two weeks they disappeared completely. However, I thought the Estrotone was truly the product that did it so when my Dim-Plus bottle was empty I didn't replace it and within a few weeks I started getting signs that the hot flashes were coming back so I got more Dim-Plus and take it with the Estrotone and they have disappeared again. So I think it is a combination of the two that keep them away...and I will continue to take both.
