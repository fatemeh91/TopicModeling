review/text: This cane arrived quickly and was packaged carefully.The pros: comfortable, seemingly durable foam handle; it's easy to adjust for different heights; nice color and finish.The con (and it's a big one): it's slightly wobbly. If you place it flat on the ground and apply slight pressure to the handle, it wobbles as though one foot is slightly shorter than the other three. Upon closer examination, that was exactly the case! I went to a local drugstore to look at others. Maybe is was suppose to be that way, I thought. However, the quad canes I found at RiteAid were much more stable. Their legs were all of even length. I read a similar complaint about this a Duro-Med cane so I can't help but wonder if this company is trying to unload the canes that weren't manufactured properly.
