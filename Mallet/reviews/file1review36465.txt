review/text: I got my Adapt-a-lap about 10 days back. I love various uses I can put it to - reading books lying/sitting on bed, on floor, holding my laptop etc. Adapt-a-lap seems to be very handy and comfortable piece of equipment that doesnt strain your body posture and adds extra hours of comfort.I am an avid reader and now can enjoy longer periods of reading without hurting my neck and back. I have bought lap-boards, bed-reading tables, book-pillow, bed desk etc. (each about $20-$35) and they comforted me only so much. Adapt-a-lap is definately superior to those alternatives.Adapt-a-Lap is efficiently designed. Leg sticks to most of the surfaces, can be elongated and locked at desired length easily, comes with straps that can hold books etc and has an adjustable thread lock to set the board's angle to your choice. Its lightweight and can be carried anywhere without much hassle. One thing I did not like much was board material. It can certainly be improved to look more aesthetic. Other than that, Its a deft piece of fine engineering that can be put to multiple uses by many differnt kinds of users.Worth the cost and more!!
