review/text: This is the second tinnitus product I've tried hoping it might work. It's just another dissapointment and more money down the drain. What really makes you feel stupid is the warranty. Product takes 3 to 6 months to work but only has a 30 day warranty. Daaaaa Well someone is laughing all the way to the bank.
