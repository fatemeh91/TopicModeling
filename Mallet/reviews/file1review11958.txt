review/text: I LOVE these prenatals! Not only do they not upset my stomach, they actually seem to help settle things down, and promote regularity (which is hard to come by when 9 months pregnant!) Also, I ran out of them for over a week once, and when I started taking them again I really noticed a difference in my energy level, moods, and mental clarity. I definitely feel better when I take these. I tried a couple of other prenatals first, but these work the best and I only have to remember one pill per day. I'm going to keep taking these as my daily mutlivitamin long after baby comes.
