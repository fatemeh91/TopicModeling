review/text: I bought these for my 85 year old father. He wears hearing aids but still had to turn up the volume on the TV to uncomfortable levels for other people in the house. These headphones work very well for him. He said the reception is very clear and he can walk anywhere in the house and still receive the signal. This does bring up a problem, however. When he is using these in his bedroom I cannot use the on-demand feature on my cable box in the living room. I get an error message concerning a transmission problem. I can still receive all cable channels but I cannot order any pay-per-view movies. Other than this I feel they are a great product. The battery life has consistently been 6 hours even though the manufacturer claimed 4 hours.
