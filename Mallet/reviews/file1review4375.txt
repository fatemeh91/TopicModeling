review/text: I love the Fusion blades. I have the kind of facial hair where I have a five o'clock shadow an hour after shaving and these blades help me to get a very close cut. They work better for me than anything else I've tried. The only downside is that when dealing with four blades, when you cut yourself, you have four cuts. I slipped shaving near my mouth a few weeks back and had a really nasty cut for a week. That however is my only complaint. If you want a close shave with a nice blade, these are great.
