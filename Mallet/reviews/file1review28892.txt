review/text: Optimum Nutrition has great products in my opinion, not just taste but quality. Having had access to trainers from around the world, many different regimes ect this product is one of the best proteins I've used. Only a couple of things with this product for me are, if you mix it with water it seems pretty thin. Not saying that's bad, and it still has good taste with water. Just don't expect it to blunt hunger for any amount of time. If you're eating right, it won't matter anyway. Mixes well with creatine, cost is great comparably and I will buy it again. My opinion is that some of the other proteins add fillers, and say it has a lot of other ingredients to make it more appealing and ON doesn't do that. If you want straight up protein that taste great, low fat, low carbs, then you will be happy with this purchase. If you're chasing more of the all in one product, this isn't your bag then.
