review/text: Don't get me wrong - it's not a cure or a perfect product. But - for such little money, if you suffer from tendinitis, this support can't be beat. I found it from a fellow golfer who said it was the only one that helped her. It has to do with the unique element that sort of digs into the arm.The great thing about it is not bulky. I too can where it sleeping or awake... If you've tried everything else, give it a shot...And of course RICE : Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation
