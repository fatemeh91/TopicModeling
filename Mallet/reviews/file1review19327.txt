review/text: This mattress cover is everything you read about. It has a great pillow top, which is so much better than crude plastic to protect your mattress and toddler. I was really worried that if it was comfy and a pillow top, then would it really work? Yet, I didn't want a piece of plastic up against my child either. It is very high quality..just love it. Unforutnately, I don't have any reports on the functionality of it, as my child has not had an accident yet. However, I believe by seeing it up close, it will do the job just fine! It is the best of both worlds...nice and soft AND has protection against accidents. I am very pleased with this buy..and I looked around for a while. Highly recommend!!!
