review/text: This new Xenadrine is supreme! It is excellent when it comes to giving you energy all day. Using EFX, I have lost 120 pounds in almost under a year and I am going to continue losing with NRG-8.The only bad thing about this is the taste of the pills. I think it's sorta funny how I hate the taste, but I think it works so great, I deal with it. It's just the coating on the pills.They are shaped like hexagons (which is really interesting) but honestly, anyone who is interested in feeling great ALL DAY should try this!
