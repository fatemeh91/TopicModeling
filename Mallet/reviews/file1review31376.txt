review/text: After spinal surgery I started wearing sturdy shoes. Since I have wide toes and a narrow arch and heel, I thought these gel mats might help with heel comfort. However, after just a few minutes one of the heel mats slid sideways and was very uncomfortable. This "one-size-fits-all" did not fit in my shoes.
