review/text: The stiff bristles on this OXO grout brush tackle even the toughest soap scum and mildew stains on grout with ease - even older white grout comes out looking nice! The soft handle makes the chore of cleaning a bit less stressful on your hands, and the length is just perfect for the task of grout cleaning. I find that spraying some shower cleaner, letting it soak for a few minutes, then tackling it with this grout brush makes my showers/tubs come out looking like new again. The bristles on this brush have held up the test of time, and have yet to show signs of wear from multiple use.I wouldn't go back to any other type of brush again!
