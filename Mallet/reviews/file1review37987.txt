review/text: This is a fabulous product, as I can speak from experience. It is very user-friendly. It works. CPR is only PART of what saves a heart attack victim....one of the main reasons for calling 911 is so there can be follow-through with defibrillation, if necessary. The machine lets you know if the patient needs defibrillated. If a heart attack victim does need defibrillated, CPR is not enough. Without defibrillation, the patient will remain dead. This product saves any wait time for the ambulance, saving precious minutes, and lives! As for those others that commented about not being able to use it on themselves...........educate yourselves....take a basic CPR class before you judge.......You should never be able to defibrillate yourself, because those that DO need it are unconscious. Even people who take care of themselves by living a healthy lifestyle, can still have heart attacks.......the first guru of running died of one. It would be nice if the product could be cheaper, so that all households could afford the device. I have noticed, however, that no matter how poor some people are, they still can afford to have big TVs and computers. This product could save the life of someone you care about, even though you cannot use it on yourself!
