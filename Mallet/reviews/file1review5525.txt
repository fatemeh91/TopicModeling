review/text: The Package: Came in a bubblewrapped envelope with the actual package inside. The stick package itself is about the height of a toothpick, 1.5" wide, about a inch deep, clear plastic with a label on it, (as shown by the picture) nothing too special. The sticks are somewhat packed in there tight, so getting the first few out is a little bothersome, but hardly an issue.The Product: To be entirely too specific, they're toothpick shaped, with one end being flat with an ever so small crevice carved into the same end (for aesthetics i suppose?). Now, the taste isn't really sweet, at all. However, it gives off a very strong cinnamon taste, which is actually quite refreshing. It yields some heat a first, something akin to weak Tabasco type heat. You get used to this pretty quick.Overall: Really does freshen breath, wont knock out that liver and onions though. Good alternative to gum, especially if you have braces, retainer, etc. If some spice deters you, i wouldn't recommend them, even though it's not bad at all. Otherwise, buy them. Good taste, good habit, great product.
