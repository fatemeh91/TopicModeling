review/text: I wore some shoes that had been comfortable for a year, but I guess more poor feet are changing. They couldn't cope with the stress of standing in those shoes for hours. A slight bunion got much worse after that day so I bought this splint to fix it.It did help. Wore it overnight and my foot was realigned in the morning. I hate having foot troubles but until I can afford better care, splints and other OTC remedies help. I write these reviews because I know how frustrating it is to try to solve foot problems. Even many podiatrists don't have adequate treatments.
