review/text: I LOVE this BP cuff. it goes super quick for my patients, and it gets the same exact readings as my arm cuff at home! the only catch is you have to be perfectly still as it is reading, or it gets wacky--sorta inconvenient for my patients with the shakes, but nothing is perfect. I love how it has memory, so i can compare my readings over a period of time, or take a couple readings before writing them down, which is nice when your busy. Overall, i love this cuff! im buying another one soon for a friend!!!
