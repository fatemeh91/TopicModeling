review/text: I bought a pack of 60 about two years ago and have three cards left. They have an expiry date of 08/2013. They were fine for the first 18 months but now 25% of them are no good. Last week I took one aid to the audiologist as it wasn't working properly -- and I had just put a new battery in it. He tested the battery and said it was dead. He advised there are four factories world-wide that make zinc-air batteries -- some are good, some are not-so-good quality. The audiologist kindly gave me his battery tester gratis and recommended in future buying brand-name batteries from a place with high turnover. Another customer at the counter overhearing the conversation said avoid pharmacies. He'd had dud brand-name batteries from the pharmacy -- they don't sell enough to turn them over. The audiology practice sells only Rayovac batteries; I bought a pack and left.Since then I have had to replace a couple more batteries. Two of the Icelltech batteries lasted a few minutes -- the tester showed them to be dead. Looks like I'm going to have to bin the last couple of cards of batteries.Summary -- these batteries are best avoided. It will cost extra to buy quality batteries but if you don't have to discard 25% of them out of the pack you're better off.5 Feb 2012 - Update. Just threw out the last two cards - every one a dud.
