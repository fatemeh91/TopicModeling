review/text: It gives me a small amount of indigestion but the directions say take it 30min before eating, so you can't really eat food with it. This is also a different formula from the one I got a few years ago (after the whole ephedra fiasco when ephedra was removed from it) and not quite as effective for me. Others may have different results. It did give me more energy and actually more focus as well, so not all was bad about it.
