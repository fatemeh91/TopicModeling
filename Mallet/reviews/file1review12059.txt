review/text: These are easy on my stomach, that's what I was looking for when it came to a prenatal vitamin. However, this does have 100% Vit E, too much Vit E in early pregnancy can result in cardio problems in the fetus. So, I'd check the Vit E intake.That being said, it has a really good mix including Inositol.A big con is that these pills are huge. I can take pills, but these taste very medicinal and are rather large, probably about 50% larger than an AA capsule.I think I'd likely take these vitamins even post-pregnancy because it gives me a good feeling, it doesn't upset my stomach or make me feel dizzy. Additionally, it seems to give a nice energy boost for about 4-6 hours after taking it. And reasonably priced!
