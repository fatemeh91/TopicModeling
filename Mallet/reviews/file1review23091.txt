review/text: I bought mine from Ace about 2 months ago and LOVE it. I have 2 dogs and a cat, so I was vacuuming the living room and kitchen every day to do hair control. I now use this every other day. It picks up the hair very well, as well as kitty litter that gets kicked out of the pan. Some of the hair does get caught on the brushes, but that happens with my vacuum as well. I spilled some bread crumbs in the kitchen the other day and headed for the vacuum. Then, I decided to try this. It worked like a charm and was much easier. I've tried a couple of other models/brands of this type of sweeper in years past, but they didn't work well. This particular model works like a charm. It doesn't sub for a vacuum, but I didn't expect it to. It does what I wanted it to do and does it very well.
