review/text: These handles are very well-designed. The ribbed plastic provides a secure grip. The suction cups are very secure, with one exception for me. I ordered two handles, and one end on one of them comes loose from the wall approximately every three days. It is essential to prep. the walls as instructed, cleaning them with alcohol to ensure proper adhesion (suction). Still, I have the problem with one of them. Once I lift the lever on that end, and re-position the suction and close the lever, I'm good to go for another three days. This requires a bit of diligence in checking. Perhaps it is defective (?), but I didn't want to hassle returning it. This was the difference for me in rating it 4 stars, rather than 5. Still an excellent product which is not only functional but is also aesthetically pleasing.
