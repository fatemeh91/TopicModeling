review/text: I've used Wahl for years but at Christmas I was gifted a Remington MS280 Titanium. Almost six months later I'm back to Wahl. Sure it's noisy but it gives a great shave and isn't that what we are looking for? No bells, whistles, or flat screens to watch the news while you are shaving. Just a good shave (and made in America!). Please keep making them Wahl and keep selling them Amazon. A great product.
