review/text: My top choice brand for supplements is Solgar. I had to send this particular formula back because it was a bit too strong for my system. All the other formulas are from Solgar and I can handle the dose. This formula would be OK for someone with regular digestive tracts but I only have half of colon which makes me extra sensitive to strong doses of anything. I normally buy tablets so I can break them in half and I did just that but this formula was still strong for my stomach so I returned it. I am not giving it the lowest star rating due to my colon issues because for other regular population, this formula maybe perfect.
