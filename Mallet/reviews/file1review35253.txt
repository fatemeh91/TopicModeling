review/text: My first item of contention was the long time it took for delivery of package. Ordered online 08-02-2010, Did not receive package until 08-10-2010 via FedX ground shipping. To add insult to injury Amazon has a third party vendor that does not provide package tracking...You would think that would be a top priority for ALL items shipped that Amazon represents.After wearing socks for only two days the threads are starting to unravel. I am not a happy camper. Too frustrated to send back! Who knows how long this will take to be corrected.
