review/text: 2 of my 4 kiddos are lactose intolerant, and these pills have been the best thing for them! I love the convenience of a once a day pill, w/ the other pills on the market they have to take one (or sometimes two) every time they eat dairy - but once a day dosing is so much easier for our busy family. I also love that these pills protect against hidden dairy also, since nearly every boxed prodcut we seem to buy has some type of milk in it (like casein or whey). My boys used to have issues w/ bloating, cramping, and loose bowels anytime they had any dairy, but since taking the Digestive Advantage, they never have those issues anymore. The fact that the pills taste great is also a big plus for us! We've bought other medications in the past that tasted horrid, so they wouldn't take them - which didn't help them of course, and just wasted our money. But again, that's not the case with these.These pills work great, taste great, and are a great price - not much else to say!
