review/text: This product tastes great and works wonderfully! I had started working out again after a long long hiatus :) I started with a hot yoga class going everyday for 30 days and the whole month long my muscles were very sore. Every time I sat down for over 20 minutes my muscles would stiffen and I hobbled around like an old lady until my muscles loosened up again. I then heard that I maybe needed more protein in my diet. I looked around for a protein powder that would work for me. I am not a body builder and have no desire to be one. I just want to get in shape. Well, I take 1 scoop of this stuff in almond milk right after my work out and my muscle soreness is greatly reduced! I was amazed that it made such a difference.
