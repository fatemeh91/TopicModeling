review/text: I've got a problem. I just don't like flossing. For years, my dentist has been warning me that I need to floss more, and it just doesn't happen. I try. I really do, but it is just so difficult to make a proper habit of it.With the Oral-B Humming bird, and specifically with it's "pick" attachment, I actually find myself flossing regularly, and the dentist has noticed as well!I can just keep it on the side-table next to the couch, and as I am either reading or watching TV it is very easy to uncap it and floss my teeth and give my gums a workout.For me, the picks seem to last quite a while. I just switched in a new pick, having used the first pick for over a year.I've noticed that the Oral-B website no longer seems to list this product (but search engines can still find the page inside the site), so I'm a little concerned that perhaps it is no longer being made, so I've picked up a few extras, as well as a bunch of picks so it should last me for a while.
