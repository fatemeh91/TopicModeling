review/text: I currently use products like NAIR to remove facial hair on my upper lip and side-burn areas. I think that it's effective, but I'm in those teenage years where if I put oil on my face I break out! I was wondering if this product would be better being that it doesn't include putting oil on your face or will it give you bad in-grown hairs? Also I was a little confused- It's not like shaving right? More like plucking? I would really appreciate a response, Thanks!
