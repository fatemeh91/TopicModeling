review/text: I did a comparison with products. I bought Hoover cleaner because thats all Amazon had at that time. My son cleaned the carpeting with a vengence...he took alot of time. When it dried it looked terrable..almost like it was never done. Than I bought the Bissell 715A fiber cleansing Formula & mixed it with the Bissell Pet formula because of bad pet stains from my sons dog. My son cleaned the light Tourquoise carpeting 3X & one water rinse. It is beautiful!! I love it now.I will stick with Bissell products from now on.
