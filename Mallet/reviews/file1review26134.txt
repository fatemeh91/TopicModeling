review/text: I think this balm is a little misunderstood. Sounds a bit ridiculous maybe, but it's not meant to be a daily balm you wear about. I use it as a night 'treatment' while I'm asleep and obviously don't care about what it feels like because admittedly it's a bit bizarre of a texture. It's slightly gritty and thick (some say waxy) but you need the slightest amount and the key is warming it up. Therefore rub it on your lips a bit and add more if needed; personally I slather it on at night and wake up with the newest lips i'll ever get. My lips are easily chapped and dry and I'm a lip biter so this does a great job for me. Regarding the price; blame it on the importing. Because in France it's only $10 (7,50eu). It is a staple for many who frequently change their makeup (models, etc.), definitely worth trying.
