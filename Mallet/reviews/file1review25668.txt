review/text: I purchased this trimmer after owning a Wahl trimmer for 4 years, and what a mistake that was. I only used it three times and it broke after four months. It was also uncomfortable to use because it really pulled at the hairs. Do yourself a favor and look at other brands. I just ordered the following: WAHL Wet/Dry Trimmer for Nose, Ears & Eyebrows (Model:5560-700).
