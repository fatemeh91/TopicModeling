review/text: We have been using the same lubricant for years, but were given a sample of K-Y Intrigue and thought we would try it. I work at San Diego Sexual Medicine so we see patients all the time with problems lubricating, as well as other problems, and are always asked about lubricants. So we thought we would try this to rule it out as a good option. Were we surprised! This stuff is great. The silicone makes it really slippery but there is no greasy feel because it's not petroleum based. Intrigue has a sensual feel and can be used as a massage oil or simply a personal lubricant. It's pricey but well worth it!
