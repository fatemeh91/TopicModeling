review/text: Oxy-powder is different from all other cleanse products out there. This does not have bulky fiber or herbs. It's just a few simple ingredients, and it works sometimes in a hour, and without a mess. Very smooth. If you take too much then your bowels will liquefy, so take a capsule or two to test for your needs. And also Amazon has the best price if you comparison shop.
