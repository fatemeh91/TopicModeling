review/text: These are very sturdy plates and look nice carrying them around over the typical colored plastic or paper plates. We used them for a catered birthday party along with the 7" version and they were a nice improvement over the typical disposable plate. They were our dinner plates and were perfectly sized for that. Would certainly recommend to others.
