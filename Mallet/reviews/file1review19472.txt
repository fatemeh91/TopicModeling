review/text: A perfect fit ... we have elongated toilets, and this seat worked well. The splash guard was the only one that actually worked. Super easy to clean, thanks to its ingenious design.The "character" potty seats were tempting, so we used a neighbor's.... my son was encouraged by the design, but they weren't sturdy, impossible to clean (disgusting dried pee collected in between the foam and the plastic rim), and when he got pinched by the splash guard, I had had enough.Bought this. Then bought another. Worth the money.
