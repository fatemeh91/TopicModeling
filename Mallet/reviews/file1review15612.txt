review/text: I was really hoping this would work, but it didn't. I went the 48 hours without applying other deoderant(like the directions said) before I tried Lavilin. I then applied it at night and showered in the morning. However I was still sweating and it did not prevent the perspiration odor from occuring later that day. I gave it one more try by using it after I showered but that didn't work either.
