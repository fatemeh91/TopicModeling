review/text: I am on my feet all day so I have to wear Danskos or Sanita Clogs for comfort. Untill I discovered these wonderful orthotic insoles. Now I can wear sneakers as well. I wear them all day and I use the low arch support which is very comfortable. My only issues is I will have to start buying shoes a 1/2 size bigger so they can fit. Love them and I would recommend them to anyone who stands all day.
