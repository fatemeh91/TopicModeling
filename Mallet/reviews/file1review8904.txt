review/text: I wanted to update my review. I could not stop taking the product because it cost too much money. After a month of taking it I got used to the taste. Now it does not bother me and I feel better since taking it. The joke around the office is we call it Soylent Green.Old Review:I am not a wimp. I have been drinking unsweetened/unflavored protein powder for years. This stuff makes me gag though. It tastes like cucumber juice. Very gritty. I do feel more energetic when I drink it however.
