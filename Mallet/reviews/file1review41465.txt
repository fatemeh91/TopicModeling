review/text: These things work and wear well. My one complaint is the &#34;stickiness&#34; of the arch support insert. Can't it be made of a material that is smoother, more like the rest of the orthodic? When wearing these in shoes with socks (the major mode of use for me), my sock catches on the arch support. ThIs causes my sock to be pulled so tightly againt my toes that it hurts until the sock stretches. They offer a smoothe insole to be placed over the orthodic and I've tried it. While it does make it easier to get my socked foot into the shoe, it creates additional problems. One, it makes the shoe fit even tighter. Two, it squeaks when you walk.
