review/text: The mineral magnesium is largely overlooked as a nutrient which is essential for good health. Most doctors and laboratories don't even include magnesium status in routine blood tests. Thus, most doctors don't know when their patients are deficient in magnesium, even though the majority of Americans are deficient in magnesium. And magnesium deficiency is very important. In fact, magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the major factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, diabetes, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems. Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked, millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs (which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects) when many could be cured with magnesium supplements such as this.Anyone interested in learning more about the importance of magnesium and magnesium supplements for good health should acquire and read the excellent and very readable book The Miracle of Magnesium by Dr. Caroyn Dean which is available from Amazon at a very reasonable price. So should their doctors.
