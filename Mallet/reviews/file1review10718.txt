review/text: Sometimes - and I know how lazy this sounds - I just don't feel like having to open 5 different bottles for vitamins every night. I looked everywhere for a pillbox that would work, but the only ones that were large enough to hold them all were huge, and it looked as if I was carting around a medicine cabinet. I probably bought three different ones and discarded them all because they just weren't quite right. These fit even fish oil capsules and calcium chews. I fill them up on Sunday night, then just toss one in my purse every day. Somehow this small thing has simplified my day.
