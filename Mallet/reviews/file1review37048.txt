review/text: The first thing I noticed with the product, which was a plus, was that it was clear. No white residue to mess with!! The scent was regular scent, which was okay, although I would've rather had a scented one. But it had no bad odor, so it made no difference. The deodorant dried quickly (since it's in liquid roll-on form), and didn't irritate my skin. I noticed that I stayed dry and comfortable all day, and that I smelled fresh all day...always a plus! I'd recommend this product to anyone, and would use it again.
