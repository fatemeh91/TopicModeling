review/text: Had a sock aid cloth covered which is great for hose but socks tended to get hung. The sock aid without covering lets go of socks and they pull right on your feet. This had been a great help since back surgery. Easy to use for anybody who has trouble bending over to put on socks. Would recommend to friends.
