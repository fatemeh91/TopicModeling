review/text: These bars are amazing. They are filling and taste great. Most are around 190 calories and are filled with nutrients. While they are not a Snickers by any means, they will satisfy any sweet tooth! A wonderful snack, taste and calorie count. I would describe them as a rich rice crispy bar topped with nuts or chips, depending on the bar, and a bottom half dipped in chocolate or yogurt type coating. Definitely recommended!
