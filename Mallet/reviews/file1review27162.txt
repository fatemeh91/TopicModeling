review/text: I had been interested in trying a whey protein to help my workouts for a couple of years, but was hesitant to start using it because I didn't know the effects or whether or not it would actually be helpful.After a little bit of research, and reading the reviews on Amazon, I bought a 2.5 lb. tub of ON 100% Whey (Double Rich Choc.) and am really happy with the results. The biggest benefit I have realized from drinking a whey protein shake after my workouts is that recovery time is vastly reduced. I rarely get sore the day after workouts now. Combine that with the great taste and easy mixability of ON 100% Whey, it was an easy decision to buy a 5 lb. tub once I finished my 2.5 lb. tub.I actually look forward to drinking this stuff after my workout is over. It's a motivating factor in my workouts. I don't allow myself to have a shake if I don't have a satisfactory workout.
