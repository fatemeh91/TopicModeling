review/text: I ordered this razor because of all the positive reviews, got it a while back and I love using it, But after I placed my order Amazon suggested to me the "Murker 180 long handle" which doesn't seem to be that much different but $10 less. All of the pictures of the long handle seem about right as far as height but I really can't tell. The classic I ordered isn't too short. I wish someone would have posted pictures of the two side by side and give a reason as to why one is better then the other or If it even matters. Could have saved me some time and money. Also it seems like the "Long Handle" would cost more then the "Classic" because more material is used and its more of a specialty item but that is not the case, makes you wonder if the $40 price is inflated some.This is the one I orderedMerkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor, StraightThis is the "Murker 180 Long Handle"Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor
