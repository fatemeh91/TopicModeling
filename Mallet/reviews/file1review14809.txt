review/text: I am a psychotherapist who found the EmWave while looking for a biofeedback product that would help my clients self regulate their moods. I can tell you that it is the real deal--it works just the way it says it will. Of course, like most things, it will only work for you if you follow the directions for use. The purpose of the EmWave is to bring your heart, brain and autonomic system into coherence, which then creates a feeling of well being. I have used it myself, as have my clients, and when used as directed it does work beautifully. You will also be interested to know that the research behind the creation of the EmWave is evidence based and sound.
