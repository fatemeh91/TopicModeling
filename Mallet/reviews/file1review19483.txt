review/text: We have been using this seat for about 1 year now and have bought multiples for convenience and for our vacation home. This potty seat sits firmly on a variety of toilets seats keeping our son from wobbling around or falling when he tries to get off the potty. It has no sharp edges or places for his hands or fingers to get stuck. The center front is molded to have a cup like piece that helps greatly to keep him from peeing all over (since he must pee sitting down until he is tall enough to stand) I do wipe the from cup part down after he uses it but I found any mess to be minimal and definitely easy compared to cleaning out a floor sitting potty seat. We had one of those but retired it because it was so awful to clean!
