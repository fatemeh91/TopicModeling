review/text: Safeguard is my "go to" herbal remedy for when I start to feel under the weather - be it sore throat, runny nose, or that sneaky little feeling I'm coming down with 'something'. It works every single time and I always try to keep it in stock at home. It works fast and I swear by it. Seriously, I recommend it to everyone I know!
