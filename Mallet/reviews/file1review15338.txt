review/text: The high alcohol content in mouthwash made me stop using it altogether. The pain during and after I felt in my cheeks and tongue just wasn't worth it. I suffer from sensitive teeth, as well as geographic tongue Geographic Tongue (Russian Edition)and took a chance and tried Firefly MouthSwoosh because I liked the facts about it. It is sugar-free, it is alcohol-free, it has fluoride to aid in preventing cavities (which is the products only active ingredient), and has a pleasant bubble gum taste. Another nice thing it offers is a built-in 30 second timer on the top of the lid. Just press it down and pretty lights flash inside the cap for 30 seconds. When it's done flashing, you're done swooshing. Pretty cool, and yes it's made for kids, but this adult can highly recommend it because it gives me no pain during or after use.
