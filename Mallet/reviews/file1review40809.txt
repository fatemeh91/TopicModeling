review/text: This product is the GREATEST THING EVER! I just bought this for a trip in like 3 weeks, but after trying it, i think i am going to be using it a lot more. I would choose this razor over any other including my old venus divine. The divine is old news now. You don't even feel like you are shaving! It feels like you are running a bar of soap over your skin! Totally comfortable!I got tired of using soap and shave gel after a while. This way, i don't waste any time putting any type of lather on! It's super quick! Before, I had to have a mirror in the shower so i could see where i had put lather on to shave my underarms. But now, it doesn't matter because there is no lather to take off! AND NO NICKS AT ALL! Which is a miracle since I am only 13.Some showers don't have a ledge or dry area to put your leg while shaving so that it won't get wet when you have all of the lather on. Well, the intuition solves this problem. Since its okay to get wet, you don't have to worry about stepping out of the shower! Bottom line girls, this razor is the best out there. Even though it may be expensive, its well worth it.
