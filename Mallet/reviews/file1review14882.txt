review/text: my expectation for taste on these type of products is pretty low. the taste is fine and it makes one big shake with just water that holds you for a while (i am female dieting). but the aftertaste is pretty bad - and tough to get rid of!! brushing your teeth is the best bet. but for the calories 240 to protien 40 g - i like it! it made my stomache pretty unhappy the first week, but i got used to it. i cut out all unecessary snacking, drinking & sweets m thru f, and am eating a whole lot less and I lost 3 lbs in two weeks. sticking with it for sure. yeah, and lifting much harder at the gym.
