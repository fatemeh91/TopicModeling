review/text: Used in the hospital after my wife delivered our first child, these Witch Hazel pads were a big relief to my wife to help reduce the swelling in the area where they had to stitch her back up. AmeriMed Direct shipped it and I received the shipment within 2 days of placing the order. I'm happy with the product, the speed of delivery and the packaging.
