review/text: I tried these not because of any problems controlling myself, but more to just try them for the heck of it. Something different. And yes, the Benzociane certainly does numb you which makes it both good and bad. On the good side it does make you go longer so if that's a problem, then this is a worthwhile thing to try.On the other side the benzociane dulls even further the pleasure which is already dulled by wearing the condom in the first place. I guess the best way I can describe it is if your tool had fallen asleep. Kind of the numbing, tingling feeling you get when your foot falls asleep. Very different. I certainly cannot say I had any problem with them breaking. I agree with the first review in that they seem even thicker than average condoms.It's not an item that I would probably use again unless I had some trouble but it does do the job that it promises to do.
