review/text: I can't live without these little pill organizers! They are the perfect size for sticking in your pocket for the day. I am 65 and take about 19 pills a day and these containers help me remember to take them. I had to buy four sets so that I could prepare my whole month's supply of medications. I will say that I don't use the little trays they come in--waste of plastic, but some people would. I just throw mine in a plastic zipper bag which fits in my drawer. One for filled containers and one for the empties.
