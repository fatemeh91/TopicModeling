review/text: this has the smallest seat cut out ever! if you are a male its impossible to sit down and go number 1 you will end up going on the floor. its nice and sturdy and came already assembled and you can adjust the legs to fit over your toilet but like i said it only works for women or going number 2. i like that it came pre assembled but we end up not using it because my dad couldnt use it.
