review/text: I went off birth control in January to try and get pregnant but my periods were all over the place. They were anywhere from 24 to 32 days long. Within days of taking the pills in July my cycles became regular. I now ovulate on day 14 every month. I'm not pregnant yet but I feel confident that I will be soon.
