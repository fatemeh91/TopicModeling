review/text: Got this to replace a short broom which my boyfriend complained about because he's tall. At first when I opened the (huge!) box it came in and took it out, the broom looked like it had been used; however, upon further inspection, it looks like that because of the feathered ends. My only complaint is that when we first used it, it was difficult to get the dirt and grim out of the bristles into the dust pan; it required lots of extra shaking.
