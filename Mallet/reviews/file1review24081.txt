review/text: I moved from Seattle to the greater LA area for school and realized water is harder in So. CA. So when I wash my once-white chef jackets with food stains (i.e. red sauces, chocolate, etc.) with this water softener, it comes out clean, bright, and white. I could tell the difference from washing with and without it so I never wash my chef jackets (and my other whites) without it.
