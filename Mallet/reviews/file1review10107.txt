review/text: I just finished this 14-day cleanse and I was surprised with how gentle it was. I barely noticed that I was on it. (I had seen gross photos on-line and stories of other cleanse results). I eat very healthy (lots of fruit, veggies, rice and beans), but eat ice cream and meat a few times per week. I wasn't constipated beforehand, I just wanted to cleanse my body. What I got was an increase in number of bowel movements, that appeared to be cleaning stuff out of my system. I also liked that this cleanse included other organs as well as the intenstines. I found it to be very reasonably priced and I will probably do this again several times per year. My only disappointment was the large size of the nighttime tablet - I had to cut them in two to swallow them.
