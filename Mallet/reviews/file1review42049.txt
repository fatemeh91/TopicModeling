review/text: I don't feel I have had it long enough to use it enough to see, or experience, the full effects of using it. That is why I have given it four stars. I have added it to the home made surface cleaner I make and it smells great and seems to be doing the job.I have not used it beyond our house to know what it is like spraying it on shopping carts, etc.
