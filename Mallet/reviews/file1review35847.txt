review/text: I have a slightly wider than average foot for a woman, and that affected my ability to wear this splint. Although the splint is nicely padded and has nice straps to hold a foot securely, it doesn't leave enough space at the ball of the foot. I traded in plantar fascitis for pain at the ball of the foot. After several nights of waking up with what might be called bunion pain (but I don't have bunions), I gave up on this splint.
