review/text: Pros:* My kid seems to like it (or at least not mind it. I put 2.5 mL in his bottle every day and he sucks it right down.* Great concentration of DHA & EPA - that 2.5 mL is all he needs for a day's worth of DHA.* Seems to keep well (keep it in the fridge after opening).* Same thing as their baby DHA (except for the strawberry flavoring), but much cheaper per ounce.Cons:* Pretty strong fishy smell (although this is to be expected - it's cod liver oil), slightly masked by a sort of artificial strawberry smell. This is unpleasant to me, but like I said my kid seems to like it.* Causes my little guy to burp afterwards, and his burps smell like the cod liver oil. It doesn't seem to bother him at all (he actually giggles), but it smells kind of gross.* Difficult to pour & measure without additional tools. The baby DHA had a dropper, which was nice. This just has a lid, and pouring from the bottle is difficult. I recommend getting one of those rubber stoppers that have a hole in the top for a medicine syringe and replacing the lid with that. (Like this one -Ezy Dose Oral Syringes with Dosage Korcs - 1 Tsp).
