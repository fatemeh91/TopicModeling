review/text: Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss.
