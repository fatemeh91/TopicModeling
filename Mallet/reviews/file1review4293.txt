review/text: Do we really have a choice anymore? These blades are the only ones I'll ever buy. And when they come out with a version with 10 blades on it, I'll buy that too. These work so well. When they're new - it's like you're not shaving at all - it's so smooth. As they age, you definitely feel it. I can get 2-3 weeks with one blade - not bad.
