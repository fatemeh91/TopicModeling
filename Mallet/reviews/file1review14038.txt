review/text: This really is about the most benign anal toy imaginable. Standing about 5 inches high in total (4-1/2" insertable), the tip is no bigger than your pinky, and the largest bulb is maybe the size of a thumb. For someone who is terrified about putting anything "up there," this is the device to choose.Tantus has built a fine reputation with its high-quality silicone-based products, and this one is no exception. Silicone is very pliable and resilient, much different from the comparatively rigid molded plastic of days past. Indeed, it may take a little practice to aim this little guy properly so it will go in and not just bend around. Once started, however, it is extremely comfortable and non-threatening. As with any such toy, lubrication is essential. Cleaning of silicone toys is easy and effective.Note that this really is not a true "plug" in the traditional sense. It will not stay in place on its own, even when fully inserted, because there is not enough difference between the diameter of the largest bulb and the diameter of the shaft closest to the base. It continually wants to slide back out. It can be used as a way to relax and loosen things up for something more substantial, but it requires continual attention of some kind, either holding it in place or moving it in and out for stimulation.In sum, for anyone who is dying to try this kind of thing but is petrified by the idea of anal penetration, this is the product to choose. Chances are that you will want to graduate to something more substantial before too long (such as, perhaps, theTantus Ripple Large Anal Plug, Midnight Purple), but this is a good start that will boost your confidence to continue. Combine that with the fact that Amazon charges significantly less for this than most other sellers, and even offers free shipping if you meet the dollar threshold, and you have no good excuse not to give it a try.
