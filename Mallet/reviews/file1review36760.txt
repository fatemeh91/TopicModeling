review/text: I am not new to creatine usage. I've used Jack 3d for almost a year now for atleaste 5 times a week. Never had any side effects and always feel very energetic when it starts kicking in. On top of that, they have a taste that everyone can handle.However, I cannot say the same for this Universal product. The taste is just awful, it taste just like the powders in pills.. VERY bitter. Also, I've tried 3,2, and 1 scoops, I felt no energy and it leaves me nauseated. I had a very hard time working out with it because me really makes me to NOT want to workout at all.Its just a bad product. Sure you get more for your money, but whats the point when this product doesn't even work and sets you back? Very disappointed.
