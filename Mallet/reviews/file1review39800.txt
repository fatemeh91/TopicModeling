review/text: This "Comfort Plus" version does as good a cleaning job as the older version of the Glide Floss. However, the old Glide Floss has very sharp edges, which cuts into the gum and the ends of the mouth at times, causing some hygenie problems. But since I switched to Comfort Plus, I need not to worry about bleeding lips or gums anymore.
