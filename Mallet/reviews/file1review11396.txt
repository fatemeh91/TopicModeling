review/text: Simple design which is very effective. Have always grind/clenched my teeth during sleep, but only recently was it causing me discomfort during the day, even though dentist saw signs long ago. Love that this is no-boil and has a very light footprint. Stayed in the first night and has for most of the time I've had the product. Your teeth will feel weird for a while after you start using this product but if you once wore a retainer at night this should feel no different; your mouth will adjust in time and you will be fine. While I am not sure if this can truly replace a doctor-prescribed bite guard, this is an effective low-cost start and/or alternative.
