review/text: This was one of the most wonderful orthotics ever made. Too bad the item shown and described on this and every retail website is NOT the item this company will ship to you.The company has discontinued this insole, and now substitutes a stiffer, cheaper item, with only PARTIAL gel plugs on the heel and ball of foot areas. There is no gel running along the entire length of the foot. Yet, this is how the item is still advertised.If you complain, they refuse to pay for return shipping! At this point, I still haven't gotten a refund. It's only through the excellent customer support of Amazon that I have some redress.
