review/text: I feel that this is a good splint. Its rigid and can form to almoast any position and it stays rigid. Only draw back is the ammount of padding. The splint has padding but it feels it could have a little more. However that being said no splint like this will have enough padding in my mind. Extra padding is usually a must. Havent used the splint yet but have played with it some and I am confident in its abilities. Would and probably will buy another.
