review/text: Adjustable is an apt descriptive for the Duro-Med cane. Though lightweight, this cane is ruggedly made and it allows easy use for long periods of walking. The comfortable foam-padded handle is suitable for all, and the telescoping cane allows you to adjust its height with a simple ratchet-like placeholder smoothly designed into the two-part cane (the upper section has the handle, and it mates to the lower section, which has the base with four rubber-tipped "feet" that inspire confident use). You can adjust the length of the cane so a person 6-feet, 4-inches tall enjoys use of the cane as readily as a shorter person can. A surprise with the cane is that it comes with a second lower section of rubber-tipped tubing that you can use in place of the quad-tipped base. This strategy transforms the cane into a standard "one-pole" model. Users who may feel they don't need the broad support of the base with four feet will enjoy this option, as will those who may want to use a cane in crowded areas, where the four-footed section might be a tad clumsy to use. (The trade-off, of course, is that the one-pole base offers less support.) An user with dizziness or lightheadedness will appreciate the extra support of the four-footed base. Last, a cord loop attached to the handle lets you insert your hand through it before you grip the handle, to add a bit of extra security. The metal cane is well-made and smoothly finished (nice welding with the base plate and its four feet), and all of this -- including the second base -- is priced astonishingly low.NOTE: Since I posted my review, I have been informed (in October of 2011) that the company does not offer a second, straight (monopole) section that can be affixed to the long cane handle. I found the standard four-prong, lower section of the cane to work very well, as described in company literature and based on my experience.
