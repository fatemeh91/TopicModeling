review/text: I was very picky when it came to a foot massage. I knew I wanted a heater and I read every review on here on every model available before choosing this model. I think this model is pretty good for at home use. Of course I would rather have someone also massaging my feet, for it to be deeper so it covered more, and possibly a wider base...but hey, this is a home unit and it is pretty darn good. The heating function is wonderful, getting the water nice and hot. I wish there were air jets under my foot- they are at the top of the unit shooting at my toes. I curl my toes this way and that and it pushes the bubbles around my feet. I think I am going to try putting my sea salts in a cheesecloth and see if it works. Otherwise, you can't add sea salts to the unit...which is a bummer.Overall, this a good unit for at home use.
