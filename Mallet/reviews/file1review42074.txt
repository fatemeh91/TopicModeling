review/text: The chair is designed for extremely short people. The cushion has the wrong "folds" to fit the chair. And the manual has some amusing, but not very helpful phrases like: "For avoid the noise, please make sore which the Tie-Down Straps secure cushion to chair tightest." That's pure Engrish...
