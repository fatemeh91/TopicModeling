review/text: I have never had anything but great experiences when purchasing something sold by amazon or processed by amazon. This item however was the exception. As another poster noted the product is badly stored. This is by far may favorite flavor protein bar. It tastes more like dessert and is very healthy for you. However, the product must be stored in a very warm warehouse because the bar I opened appeared to have been melted at one time. It was crumbling and unedible. Trust me, save your money on this one. I hate going to stores so getting things through the mail is wonderful, but for protein bars, I may be forced to actually go out and pick these up. I will say amazon accepted my return and credited my account so at the very least I was happy with that.
