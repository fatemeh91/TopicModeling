review/text: i bought this vitamins, not sure if they work or not, but something weird happened to it, it was fine when i opened the jar, but after ciuple of months, the pills had big black dots on it and smelled like rotten fish, i didnt risk taking them, not sure why that happened... so i opened the second sealed jar, and it was fine (yellow pills with a bit medicine smell) , lets see if it will turn rotten after a while like the first jar... anyone has experienced this?
