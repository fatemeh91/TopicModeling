Not everyone I shared it with liked it immediately, as it has a slightly unusual taste at first. The sweetness of the bar comes out as you chew it, however. The pleasant fruit flavor reminded me alternately of raisins and strawberries. I particularly enjoyed the creamy yogurt coating. The balance of nutrients is excellent for a healthy snack or even a small meal when time is short. I was unaware of this type of product and I'm glad to find out about it.
