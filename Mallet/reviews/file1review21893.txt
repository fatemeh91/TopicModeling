review/text: I started running for the 1st time ever about a year ago and developed a horrible case of shin splints. After physical therapy and 3 months of rest in combination with sports massage and chiropractics, I am starting to train for a mini-marathon. I don't want to relapse, so I wanted to ice 4 or more times a day. Having 2 kids under 5, it is impossible to sit for 20 mins 4 times a day to ice. So I decided to try this product. I LOVE IT! I measure for the small, but ordered medium based on other's reviews of difficulty putting them on. They provide the perfect amount of compression and length of time icing. Best of all, I can wear them doing laundry, cooking, etc. They are tricky to slide on, but are getting easier with repeated use.
