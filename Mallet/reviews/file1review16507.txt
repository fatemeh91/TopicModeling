review/text: I only use Stacker 2 xplc, the best out there in m.h.o. since they dont make me feel sick when taking them. A great burst of energy that really helps take off and keep off the pounds. Did I mention a bottle of pills is about as cheap as a Burgerking meal nowadays?However, they show a picture of a box of 20 convienient easy to tuck away daily tubes with 3 pills in each, which is what I thought I was buying.....bitter disappointment when they arrived all in one medium sized bottle instead...*Sigh*But the price is right so cheapskates can't be to choosy so until I find a vendor that actually sells what they show in their pictures Im stuck with Amazon because of the price...Goodluck in getting what you think you are buying.
