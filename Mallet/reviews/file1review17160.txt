review/text: I bought this to replace my cheap trimmer that i bought at Target last year that broke on my at the start of this fall. I like most people was skeptical because it wasnt what i was use to buying, but for the price you cannot beat it. With easy to change levels of trimming, i am able to fade my hair with the beard with no problems at all. No changing trimming head pieces and what not; everything is right on the trimmer. Been using for about a month or two now and still sharp with no pulls.
