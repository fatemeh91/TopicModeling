review/text: Once I started using water I had just boiled, shaving with this became a two minute pleasure with almost zero nicks. I just took an old electric kettle and put it in the bathroom. Just put the hot water in a shaving cup, dip in the brush, make your shaving foam, and use the hot water to dip your razor. Please be careful the razor and the brush are not too hot--dip in the hot water, wait a few seconds, test it, etc. This improved my ease of shaving with this merkur a ton. I use the derby blades, they work fine.
