review/text: I was expecting to add 1 pound of muscle to my body for each pound of Whey Protein, but it's actually duplicating my expectations! I have consumed 3 pounds of the product so far, and I already gained 7 pounds of muscle! And the best thing is that I'm just taking one serving per training day, after workout. I train one muscle per day, just 1 hour. The flavor is also great, at least the double rich chocolate. I don't know if this is the best product but it's working for me so I'll definitely keep on using it.
