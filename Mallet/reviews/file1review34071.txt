review/text: This stuff is amazing. I bought some on a whim one day at the health food store. I only use it after I eat a heavy meal or foods that usually give me heartburn or an upset stomach. These do the trick. After Thanksgiving dinner, my husband said that he felt really bloated and sick. (He ate like a hog.) I gave him three of these and within a few hours, he said he felt fine. He uses them all the time. It is one of the few organic items, he doesn't care how much I spend on because it works. At Amazon's prices you can't go wrong. LOVE IT!
