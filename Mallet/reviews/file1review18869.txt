review/text: I chose this cover for the color and material. I was very disappointed when I put it on the change pad and it did not fit. Our change pad is a standard size by Summer Infant. It did not fully cover the sides and I put something in the center, about the weight of a baby (I am due next month) the corners lifted off. It is too bad because I really liked it and had to return it.
