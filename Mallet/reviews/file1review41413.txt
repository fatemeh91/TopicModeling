review/text: I thought I had read other reviews that said this product was specially formulated to dissolve easily in liquid (even water) and I figured natural flavor would be largely tasteless. I've tried everything and this stuff is still disgusting! It does NOT dissolve, no matter now much you blend, shake, let sit, etc. There will always be clumps. More importantly, you can ALWAYS taste the off-spoiled milk taste of this product. Even in shakes, it makes the shakes extra foamy and is hard to swallow. The ONLY luck I've had using this is putting it in pancake batter (beware, as it makes the pancakes burn, as it changes the property of the batter). Very disappointing. I feel misled by other users' product reviews and have no idea what I'm going to do with the huge tub of this stuff now.
