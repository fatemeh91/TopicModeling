review/text: My colleague at work had one looking very similar to this. I would NEVER have thought how great it feels on those tight knots I get and have on my back. This one is easy to use and you can place more or less pressure as needed. You can use this on your back or legs, arms, neck, the s-shaped one is better than the hook one because it is more versatile. Very sturdy, durable, I have had mine for about 3 years now.
