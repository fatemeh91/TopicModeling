review/text: I bought this on sale for $15 at a local Kroger (Smiths) outlet just to quickly replace my $50 trimmer that started to pinch and I have been very impressed with it for the price I paid. I've had it 6 months now and it works just like it did when I bought it.Some things I like about this particular model:#1 - NO ATTACHMENTS! Can't tell you how many times I've had to fumble and look through my stash to find the correct attachment to use. This completely defeats this problem by just using a scroll wheel to select what length of trim you want.#2 - Charge indicator light, believe it or not some don't have any charge indication lights which makes it real fun to try to determine if the device is charging or is fully charged.#3 - No pinching. Like I said, I've had it for 6 months and it still cuts great and I have thick black hair. I've spent $50-$70 only to get a unit that pinches and pulls on hairs rather than trim them.You can't go wrong with this unit, its cheap and it works better than some of the more expensive units you can find. This is one case where price isn't a indication of quality.
