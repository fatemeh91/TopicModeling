review/text: I had a reaction to shampoos. Itching all the time. I didn't think I was going to find anything that I could use. The itching was driving me nuts. I had to go into the hospital for surgery (nothing about this) and used the product while I was there and man does it work. No more itching. Just soft clean hair. I am one of the lucky ones that found a product that works.Thank you so much
