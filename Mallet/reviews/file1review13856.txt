review/text: My husband --- who is a National Park employee --- had these in his first aid and medical supply kit. He bragged that nothing worked as well for his indigestion and reflux. He has taken a wide variety of products for his upsets --- including some prescriptions. I was skeptical, but he was insistent that I look on line for a source to purchase a supply for at home. Of course, I found it on Amazon! Then I became a believer as well. The small tablets are fast-acting and effective. It's a generous, inexpensive box full of relief, and the individual packets make it simple to stick a couple in your purse or lunch bag.
