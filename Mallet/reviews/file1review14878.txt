review/text: The Met-Rx extreme chocolate shake tastes really good. I agree with the other reviews that compare it to chocolate cake batter, which to me is tasty. I've had other protein shakes specifically designed for post-work out that do not taste nearly as good as this. It also leaves me decently full, and I find that it works great for me as a replacement for breakfast or an afternoon snack. It is a bit pricey, but when you consider the cost of food you are saving by replacing it with a shake, it's really not that bad.
