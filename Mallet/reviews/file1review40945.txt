review/text: I don't know why some other customers are complaining. I used to be one of those who inhaled food every 5 minutes, but the patch stopped all that. I only used a one month supply and I dropped back down to my high school weight. Okay the red marks aren't fun but I think it's worth it. I look and feel great about myself again!!!
