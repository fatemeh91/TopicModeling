review/text: Optimum Nutrition has been #1 rated protein for years now. There is good reason for it. Its the highest quality of protein, the taste is absolutely amazing, and the price point is better then anything your going to find.it doesnt contain other supplements, just straight protein. It doesnt clump up when your mixing it, it doesnt have a horrible after taste either. Its just straight wholesome goodness.This stuff cuts recovery time from muscle exhaustion dramatically. Literally over nite muscle soreness evaporates into a figment of your imagination. Im not a rep for Optimum, just a proud user for quite a few years now.I will always buy Optimum, and nothing else!!
