review/text: Although the idea is good, the prenatal cradle has to be modified in many aspects:This product was not made thinking about fashionable and practical pregnant women.If you live in a hot weather,clothing is light and does not cover all your body,therefore,the prenatal cradle will show up either from one side or the other!!!!!!! (specially if you are proud of your new body and use low rise pants or short t-shirts)it also can be seen through your clothing because the cradle is white and made of a thick material. It is one added worry,every time I have to dress up for work, workout or just going out, I have to spend a long time thinking how to cover it. I am dissapointed about this product, it makes me feel frustrated.
