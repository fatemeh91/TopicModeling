review/text: The only reason I purchased this product was to remove the sticky residue off my cabinets that are near my stove. I used the product and tried with all of my might to get the grease out to no avail... waste of money. Might work for making your cabinets shine but not for cleaning as stated on the bottle. I guess castor oil is my next purchase.
