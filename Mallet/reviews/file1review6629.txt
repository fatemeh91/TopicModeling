review/text: I have mild scoliosis, and have had a history of a ruptured disc in my lower back. I've done well until this past year. In April, I had a return of sciatica. Many tests have not shown anything "physical" to explain the often incapacitating pain.Along with medical pain management, I have added massage therapy. Recently, after a therapist spent hours trying to get the knots out of my back, he recommended that I look for this tool, as a way to help massage my own muscles between visits.What a godsend! A few minutes several times a day seems to give me hours of pain relief. It looks funny, and I suspect that my husband does not quite believe me when I say its for back massage, but hey.Its not expensive, not high tech, and helps a lot. What more can you ask for? Stores easily in a closet or under the bed.I have recently found a dual use: My dogs are afraid of it, and I have found that if I lay it on the couch, or up on counters,(or wherever they go where they are not supposed to be), they will avoid the forbidden area completely.So massage your muscles, and train your dogs at the same time.
