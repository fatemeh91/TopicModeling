review/text: I was getting nervous about not having enough milk to send to the babysitter's for my daughter. I am only producing 2 bottles of milk a day while I am at work and she takes three at the sitters. I used to be able to get three while I was at work. I started using this product and used it for 3 weeks straigt with no change! In fact, the only changes that occured was even lower production. I have since stopped taking it and have to supplement at the babysitter's house with one bottle of formula...which my daughter hates! I will say that since I have stopped taking it I feel like my production has gone back up. I don't know if it's me just coming to terms with having to supplement with formula or what. I wish it would have worked for me but it didn't...I shouldn't have bought 2 bottles before even trying it ; ) I hope this helps and I hope others have more luck than me! My GYN swears by this stuff! It just wasn't for me.
