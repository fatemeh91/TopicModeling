review/text: I have been using these shakes for years. Some posters do not like the fact that they have sugar. Frankly, I beleive that anything in moderation is ok and alittle sugar in the shakes does not change the fact that they are good, filling and satisfying for about 200 calories. I try and stay away from lots of artificial sweetners and this does have some splenda. I always blend it in the blender with about 6-8 oz. of skim milk, ice cubes and sometimes a little coffee. If you whip it enough you have a huge shake that is similar to a frappacino from Starbucks or a milkshake. Very satisfying and refreshing.
