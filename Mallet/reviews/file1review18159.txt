review/text: I bought my first one of these about a year ago to help block out the light when I had to work at night. These are very very comfortable because unlike other eye masks they do not put any pressure on your eyes and are very lightweight. However, about 6 months after everyday use (always at home, very gently used) they started to fray at the edges.I bought another pair because I really liked how comfortable they were but the foam padding completely separated from the eye mask in less than 2 months of use.I tried a few other different brands which were much more durable however they all put too much pressure on my eyes which I found very uncomfortable. So I finally broke down and bought my third one of these in a year a month ago. It's still in excellent condition but time will tell.5 stars for comfort, 2 stars for durability (3 pairs in 1 year!!)
