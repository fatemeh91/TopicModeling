review/text: My Remington Microscreen DA 307 ran out of juice after working perfectly for about 15 years. I looked at buying a new electric razor, and they all looked foreign, possibly cheaply made, and expensive. I bought the reconditioned shaver advertised here and I love it. It came yesterday, and man, I took it out for a run and it was excellent. HOWEVER, after purchasing it, I found out that at ShaversOutlet.com you can buy the lower part of the shaver for $9.99. I bought one, attached my old head, and now I have two excellent shavers. Yay me. BTW: I'm not Susan. That's me wife.
