review/text: The problem with these Kava capsules is that this in not a concentrated extract. The active ingredient, the kavalactones are not in very high quantity based on the recommended serving sizes. I felt NOTHING with 2 capsulesAlso, the genetics behind the Kava root are very, very important. I don't THINK this is a top strand.The liquid gel caps are superior and you actually feel the effect. The Kalm Down Tonga Kava Powder is fantastic. That will give you the effect you desire.
