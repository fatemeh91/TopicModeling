review/text: I've tried a handful of enzyme formulas, from the "sold only by licensed professionals" variety to off-the-shelf. This has proven to be the best. It effectively reduces bloating and fatigue after meals. I can really feel the difference it makes. Having taken it for 6 solid months now, the impact in my overall digestive health is undeniable and quite significant.Caution: as one reviewer noted, the pro-biotics in this formula are cultured using dairy (which is a very common practice). If you are severely allergic to dairy, make sure to ask the manufacturer specifically how they culture their pro-biotics.To good health!
