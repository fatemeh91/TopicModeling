review/text: I absolutely love this product. I've been using it for several years now and it has stood against the worst things I could throw at it. When I had roommates who absolutely refused to clean anything, they were willing to use this after their showers. Scrubbing the shower every two weeks after 3 adults used it daily was so much easier with this spray. I personally do not mind the smell, though ylang-ylang did take some getting used to with other products.
