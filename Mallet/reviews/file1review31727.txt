review/text: Just got this today. As stated inside the packaging, a good knife, space blanket/emergency bivy/tube tent, and a method to PURIFY water are all necessary additions to this. This is very similar to the survival kits that I have made for myself. Not a be all end all but the price is right and this leads one down the correct path for serious survival. The packaging is nice and small and the bag is sturdy. I am curious to see how I can make a pot to boil water and cook out of the heavy duty foil, as I have not considered it in the kits I already use. 5 stars for me!
