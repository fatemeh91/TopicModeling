review/text: This is a very well-designed potty seat:- Our toddler thinks it's very comfortable.- The rubber rim prevents it from slipping.- The sizing mechanism is simple to use, takes only a few seconds to get adjusted to virtually any toilet, and holds on very securely.- The handle is useful for carrying or hanging the seat.- Overall, seems to be very durable.The only downside is that it isn't exactly tiny. It's a couple of inches narrower and shorter than a typical toilet seat, and is roughly 3 or 4 inches thick at its thickest point, making it awkward to place in a diaper bag. It's hard to imagine any way this problem could be eliminated, however.
