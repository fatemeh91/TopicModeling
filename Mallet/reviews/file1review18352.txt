review/text: I ordered these for our fall wedding. Our wedding was mostly DIY. We had decided on lemonade and iced tea {& H20 of course} for our reception in addition to a bar. But since we were providing these beverages ourselves instead of catering them in... cups were a last minute thing I needed. These arrived quickly, they were inexpensive and the perfect size... bigger than a stupid punch cup but small enough a quick refreshment [because seriously, giving a couple hundred of people the option to fill a big glass... would mean a lot of lemonade and tea making... no thank you]. And... with our guest number around the 175 mark... we had plenty of cups. Whats great about left overs... my little bro is graduating from high school in the spring... bam! cups are taken care of!On a product note... Hefty never fails, these are hefty duty :)
