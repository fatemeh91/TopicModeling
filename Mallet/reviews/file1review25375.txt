review/text: I've suffered from migraines for 16 years and have tried practically everything on the market, both conventional and alternative/natural. I've been taking Petadolex (butterbur) for nearly three months and the frequency of migraine attacks has dropped dramatically. I usually get at least several migraines a month, many times I have gotten several per week. I've had one near-migraine the past six weeks, and the pain was minor compared to past headaches. I did not have to resort to my usual remedy: Maxalt and a dark room.It takes one to three months to experience the full benefits of butterbur, so be patient if you try it. But, if you are like me and millions of other migraine sufferers, what is a month or two compared to so many lost days spent in the dark lying still, hoping and praying that the pain will subside?Don't let the cost of this product stop you from trying it. We cannot put a price tag on our health, on feeling alive and well.
