review/text: Can't beat the price for this hard to find item. Only one local store carried them and they wanted 5 times what I paid here. If you can wait a week (not prime eligible) then buy away!Bought this for my dive computer transmitter. just becareful and note the pointed end is the negative. This is clearly marked and my old battery was the same way. My mistake so I can't fault the battery, just a note to self.Not sure on how long this one will last, the old one lasted two seasons or about 100 dives..So far 8 dives and going strong.
