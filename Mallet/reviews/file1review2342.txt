review/text: This product was recommended by my eye doctor. Within one long uncomfortable week I discovered I cannot take fish oil, that fish oil is fish oil, it's not the quality as my doctor suggested, it's personal intolerance to the product that contributes to fish burps, followed by intestinal distress, head aches and finally nose bleeds. Many people can tolerate fish oil products, but those of us who cannot, beware!
