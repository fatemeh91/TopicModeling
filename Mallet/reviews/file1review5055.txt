review/text: I was looking for something to help boost my energy during workouts to help me complete my circuit/weight training. Na No Vapor really delivered in giving me that rush and endurance boost I. It feels like adrenalin and makes you feel like you have the energy to lift until your muscles give out. I haven't had any side effects using this product, except maybe when I use too much of it and feel like I want to run off a couple of miles AFTER my workout. Bottom line is that it works really well. (I enjoyed the WWF style description on the packaging. "You're not ready for this stuff! Oh yeahhh...." lol)
