review/text: I love this bra, don't get me wrong... I have one and plan to buy one or two more. It's great not only for wearing at night, but I wear mine around the house as a top (although I will readily admit that it's not the sexiest) and it's extremely comfortable.My problem is that it isn't adjustable enough. I have a small frame and very large breasts (34DD), and the bra doesn't seem to fit quite right. The elastic band sort of bunches on top while the cups are a little small.I'm sure that if your body is more proportionate (eg. 34C or 36D, etc.) this would be the best bra ever. This truly is a light support bra and doesn't really cut it outside the house for large-breasted women, unless you're going for the sagging look!
