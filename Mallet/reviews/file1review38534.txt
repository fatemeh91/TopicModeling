review/text: I received these from VitaCost in a horribly mangled package with half the tablets crumbled. However, VitaCost was nice enough to immediately replace my order. So for them, I give this 3 stars. Excellent company with fast shipping. That being said, these tablets taste AWFUL. I am not a picky eater, but the fake sugar taste of these tablets is so strong and leaves an after taste that won't go away. Only purchase if you have a strong stomach and don't mind the taste of fake sugar.
