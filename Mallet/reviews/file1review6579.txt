review/text: Hook it over your shoulder, probe around until you find the tension and then (using gravity alone) drape your arms over one of the extended ends of the device. Allow yourself to zone-out for about 10 seconds and you will feel your body begin to relax. I work at a desk all day and have to remind myself to take breaks.Since receiving my B-B-Buddy, I look forward the first signs of tension just to experience the relief it produces!Highly recommended!
