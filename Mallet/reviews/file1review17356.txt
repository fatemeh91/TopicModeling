review/text: I had a Remington trimmer for many years which I loved. It was incredible, always fast and sharp. When I lost it, I bought this model, but I was really surprised by how badly it cut. It will NOT cut close to the skin AT ALL. It was not able to cut the hair under my nose, and it will simply not cut closer that 1/4 inch because of the way the blades are positioned. So if you need to get close to the skin, for example under the nose or down on the neck, you're going to be screwed by this shaver. Not to mention that it pulls like the dickens. I am just perplexed by what Remington has wrought.
