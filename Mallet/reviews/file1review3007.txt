review/text: These condoms do run a bit small but they stretch very comfortably. They seem to have more room at the end of the condom for the head of the penis. I have read by many that they feel exactly or very close to wearing nothing at all. My first Crown Beyond 7 test I was disappointed for the first 3 or 4 minutes. Then the feeling became very natural, warm and wet. I was thinking wow, they are exactly like not wearing a condom! Just to be sure I quickly pulled out, removed the condom and began at it. Truth be known the feeling is very good for a condom (the best of any condom I've tried) but not even close to the same feeling as wearing no condom. She said the same thing. Try it the way I did and see for yourself. These condoms are strong, comfortable and allow you to feel what other condoms don't. So if you are in a position that you must use a condom I'd say these are the one's. They actually make me think now that some of the girls I never had sex with because I would have to use a condom, may now be worth having sex with wearing one of these. Side note if you are very thick (waaay above average) I'd say pass on these and stick with the Magnum XL's.
