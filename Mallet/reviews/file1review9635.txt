review/text: This stuff is great! I had my first bottle of Zim's from a local pharmacy, and it lasted several years, but when I went back to get more, the store no longer carried the product. I was horrified because, as an aqua fitness instructor, my hands are often dry and, in the winter months, painful cracks show up along the edges of my fingers. Until I found Zim's Crack Creme, I struggled with bandaids and antibiotic ointments for weeks at a time to clear them up. This medication smells a little yucky and makes the skin surface a little sticky, but if you put it on before bed for several nights, the cracks disappear as if by magic. So, imagine my horror when I couldn't find it in any of the drugstores around my usual haunts and imagine my delight when I found it on Amazon! Once again, Amazon has saved the day. The diversity of products offered online through Amazon is staggering, and I am learning to look there first when I need something. If you have any dry skin issues with your hands, elbows, feet, or knees -- give this stuff a try.
