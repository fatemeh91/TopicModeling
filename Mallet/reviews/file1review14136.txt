review/text: The year before last I was given a Philips Norelco Cool Skin Shaver. I tried both the Nivea cream and gel cartridges. The gel seemed to work better out of the shower. If your like me and need a mirror so you can see what your doing use the gel. This is a great product and I haven't found it anywhere cheaper than on amazon.
