review/text: I really like this deodorant. It works for a whole day and smells really very good. Also, it keeps you dry for hours and you'll feel fresh the whole day with Secret Anti-Perspirant. My wife loved it very much. After the delivery of our baby, she used to sweat a lot. When she used this, she felt very fresh and dry. I really recommend you use it.
