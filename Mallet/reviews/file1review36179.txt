review/text: I have been using this cream for almost 2 years. My dermatologist had recommended it because of a severe case of dermatitis I have. It was to rebuild my skin, he said. That has not happened but I notice that my skin feels much better after I apply the cream. I am happy to have found the 4 oz. size because the tube I had before was about 1 oz and I paid $11 for it!
