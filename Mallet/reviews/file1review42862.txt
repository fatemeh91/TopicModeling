review/text: My Rx makes my throat dry and irritated. Eating anything with MSG also screws up my throat. I've noticed that taking histidine dramatically reduces these side effects with no side effects of its own. I just love it. People claim that it helps to reduce allergies, but I'm not sure if it's true. I'll know for sure when the allergy season is over. So far, my symptoms are not that noticeable, so I'm hopeful.
