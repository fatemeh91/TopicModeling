review/text: I LOVE this mask and wear it every night. However, after just a few months the inner liner peels away and I have to throw the mask away. This shouldn't be a disposable item! I keep buying new ones because they're so comfortable. BUCKY, PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM! If you only wear it occasionally, like for plane travel, it's the one to buy.
