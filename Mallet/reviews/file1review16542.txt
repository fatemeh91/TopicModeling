review/text: I bought this today from my local CVS. I took one pill this morning with breakfast (I'm only 94lbs, so the huge doses scared me). After a few minutes I started to feel anxious, like I had too much coffee. I couldn't sit through Church or focus on what the preacher was talking about. I've had a dull headache around my temple area, and a ton of pressure behind my eyes all day. I will give it a few more tries, but I don't think it helped me focus at all, if anything, the side effects made my focus worse than normal.
