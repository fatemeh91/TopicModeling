review/text: I have tried many of the colon cleanses out there, including the 250 dollar BePure Cleanse, the 10.85 dollar Super Colon Cleanse, the 10.78 dollar Nature's Secret Super Cleanse, the 24.60 dollar Renew Life Fiber Smart, the 17.99 dollar Renew Life Organic Triple Fiber, and the 7.55 dollar Smooth Move Tea. Out of all the colon cleanses that I have tried, I can say that Oxy-Powder is by far the best and most thorough.Some of the benefits of using Oxy-Powder that I have noticed include increased energy, a lighter feeling about life, a look of health, an acne-free face, and a flatter tummy.Oxy-Powder even cleanses your blood and body unlike many of the other colon cleanses out there. Also, Oxy-Powder is not JUST a colon cleanse; it also cleanses the small intestine as it is a whole intestine cleaner.If you want a highly effective intestinal cleaner, I highly recommend this product.
