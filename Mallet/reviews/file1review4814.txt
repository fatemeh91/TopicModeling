review/text: This tastes great and is the easiest way to get something of this high quality into your diet. Great for those who don't have the ability to cart around fresh veggies all day or don't have the time. I love it for those reasons personally, and love that it helps me get nutrient-rich veggies into the diet of my "veggie haters". Even the fiercest vegetable haters don't know they are having it when I mix it with a little cherry juice and yogurt for a smoothie with a secret. ;)
