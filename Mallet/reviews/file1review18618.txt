review/text: Just kidding! This is simply a product which threads floss through your teeth in situations where dental appliances block floss from getting between the teeth from the top. I have a permanent wire glued to the back of my bottom front teeth so I must thread dental floss through them from the front, underneath the wire, in order to floss between them. This product is up to the job and the price was reasonable. End of review!
