review/text: I too shared many of the apparent problems with this charger/battery combo! I was about to return both sets I purchased; however, was able to resurrect the product and it works GREAT! The batteries now work super in my digital camera, cordless mouse, cordless keyboard, and even flashlights.What I did:1. I fully discharged the batteries in a flashlight - left it on overnight.2. I fully charged the batteries in the charger overnight (ignore the steady green light indicating a full charge).3. I repeated steps 1 and 2.The batteries now operate great. They hold a charge and operate items I only operated previously with DuraCell Alkalines. The green fully-charged indicator on the charging unit also appears to be operating correctly now.Other problems noted such as overheating and unit not staying plugged in have not been an issue for me. The unit is secure in a wall socket, the batteries are secure in the unit, and the operating temperature (even after 12 hrs) is just a little above room temp.I hope this review may save you some grief and a potential needless return of the product!
