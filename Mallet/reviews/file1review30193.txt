review/text: It is very good for the corner and hiding place vacuum, but the blowing function doesn't works well. I mainly used it to clean my computers and slits in my sofa where my kids drop all kinds of food, small toys, different staff and dust. It works very well, but the sound is too loud. If you don't care the loud noise which is a very good product for small area.
