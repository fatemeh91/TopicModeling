review/text: I am putting my house on the market and I had water stains on the popcorn ceilings of two bedrooms. I had read "just mix one part bleach and two parts water and spray the ceiling multiple times until the stain is gone". Sounded reasonable. Thing is - it didn't work. It somewhat faded the stain in one room that was pretty light but didn't even touch the darker stain in the guest room.I was pretty convinced that there were just no good options here. Ceiling spray paint never really matches. Bleach doesn't work. Repainting the whole ceiling is a pretty questionable proposition because you run the risk of the popcorn just falling off and then you have to try to respray the popcorn stuff in a can that doesn't match and looks like garbage anyway. So what the heck are you supposed to do?Buy InstaGone. It actually works. The directions say that for heavy stains you should mix it with half the amount of water so that's what I did. I sprayed it on both stains and actually watched them almost disappear completely on the first go. The lighter stain I treated one more time and the darker one I sprayed a total of four times (letting it dry in between each time). The stains are gone. You can't even tell where they used to be. I can't recommend this product enough for this purpose.
