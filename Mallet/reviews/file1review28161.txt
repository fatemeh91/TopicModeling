review/text: Great product. Tastes great (I've tried the chocolate and vanilla and enjoy both), dissolves quickly/easily by shaking, high protein value and good mix of amino acids. I recommend this highly. If I could change one thing, it would be to have the company reduce the cholesterol content. (Soy has no cholesterol, but I prefer the whey for overall nutrition). All in all this is a great product, best whey product I've found, used it daily for years and will continue ordering unless/until I find a lower cholesterol rival that tastes and mixes as well with the same high protein value. Recommended. (Works great as a blender smoothie with bananas, strawberries etc, and also works well mixed with just hot water; tastes then like water-based hot cocoa). Great for backpacking or travel; get up, mix a shake, start your day.
