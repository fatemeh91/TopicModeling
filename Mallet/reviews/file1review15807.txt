review/text: I use my pen every day for work so I always need to have one handy. This pen has a pencil and two colors of ink. Comes with black & red but I usually prefer the blue and red combo. Cross Pens have a great lifetime guarantee so if one breaks I send it back with $10 for shipping and handling and they will repair or replace it. Since I can't take a break from writing daily I needed a back up pen until my original one gets back from the factory. The retail stores sell them for $49.95 plus tax. This one was offered at a much lower price, got free shipping as a Prime member and it came right away. No hassles and a great product. Thank you very much for the service you gave!
