review/text: Okay, so I buy this online because I'm too embarrassed to admit I have a massive hedge-like formation that has cropped up on the inside rim of my nostrils and I don't want to go into a store and let some 16 year old babe in low rise jeans see me buy it. I get it home, take it out of the box and put it to work. Side A (the left) goes reasonably smoothly though there is this wierd aroma of frying hair as I pump the thing in and out of my nostril. I switch to side B and it really seems to go haywire flaying open the skin and tugging the hairs out so viciously that I got tears running down my face. I stumble out of the bathroom and my woman sees me bleeding crying and looking all confused and she says 'youre on coke again aren't you?' So I'm like 'no!' but I cant stop screwing my face up because the hair that got pulled out tweaked something in my face and it just stings so much. Anyway, I'd recommend it.
