review/text: The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree. However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working. Braun is telling me to send it to a repair shop but, as luck would have it, I can't find my receipt so I can't get it repaired under warrantee. Even if I could find the receipt, I would have to send the stand in at my expense.I bought this shaver because I felt I would be buying quality. I am a product designer by profession and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy. If they were to stand behind their products, I would be fine with this failure, but, as it stands, I regret buying this shaver and I doubt I will purchase anything else from Braun.
