review/text: After years of trimming my beard with scissors, I decided to try an electric beard trimmer. Since it was to be on a trial basis, I wanted to find a trimmer that had good reviews, and was coupled with a good price. This Remington MB-200 was being sold for about $14.00, with free shipping, so I thought "Why not?". I'm happy to say that it was a good decision. The trimmer has proven to have suited my needs. The blades are sharp, the unit holds a charge well, and it's easy to use. I especially like the adjustment wheel, as it enables one to make quick length adjustments, without having to remove heads (that is, unless you want the very shortest stubble or definition, which requires removal of the length guard). Since I'm using the unit for short stubble length, I can't attest as to how the trimmer would be for longer lengths, although I would venture to guess that it would work well in those cases, also.
