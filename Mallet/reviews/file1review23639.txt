review/text: I had doubt when I first bought this item. I can not believe this product will really release my thumb pain. After I use it for a few days, it immediately show some relief. After using it for 2 month, My thumb pain has been greatly reduced to almost nothing.The only problem I had with this product is the life span of the steel stick. The stick that on the back side usually broke in about three - four weeks. I am already use my third pair right now. That is the reason I gave it a 4 stars. Other than this, it really works.
