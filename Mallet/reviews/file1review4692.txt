review/text: I got this product to make my life a little bit easier after the birth of my third child. I figured it would make for a quick breakfast and might help me lose the baby weight a little faster. So far, I'm impressed. I wake up and already know what I'm making myself for breakfast. I add a banana or strawberries and I'm ready for the crazy day ahead of me! I've found I'm not hungry throughout the morning and end up eating a reasonable lunch. I've lost 25 pounds in the two weeks since the baby's been born (alot of it water weight post-baby, I know), have a good amount of energy (all things considered), am healing from my 3rd c-section well, and exclusively breast-feeding! I couldn't ask for a better system right now, since I can't work out yet. I have never been a meal replacement type person, but this is working for me!
