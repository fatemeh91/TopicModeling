review/text: I bought this for my husband to use in our Corolla. He loves the heat function and the dual massage is pretty good, the lower back works better than the upper. The only problem we found with this unit is the straps to hold it in place on the seat. They aren't long enough and the material won't stretch sufficiently to fit around the bucket seat of a Corolla! A Corolla is a midsize sedan what type of seat was this product designed to fit a VW bug?! There is no way we will ever be able to use it in our Expedition. Really bad design.My husband has to just place it on the seat and adjust it which is not optimal since it can shift while you are driving. I got it on sale so I its worth the price I paid, but I wouldn't pay full price for it again.In summary, a soothing massage, but poorly designed for in car usage.
