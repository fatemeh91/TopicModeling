review/text: The hammer is excellent and the price is right; however, the company sent the wrong hammer the first shipment. It had been listed as being in stock, and I needed it for a practical exam. So I am annoyed that I did not get it in time. OTOH, customer service was very nice. They let me keep the incorrect hammer at no charge. Unfortunately, I already have two regular reflex hammers, so... Mixed feelings.
