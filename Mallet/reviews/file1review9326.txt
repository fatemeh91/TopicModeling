review/text: I spent WEEKS looking for an AM/PM pill organizer that would fit all of my vitamins and whatnot without squishing them together like I have been, and having to use something to pry them out. I finally decided on this one after reading reviews and looking at customer pictures. This organizer is awesome! I love the freedom to take a pod with me and since I travel 2 hours away on weekends, this is PERFECT! Not only that, but there is enough room for ALL of my pills to fit. I will be attaching pictures to show what supplements I use and list them. I am also uploading a picture of a normal sized pill keeper compared to this, since this is larger than most pill organizers. I'm glad I went with this product.
