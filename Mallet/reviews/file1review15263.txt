review/text: We had always used Clif Bars when we wanted a nutritious snack or meal replacement. For some reason, the Clif Bars looked more delicious -- with their packaging! The Balance Bars look more adult (maybe too adult ... maybe for old people!) But, in fact, my family prefers the Balance Bars. They tasted much, much better, and nutritionally, they appear to be of higher quality.
