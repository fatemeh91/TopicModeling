review/text: As a runner, based on recommendations from fellow enthusiasts, I've made the switch to Hammer products and found their products work well for me. For long runs, using the jug, I can fill my gel flask making nutrition intake more convenient rather than carry individual hard to open (especially when sweaty) gel pacs.
