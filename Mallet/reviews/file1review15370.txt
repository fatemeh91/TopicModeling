review/text: I purchased the Coco Mango incense some time ago and should have left a review by now. I'm sure if the seller is still listing on Amazon but Auric Blends had the best price along with shipping. The incense themselves burn within 45 minutes to one hour. The smell is quite nice, not too strong and you can easily burn multiplies one after another as the smell keeps bringing you back. I recommend Coco Mango, but if it isn't from Auric Blends, that could potentially alter the scent since oils don't always come from the same buyer. They may put diluted to extend the oil, thus weakening the scent in the process. Be sure to ask this question before buying. Thank you.
