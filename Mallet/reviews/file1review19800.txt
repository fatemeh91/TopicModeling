review/text: I am very happy with this purchase. We have an elongated toilet seat and this toilet trainer is the only one to fit perfectly. I also like that it is plain white and "blinds" in our bathroom.Easy to clean, easy to adjust, easy to put on the toilet and easy to remove.Both my kids love to use it (6 year old daughter and 3 year old son).Don't waste your money with other seats, this is the ONE to buy.
