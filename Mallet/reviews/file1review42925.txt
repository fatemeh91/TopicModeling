review/text: This product cleans better than other similar cleaning products on the market I've used, and the awesome fresh smell (lemon verbena) remains for a period of time after you're done cleaning. No scrubbing is required - just rinse thoroughly. I was able to easily clean the built-up grease on my kitchen cabinets with no problem. I wish I had known about this product a long time ago.
