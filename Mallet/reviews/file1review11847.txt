review/text: I love this protein powder! I am required to drink at least one protein supplement a day because of my medical issues. This tastes alot like lowfat chocolate milk and isn't gritty at all. BUT this price is outragoues! I ordered from another vender a container this very week of the same flavor and size for $29.99! Check around before you buy! WLS sites are great for high protein low carb mixes and powders as well as ready to drink protein. In my opinion Champion is the best but I can't give this product here a 5 star when I know it is over priced compared to other venders.
