review/text: I have had this product for about 2 months and I really like using it. I wouldnt really say its over priced, because it is such a great product; but, its a little bit expensive for the average consumer, including myself. I do find that it helps in enhancing a meditation. The games are not what I expected, I hope they do work on those to improve them. As a whole, its a step up from normal meditation; you notice a difference for sure, I do recommend it.
