review/text: I have been using this product for about 6 months now and it definitely works. I have glass shower doors that show every water spot if I don't wipe them down every time, and this product has been working very well on them. Simply spray and it cleans off scum with time. It does have a strong odor, which I happen to like. If you are sensitive to that sort of thing, I probably wouldn't recommend it. It would be nice if they came out with an unscented version some day. Or at least one that isn't quite as heavy. I usually run my bathroom vent after spraying it, which seems to help.
