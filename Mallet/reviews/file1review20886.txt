review/text: I hope the Activator 8585 is available for consumers , since the quality is extremely good.In some respects it is like the SYNCRO models, but most of the functions have been greatly improved. The key change is the loss of the stem that many people have had issues with: virtually all of the key elements are on or in the cleaning base.In choosing the Activator, and the previous one for me, the Syncro 7526, the reason I chose both, was that I have sensitive skin, and yet the hair to be shaved is tough. A blade razer make me look like a Freddy Krueger victim. If you have use the Syncro 7526, and liked it, the activator 8585 is a perfect move.The 7526 gave me well over 2 years of use, and the thing that died on me, and basically caused the shavers demise, was the button. The 8585 has a clearly better button, and even better trimmer blades. The main motors in the 8585 are very quiet.It appears that the 8595 is taking over the 8585 role. I cannot see the difference in the two models. The main reason I got the 8585 is the price and quality. I got the current model 8585 from Target for less than 80 dollars. However, even at the listed Amazon price, this is a great buy
