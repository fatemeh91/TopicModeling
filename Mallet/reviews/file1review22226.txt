review/text: I bought these containers so my husband could take left-overs to work for his lunches. They are PERFECT. I love that they have the divider so you can have 3 separate foods. The size is very nice. Even the smallish sections are an okay size for vegetables or other sides. I'm sure I'll be buying more!
