review/text: After brushing with the Oral B Crossaction for the first time, I immediately noticed how well it cleaned compared to a manual brush. I would say that 30% more plaque was easily removed. And I'm no newbie to electric toothbrushes.. I used the Oral B Sonic Complete for about a year and I can confidently say that this does the same job at a fraction of the price. Also, the fact that it works off 1 AA battery is incredibly convenient. I also like the form factor of the toothbrush itself. It's similar to a manual toothbrush in size and weight and works just like the higher end electric toothbrushes. It really is a bargain at $6.99 (or $6.69 at Wal-Mart)! One of the best features about this toothbrush is the fact that it has a replaceable head. Meaning that you don't need to throw away the whole unit just to get a better cleaning experience. I do have one complaint though.. this little guy makes quite a bit of noise. So brushing late at night when others around are sleeping is a big no no. Other than that this is a pretty awesome toothbrush. I've purchased 3 extra to give to friends as gifts. :DEdit (4/1/2012):I can't believe how long this toothbrush has lasted! I've been using it for 4 years now (changing the brush head regularly of course) and it still works as well as it did on day one. I had previously rated this product at 4/5 stars. However, I now feel obligated to give it a full 5/5. Of course, when operating the toothbrush's volume is louder than I'd like. However, that's a small price to pay in exchange for the exceptional cleaning and build quality that comes with it. Needless to day, I'm impressed!
