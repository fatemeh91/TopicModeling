review/text: This shaver works very well. The only complaint I have had with it is the run time. It has always had to be recharged after about 10 minutes of use since it was brand new. I have owned several other Remington shavers in the past and the battery life was MUCH LONGER than this one. But, Who knows, maybe I just got a bad battery? It is still a good buy and maybe yours will have a better battery life? And, Yes I did fully charge it per directions before the first use.....I have owned this product for 1 year.
