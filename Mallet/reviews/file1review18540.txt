review/text: I bought the fountain pen and rollerball in this finish. It is a beautiful pen with a smooth lacquer finish and feels well balanced in the hand. The converter screws in, which is a plus. The nib looks too small for the size of the pen, however. Writing with the pen is a disappointment. The nib is extremely scratchy and feels like writing with a nail. I sent the pen back to Cross for an adjustment and they lost it. Customer service was horrible. They told me they didn't have time to look for my one pen as they were in their busy season servicing their corporate clients. Some 4 months later after many phone calls and letters they agreed to send me a new pen. It was as scratchy as the first one I received. I've written with them in pen stores to see if my experience was an anomaly, but everyone I've tried is just as scratchy as mine. If you draw a line the nib shrieks like running fingernails across a chalk board. I really want to like this pen, but after my experiences with two of them and Cross' new "customer service" I'll never own another Cross pen. It's a pity because at one time Cross made some of the best pens in the world. I have several of their fountain pens from the 80's and they are wonderful writers. But then again, those pens were made in the USA whereas the new Cross pens are made in China.
