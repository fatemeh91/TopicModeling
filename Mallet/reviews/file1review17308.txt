review/text: i really enjoy this machine, ive only had it for 2 days now, but ive used it quite often..i like the adjustment options on the adjustable head from 0 to 9, mine is a 3 for my mustache and gotee, its also pretty heavy not flimsy plastic feel, you know your holding a piece of machinery in your hands which is good..good grip to it, its quiet too, if you got the wife in the bedroom and your in the masterbath you wont wake her up or annoy her if shes watching tv..i love that it does not take batters it comes with a charger..so that saves me money on buying battries..also when i was trimming it felt like it was not even touching the hairs..but when i removed it from my face and looked down there they were..and my beard was trimmed i was surprised cause it first it seems like its not trimming but it is..so good buy here folks..pick a few up for xmas and be the hero..lol
