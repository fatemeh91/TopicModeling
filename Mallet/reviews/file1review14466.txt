review/text: Please don't waste your money. This product if horrible. This product says 2 bags, it actually means that they're are two bags of product to use in one session. It takes alot of time to use this product. Over 4 hours. You apply the first bag of product and time it, then rinse it, and apply the other bag of henna, time it, and rinse. It claims to cover grey. It only tints it slightly. But you don't read this until you get the product and its in the instructions. Nothing wrong with the seller or their service.
