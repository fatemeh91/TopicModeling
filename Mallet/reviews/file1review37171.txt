review/text: Arthritis isn't even my main problem, though I think it's a factor. I have a (murkily diagnosed) skin condition, or, some kind of condition that particularly manifests in my hands/wrists. It's a daily struggle. About six months ago, things were bad enough that I developed lymphangitis and needed daily intravenous antibiotics for eight days.These very comfortable, form-fitting gloves mainly do two things for me. One: They keep my skin 'still' for a while so my hands are not constantly itching and driving me crazy. I sometimes wear loose plastic gloves over them (food handling gloves), too, to cover them in the kitchen or whatever. Two: They help shrink my skin back to normal. I get a lot of inflammation, all-over, really, but in the hands this causes a lot of splits and cuts -- and then the skin is often left 'baggy.' If I wear these gloves, when I remove them, my hands finally look almost-normal again.Just a note to anyone else like me.... After shrinking my hands back to 'normal,' I find I need to also add some treatment with a cold gel-pak (hot/cold) mitt for the hand(s), to reduce redness and slight burning. But I blame this on my existing condition, not on the gloves.The gloves are definitely improving my condition!Because I had such a bad infection before, I often use various essential oil mixtures (safe and mild ones, and high quality) against germs on the hands. I also use an alcohol-free hand cleaner, and I soak my hands clean at times. Wearing 'tight' gloves -- or any gloves -- could be unhygienic, to problem skin. However, going without gloves is also a bad idea, for the same reason, so.... it's a matter of judgment.I like knowing that, even if my own skin is painful at any time, I can rely on this 'second skin' to get through the day.
