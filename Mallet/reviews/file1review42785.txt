review/text: We leave in Southern California about 15 miles inland from the ocean. We get the ocean breeze along with the heat from the interior valley. This can play havoc on water foundations which we have a total of three.We have tried a lot of products as well as solar aerators.. So far this product has kept the water relatively clean yet not crystal clean. This is fine with us as we have reduced having to change the water to just twice a month. I would sense we can start to add more of the product to see if they helps the water clarity even more. And we may. Yet, we are really pleased to find something that seems to work and is safe for all the wildlife that use the foundations as their water source.
