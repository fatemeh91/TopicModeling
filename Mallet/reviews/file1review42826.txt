review/text: I was suffering from continual relapses after a salmonella infection. Antibiotics got rid of the worst of the symptoms but then I've not been able to take antibiotics since then (for other infections I got). I realized I needed to restore the order in my digestive tract. Taking Primal Defense has definitely helped me to finally start getting healthy, and I've not gotten sick or as sick whenever my kids are sick. I highly recommend it!
