review/text: I have tried all kinds of protein powders and this is hands down the best tasting. It is reasonably priced, comes in a wide variety of flavors and mixes well. From what I have read Optimum Nutrition is considered to be one of the better proteins.All the flavors I have tried, except Vanilla Ice Cream, are full of flavor.
