review/text: My knee went out about 2 months ago & someone had to call the ambulance and in the hospital I didn't get crutches or anything. After most of the swelling went down my knee was still in pain & I couldn't walk that much because it still hurt. When I bout this it helped me alot, even though I stoped using it when it started to get really HOT outside because even in a chilly day you start to sweat with this Knee support pad but over all its GREAT! I recomment it :)
