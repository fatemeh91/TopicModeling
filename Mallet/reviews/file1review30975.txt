review/text: I have been using Osteo Bi-Flex now for 2 or 3 months, sadly over a month ago I noticed I started getting a mild headache every day. Lately my headaches have been getting very bad, I also started feeling like I had a mild case of the flu every day, complete with a low-grade fever.I started looking on-line for side effects related to this product, and I was very surprised that a lot of people reported the headaches etc. I have now stopped using this product, and my headaches and flu like symptoms have went away. I was very pleased with what it did for my knee pain, but the severe headaches and flu like symptoms were not worth continued taking it.
