review/text: A little over three years ago I reveived radiation treatment for prostate cancer. As a side effect, due to the irritation caused by the radiation on my gut and rectum I developed both internal and external hemorrhoids. For the past three years these have been so bad that it takes two to three trips to the bathroom to empty myself enough and alieve the gas enough to safely leave the house.I have tried all the usual ontiments and creams with no real improvement. It was to the point that I figured that surgery was the only way out of this. Then I tried this product.I have only been using this for a week and the results are nothing short of amazing. The external one are gone and the internal ones are getting better.I do reccommend that you order some slip tip 1 ML disposable syringes (no needle) to deliver the product as it will reduce the amount wasted.
