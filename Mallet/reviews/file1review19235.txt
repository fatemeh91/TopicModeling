review/text: I have been taking NV for 3 weeks. For the first week I had so much energy! I skipped my usual 2 cups of coffee in the morning, and 20oz of diet pop in the afternoon...and still, three weeks later, have no need for caffine. Supposedly each pill contains as much caffine as 2 cups of coffee. You only have to take 1 small pill, twice a day - so that's nice. Small pills too! When working out, I have significantly more energy and can go for 90 minutes, 5-6 days a week! There are no adverse side effects at all..not even the jitters that normally come from diet pills. But I did notice that in the 2nd and 3rd weeks, I didn't feel as energized as I did the first week. As far as appetite supression, I can definately tell this is working. I don't need a morning, or afternoon snack at work, and it doesn't take much for me to get full.All this having been said, I haven't lost any weight! I am not overweight to begin with, so that might be why. I am of average weight for my height, and was looking to lose 5-10lbs. I am going to finish the bottle and hope something happens.I have a few friends who are overweight, and have also taken NV and they have been losing weight. Generally 5lbs a week. Hope it happens to me soon!
