review/text: I've suffered from constipation my entire life, that's over 60 years!!! My doctors and gastroentrologist always recommended laxatives and stool softeners, and I took them for a very long time. But I was always frustrated that when I stopped taking the laxatives, I would be constipated within a day or two.Even with a good diet full of fruits & veggies, I would still get constipated. I tried two other colon cleansers and neither one of them even came close to the effectiveness of oxypowder. I was very impresed with the oxypowder cleanse.I haven't taken any oxypowder or laxatives in over a week, and I am still regular. I haven't gone this long without taking something in my entire life.THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! I am so glad that I found oxypowder. I recommend this product to everyone!
