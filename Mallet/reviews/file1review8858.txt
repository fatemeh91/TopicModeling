review/text: Vibrant Health Green Vibrance is an excellent product, priced nicely (compare it to the overpriced Athletic Greens), and with full disclosure label (no proprietary blend nonsense). I've been taking it for weeks now, and past the first day "not so good" taste (before i stored it in the freezer) i got accustomed to it and actually enjoy the taste now. When i run out i will definitely buy some more, as i do feel like taking it has improved (and still is improving) my health and energy levels. I love it! :)
