review/text: This is not a bad product. The only concern I have with it is the cost. I wish it had been in the ten dollar range. I have no idea how long this new foil and cutter block will last. My original foil and cutter block lasted for over four years with an average use of three times a week. Too, Amazon has comparable online prices and ease of shipping and internet securty. To me, company reputation is extremely important.
