review/text: I track my bbt's and just tested positive with this pregnancy test from this company, which was just thrown in for free with my pre-seed order. I am 10 dpo and just had an implantation dip this morning, so it is in fact very early detection for me. Line was faint, let it sit for at least 5 minutes for the pink to all clear, but it was there! Earlier detection than store brands and far, far less expensive. Also, very fast delivery.
