review/text: The principal beneficial ingredient in "Mineral Rich" is 1000mcg of Vitamin B-12 but it is accompanied by significant amounts of over 1/2 dozen important minerals as well. The pleasant tasting liquid can be mixed with juice or water. I then use that to take several other supplements that I use.My 89 year old mother and I have been taking Mineral Rich for years. The benefits are too numerous to itemize here and the quality of the product is remarkably high. The addition of the ALoe Vera only improved the product.Also, we've had a good relationship with Swanson (via Amazon) for over 1 1/2 years now. The one mistake they made (an item was omitted from our order) was corrected in a few days quite satisfactorily. We recommend this product, and this seller, very highly.
