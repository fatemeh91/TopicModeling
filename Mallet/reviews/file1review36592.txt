review/text: I have to wear a brace on my left ankle whenever I walk outside because many ankle sprains have weakened my ligaments permanently.I have tried every rigid ankle brace out there and the tarsal lok is the best. It's light, takes up the least space in shoes, fits comfortably yet does the job of keeping my ankle from twisting.It's kept me sprain-free for years much more comfortably than any other.
