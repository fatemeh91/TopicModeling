review/text: I'm a health lodge officer (EMT) for a scout camp. I was looking for an economical splint for my personal trauma bag. This one fits the bill nicely. It comes rolled, so it is compact in my bag, which is critical because space is limited. I shopped all over the Internet and this was the best deal.
