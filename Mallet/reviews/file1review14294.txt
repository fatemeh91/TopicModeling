review/text: I had the same experience as CraigF with 2 different units. It didn't clean well at all, maybe it's because we have a plastic tub surround. Doesn't even touch the tub itself. Also both units failed after about 2-3 months, just quit spraying. The company itself replaced the first one, then the second did the same thing. Finally asked for and got my $25 back.Bob
