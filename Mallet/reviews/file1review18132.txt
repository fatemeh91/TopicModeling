review/text: When I bought them I was hesitant and afraid they would be uncomfortable, but I absolutely love them, they are soft and comfortable. I sleep on my side but they comform to your face so that you can't even feel them while the light if blocked out! I am thinking of buying a second pair. I love them!Update: I am very sad after only four months, my mask started staining my pillowcases. I bought the "raspberry" color which was the only one they had at the time I bought it. I have washed my pillowcases which were rather expenssive,about $30.00 and the color will not come off. I wrote an email to the company and I was told "they do extensive testing and the color does not transfer", so what does that mean? That I am lying?, I have the mask and the pillowcases to prove it!. The important thing here is that their customer service is terrible, and if you should have a problem, it is yours alone!!! I do not know if other colors transfer too, but beware!!!
