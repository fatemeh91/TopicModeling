review/text: A lot of negative reviews due to recommended dosage. I only take two a day (in the morning) and it's all I really need. I think I started with 4 a day and that's not a bad idea because it'll get into your system and start working quicker. Amazon has great prices for this, almost half off retail. I have a tendency to get sluggish, moody and feel like I have a touch of the flu several times a year. This vitamin (combined with exercise and diet) has virtually eliminated this problem. I chalk it up to hormone issues. This really balances me out. I'm so glad I found it.
