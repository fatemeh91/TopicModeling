review/text: Like most others, I fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years, I had to buy the latest, greatest design in razors. With each new design, the blades got more and more expensive until I realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money. About a year ago, I bought a Merkur safey razor and have not regretted it. I believe it will last forever and the cost of the blades will save me a bundle. If you are a newbie to this type of razor, you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique. Then, enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket.
