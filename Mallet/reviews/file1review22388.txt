review/text: I haven't experienced any problems like the other customers. I've been using 2 light blue covers now for 21 months and they've haven't shrunk and still look the same. They're not as soft and fluffy as they were brand new but that's to be expected. I've never had a problem with the straps since they are underneath the pad and wrap up and around. I have the Simmons changing pad so maybe that's the difference? I like how they have a large color selection making it easier to cordinate with your nursery colors.
