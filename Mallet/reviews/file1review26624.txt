review/text: this thing works great! i have it in a pc chair under a sheepskin car seat cover, i have a gel/water cushion under rear and this on back of seat i found it works best and is most comfortable when its nearly flat, maybe 1 good breath inside, like this it provides support and suspension, inflated to full its too thick and bows my back, i can sit literally all day comfortably, it has been under the seat cover well over a month and none zero leakage issues at all, i think people who complains it leaks got a bad unit or overinflated it and weigh 300 lbs and sitting on it, for the price this is the bomb for lumbar comfort and i recommend it highly
