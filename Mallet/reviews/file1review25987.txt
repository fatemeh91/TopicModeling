review/text: This mask is wonderful. I doubt there is another one like it anywhere. It is super comfortable as it is adjustable, and is smooth and soft against your skin.It feels like being given a gentle hug around the head.As soon as you put it on,it causes you you to relax.The nice thing about it is you don't even need to close your eyes to experience total darkness. It is nice for sleeping, but also is wonderful to listen to some relaxing music while wearing, and help encourage you to experience your rich inner world.It might be used while enjoying the sounds around you, but also comes with earplugs if you want to use them for relaxing or sleeping. This would be a nice gift.
