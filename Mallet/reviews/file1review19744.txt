review/text: This seat is worth the money, particularly for little boys who need a decent splashguard. I purchased cheaper seats that were two piece construction with minimal guards that were a nightmare to use. With two piece construction, urine often would find its way between the two pieces creating a horrible mess. With this seat that is not an issue and it's easy to clean. With potty seats you get what you pay for. Pay the extra $10 for this seat and you'll have a high quality, durable seat that is easy for your little man to use.
