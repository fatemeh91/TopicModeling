review/text: I've gone through 3 of these boxes in the last 5-6 years. I absolutely love them! If you've got kids, or just multiple people sick in the house, it's an excellent product with no fuss. The accuracy of these thermometers are spot on (no pun intended).I was first introduced to them by my health care provider, who uses them extensively in their clinics and hospitals. My sister is an RN and she's tested them multiple times for accuracy against rectal thermometer readings. She says they are consistently within 0.2 degrees of the rectal readings. I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone.Also, the seller I ordered through was KCK Industries. My order was placed on the morning of the 13th, and I received the product on the morning of the 16th. Five stars for them as well.
