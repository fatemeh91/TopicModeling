review/text: This item is very handy. Images are not distorted and the optics are clear and easily legible. I would purchase this item again. The fact that it is not made of glass is a plus as this material, when made properly, is not subject to chipping or cracking. You get what you pay for, as the cheaper versions can have severe distortion and are unpleasant to use.
