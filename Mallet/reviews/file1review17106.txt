review/text: I purchased this beard trimmer because I wanted something with more adjustability than most beard trimmers. The unfortunate part is that if you press the trimmer firmly against your face when you shave like I do, then settings 1-3 will be the same. They will be a setting 1 - the closest. Reason for this is the guard is very flexible and doesn't hold the 2nd and 3rd settings very well. Overall I do not like the weight, I think it is too heavy for what it is. I prefer the weighting of my Norelco G370 and this is still the best all 'round beard trimmer for my money.
