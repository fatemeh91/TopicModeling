review/text: We tried the swivel seats. I never felt like I got my child clean, nor did he appreciate being shoved into something so hard. My son LOVED this tub! He liked the idea of being in the &quot;grown-up&quot; tub but was snuggled in his own tub. The bottom blows up and provides cushioned comfort. The sides are poofy enough and squishy enough to have fun in, without damaging body parts on the hard tub. It's quite portable too, and great for travelling. I would say that blowing it up every bathtime would not be fun, however.We used this until our son was 30 months. He enjoyed lying on his stomach and sticking his legs and arms over the edges. It was extremely easy to clean (just wipe down with a cleaning cloth), and the vinyl is quite thick and textured (to help prevent slippage). We'd tip the tub upright to completely dry it out.We had to purchase 2 of these because a seam blew out on the first one after 2 months. The second one lasted much longer. The best feature is the water savings--it takes much less to fill it than the regular tub.
