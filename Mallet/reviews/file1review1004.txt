review/text: After struggling to keep up with my 5 month old (baby #3) I was up to giving her at least 10 oz. of formula a day because I just didn't produce like I did for the other 2.I was up to 9 Domperidones and 9 fenugreek + about 4+ blessed thistle a day and STILL had supply issues. And, I smelled like an Indian grocery store and had constant heartburn from the pills getting stuck in my chest.I tried the nursing tea in the past and it helped a bit, but tasted like dirt, was inconvenient and to be honest I think 50% of its effectiveness comes from making sure that you are properly hydrated because you are constantly drinking it!Anyway, fast forward, I finally broke down and bought the MMP liquid. Yes, it's expensive and yes it's inconvenient to take 20 minutes before or after water, but it totally works. My supply after the 1st day was up at least 40%. Even my mom, when she saw the bottles I had pumped asked "whoa, what did you do??"To me, it's worth the price, even if it is kind of nasty tasting.
