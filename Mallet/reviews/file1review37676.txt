review/text: I was very pleased with the performance of this particular Mitchum deodorant. It feels fresh and lasts all day. My main dislike with deodorants and anti-perspirants is that they feel uncomfortable. This one however, doesn't even feel like it's on, which is the way it should be. I would definitely recommend it for any man.
