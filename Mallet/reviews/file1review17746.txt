review/text: This trimmer charges quickly (in about 4 hours), works over a week on a charge. Great trimming performance, trimmer comb has positive stops (won't move unintentionally under pressure). Ergonomic design, very easy to hold - and to hold at the correct angle. The product information states that the cutting blade never dulls - thus far I agree (after over a year of almost daily use). Easy to clean. Fairly solid construction, quality materials. I would prefer some kind of indicator for the remaining charge level, since it just goes from normal cutting speed to near stall in seconds (that is a feature of the battery technology used). The charger is small and light weight, easy to pack or travel.
