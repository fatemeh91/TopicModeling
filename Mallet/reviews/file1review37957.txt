review/text: I use this brace not for carpal tunnel but to support a wrist weakened by overwork on the computer. It's great both for when I work on a computer and for when I do yardwork. The metal insert can be removed, and my spouse also straightened (with a hammer) the metal insert so that it was optimally comfortable for my wrist.This is a durable product that can be machine washed, regular cycle on cold /air dried (remove the metal insert before machine washing).
