review/text: I am 5'9, thin boned with big hips and when I was in my Junior year of high school I weighed 170 pounds. Senior year I started working out and got my weight down to 145 pounds. I graduated in 2003 and still weigh the same, but have never been able to get down to my goal weight of 135.I decided to try these out, even though I cannot stand sara-nicole smith in the commercials. I had tried one other product that turned out to be pure caffine pills and I was jittery and irratable with them and stopped immediatly when I realized it was those pills causing the promblem.With trim spa I am only taking 2 pills a day and drinking 16 ounces of water directly afterwords. I take these in the morning and by the after noon when I do my workout I have enough energy to make it all they way through, which latley has been saying a lot for me. But I am not jittery and I am sleeping soundly through the night.For the week I have been taking these I have already lost 1/2 pound, since seeing have been at a dead stand still for the last 4 years is great for me. And I also know that it is not water weight I am loosing because I am drinking more water now then I ever have.I do still have the same appitite that I had before, but I have never been a big eater. So this is not a problem for me.~Slj84~
