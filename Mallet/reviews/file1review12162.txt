review/text: After having my baby I wanted to continue prenatal supplements because I felt so healthy on them! These got great reviews so I decided to try them, but IMMEDIATELY gave me horrible skin!! I'm 30, have combination skin, and occasionally get little break outs but nothing major. After three days of vitamins my skin is completely broken out despite continuing my normal skin routine with Murad salicylic wash. What a nightmare!
