review/text: I bought one of these 3 years ago and it finally died. I love it so much I bought another. The emjoi is the only thing i used to remove leg and underarm hair, so i'd say 3 years is a good lifespan.It DOES hurt a little at first. I had gone a few months without using it after it died, and when i first used my new one it did hurt a bit. However, it my underarms were completely smooth for 9 days before any signs of hair regrowth, AND the hair is thinner and blonder (i have thick dark hair, normally.) I know a lot of people say these things cant make hair grow back thinner, but mine always does. If i shave with a razor, the hair comes back black and thick. When i use the emjoi on my legs it takes about 2 weeks to grow back, and it doesnt seem to hurt as much on legs the first time. The trick is to hold the skin taught.also- if youre going to use it on your underarms, you should do so at night, or at a time where you will not need to apply deodorant soon after. If you try to put it on right after removing your hair, its going to sting A LOT. i put deodorant on before if i have to do it in the morning, and then use it to remove the hair. You also should be careful not to apply lotion right after using the emjoi. sort of like not using salt scrubs if youve just shaved (you probably shouldnt do that, either, lol.)I recommend this product to EVERYONE. i've told all my relatives and friends to get one. it beats having to buy razors and shaving cream and shave all the time... AND its $30 cheaper on amazon than anywhere else!
