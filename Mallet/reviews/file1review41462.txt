review/text: Years ago, I went to a foot doctor for foot pain and he recommended professional orthodics. I took him up on his offer and paid some $400 for a customized set ($200 w/insurance). They were great, but when they wore out, I went to get more but my insurance no longer covered orthodics, so I decided to find an alternative. For $20 I tried Walkfit and to my delight and amazement, they were fantastic. Worth every penny.
