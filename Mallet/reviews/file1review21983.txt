review/text: Salt tablets used to be available at most pharmacies. That is no longer the case. Now that they are made by only a few companies, the customer who really needs this product is being grossly taken advantage of.I am using salt for the salt/vitamin C protocol for Lyme disease and came up with a much more economical solution.You can buy your own PURE sea salt for a few dollars a pound (there are approx 6 grams of salt per teaspoon). Personally, I don't like drinking salted water, so I have started encapsulating it at home. I use "The Capsule Machine" Size 00, which costs about 15 dollars and is very easy to use. Gelatin capsules are readily available online (larger quantities are more economical). After the initial cost of the capsule machine, my total cost for 5000 capsules is $70.00 (about $14.00 for every 1000 capsules of approx 1 gram each). Smaller quantities might cost more (about $20.00 per 1000), but would still be significantly less than the salt tablets.Don't throw away your money - a very small investment can save you hundreds of dollars.
