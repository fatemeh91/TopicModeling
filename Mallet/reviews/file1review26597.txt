review/text: UPDATE: 10/3 1 DAY PAST RETURN & IT WILL NO LONGER HOLD AIR!! This lumbar support cushion is tremendous. I am having a lot of problems with my back and currently in a rehab program. After examining the recliner I use all the time I realized that the support just wasn't the way it should be so I ordered this product. It has made a world of difference in how my back feels when sitting in the recliner. It also makes my car seat feel a lot better, so I have ordered another one to just leave in the car. When I showed the product to my physical therapist she was also pleased with it.UPDATE: 11/30 I now have two back boosters that will not stay inflated. I can't afford to buy a new one every 3-4 weeks. I am now looking at different back supports to buy. Too bad that they don't last because they really feel tremendous when inflated.
