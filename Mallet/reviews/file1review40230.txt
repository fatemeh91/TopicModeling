review/text: I wish I did this a decade ago. I love the 8oz tube. Grew up in a big family; seemed like there was never ample tooth paste. These big tubes come in 6. I store them in the top shelf of the cupboard. I LOVE not worrying about TP. No more expensive, little tubes and no more cutting them open with scissors to scrape the last bit out! Wish AMZN was around when I was a kid.
