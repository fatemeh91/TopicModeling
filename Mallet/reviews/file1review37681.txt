review/text: This Mitchum Deodorant is a high quality product. We usually don't buy unscented, but this product surprised us! It's very smooth and soft, and really is unscented! No smell at all! It does a great job too. It kept me clean and fresh all day. My husband used it too, and was surprisingly pleased with the product as well. As with most solids, there's a white residue, but that was expected. I'd definitely buy this great product again!!
