review/text: The magic of this particular garlic is in part that it is encapsulated in a superior one of those 'rubber footballs' which must somehow be part of making this work properly. It is easy to swallow...it only has a minimal garlic odor in the bottle...AND it does not 'come back up' so you taste it all day. Much better than any other that I have tried, we love it, and I buy it for us on a consistent repeat basis.
