review/text: I have a history of hypertension and I found recently that my blood pressure had risen again in spite of a better diet and weight loss. I decided to buy this monitor to check the effect of other changes to my diet on my blood pressure in between doctor visits. This monitor was very easy to use and accurate. I make a check of my blood pressure daily and am very satisfied with the results. The unit itself arrived quickly and with no problems. The only thing I would recommend is for the user to measure his or her own bicep. If it's between 13 and 16 inches, you may need to order the Large Adult Arm Cuff. (The Standard cuff is the one included.)
