review/text: I just recently lost my pair of Tweezerman Slant tweezers this past week after having them for about 15 years. These things are the best. I would dare somebody to try and take them from me! Haha I was upset to learn that I no longer had them as I looked everywhere for days. It's possible somebody took them as I had them with me at work (don't ask). Either way, I am ordering another pair in hopes that I will have them for many years to come. Definitely a great purchase and worth the money! Generic tweezers just don't stand up to these!!! Take it from a woman who plucks her eyebrows on a regular basis.
