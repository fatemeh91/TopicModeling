review/text: im one of those people that NEEDS my sleep, but im also one of those people who is very sensitive to sleep disturbance. Lets say my sleep pattern is 10 pm every night well if I go to bed at 1 am on a weekend because im out late well then my sleep pattern is thrown out of wack and I have a hard time falling asleep the next few nights, my mind races and I get frustrated just laying there. So needless to say when I travel out of country im pretty sleep deprived for awhile! Well not with these pills, they do take 3 days to work really effectively but they DO work, they calm my mind and allow me to really relax and I just fall asleep and STAY asleep, I dont wake up at 3:30 am wide awake (which im usually prone to) but best of all for me once im on a great sleep balance I dont have to take the pills until I mess up my sleep pattern again, these would be great for those who work crazy shifts and cant really have a regular sleep pattern. Oh also and a tip I noticed another reviewer mentioned nightmares. I find when I take supplements and end up with nightmares I just stop taking it for 1 week and then start up again and I no longer get the nightmares.
