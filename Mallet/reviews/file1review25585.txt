review/text: I brought it for myself due to it was under the gold box sale, and the prior grooming object was barbaric and hurt from pulling the nasal hair. This doesn't pull the hair. It cuts the hair no pain involved at all I was so impressed with it. I bought 2 more for family members. it is awesome and only one battery and it can be immerse in water. Now I look forward to my hair growing :) and knowing I will look my best
