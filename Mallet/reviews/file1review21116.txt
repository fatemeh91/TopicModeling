review/text: I suffer from chronic back pain and I have used this Thermophore heating Pad before, but it belonged to my sister. Recently my wife has come down with back problems so I purchased a pad from the drug store, for about $39.00, that claim to do the same thing as the Thermophore. What a mistate! A total waste of money. So I went and ordered the Thermophore online, the same one my sister owns and my wife and I love it. It is the best moist heating pad I have ever used.
