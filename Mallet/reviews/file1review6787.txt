review/text: I bought the Body Back Buddy after seeing a friend's. In August I woke up to my left hand "frozen". I was unable to move it for a few minutes and even after that it was stiff. I decided to see a chiropracter. After about 10 visits where she did pressure points my hand was better. Unable to afford regular visits, I was looking for something to help me that I could use myself. The Body Back Buddy is it. I find that if I use it once or twice a day, my fingers loosen up. It is amazing. Who would know that the muscles in my neck and shoulders control my hands and fingers. I will keep using this.
