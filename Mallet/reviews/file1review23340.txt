review/text: I have been using this product for many years. It is like an old friend. I have always suspected that this is the same as the exfoliating soap bar but in a different shape.Ether way it lathers well and leaves a light sent of Bay Rum that she has to think if it is really there. The residual does not clog up the razor. And of course I use it in one of my official Burt's Bees shaving mug. I suggest you keep another bar handy so you will not be surprised with an empty mug.
