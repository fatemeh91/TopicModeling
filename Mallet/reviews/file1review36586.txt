review/text: I'm an advanced tennis player with floppy ankles due to many former injuries. These ankle braces are great. I have this style with the external figure-8, and also the internal figure 8 braces. I use the external for serious matches because they feel a bit more supportive and I can control the placement of the straps more easily. This external also has the additional top flap which adds more support and also covers the laces which tend to flop around. It also keeps the vecro from sticking to sweatpants.The internal figure 8 does not have the top strap, so you have to tuck the laces into your socks to keep them from coming undone or flopping around in an annoying way. The internal figure 8 also tends to knot and tighten up which makes it harder to get on and off sometimes. But I like the internal straps for informal matches or practice since they're a bit lighter weight. I alternate between to the two styles so that I have a pair drying while I wear the other.Great product.
