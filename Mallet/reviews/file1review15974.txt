review/text: I have owned this breathalyer for 1 year exactly, and it's time for me to buy the replacement calibrated sensor. I find it to be very, very reliable and consistent. I trust it completely, and it has prompted me to call a cab for a ride home rather than driving on a couple of occasions in the last year.
