review/text: I put this on my registry, but after setting it up on our changing table, I realized it was not what I wanted. It's much larger than I thought from the picture. It took up a lot of space, and I didn't have enough misc. items to fill it up. Everything was sagging. I tried to put wipes at the top, but they just slid to the front. We folded it up after a month and haven't tried to use it since.
