review/text: I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed at the taste and the "thinness" of its taste. I thought that the protein level would be higher and in this way it would be healthier while limiting calories. Having to limit food intake to just on source does make it easy to diet but for me I needed a variety and some pleasure from chewing. Carrots looked really good to me in the end of the first week. I did manage to loose a pound but on week two I went on Weight Watchers and found it more filling and easy to follow and I lost mega pounds.
