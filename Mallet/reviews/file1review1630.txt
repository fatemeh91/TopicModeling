review/text: I have been trying this on three different flat warts about 4-5 days a week for the past few weeks. I put a good glob on there and cover it with just the sticky part of a bandaid. After the first day a thick layer came off, which was encouraging, but since then I don't really notice them getting smaller although each morning when I remove the bandaid it is white so I guess that means it's trying. I haven't found anything yet to make flat warts go away completely- if and when I do I will let the whole world know!!
