review/text: This is a pretty basic well made squeegee. About a one foot wood handle. The sponge scrubbing area does have a tougher section covered with some kind of nylon mesh that's good for stuff that needs some extra scrubbing. The rubber blade is thick and durable. I washed my outside windows in record time! Now maybe they'll get washed more often than once every year or so...
