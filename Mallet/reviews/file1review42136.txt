review/text: This product has nearly 101 uses! Personally, I use it as a toner for my face! We use it to treat scrapes and other boo-boos. We also use it for the intended purpose and it works wonderfuly, even on basic toilet paper- no need to purchase wipes which can irritate the diaper area even more. Since switching to this product, we've no longer had to use diaper creams or powders. I recommend all California Baby products, and the prices offered for the multi-packs here on amazon.com or amazing!
