review/text: I read the two negative reviews and it appears that these reviewers have not tried the product, but are relying on their superior intellect to suggest that others are less mentally competent if they do try it. Additionally, comments about the quantity of materials that go into making up the Oscillococcinum indicate that they have little knowledge about homeopathics and how they are produced. In my understanding, you are being treated by the super-diluted essence of the material, rather than by the material itself.On the other hand, the positve reviews seem to be coming from people who have actually TRIED the product and have received positive results. Try a product before you review it? Gosh, what a novel idea!Personnally, I have tried the product several times, am very pleased with the results. By the way, I also take a flu shot every year, but these shots are usually trivalent, meaning that they only protect you against the three, global influenzas most common at the time of manufacture.
