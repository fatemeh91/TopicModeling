review/text: I've been taking this for about a year. No tummy upset as long as I eat a couple bites of something before I take it. I hate fish and all seafood in general - these have no fish oil so they are great for me personally. I'm not sure if these omega's are the reason, but since I've been taking them, my HDL and LDL numbers have both improved.
