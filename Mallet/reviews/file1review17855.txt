review/text: That is in my opinion and both my little ones also. I have a 19 month old who nursed for 12 months and I supplemented this formula for her from 6 months up to 18 months. My littlest one, 3 months, is also nursing and refuses to drink the Similac. He has no complaints with this formula though!! Fills his little tummy through the night, no spitups or gas. He does get constipated here and there when he consumes more formula than breastmilk, but I'm told that is normal with babies switching back between breast and bottles w/ formula. Nothing a little Karo Syrup doesn't take care of (not to mention he loves the syrup mixed w/ the Enfamil...it's like candy in a bottle!). Thank you Enfamil!!
