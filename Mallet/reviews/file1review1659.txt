review/text: I learned about Bragg Liquid Aminos from my daughter, a fitness expert. Always wanting to limit sodium and additives, she is a big fan of this product. So, I bought a bottle at my local health food store and have been very impressed!PROS:Very tasty, especially when I substitute Bragg for soy sauce in my Mongolian Beef dish.Has become readily available in grocery stores.... this should eventually help the cost factor.Much lower in sodium content than soy sauce...all natural protein made from soybeans and distilled water. **NOTE: You can always put Bragg Liquid Aminos in a spray bottle, dilute with a bit of distilled water, and spritz your food like you would salad dressing or butter products... Get the taste without the sodium.**CONS:A bit pricy compared to soy sauceI think it has a saltier taste than soy sauce; however, I have decided a little goes a longer way than actual soy sauce. See NOTE above.Overall, I will not buy soy sauce again because of the sodium content and preservatives. I did take away a STAR for the cost.
