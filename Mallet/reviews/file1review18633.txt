After going through a series of plastic units from the local big-box store, then something from Oreck that looks like a cheaper version of this Hoover, we decided to 'go commercial'. What a difference! This vac is small but very powerful. It is light enough to carry on your shoulder or you can pull it around on the floor. The hose and tools are very heavy-duty and the tools lock on the hose so you don't have the old frustration of tools and hose coming apart. The cloth bag is reusable so there is no additional expense, altho you can get a replacement bag on Amazon so you can keep one clean for standby, just throw the emptied dirty one in the washer. No Dyson sci-fi twists to this vacuum, no ground-effect levitation or Italian styling - just a good and durable little vacuum. I see why the local maid services only uses these vacuums for all their residential work. Now if I could just afford a maid...
