review/text: I feel like the immune-boosting product has helped me. I've got a preschool aged daughter who is a "thumbsucker"and it seems like we get a cold every month. Trying to break the "insert thumb, insert germs" habit with her!I don't however, like that you are supposed to take 6 capsules every 3 hours when you feel unwell. Not very economical!!!
