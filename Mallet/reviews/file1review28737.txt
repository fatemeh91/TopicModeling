review/text: I actually served up a serving of the banana cream with a real banana and half a mango, and some crushed ice. It tasted great! The only thing that could have been better was adding in some ice cream... I like the results of the ON Whey because of the Aminos they add in their recipe. I feel recovered faster of good workouts and getting great results.
