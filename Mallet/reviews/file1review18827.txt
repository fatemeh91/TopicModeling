review/text: I suffer from neuropathy which I know can be helped by B vitamins. So I tried Mineral Rich - it definitely has helped my symptoms. I have to say though, I would only take 1/2 of the dosage they recommend as it is very strong and can be a little rough on the stomach so definitely follow up with a glass of water after taking it. Very good product and a good source of Vitamin B-12.
