review/text: Although this is the first whey protein powder I have tried, it seems to be of fairly high quality, from the description and the very helpful reviews of the other customers who bought this product. I don't think anybody would be buying this product with the intention of buying the best chocolate mix; they would be getting it for its protein offering which is very good. It is "instantized" powder, so should dissolve easily in skim water or milk+water combination. I will say that it is better you have a shake cup which makes mixing far more easier and faster than trying to stir with a spoon.
