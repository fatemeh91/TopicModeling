review/text: 1st Of all when this bracelet arrived the case was jammed shut as if someone stepped on the box before sending it out for delivery. I literally hurt myself trying to pry it open. a couple of tools later I was taken back by the cheesy bronzy gold look. The bracelet looked extremely cheap. After I got over that I decided to try it on. Errrrr! Not so fast the clasp would not open. Thankfully I had tools so I finally got it on. I was gonna try to work with it. Then time came to take it off. I had to enlist my husband and he struggled to pry the clasp open for me. Enough was enough, I had to send it back.
