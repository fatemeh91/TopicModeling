review/text: This pad fits the Davinci changing table/dresser with just a small gap around it. It's thick and doesn't seem like it will tear easily. The original thin pad that came with the changing table ripped almost immediately. Although this was a little pricey, I would recommend it. Altogether, I've been happy with this changer pad.
