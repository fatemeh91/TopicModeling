review/text: It's not always easy to get a smooth shave, but these blades work well. They provide the cleanest smoothest shave I have ever had. Better than the single blade and even 3 blade razors I have tried. You can get a smooth shave from fewer blades, but they tend to cut the skin more - at least in my case. I recommend these blades.
