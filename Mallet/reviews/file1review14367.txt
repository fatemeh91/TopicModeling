review/text: I bought this vinyl sheet to cover my new mattress from a dog w/ a peeing problem. It has just arrived so I cannot review its durability. Also, as some other reviewers have noted, it does not smell strongly of plastic and that is a plus. It is ALMOST as described. It is the correct color and size as described by the seller. HOWEVER, I ordered a California Queen, as I do not have a regular queen size mattress. The product on Amazon's website is described as being 9 inches deep and this is correct however the sheet does not completely cover my mattress because as described, it is only 9 inches deep. Why have an option for a california queen or a california king if the deepness is the same as a regular king or queen? Save your money and order the regular size or spend a bit more and get a REAL vinyl california king/queen mattress cover.
