review/text: vitamin shoppe phylllium husk powder is the best i've tried. no extra crap added...and it's finely milled so it mixes well into alot of things. i've added it to smoothies, soups, yogurt, juice. i used meal replacement shakes and they weren't filling enough for me....adding 1-2 teaspoons of the psyllium husk powder really made the difference. it's made it alot easier for me to sneak extra fiber in where i need it.
