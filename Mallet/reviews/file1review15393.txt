review/text: I should start by saying that I was primarily looking for a healthier caffeine alternative that would serve 2 needs:1) provide the boost I had been getting from diet soda2) Not have all of the sodium and artificial flavorings that are in soda3) Costs a lot less than soda per mg of caffeineWhen I found this product, I was pleased to find that not only did it meet those needs, but also included green tea extract - a great added bonus to have the anti-oxidants in addition to not having all of the bad stuff I was drinking in the diet soda. I currently take one of these with a can of Mountain Zevia (an alternative diet soda with no sodium, and flavored with stevia, a natural leaf). The two together provide about 110mg of caffeine, which is about perfect for me to feel alert. 2-3 a day keeps me feeling sharp and awake all day, without any jittery feeling or crash one might get from coffee.I cannot speak in any way about the purported weight loss/maintenance claims of this product, as I wasn't really looking for it to fulfill that purpose. If I end up losing some fat, that would be very welcome, but it isn't really the reason I bought the product.
