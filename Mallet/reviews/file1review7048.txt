review/text: This is a very good electric razor. But I have a very thick beard and sharp jawline....I am also trying to go electric from expensive blades..... the transition has taken a few weeks for the upper part of my face.... but is not working at all for my neck...... If you are in this boat ....you may need to purchase a more expensive razor to get the job done otherwise......... it is truly great for the money....
