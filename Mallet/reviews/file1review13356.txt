review/text: I purchased this pad for my 82 year old mother who has incontinence. I love it because it is large and the feel of the fabric is nice. I'm picky and I've found that this works great and washes nicely. I've previously purchased a velvet chair pad for her lift chair, that was a Priva product as well, and I found that this worked great too. Based on the two products that I purchased I've found that the Priva brand products are quality made and I highly recommend them.
