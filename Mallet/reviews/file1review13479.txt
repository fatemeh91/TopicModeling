review/text: I was so excited to receive the Caldrea Basil Blue Sage Stainless Steel Spray in the mail. Of course, the first thing I did upon delivery was to try it out on my stainless steel refrigerator (the very reason I bought the product). Like most facial products I invested in, this product will join their company in the back of cabinets. After the first use, like all the other similar products I have tested, my refrigerator was left with film and smears. Even though I worked it in and tried "polishing" the stainless steel, I was left disappointed and frustrated. I have recently learned that the best way to maintain beauty and shine for stainless steel appliances is by cleansing the surface with a mild dishwashing detergent and then using extra virgin olive oil to protect and polish the stainless steel. The results are better than any products I have come across. The seller is dependable; the product was disappointing. I hope this is helpful.
