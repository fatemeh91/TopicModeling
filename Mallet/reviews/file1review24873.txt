review/text: Im very confused right now. I got this product about 3 weeks ago. And around second week got cramps. Was very excited for my periods are non existant and im 21yrs old. I use to have normal periods but went swimming and they stopped. They stopped for five years until i drank parsley tea then they came for a while then stopped. Until i took vitex and they came last year 2011 before they stopped again in Dec. Havent had one since. But then FERTILAID! it has given me cramps for a week and 1/2. But now they stopped!!!! I didnt get a period just cramps and yesterday 1/17/12 the cramps stoped. Im still taking pills because they gave me cramps but now nothing..im hopeful they just need time to get into system.Even though they habent worked yet the syill did SOMETHING so im happy and would recommend them to anyone. Doing something is better than nothing in my book.Has anyone.elsebhad this problem?
