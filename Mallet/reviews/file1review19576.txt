review/text: We used this toilet for our son after he potty trained in a little potty (which was a huge mess to clean b/c it has so many grids underneath where I discovered pee would "pool" and smelled so bad! Anyway, we first tried the Elmo potty attachment, very cute cheap plastic, used it once but would fit/ even sit at all on our elongated toilet. This one adjusts, and it fit perfectly. We are now in a new place, with different shaped toilets, and it still fits well.Been researching a new potty attachment to buy since his little brother trained up from an Ikea ($3.99!) bowl shaped potty, but would like to move to the next level. Lil brother will not sit on this! So we bought a "Cars2" one and b-4 opening it, decided it wasn't a good product, and also found bad reviews on it. So my husbands brilliant plan now is to cover the bear circle on this product with an awesome circle Cars2 sticker, and trick our son...hope it works. :)
