review/text: The razor cuts, and I appreciate that the guides are built in (and therefore, not lost), but the battery trumps all. I use it only once or twice each week and it cannot hold a charge between shavings. Since you can only use it from battery, you have to plan ahead and start charging it several hours before you plan to use it. Probably fine if you shave daily, or if you don't mind leaving it plugged in all the time, but nearly useless for my less frequent uses.
