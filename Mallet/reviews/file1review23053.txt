review/text: I saw many good reviews from the other buyers before ordering it, but I was so disappointed. As I held it in my hand to try it for the first time, it was noisy and inflexible for operation--it was just like a funny toy for kids. The performance was no better than a regular broom that can really clean every corner. I returned it the next day!
