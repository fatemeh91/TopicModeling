review/text: Soft enough to place on top of the fitted sheet, urine does not seep through. Easy to wash, air dry during the day and it is ready again at bed time. Happy with the first one, we bought another just in case... Size is perfect for a twin size bed, our daughter moves a lot at night and we haven't had any problems so far (after 2 months). Highly recommend.
