review/text: I don't know what it is, but taking this product makes me feel horrible. My mouth dries out, my chest feels like I've drank concrete, and my joints and muscles pang with soreness. This is the third meal replacement I've tried and I've not experienced anything like this before. Other MRs leave me feeling great. This one makes me feel like crap. Even hours after drinking half a shake, I still feel a dry dull pain in my chest, neck, abdomen, and legs. This is the second day trying this product and I don't plan to do a third. Unfortunately I've already shelled out for this container.Also the advertising statements are wrong. This container does not provide 60 servings but only 30. The advertising statement says "30 Day Supply For Weight Loss (twice a day), 60 Day Supply For Weight Maintenance (once a day)." That's completely false. One shake is two scoops (25g), the container is 750g, that's 30 shakes, not 60!Also the other MRs I've tried do not require you to add other foods to provide full nutrition. It's certainly not a very convenient option if I need to keep going to the store and refrigerate fruit to make a full meal. Other MRs provide you with full nutrition and don't need you to go prepare something else with it. That defeats a big purpose of meal replacement -- convenience.Finally, the shake tastes the worst of those I've tried; it has a chalky, gritty, dusty consistency and aftertaste that never goes away. I can't imagine the other flavors are any better. You can't cover up a cruddy sludgy taste like this.
