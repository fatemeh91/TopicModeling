review/text: I bought two of these for potty training my son since I was NOT cleaning out a typical potty. This potty seat did the trick for both of us! My son was absolutely comfortable sitting on a regular sized potty with this seat and I had no messes to clean up after every bathroom trip. It fits nicely into our current toilet seats and adjusts easily to other seats when we travel. Six months later, my son is comfortable enough with regular toilets not to use this seat. I would absolutely buy this again or give it as a gift.
