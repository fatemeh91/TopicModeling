review/text: I have been taking prenatal vitamins for the last 6 years. I have had prescription vitamins, generic brand vitamins, and everything in between. These are the best, by far. These prenatal vitamins make me feel good. I don't have issues with irregularity with these vitamins, either, which is a plus. These vitamins make me feel more energetic and more healthy. I love them! I won't be taking anything else.
