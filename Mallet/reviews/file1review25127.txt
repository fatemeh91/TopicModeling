review/text: Having had a few surgeries that made self-wiping difficult to say the least, I find this is the best I could find anywhere. I can't believe with all the back surgeries or other types that make it impossible to take care of this necessary function that someone has not come up with something even better. This one takes a little getting use to and would not work for someone whose hands are crippled with arthritis with regard to pushing the button to release the tissue. Fortunately I do not have that problem. As for the directions for releasing the toilet paper or wet wipe, I found it easier to just wind the paper so a piece was further up and started the unwind then just turned the tool in circles till it was time to push the button and release the hold on the paper. Works just great. Until someone invents something better, I highly recommend getting this one.
