review/text: You will really like this tooth brush,it is great for removing stains,food particles,and does a great job at making your teeth feel clean.You wont need to apply much pressure while brushing because the ionic part of this brush removes the film that is left behind on you teeth after eating.The long and short bristles help to get between the teeth and clean the surface as well. It's really worth the money you spend.
