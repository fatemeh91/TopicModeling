review/text: I bought one of these albeit cheaper in Target US 8 years back and it still goes strong, but I have tried other supposed beard trimmers and they don't have the simplicity and flexibility of these guys so I thought I better get another just in case. This one is the superior model and different from the first with the titanium (strong) blades and the non battery rechargeable style... my beard has never been so perfectly trimmed.... what can I say? Thanks Lord Remington of Shavebury!!!
