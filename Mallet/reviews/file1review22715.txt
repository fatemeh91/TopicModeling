review/text: As per my dog psychologist's recommendation I purchased Rescue Remedy for my Shih Tzu's extreme separation anxiety. I've been using it for a month in combination with a prescription med and she is doing so much better. She was so bad that we were going to give her away, now she sleeps in a crate which was not possible before. What a relief!!
