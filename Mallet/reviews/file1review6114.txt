review/text: This is not a good product. It's just about good for one use, and that is being generous.Look around -- you will be sure to find something -- anything -- better than this for the money. It's just not worth it.If you find it for a dollar, you might consider using it once and throwing it away. This product is a huge disappointment, and I am very surprised that "Mr. Clean" is the brand name.
