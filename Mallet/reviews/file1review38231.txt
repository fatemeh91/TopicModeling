review/text: I wish I could give it 5 stars because it's inexpensive and works great....but the only problem I find is that it's difficult to get the powder completely dissolved. Even after vigorous stirring some small undissolved lumps remain. I tried sifting the powder first but that didn't help. Previous psyllium powders that I've used dissolved easily so not quite sure why this one doesn't. Anyway it still works fine so I can live with it.
