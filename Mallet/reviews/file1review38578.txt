review/text: I will NEVER, EVER use anything else again. This stuff is great. I even use it on plastic tub toys. It melts away soap scum. I have never experienced any irritation to my eyes or throat. In fact, that's why I use it. I've used a zillion other products that gag and choke me, like Kaboom. Holy cow! I can't even spray that once without choking. You can spray Comet on and simply wipe away.
