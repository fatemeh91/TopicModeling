review/text: The Detecto Model 437/439 (the 439 has the height measuring rod)balance beam scale is virtually idential to what you are used toseeing in a doctor's office. I need to check the next time I'm inmy doctor's office but the 437/439 may be of lighter construction(but perfectly adequate for the typical home environment).In the several weeks that I have had the 439 (I ordered the Model437 but the box contained the Model 439) I have been impressed at :a.) How repeatable the measurements areb.) How the scale's calibration stays thesame even when the scale is moved.The scale arrived in a very rugged cardboard box and the onlyassembly was to attach the vertical upright portion of thescale to the floor assembly (that you stand on).I think that there could be a slight weakness in the design inthe way the two pieces attach as there might be a problem withmetal fatigue if the scale was dragged around a lot by it'svertical member.The floor assembly has two metal 'tabs' that project up and itis over those 'tabs' that the vertical member is placed and thensecured with four screws on the back and two on the front. Thevertical member exhibits good stiffness when exposed to front-backpressure but it shows less resistance to side-to-side pressuresbecause there are no securing elements in those directions.Long-term I may buy some small metal angle-brackets and mount themto the left and right of the vertical member to provide support inthat plane (but I may never get around to it because in my householdthe scale will not be abused and so will probably never have aproblem).My overall evaluation of the product is that it's a bargain for thecouple of hundred dollars that I paid for mine through NorthShoreSupply (and the people there seem like nice folks).
