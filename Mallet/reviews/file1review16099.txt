review/text: My dog has had UTIs all her life. Every month (or so) she is afflicted with yet another one. I have tried diet changes, even to raw food, different water, distilled, bottled (Voss), and finally this product. It was cheaper than the $112 Clavamox they usualy prescribe, but had to use SO much of it, and it is in such a small bottle for so much money. While using it, she got yet another infection. I thought I should continue using it, that I didn't give it a fair enough shot. I kept using it but it didn't do much to help. I was left with having to fall back on expensive drugs. :( So disappointed, but I am glad they offer a money back guarantee. Too much money anyhow.
