review/text: Well, it's not as good as many of the others. It's tastes awful in my orange juice so I quite drinking OJ and lost a pound. Guess I owe it to Whey to Go. It's not a thick, rich shake. But . . .It is easy to mix. It has pure, good, safe ingredients. No hormones. None of the bad stuff. And, according to Consumer Reports it has little to no arsenic and none of the other heavy metals that seem to be abundant in all the others, including Jay Robb and EnergyFirst.If you mix it with some milk, a banana, a little sugarless pudding, peanut butter, olive oil and whatever else you want, it's great. I also like to put some in an avocado and a dab of water and some stevia. Makes a great sweet dessert.If and until the other companies start cleaning up their messy products, I'll use this and hope they don't mess up too.So, at least for now, I highly recommend this product. I like the chocolate too. In fact, I prefer it. But I don't know about the heavy metal content of it.- Susanna K. Hutcheson
