review/text: What amazon is showing is what it used to be and what my son used to like. Before it was very clear capsule w/ 5 other ingredients you can readily identify. (sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, water, vita C, and vita E. I used to order 1 bottle every 2 months for my son and he used to like simple seaweed flavor. Now it has modified corn starch, glycerin, high oleic sunflower oil, purified water, CARRAGEENAN, sorbitol, ascorbyl palmitate, tocopherols, natural flavor, sunflower lecithin, and caramel. Now it has stronger odor, smaller but thicker shell, and dark brown in color from its original clear orange color. My son won't touch this thing anymore. I guess they changed the formula to decrease the volume and lower the cost. Time to look for another brand.
