review/text: I got this shaver as a gift. It is the first electric shaver that I have used. The first few times that I used it, I felt the shave was not very close. But after a week, it is great. It seems to shave closer than with a razor. Also no cuts. The cleaner also works great, it needs cleaning only after 3 or 4 uses. The only problem I have is the noise. But maybe all electric shavers are a little noisy.
