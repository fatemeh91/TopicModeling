review/text: Last year I suffered from a bad cold and had to take a week off from work, I took vitamins, extra vitamin C, and Airborne, none worked! Was scared that I would get sick again...a few weeks ago...I started getting symptons, sore throat, and stuffy...right a way I purchased these and took 3 every 3 hours as directed and within 2 days my cold was completely gone. This is the only thing that works. The smell and taste is a bit gross but I'd rather take it than get sick. I prefer the tablets, less dosage than taking the capsule form.
