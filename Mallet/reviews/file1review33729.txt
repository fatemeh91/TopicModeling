review/text: I've used my takeshape brand bp cuff at a nursing home for years and absolutely love it. It Will take blood pressures on the most difficult of patients without pain. Movement is not a problem with this cuff it is a true work horse of a machine. Keep your batteries fresh though it gives erroneous readings with low batteries
