review/text: This shaver is okay. Not like I recall from years back. It seems less able to shave as well. It seems less noisy now but shaves slower; not as close/fast as before. Surprising since it looks like the same shaver. Others have commented on the missed areas when shaving and I agree.This would not be my first choice as a shaver. The price is okay but there are better shavers in this price range. I still have doubts as to whether this shaver is made in USA. The shaver itself might be, but it is not indicated on the unit. Maybe the components are bought outside and assembled in USA.Good luck with yours if you decide to try it. You may like this shaver. But it is clunky and not a quality unit.
