review/text: I can't say this herbal solution, while interesting, was effective as a remedy for my health situation. WHY it contains grain alcohol is, also, a little confusing from a a health standpoint. It hasn't harmed ME. But, since I've been using it, I've learned of and use something incredibly more effective to cure my skin infection. All I can suggest, to curious users, is try it and see if IT works for them.
