review/text: I have an old Norelco Advantage Razor which is the best razor Ive ever owned, better than the latest Norelcos out there. I love the grip and I love the trimmer that comes with this razor and I love the fact that lubrication is built in. I recently found the replacement blades for this razor and now I have an old razor that is as good as new.
