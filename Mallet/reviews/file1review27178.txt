review/text: There are many protein powders on the market. Really, do we need them to have all sorts of exotic names and have strange ingredients? All you need to build muscle, stay lean and stay satiated, is plain whey protein. Chocolate is by far my favorite, I've had vanilla, strawberry and other flavors, but chocolate is still the best tasting all around. I have been using this for literally years, and would not know what to do without it. Great as a pre-workout, and post workout protein drink, as well as an evening drink before bed time. I have had the casein powders before bed, but they take a bit to mix up, don't taste as good, and it is milk based, but add this powder to milk, and you still have a casein protein mix. I mix one scoop before my workout with milk, one scoop with water afterward, with milk before bed, and I even keep some at work to help me through some hunger pains now and again. This sells for a great price too, can't beat it. I love it.
