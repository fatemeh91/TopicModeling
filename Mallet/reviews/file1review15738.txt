review/text: Nurses are always in need of tri-color pens. We thrive on the free ones but once in a while you have to bite for the finer things in life. This is a great pen, writes nice, and fits the bill. Getting the refills for the red pen and eraser are a pain but love the pen. I keep the free pens for those who ask, can I borrow your pen?
