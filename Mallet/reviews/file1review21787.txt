review/text: I have tried Crest White Strips in the past and was pleased with the results, but I decided to give these Oral B a try: they are cheaper AND they only have to be used once per day (compared with 2x/day for the Crest strips). At first, I was pleased to see that these strips were stiffer and thicker than the thin Crest strips, which were sometimes difficult to use without getting the gel all over your hands. The Oral B strips definitely were easier to apply, but once they were on, I found the thick strips to be much more uncomfortable. When wearing the strips, my entire mouth stuck out as if I was wearing a mouthguard, making it impossible to talk and definitely impossible to wear the strips inconspicuously (as opposed to the nearly invisible Crest strips). Also, the thicker strips didn't necessarily stay in place any better and required frequent adjustments.The instructions advise that when taking the strips off, you should rinse your mouth with water for 15 seconds and then peel off the strips. When I did this, I was able to remove the strips without any problems, and any remaining residue easily rinsed away. However, the requirement of having water for removal makes it more difficult to use these strips on the go--for example, while driving. Finally, I was disappointed with the results of these strips, as I could discern only a very small color improvement in my teeth. Overall, I would not recommend this product; pay the few extra dollars and you'll see much better results with Crest's White Strips.
