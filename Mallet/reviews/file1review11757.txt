review/text: I purchased this elbow support when I developed painful golf elbow and required some support for exercise and weightlifting.Pros: This elbow support is extraordinarily comfortable, fits well with proper sizing, and provides excellent support for the elbow.Cons: Expensive. Featured a large sewn-in tag on the inside of the support at the bottom center of the bicep which was very uncomfortable. When I removed it, the sewn lining ripped and exposed some elastic(otherwise still works well and has not unravelled further).Bottom Line: Good Product, but much less expensive alternatives exist.I really do like this support, but I have since purchased a shock doctor elbow support for my other arm which is not quite as comfortable, but much cheaper and offers decent support and good flexibility.
