review/text: I bought this hoping to get more accurate body fat measurements. According to multiple measurement sessions I am at a ripped 4.5%. If that was true I'd have the abs I'm working towards. I finally just watched a video on how to measure your skin folds, used my cheap little Accu-Measure plastic calipers, and got a far more accurate reading of 12.5%. The FatTrack calipers seemed to cut my skin fold measurements in half of what they should be.
