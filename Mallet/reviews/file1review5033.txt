review/text: With the "green" cartridges, Schick Quattro has always seemed like the best razor on the market to me; however, with these it's like I can't get even what I would consider a decent shave!! I really couldn't figure out what the problem was until I came on here to rant about the new design and realized there's 2 different cartridge styles available now. So please, head my warning, and stick to the green-colored ones! These are a total waste of money!
