review/text: This is the 2nd time I'm using this product. The first time was a little over 12yrs ago. I went from 245lbs down to 195-200lbs in a little under 8 weeks using this product. Of course I also worked out 4-5 times a week and maintained a 2000 calorie a day diet but I didn't change my diet that much. This product curbed my appetite to where I had to force myself to eat because I was never hungry!A lot of products give you a roller-coaster ride with fluctuating energy levels but I never experienced that issue with this product.
