review/text: I am very impressed by not only the mirror quality, but by the strength of the suction cups. The mirror is very powerful - I can see a little too much on my face! :o) It has made applying makeup very easy for me as I am quite far sighted and have a hard time seeing what I am doing in a regular mirror.
