review/text: This item is not as pictured. As the item title states "Benefiber Pwdr 4gm Pkt (Case)", it is Benefiber in individual 4g (single serving) packets with 75 packets to a case (or box?). "Product Features" describes it as "Boxes Per Case 75" which is actually 75 packets per case. This is a confusing description and misleading photo.Benefiber is a great product but it is difficult to find a bulk quantity if you plan, as I do, to use it for a long time.
