review/text: I researched all kinds of products and stumbled upon this one. It had the best reviews by far and with a 43% savings, I decided not to pass it by. I am so glad with my decision. It is the best method I have found for removing all those unwanted hair. There is minimal pain (it IS pulling out multiple hairs at once after all) that can be quickly gotten used to. Less pain than waxing. No mess like with shaving. The first time I used it was a little time consuming but I think that's because it is picking out every single hair, even those that might be too short to cut with a razor. But after that, the time will get shorter. I got it a week ago and my legs are still smooth. Hair removal has always been a pet peeve of mine. I have finally found a product that I can use without having to use it everyday!
