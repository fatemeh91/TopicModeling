review/text: I can't wear it all night. Not sure if it is worsening my bunion or if it my bunion is getting worse for other reasons and it is just a coincidence. Could do with softer padding on the bunion side. Not sure how the manufacturer could accomplish this, but it would work better if it could pull the big toe away from the heel at the same time it is pulling it away from the other toes. At least it was not expensive and worth a shot.
