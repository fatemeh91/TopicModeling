review/text: I bought this product because I am sick and tired of shaving. It was getting to expensive to buy quality razors, and it has recently become more dangerous for me because I only have a stand up shower.I was a little nervous about using the product at first, but it really wasn't that bad. There is some pain, don't get me wrong, the first thing that I thought of was getting a new tattoo (this is not as bad, but it is the only thing I can compare it to). It hurt, and it was a constant pain, but after a while it really wan't that bad. I think that I need to wait a little longer for the hair to grow out before I use it again, but other than that it appears to be very affective. I used it on my legs, bikini area, and underarms. The worst was under the arms! I wanted to quit right away, but stuck with it even with the tears. I do plan on still using it under my arms though because I hate armpit stubble, I think it is gross.My only complaint is that it seems to be really loud. I have read other review that say that it is quieter than other, but it was pretty loud in my house. Good Luck!
