review/text: I found this product when I looked through a search engine to find natural ginger. I was taking a medication, that made me very sick to my stomache. Because of all the other medications I was on, my doctor was reluctant to give me another medication to address this side effect, so he suggested natural ginger. The first product I found was in a super market and it was ginger pieces that I would hold in my mouth, it worked ok, but one day I was in a super market and found some all natural ginger candy and that was great. I looked for it again to no avail. When I found these online, I was thrilled, but I was even happier when they arrived!!!! I would highly recommend these to anyone who is pregnant, or going through cancer treatments, motion sickness and of course side effects from medications. They are inexpensive and worth a million!!
