review/text: Something to keep in mind when using a patch of any kind, including this one: if you have an allergic reaction to the patch, that in itself can create a kind of barrier so that the patch does not work. Whatever the ingredients are, they won't cross the threshold of the irritated skin.I have not used this product, but this is true as a rule of thumb for anything that works as a patch.
