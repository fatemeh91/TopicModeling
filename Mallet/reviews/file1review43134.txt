review/text: This diaper becomes fully saturated very quickly. I bought one pack of them and a couple dozen of the more expensive chinese prefold diapers. I used them with the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap cover, which are great. These diapers were retired after my daughter fully saturated the diaper during a nap when she was one month old. I have never had that problem with the chinese prefold diaper and think they are absolutely worth the extra money. The gerber diapers are only good for burp cloths.
