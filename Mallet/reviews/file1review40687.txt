review/text: My orthopedist recommended this thumb brace to help alleviate pain from basal joint arthritis 5 years ago. I have been wearing it at work and around the house ever since. It eliminates the need for ibuprofen or aspirin to prevent the chronic pain from this type of joint arthritis. It's the best.
