review/text: I bought this during my third pregnancy to deal with the vulvar varicosities and varicose veins that are occuring in my third trimester. The first time I tried it on it felt wonderful. I felt a little bit of pressure come off my pelvic area which I hoped would lessen the pressure on my leg and vulva veins. It did feel like extra hands holding the belly up.Unfortunately, by the end of the day I couldn't wait to take it off. It felt too confining and too tight on my belly even after adjusting the straps according to the instructions. The straps pulled down on my shoulders and neck just enough to make them sore. It's ability to lift the belly up apparently lifted the baby up into my already limited stomach and I started experiencing heartburn.The best thing about this is the V2 supporter. That has really helped with the vulvar varicosities. It holds my pad with the witch hazel on it in place and puts just the right amount of pressure to ease the vein pain. If I don't wear it, by the end of the day my pelvic region is so sore. I just tuck all the extra straps under and around so that they don't bulge out and wear it just as the V2 supporter. It wasn't worth returning since I could still use it and it was a good price,around $60. Maybe if you start wearing the prenatal cradle in the beginning of your pregnancy it wouldn't be so uncomfortable as you grow?So I would think about what you need it for before you buy this combo. You may be better off getting one or the other.
