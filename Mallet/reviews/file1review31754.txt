review/text: Most "pocket survival kits" are either junk or too expensive for what you get. Most of the time, you can put together your own kit of a fraction of the cost of a pre-made kit. This survival kit is an exception to the rule. It is very well thought out. It puts the items you need in a waterproof package that really does fit in your pocket. It contains quality tools at a reasonable price. You would be hard pressed to put together a kit of this quality for the price ala carte. Anyone who spends any time outdoors and away from immediate help should carry this kit. In addition, there is a small amount of room left in the kit for you to add other items. I would suggest adding waterproof matches and water purification tablets to the kit. With this kit, a survival blanket, a good knife, and a water container, you will be pretty well prepared to survive with just tools on your body.
