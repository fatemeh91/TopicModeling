review/text: This is perfect for anyone in need of monitoring their weight who wants better quality then those bathroom scales. I'm a big guy, 6'7" 300 lbs and I needed accuracy and durability. I have it set up in my office bathroom and can now get serious about watching my weight. The unit needed some calibration out of the box; a very easy set screw adjustment but was right on the money on my first weigh in. Assembly was quick, but not as easy as advertised. It helps to have a helper and it is somewhat unclear in the directions as to what needs to happen in the base of the platform. Once I figured it out, it was no big deal, but the instructions could definitely be better. All in all I feel this was a very good choice for my needs.
