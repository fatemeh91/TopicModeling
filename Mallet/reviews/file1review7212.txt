review/text: I was so disappointed to discover than you could only use plain water with this unit. Also was disappointed that the water level didn't come a bit higher to include my ankles or part of my ankles where a lot of my pain is. The rollers were useless and i took them out, and if you do keep the pumice stone in I could foresee an accident waiting to happen if u aren't careful when putting your feet in as it can give quite the abrasion if you forget it is there. Also I probably shouldn't complain that the water level doesn't go higher as this is quite large, heavy and awkward to handle when you have to dump the water out after every use. The jets are nice, as is the fact that it heats the water but i think for the most part this will stay in the closet and i will continue to use the old bucket where i can add Epsom salts and oils to help in the relief of old tired feet and ankles.
