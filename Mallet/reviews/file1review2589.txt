review/text: The price may seem expensive, but this is a high quality product and is worth the money. The bottle is about 7 and 1/4 inches tall. It has a screw-on cap. The bottle is soft and one just has to lightly squeeze the bottle to pour the lubricant. One only needs to use a small amount, but I found that I did need to use more after a short while. The lubricant has high-quality feel. It feels closer to natural vaginal lubrication. It is very smooth and silky. It does not have a smell or taste. I highly recommend this product. You and your partner won't regret how much it will help you in the bedroom. It makes everything better.
