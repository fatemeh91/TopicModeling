review/text: Effecive product to clean gums and in between tight spaces of teeth. However, it does splatter quite a bit, so you have to really lean close over the basin. My dentist told me that there are Waterpik shower attachments. This would seem a more efficient way of accomplishing the same thing, without the mess, and without the minor assembly/disassembly each time.
