review/text: I decided to buy the groomer after I have read so many positive reviews about it on amazon. The groomer works and trims the hairs fairly short. However, from the first time I tried it it hurt and tickled at the same time. That is the strangest sensation. The groomer pulls hair often... very often... continuously... The combination of pulling hair and tickling makes your eyes water. My old scisors were sharper and I had to be more careful with them, but at least they don't pull my nose hair.
