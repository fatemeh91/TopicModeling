review/text: I bought this when i lost my masters litman stethoscope I work on a cardiac unit and it was difficult at times to hear heart sounds and breath sounds clearly but maybe in a another field it would be a better choice. I would rate this as ok but didn't impress me overall its cute but I needed better clarity to do my job.
