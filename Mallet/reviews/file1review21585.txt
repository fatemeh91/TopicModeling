review/text: I've always thought this water had a funny taste to it. Kind of like it was filtered or something, even though this may indeed be how "pure" water is supposed to be. It's difficult to describe the taste of water though.Anyway, I'm sticking with Poland Springs sparkling flavored waters. I like the carbonation, and the slight natural flavors like lime and rasberry. It's also cheaper than this water.
