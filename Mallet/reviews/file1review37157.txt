review/text: I have used many different gloves that were cheaper and more expensive, but I have never had a pair of gloves that do the job as well as it has with being used every minute of everyday.I have had these gloves for several months and these gloves have stayed tight to my hand, I have used in my yard with my hands in dirt, I have had it wet almost everyday without the glove stretching out of shape and unlike other gloves are washable by simply putting them under a stream of water and they have not come apart from carrying heavy bags of stone, dirt and 50lbs slabs used in my yard. Also they have a rubber type fabric that keeps them able to hold items without slipping from your hand.I also have a left hand that is slightly deformed from surgery on thumb that left the joint pertruding keeping me from holding anything in hand without the bone getting in way. With these gloves being so well made I have put a 1&#34; piece of rubber in the palm of glove giving enough cushion so the bone is not in way of holding things, lifting weights and doing pushups.I think the one thing that could be done to make these gloves perfect would be to have it made with more cushion in the palm.
