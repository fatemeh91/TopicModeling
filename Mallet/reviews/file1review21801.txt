review/text: My eye doctor said about me, that he's never seen anyone try so hard to see badly. This is not a recommendation to stop seeing your eye doctor. But if you're over 40 they make you choose whether you will see well close up or far away; you can't have both. Nobody tells me what I can't have! When I found this product I thought it was worth a try, and it was a good decision. Eyesight Rx actually helps me stay in my older glasses with which I can read also.
