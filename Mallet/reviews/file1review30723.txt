review/text: After about a month shaving with the #178, I've only noticed a few drawbacks:The handle is a bit short, if you've large hands, I would suggest you consider getting the #180, which is the same basic no-frills design, just a longer handle. I would say I have slightly smaller than average hands for a guy, and if I had the chance to order again, I would go with the longer handle. The posture you'll need to use the razor is a bit different than a disposable, but easy to get used to. The overall weight is good, heavier than a disposable system razor, but if you want something hefty, look for the HD models, which are a good deal heavier.Also, be sure to get a stand to hang the razor when not in use, as its generally not a great idea to have the razor's edge so close to a hard surface, as it would be if you just laid the razor down on a counter.The #178 has a lot of great points though:A rugged design, all stainless. Changing razors is a breeze, and with the screw down mechanism, you can feel confident the blade is not shifting, nor going anywhere. I would say that the learning curve switching from a modular disposable razor is short and easy to deal with. The available replacement blades are all generally sharper than in the disposables, but the design of the #178 allows for some lee-way, you're not going to cut yourself as long as you use deliberate strokes and take your time.I personally would recommend getting some Derby Extra DE blades"Derby Extra" Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades, I find they are better than the Merkur blade that comes included, but that's another review. Just know that there is a wide range of replacement blades, and it could mean the difference between a slightly better than average shave, and an exceptional shave.
