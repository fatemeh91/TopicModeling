review/text: When I feel myself coming down with a cold I usually begin taking Ginger and Echinacea supplements, and although it doesn't always prevent me from getting the cold it doesn't last as long if I'm on these supplements. Therefore, when I saw this supplement that included both ginger and echinacea, aswell as black elderberry, I was intrigued. I'm not terribly great at taking pills, and so I thought this supplement would be great. I am a little daunted by the amount of these pills you have to take in one day however (10 total). It does seem a little excessive. Yet when I compared the MGs of this supplement to the single supplements I have of ginger root and echinacea, I actually found that they were very similiar. All of the capsules are about the same size and so this would explain why you would have to take so many more of this particular supplement--it has three herbs to fit into each capsule.For all that it seems like a good idea to combine these herbs, I do feel like it is just as convenient to take a few more capsules, but less times a day. Plus, the price of this 'Quick Defense' supplement box is very high, and so in the long-run I feel it would be more cost effective to buy the bigger bottles of the herbs in single form.All in all though a good product for some-one who just wants a single bottle to throw in their bag and be done with in two days.
