review/text: My little brother is 4. He has had issues his entire life with a type of anemia (which type? I'm not sure) and has had to stay in the hospital for several days on several occasions because of it. His doctor prescribed him a list of foods that he cannot eat (due to digestive problems caused by his anemia) and also some multivitamin liquid with iron in it. Doctors say he will grow out of this problem maybe by the time he's 6 or 7.Even when he is not feeling sick, he REFUSES to eat meat (unless it's fish). We're grateful for this stuff because he loves it + it's good for him. My mom has gotten him into a unhealthy habit of only liking milk when it has a couple of teaspoons of sugar in it. Noticing this wasn't good for him and seeing that he refuses to drink milk plain, I looked up on the internet for things that he might like that would also be good for his nutrition, help him with digestion and with his lack of protein intake. This stuff is supposed to do all 3 of those things & He GULPS it down in SECONDS!We give him one per day and on the rare days that he didn't eat well, we'll give him two. I took one star off for price because I'm sure if it were less expensive we'd be giving him two per day everyday. But even at the high price, we'll continue to purchase these for him and amazon's a convenient place to get it. I will ADD however that Amazon is no cheaper to obtain these than your local Wal-Mart etc is so don't think that you're saving any money, just time.
