review/text: This is actually a very useful watch for anyone hard of hearing, and who has a good sense of humor. My Father would have loved this watch. It was kind of a joke gift for me, and yet I have come to rely on it every day. It has a great speaking voice to tell you the time, funny alarm sounds like the Rooster Alarm to wake you up, and a nice glossy gold look. It's a great gift for anyone hard-of-hearing, and they will love the look and sturdy feel of this great watch.
