review/text: MY PERIODS ARE VERY IRREGULAR...SINCE TAKING B/C I'VE HAD TO HAVE PROVERA TO MAKE ME START MY CYCLE. I WAS PUT ON CLOMID FOR 3 MONTHS WITH NO SUCCESS MY DOCTOR SAID SHE COULD NOT DO NOTHING FOR ME AND WANTED ME TO SEE A SPECIALIST. I'VE BEEN TAKING FERTILAID FOR 14 DAYS WITH SOME CRAMPS HERE AND THERE... BUT AS OF TODAY I'VE STARTED HAVING PERIOD LIKE CRAMPS AGAIN AND SOME SPOTTING...I NEVER THOUGHT THIS PRODUCT WOULD WORK, BUT NOW I SEE THAT IT REALLY DOES!!!! HOPEFULLY I CAN GET PREGNANT NOW!!!
