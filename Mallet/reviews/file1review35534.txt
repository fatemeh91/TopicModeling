review/text: I have been taking Vim & Vigor off and on for about 1 year now. I would let it run out, but after a week or so of not taking it I would notice how much more sore and stiff I would get. I have not noticed any weight loss benefit or extra energy, but I do notice how much better I feel in my aches and pains. I definitely recommend this. I always end up buying more after I realize I am hurting again!
