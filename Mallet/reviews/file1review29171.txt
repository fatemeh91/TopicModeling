review/text: This toothbrush is the best I have ever used.First, it provides a more thorough cleaning than any other toothbrush I have tried. The closest competitor is probably Sonicare.Second, the battery life is awesome. The original AA that came with the brush lasted the entire first quarter of my Freshman year.Third, the batteries are easily replaceable by unscrewing the bottom half of the handle.
