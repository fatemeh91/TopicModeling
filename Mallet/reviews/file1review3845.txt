review/text: When I first met my wife, it wasn't too long before she suggested that I might have whiter, bright teeth and a better smile by using "Crest Whitestrips." Whiter teeth? Moi? I brushed my teeth twice every day and had them regularly cleaned twice a year. Yet, close inspection indicated they were indeed a bit yellow and stained, and I always assumed it was just my age. Or maybe it was the coffee or red wine. So, if a new girlfriend suggests Whitestrips, then Whitestrips it is. Several days later we went to a pharmacy and purchased the "Crest Whitestrips Premium" packet.I followed the instructions as closely as possible. It was a bit difficult getting started with getting the strips on and then holding them in place for the suggested time. I finally worked out a routine wherein I would fit them in prior to driving to her place. When I'd get there, I'd discard them. When I'd head back for home (about a 20-minute trip), I'd put a new pair in and take them out upon arrival. I'd make the round trip about every couple days so it took a little longer for the total whitening treatment but the arrangement worked fine and didn't waste any time. Plus it was easy to remember.We began noticing the whitening after about three or four days. It was very subtle and gradual at first, but by the end of the packet, my teeth were noticeably whiter and brighter. It was a good improvement. The whitening agent was applied, of course, only to the front teeth, but those are the most noticeable and it works out fairly well for my smile. I'd say if you want whiter, brighter teeth this is a reasonably good product and not very expensive. It's not perfect, and I may try a few of the other whitening methods. It's also not permanent and I've now got a third kit for another go at whitening. Using the procedure about every year to 1.5 years seems to work best for me.Gary Peterson
