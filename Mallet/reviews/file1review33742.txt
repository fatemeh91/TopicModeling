review/text: This is a pretty and functional tart burner. It heats up pretty quickly, and I love that it doesn't have a gaping hole in the back like other burners do. It makes putting a tea light in a little trickier, but it's pretty easy. And the vents make pretty patterns on the ceiling or wall, which is a bonus.
