review/text: I got this for my daughter's family. They now use it for everything, the kids, the husband. (they haven't said anything about the dog) The love it and all of the attachments. They said to me they wondered how they got along with it before. According to the husband, it is slightly too big to be effective on his mustache. oh well. 99% satisfaction is not bad. good gift, from "grandpa" ah sweet success
