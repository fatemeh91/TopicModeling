review/text: These are the best tweezers I have ever used. I had heard good things about Tweezerman tweezers and wanted to try them, but was daunted by the high price tag. After finding this pair of mini-tweezers for half the price I had seen them in stores, I took the opportunity to buy a pair and have been very satisfied with the results. The sharp edges allow for precision hair removal and have not appeared to dull in the weeks I have owned and used the product. Also, the "mini" tweezers are sufficient for everything I need. I don't see a reason to pay more for a larger pair. These tweezers are superior to anything you will find in stores in this price range. I highly recommend them.
