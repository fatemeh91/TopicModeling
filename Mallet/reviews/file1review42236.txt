review/text: IN A NUTSHELL: RARE MEDICINAL PRODUCT THAT HAS NOTHING GOING AGAINST ITS USE: SUBTLE - SAFE - BUT POTENT ANTI-OXIDANT!Most products that have a potent effect on the human body also cause negative externalities that physicians call, SIDE-EFFECTS. This Alpha Lipoic Acid in 100 Mg capsules, carries with it many benefits, yet few if any risks, side-effects, harmful interactions or toxicity.WHAT IT IS! [UNDER-CONSTRUCTION]Alpha lipoic acid is a vitamin-like antioxidant. It is called a "universal antioxidant" because it is both fat and water soluble. Alpha Lipoic Acid can be made within the human body and is found in a few foods, such as, yeast and liver.Perhaps of even more importance, is Alpha Lipoic Acid's ability to regenerate other antioxidants back to their active states. Among these, are Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Co-enzyme Q10 and Glutathione, to name a few.I generally take 3-4, 100 mg. capsules per day, with L-Carnitine, and with other anti-oxidants. Before I tried the various doses out for my own use, I used this 50 mg. product once with every L-Carnitine I took or 3-4 times per day. I prefer taking the 100 mg. capsules, but you may consider taking this lower dose as a starter.WHAT'S "ALPHA LIPOIC ACID" GOOD FOR? [UNDER-CONSTRUCTION]
