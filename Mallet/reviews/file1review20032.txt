review/text: This tub was perfect for my baby. It kept him upright laying slghtly. There is a small slot by the feet for small toys to play with while bathing. In addition, the fold-up feature made it easy for storing. The foam did not allow my son to slip at all. The fact that a small amount of water can be filled near his bottom allows the freedom to bath him by gently soaking a wash cloth. Later you can drain the tub through an opening at the bottom of the tub.
