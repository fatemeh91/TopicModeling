review/text: These clippers are of the highest quality possible. This time Panasonic used their powerful linear motor in this product. It is built and performs like a 250.00-300.00 trimmer. For some reason Panasonic has always made some of their finer products harder to acquire - for now it is available - in the past mostly sold through very scarce professional channels. It is the perfect product. This time it comes with blade attachments up to 15mm. The USA model even comes with a charging stand whereas the direct import has less attachments and no stand. The way it is packaged it is a bargain. Made in Japan - very high quality. I use it as beard trimmer. The cheaper models have always barely worked - this is a professional grade product.
