review/text: GRAPESEED OIL IS GREAT FOR SKIN MOISTURIZING,CUTS, DRY HEELS, ELBOWS OR ANY PART OF THE BODY. I MIX IT WITH THE TAMANU OIL I ALSO BOUGH AT AMAZON. TAMANU OIL IS AN OIL WHICH HELPS ACNE, ECZEMA ETC. READ ABOUT TAMANU OIL AT ANY WEBSITE. GRAPESEED OIL SELLS FOR ABOUT $20 AT MY LOCAL HEALTH FOOD STORE WHEN THEY HAVE IT IN STOCK. I PAID $8 AT AMAZON. I'M ON MY 2ND BOTTLE FROM THE SAME SELLER AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY FROM THEM. THEY SELL HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS AT A GREAT PRICE. TAKES ABOUT 10-14 DAYS TO RECEIVE BUT IT'S WORTH THE WAIT.
