review/text: I purchased these cloth diapers to use as a liner on the changing station of my pack & play. They are very thin, so I have to double them up and then fold them in half. They are absorbent (I have twin boys, so we have our share of accidents during diaper changes). Another reason that I'm not crazy about them is that I need to wash them by themselves; they release a TON of lint that gets all over the other items in a shared load. All in all, I would not purchase these again.
