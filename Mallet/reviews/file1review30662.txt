review/text: I just got a Merkur razor for Christmas and I had a great first shave with it. I am really impressed with the shave. As others have said, you want to apply light pressure and make multiple passes. I would also like to add that I don't normally shave upside down, but did with this razor and got a very close shave. I did not cut myself and found it to be easy to learn to shave with. I would recommend this razor and am throwing out my disposables.
