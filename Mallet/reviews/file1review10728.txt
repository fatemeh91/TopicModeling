review/text: This is perfect for what I need. I take different vitamins/pills 4X/day. This one has the 4 separate compartments to allow you to fill specifically for each time of day. It's great to just take the day's pill box out of the tray, toss it in my bag, and go without having to lug around a huge pill organizer. I looked at a few others but kept coming back to this one and I'm really glad I did! Also, it fits a lot of pills in each compartment - currently I'm taking 7 pills in the AM alone and this fits them all - although I don't think I could fit another one in there which is fine for me, but if you take more than that or if your pills are all very large (some of mine are medium/large but most aren't very big) you might need one with bigger compartments.
