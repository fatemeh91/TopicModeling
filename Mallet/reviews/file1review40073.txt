review/text: Crest is, and always has been, my favorite toothpaste. The only problem I ever had, though, was that tube. It took up too much room, and was in the way. I love this new Neat Squeeze bottle with my favorite toothpaste in it. From now on, this is my brand and my bottle! Excellent product still, just with a different look. I highly recommend it.
