review/text: This trimmer works like a charm. I charged it up once and have been trimming my beard for several weeks now on a single charge. Adjustable trimmer length is easy to use and works as expected. Haven't had to clean or oil it yet, but it came with the supplies to do so. I'm completely satisfied.
