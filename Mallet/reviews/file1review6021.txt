review/text: I like this little device because it is very easy to use, holds the information for future reference (memory option) and has a large face with easy to read numbers and it is small in size.It takes blood pressure and also pulse. It is so much simpler than the old cuff type, just strap on with velcro strap, press blue button. It seems reliable as I get similar readings with other BP monitors. It uses AA batteries which so far seem to last a long time.Fun, functional and easy. I would give it 5 stars if it held more than one person's information in memory and if it were less expensive.
