review/text: I got the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor which reminds me of the astronaut dehydrated ice cream flavor type of smell but it mixes well with unsweetened almond milk (reducing lactose). It is not too sweet and the aftertaste is minimal. I chose this brand since it had less ingredients than the others and less artificial flavorings.
