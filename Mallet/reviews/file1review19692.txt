review/text: I purchased this potty seat for my 3 year old little boy to move him from his "little potty" to the standard one. It has been a great purchase. There are no areas that can not be cleaned and it is dishwasher safe. I put up a hook to hang it on and it stores discreetly out of site while still being accessible to my little boy. The adjustable feature makes it a secure fit on the toilet and does not allow it to slip as my son is climbing up. I would very highly recommend this seat, it is worth the higher price just to have something that can be cleaned so thoroughly, not to mention that it is highly functional.
