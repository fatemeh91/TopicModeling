review/text: my husband I and have used these twice. the first time we were amazed at the results!!!! that was about 8 months ago and now for the holidays we just did another treatment this week. they are very easy to put in and there is hardly any taste if at all. they fit very well also and I have had no problems of them coming off liek others say. I mean seriously for the price you CANNOT BEAT IT!!! esp for my husband who is a heavy coffee drinker, pop drinker and smoker. the only thing for me is YES the first 3-5 minutes my gums burn and it is uncomfortable but not too bad..the results are WELL WORTH it for me.....I would not say it lasts 18 months but about 6 months for me...great product!! I highly recommend! plus other people even say How did you get your teeth so white???!!!!
