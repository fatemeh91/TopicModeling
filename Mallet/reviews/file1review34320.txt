review/text: This junky apparatus fell apart in less than 2 months. The plastic clips that hold the dryer snapped off on the first uses. That was the end of it standing up on its own. After that I used the velcro to hold the dryer but it slipped off over and over. I am now shopping for a better one. Don't waste you money on this one!!
