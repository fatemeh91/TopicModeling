review/text: I've been using this for menopause symptoms - heavy cycles that are prolonged and coming too close together - and this truly seems to be &#34;regulating&#34; my cycles. My cycles have not been as painful or heavy since I've been using the cream and they are back on track to every 25-28 days. The scent is pleasant as well.
