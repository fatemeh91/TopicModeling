review/text: Bottom line:If you want to lose fat you should gain muscle: eat right and lift heavy shit, free weights! Not machines, not cardio.Example: Follow StrongLifts 5x5.When I used animal cuts I only had access to crappy machines and a treadmill. I used both 3 times a week while cutting, and it did work pretty well, I could see some definition showing up in my stomach area. I have the feeling that it was mostly water weight though and my results would have been considerably greater had I been lifting heavy with free weights. I could have probably gotten about the same results using cheaper water weight cutting products instead.
