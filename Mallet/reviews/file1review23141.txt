review/text: This sweeper really works and the handle issue I see commented can be solved by a hammer or strong husband. I highly recommend this sweeper. The entrance carpet regularly gets crumbs and this sweeper picks them up. However I use it the most in the kitchen tile floor and a comfort rug I have. I have a small kitchen and after cooking a lot of crumbs end up on the floor, I wanted something I could have at hand to clean it fast without having to drag the vacuum out every day. I was skeptical this would work especially with all the ones announced with battery and all but this thing works like a charm. Also in the bathroom hair daily ends up on the floor and this one picks them up too.Emptying the trash is also very easy. I'm happy I didn't go for one with battery because I don't have to charge this one or have battery problems, I just take it out and it works on carpet, floor, rugs, everything. I highly recommend it. It also takes very little storage space.As for the handle when I put it together the top part kept falling so I asked my husband to apply his strength to it and problem solved, it's just a matter of using force.
