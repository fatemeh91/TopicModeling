review/text: When I first bought Glad Rags some years ago, they were fantastic, well-made, well-stitched, and lay flat even after many washings-- and well worth the high price. I would have given them five stars. I still have some of those today that I use as panty liners and they are as good as they ever were. ( I found they weren't irritating like the disposable panty liners.) However, when I bought a package of Glad Rags recently to replace a couple that the dog ate (!!), I was VERY disappointed. The inserts of the new Glad Rags were narrower than before and so poorly made that every time I washed them they all crinkled up and I had to IRON them before they were usable! Until the company gets their act together and does a better job of quality control, I suggest you make your own liners for light days or panty liners. It's easy--and I'm not a seamstress! I used four layers of good cotton flannel (that I pre-washed in very hot water), cut in an oblong shape and double hand stitched and finished around the edges while watching something insipid on television. If you just need panty liners, you can pin your home-made liners through two layers of the flannel into the crotch with a very small safety pin from the outside of the undies. (Double-check to make sure it's securely pinned!) Saves a lot of money too.
