review/text: I purchased the double chocolate flavor and find it to be much easier to drink than several other brands that I have tried. I usually just mix it with water and it tastes fine. It also dissolves very easily and with relatively small amounts of fluid--I just shake it for a few seconds and let it sit. With other brands, I had to use twice as much liquid to have it come anywhere close to fully dissolved. This brand is also very affordable, so you can't lose.
