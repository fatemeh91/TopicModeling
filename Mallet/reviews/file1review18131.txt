review/text: I am very happy with the Bucky 40 Blinks Ultralight Eye Mask. I use it every night, because the blinds in my room let in some light from streetlights, and the bright lights some people have on in their yards at night. It is so much better than the sleep masks I have tried in the past! It keeps out all light, even when I lie on my side. I like the velcro strap, too, because I do not have the smallest head, so most elastic straps get stretched out very quickly. It's very comfortable; thank you to everyone who wrote reviews! You were right!
