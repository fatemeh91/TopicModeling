review/text: I highly recommend these drops if you suffer from allergy eyes. They work immediately for me and I stock up on them and keep them in my cabinet. You never know when you'll have a flare up.This company makes several different formulas and I suggest you try them all. With the economy in dire straights and our pockets empty, most people can't afford to run to the eye doctor for every little symptom. I find that these do the trick without all the drama of DR appointments, time restraints or lack of money....Here's to healthy eyes !!
