review/text: I purchased this cane as a result of a health problem I was experiencing and used it a few times. I like it because of it's durability and the fact that it is so stylish. When taking it out of the carrying case it automatically opens for you. I don't use it all the time but I feel much more safe knowing that it is there should I need it. It's easy to carry with the handy case that comes with it or even in a tote bag. Easy to fold and use.
