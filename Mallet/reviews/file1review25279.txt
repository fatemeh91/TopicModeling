review/text: I used these while cycling. I bought 8 pairs (my mistake, I should have tried one out first) and got about 4 minutes of heat and then they went cold. I bought them directly off the Hotsnapz website. I have tried calling and emailed the company for 4 months for a return and never get a response. Do not buy.
