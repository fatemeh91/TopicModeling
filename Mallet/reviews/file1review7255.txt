review/text: Received the foot spa and we were able to immediately start using it. The remote control is great so you can keep relaxing and not bend over to change things. The jets are nice and strong. The best part is the heated water temp. It never cools off, in fact you might have to turn the heat off and maybe back on if you stay in it long. I love this feature. Very happy with this purchase.
