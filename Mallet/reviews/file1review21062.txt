review/text: this was a gift, but i have one and my family has been using these for about 20 years. i consider it the best heating pad on the market. if you are lazy and don't want to hold done the activating lever, this is not for you. i highly recommend NOT to tape the lever down. this pad will burn you. children must be supervised!!!!!!
