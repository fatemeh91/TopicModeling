review/text: I've have a family history of very irregular cycles. I would go as long as 8 or 9 months without a cycle then feel very ill when it did come. Due to my high risk for endometriosis ( my mom's later turned into Ovarian Cancer)I have been on the pill since I was 16 years old (13 years!).I didn't want to have 8 or 9 months go by without a period and decided to try fetilaid out (after missing a couple periods) to help my cycle naturally while TTC. After about 1 1/2 months later I THOUGHT I got my period and was estatic, but nope I AM PREGANT! Turns out it was implantation bleeding. Funny thing was I had just received some ovulation/pregnancy tests from Amazon and thought I got ripped off because they were all coming out positive. I even had my husband take one..lol (his was negative)! A run to Walgreen's and a dr's appt later, it's confirmed. I never even got a period, as soon as I ovulated, I conceived. THIS SUPPLEMENT IS A GODSEND!!Note: Due to lazyness I had been taking all three pills at once in the morning, but afer reading someone else's review saying it worked better taking 3x a day (with meals) I decided to try. Seems to have done the trick. =D
