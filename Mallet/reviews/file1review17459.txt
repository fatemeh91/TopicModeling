review/text: What a bargain ! This trimmer does what it promises and more, making it a pleaseure to take care of a beard and to change lengths and looks at the flip of a switch ! My wife wasn't sure how long she wanted my beard and in two days I was able to use one trimmer to go from a full beard to the "scruffy" look and each stop in between !
