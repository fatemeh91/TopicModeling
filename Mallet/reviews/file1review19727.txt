review/text: I have a 3 year old little guy who is totally not into potty training. I bought a trainer at one of our local stores and it wasn't stable on the toilette and it wasn't big enough. Left ugly red marks on my little ones rear.In order to get him more interested in potty training I decided to try a new approach. We are very happy with this product. I does what it says it does, its easy to attach, easy to remove and it is stable when its on the toilette. Once more it looks like the "big potty seat" my little guy enjoys putting it on and taking it off himself. I hung a low hook on the wall so he can also put it away himself. This toilette trainer has made him feel like a big boy. I would recommend this item, expecially to parents of little boys who are perfectly content with diapers.
