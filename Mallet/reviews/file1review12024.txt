review/text: i was taking some other pre-natl vitamins before i found this one. The other stuff was sort of making me gag after i would take them. So i decided to look for something with a good review and decided to try this and i have love it since. Its true the pill is huge but you only need to take it once a day unlike the other stuff which requires that you take it up to 3 times a day... what hassel.....this one also has a good amount of calcium in it. Just ask my chunky and healthy 1 year old nursing daughter...she would recommend this product too...
