review/text: Having been a "health-nut" since I was 15 years old (I am 51 now) and having tried a lot of products, I must say that this one is on the very top of my list.Like other reviewers have said, I too have not caught any flu or colds since starting my daily scoop of Green Vibrance.It not only seems to make my immunity stronger, it also has improved the appearance of my skin and hair.I put my scoop into my daily protein drink that has so many other ingredients, that the taste is not an issue with me.This is some powerful nutrition.I also agree with other reviewers that this stuff makes you very regular and that means that toxins do not stay in your body for very long.The concentrated powerful nutrients are worth ever penny.And by ordering it from Amazon, I saved about 30 dollars compared buying it at Whole Foods.Very impressing stuff, I just ordered my second 25.4 oz canister.Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!!!!!!!
