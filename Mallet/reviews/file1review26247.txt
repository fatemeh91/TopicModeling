review/text: The thickness of this backrest put me too far forward in the seat of my very small car to be comfortable. The backrest was comfortable, but the edge of the seat was too short for comfort when the backrest was in place. Honestly, the seat was almost too short for comfort without the backrest.However, thinking outside the box, I decided to try this as a bed pillow for reading. It is the PERFECT "pillow" with back support and the BEST I have found for sitting up to read or use a laptop in bed. It offers the kind of support that other sitting up in bed pillows don't. I think I have tried every style of bed pillow ever made for reading in bed without being 100% satisfied with their performance and my comfort. So, I am delighted with this use for this backrest. This backrest nearly hits the 100% mark as a reading pillow. The only thing it would need to get higher marks would be a softer *bedroom* fabric with a greater choice of colors. The fabric on this backrest is durable and looks like it belongs in a vehicle. While I didn't purchase this backrest for this use initially, this backrest has more than met my expectations.I think this backrest/pillow (or the smaller one) would be a great help to those who are wanting to sit up in their beds in the hospital or for individuals who are confined to bed for health reasons.This backrest would also be great for college students who don't like to study at their desks and prefer to read sitting up in bed.I am very pleased with my purchase. In fact, I have ordered extras to keep on hand for gifts.Update 4-10-2008: I found the perfect back support for my compact vehicle: Angel Sales PosturePro Lumbar Support. It is sold on Amazon and I left a review of the product on that page.
