review/text: At first I was very nervous about epilating. I have never bought/used one before. I read reviews for several epilators and I decided on this one. I purposely chose one that was NOT battery operated (I read a few reviews that the battery life is short on these.) Also I followed advice that others gave; I took a warm shower and exfoliated beforehand. (Make sure you do both!) The rotating blades were very intimidating at first but after I got over it, I realized that this was the best purchase I have ever made! It was simple, easy, and it did not hurt !! No more waxing! No more waiting for the wax to heat up or anything! This epilator glides against your skin; it is as easy as shaving. I will never shave or wax again! Granted, I have been waxing for a year before I bought this product. My hair is finer than it was a year ago and my hair follicles are probably used to the hair being pulled out; so it was painless and my skin was not red/pink afterwards. I wish I would have discovered this miracle product earlier! It would have saved me lots of time and money waxing! This product also comes with a nice case to keep the epilator protected from the other items in your bathroom (or wherever you plan to store it). I plan to give an update after a few weeks or when the hairs grow back.
