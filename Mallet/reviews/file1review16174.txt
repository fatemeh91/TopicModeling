review/text: I have owned several diaper changing pads. This one is by far the most durable. I have had it in my home daycare for 2 years and not a tear or rip. The only bad I would say about it is it came with an attached handle so u can carry it anywhere...well it tore the first day but I wasn't gonna use that anyway. it stays in the same place all the time
