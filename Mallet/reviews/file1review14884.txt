review/text: I use this about once a week on average, mostly as a meal replacement, and partly for the protein etc. after workouts, and often to take to work. If you make it with milk, it makes a really thick shake, add a banana or peanut butter, or both, and the taste is even better, really great in fact, and the shake is even thicker. I now use about 1/2 milk and 1/2 water, and also add a banana to it. This is a shake to enjoy as a meal replacement, or after a grueling work out in addition to a meal an hour or two later. I've used it both times. Well worth it for the daily meal replacement, if that is your intent, or an occasional shake for what ever reason you choose.
