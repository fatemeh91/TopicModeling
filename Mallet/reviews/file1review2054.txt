review/text: I purchased this item after having much foot pain, especially by end day. Some of the reviews stated it didn't have much padding, but I feel it's adequate and the design does the job. I feel it's sturdy and well made. I do agree with other reviews stating the velcro strap is not long enough, and it wouldn't be for a wide foot. Fortunately, mine is narrow and it fits fine. Others could replace it with a velcro strip found at a sewing store. The first night I could only wear it for 4 hrs, but after that, all night. It's not made to walk around in, but a quick trip to the restroom is do-able. I've been wearing it every night for over a month now and have felt a difference. Even after a few days, my foot pain had decreased dramatically. I don't expect miracles because my bunion has been there for years, but I do feel pain relief, and that's what I was hoping for. I'm hoping that after continued use, my toe may tend to straighten a bit. I only wish I had found this item sooner and would recommend anyone with a bunion to use this early on. After talking with people, surgery is the last resort.
