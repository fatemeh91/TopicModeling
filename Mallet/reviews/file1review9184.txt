review/text: If this Pill box was made of better materials, it would be the ideal pillbox. It has large compartments, each day lifts out of the box, it is clear, so you can tell at a glance if you took your meds or not and you have four compartments for each day. It has every thing we need, except with in a month, two of the little doors that keep your meds in its compartment had broken off.
