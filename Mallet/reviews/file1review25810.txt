review/text: The picture does not actually match the what the goniometer will look like as the picture is of a 12" goniometer. The 8" goniometer works exactly as expected. The plastic is a little thin but that also match the price of the product (Get what you pay for). I like it though because it is less cumbersome when measuring ROM in the hands, wrist, and ankles.
