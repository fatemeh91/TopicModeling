review/text: In all reality, I am simply wanting to add another 5-star rating to these tweezers. There is not much left to be said that hasn't been said already. They work great, they are very very sharp and come with a rubber tip cover. They are very comfortable to hold and use since they are nice and wide where you hold them. The yellow color is not unattractive at all. They really do a great job pulling hairs and even digging out foreign matter under the skin. Don't forget to sterilize them before going digging!Thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers out there that help everyone make informed buying decisions. It's so nice to read about real people using products and giving real feedback.
