review/text: I was introduced to this when it was sold in the black boxes. It now seems to require application more frequently than what I remember years ago, but this is still much better than daily use of pore-clogging deodorants with aluminum powder. Formula change? Perhaps. Lavilin swears no, but no sense living in the past. The alcohol and chemicals in other deodorants can be harsh on sensitive skin, but this is tolerated in a lot of cases where common deodorants fail. If you have a history of skin irritation from deodorants, or have sensitive skin in general, give this a try. It's not a miracle cure, but it works in more cases than not.Days between required application seems to vary based on my activity-level and season. As few as 4 days in the summer, while 5 and even as long as 7 in the winter.
