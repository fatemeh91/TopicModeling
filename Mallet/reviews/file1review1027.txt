review/text: I chose this product because of the TV advertisement. It does seem to whiten teeth just like it claims. I like the fact that it is not abrasive and will not damage the enamel, even when used every day. The only downside is that it is a little pricey and I'm not sure I could afford to continue using it twice a day, every day as suggested.
