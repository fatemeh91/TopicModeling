review/text: After about a week of use, my unit stopped oscillating and one half of the jets only spurted weakly. I tried cleaning the nozzles, but that didn't fix the problem.I am on well water, and there are a lot of minerals in my water, so it's certainly possible that the nozzles got clogged up or something, but one way or another, this product simply won't work for me. I've stepped up to an impact sprinkler that has been working much better.When the product was working, it worked fine, but it stopped working shortly after I bought it.
