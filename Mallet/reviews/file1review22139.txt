review/text: I used this thermometer pacifier and it's never had an accurate temp. Not to mention that the regular pacifier I wouldn't recommend using it at all, my daughter used it and she almost choked on it, it fell apart on her and the nipple was the only thing in her mouth nearly down her throat. It'a a good thing it was time for her to wake up or she wouldn't be here today.I WOULD NOT USE THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.
