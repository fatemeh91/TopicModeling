review/text: Purchased this to replace a similar but older model. I actually looked for this style, because it is easy to adjust. Unfortunately, it is more flimsy and louder than the original. A couple teeth have broken off guide and it did not come with a carry case. Battery depletes fast as I always need to use it plugged in. I will replace it with a better model, but now that it is even cheaper, it can't be beat for $14 bucks.
