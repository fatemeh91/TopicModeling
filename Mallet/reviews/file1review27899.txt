review/text: I've tried a few different kinds of protein, and this is my new favorite. Most importantly to me, it's more easily digestible than some of the cheaper protein powders out there. The double rich chocolate is also quite delicious. And to top it all off, Optimum Nutrition isn't too expensive for the amateur weight lifter. Give it a try!
