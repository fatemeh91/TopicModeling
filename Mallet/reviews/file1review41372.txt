review/text: I broke my heel bone ten years ago. Despite surgery to fix the break I've suffered pain and frequent swelling since then. I also have high arches. I've been wearing these for three days. They felt so good, I sort of skipped the whole "breaking in" thing. I've worn them in my tennis shoes, as well as my casual work shoes. I've noticed less pain, and swelling. And my good foot benefits from not having to make up for the bad one. Even did well standing for several hours on bare concrete floors.
