review/text: We have been using this for three years during flu season, and though our Licensed Homeopath believes in the classical delivery of remedies, we have found the French have indeed been using a very effective remedy for years. Being aware of your body, and its first signs of a sniffle, sore throat, clogged ear this remedy helps get you combat and heal from within. NOTE: You do have to get more rest and drink fluids, but our family of 8 has found the flus and colds subside in 24 to 48 hours and have yet get worse get drawn out. I challenge anyone to look up homeopath and learn about it. It sounds to good to be true, but this method as been used and refined for 2000 years in countries far older than our U.S.A.
