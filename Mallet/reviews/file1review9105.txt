review/text: I'm 50 years old and a RN I have been taking Vibrant Green for 2 weeks but I'm in love with the results so far. It is expensive but the benefits out weighs the cost. My husband and I switched to a plant based diet to see if it would help with his migraines that came on suddenly and was not controlled with medication. We later switches to juicing. I travel a lot and my husband would not juice despite the fact that it made him feel better so I started juicing and freezing the juice during my trips which worked for him but was time consuming for me. I was talking to my pastor's wife about juicing and the whole story about traveling. She recommended Vibrant Green and blessed us with a 25 oz. we started taking and my husband has not had a migraine and the both of us has had so much energy. After my trips I usually sleep the next day until 12 pm well actually I sleep like that on any off day and sometimes more well this morning I'm up washed several loads of clothes, cleaned up the house etc and its not 12 yet. I love this products and love this type of natural energy. Does not feel over stimulated and no ups and downs of energy level.
