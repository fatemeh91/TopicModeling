review/text: My sprinkler system developed problems during last winter. We had such a wet spring that I only recently attempted to prepare my system to water my yard. Having difficulty getting an expert to repair my system, I decided to try using an inexpensive manual sprinkler instead. This Melnor 300 looked like a good choice.The Melnor 300 Oscillating Sprinkler" works perfectly for my back yard. It is designed to cover up to 70' by 45' which is bigger than the yard. I can cover the entire space using only three fourth of my usual water pressure. I can simply set in the middle of the yard, turn the hose to about medium high pressure and water the space in one setting.I like the "Melnor 300" it solves my watering problem and saves me the cost of repair of my sprinkler system.
