review/text: This is a great cream, I use 3-4 times a week, at night. There is no peeling or rash, just a light tingle to let you know its working.I especially like the 20%, I've worked up from a 10% with another brand. Also note, this is a unbuffered glycolic acid in a very low ph solution, which gives you the full benefit without it being watered down; don't forget to moisturize a few hours later.
