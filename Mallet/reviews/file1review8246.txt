review/text: Wow! Got this brush for cleaning pint drinking glasses, but am even happier to use it on our blender. It does a perfect job on pint drinking glasses, but I imagine a lot of brushes would be ok in that application. Making fruit smoothies at least once a day in our blender, I've been less than happy with our regular dish brush in cleaning the inside. We use avocados and ground flax seeds in our smoothies, so you really need to scrub and wash to get that fat cleaned off between uses. This brush makes it a snap! What a pleasure!
