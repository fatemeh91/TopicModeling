review/text: It reeks like plastic. I read another review that mentioned several washes will neutralize it. I washed it 4 times the day I received it and the smell is faint but still obvious to me. I don't use harsh laundry soap but ecofriendly mixed with borax. I decided to place it underneath my sheet as my sheets are more comfortable than the pad, plus it helps hide the plastic smell. I got this for bed protection from my toddler whom I bedshare with and I like the 52" so it covers more area if my boy rolls around. Another complaint I have is that it retains heat. We have a temperpedic bed that retains heat as is, so this is just overkill. My child sweats a whole lot at night since we've been using it. It would be perfectly fine during winter, but summertime, not so much. I'd love to find a breathable pad but have had no luck yet. This pad is okay and will do for now but I don't know how much longer I can deal with the extra heat. I will say that it isn't noisy and it doesn't move much, but like I said, I placed it underneath the sheet.
