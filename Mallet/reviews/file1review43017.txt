review/text: After knee surgery I had a single unit washer dryer combination installed in a smallish bedroom closet for laundering my personal clothing. Storing the needed products became a nuisance. I like the convenient smaller size container of concentrated, low suds detergent (required for the unit) fitting on the shelf just over the unit. Plus, I am very satisfied with the cleaning results. I can now get to the basement to my large washer and dryer for my household linens,etc , but I still like to do my clothing in the combination unit.
