review/text: I bought a Summer Infant Best View baby monitor in Oct.2010 and while charging, it got incredibly hot and and then would only work when plugged in. It was a pretty expensive item to only last about 8 months. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it used regular rechargeable batteries, but one of them had obviously flamed out. It was totally blackened and had melted a good part of the battery compartment. I bought these Sony batteries hoping that the bad battery hadn't destroyed anything. These battery appear to be a direct replacement for the originals and charged up and have been working great for a few days. Hopefully they will last at least another 8 months. Overall a pretty cheap fix for the downed baby monitor.
