review/text: I have used this product to treat chronic stress-induced muscle tightness. This product supplies a gentle warmth to my neck, shoulders and upper back at the same time. I have had success heating the product in the microwave according to the instructions. I fold the cervical collar into thirds and place on a paper towel in the center of the microwave. I heat it in the microwave for the full 45 seconds, flip it over and heat again for 45 seconds, then let it rest in place for 1 minute. I get a nice even heat. I enjoy wearing the collar two ways: using the velcro tabs with the collar worn around my neck as directed, and also by wearing the collar open with the top placed at the base of my neck and the sides draped forward over my shoulders. In this position, the product warms the area between the shoulder blades up to the base of the neck and along the top of both shoulders. As mentioned in other reviews, there is an odor when the product is heated that gradually disappears over time, but it has never been enough of an annoyance to outway the benefits I have experienced from using the product.
