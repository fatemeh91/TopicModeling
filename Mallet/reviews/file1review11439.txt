review/text: This is a cheaply made, flimsy product. The one I received has the holes for the width adjustment in the wrong place so the securing pop-up bottons don't work. The height adjustment for the arms is only for the front of the arms. If you lower the height the arms slope down! The height of the back of the arms is not adjustable. Very poor design.
