review/text: I've been taking this stuff for approximately a week. It does help me meet my protein intake goal and it tastes pretty decent.I don't like milk so I drink it with a small bottle of blue Gatorade followed by a glass of water. If you want to just mix this with water...be warned. It does not taste very good in water.Again, with some gatorade this is very drinkable.
