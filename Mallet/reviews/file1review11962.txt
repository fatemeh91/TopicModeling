review/text: I have been taking these vitamins for almost a year now, and I have been very satisfied with this product. Previous to purchasing them, I was taking a daily multivitamin without iron, and a separate iron pill. The iron pill always seemed to do a number on my stomach and often made me nauseated. I have had zero stomach upset from these vitamins, and they still contain 167% of my daily iron needs. I am a vegan who follows a mostly organic, whole foods diet, but take a daily vitamin as extra insurance that I am getting everything that I need. As well, we are planning to start a family in the not-to-distant future so taking a prenatal vitamin is a good idea for me right now. It is recommended that women start taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid three months before conceiving, so if pregnancy is in your near future don't hesitate to start taking them now.I love the subscribe and save program offered by amazon for this product. It pretty much guarantees that I won't ever run out of vitamins, and they are delivered right to my mailbox at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended!!
