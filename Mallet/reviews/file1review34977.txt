review/text: I've gone through one bottle of this product over about 5 months -- so not using it regularly. I found it did seem to settle my stomach for occasional heartburn that was not persistent, most typically prompted by tea, coffee or spicy food. My method for trying it was usually once a day before breakfast. I occasionally added a second dose before dinner or at bedtime. The package directions indicate maximum of 3 per dayI have not notice any side effects from my infrequent usage. I do notice that glycine is included, which may have biologic action -- not too surprisingly making it harder to attribute my response solely to DGL. I did track my blood pressure for awhile and did not find any particular pattern of change. However, obviously my observations were not double-blinded, they were performed in only one person, and I am typically normotensive. So I am UNable to confirm the reported benefit of DEGLYCYRRHIZINATED forms of licorice being blood pressure neutral for everyone.I am satisfied enough to return and purchase again. I tried the fructose free/sugarless versionDGL- Fructose Free/Sugarless 100 tabsand am not as pleased. In principle, I like the concept of going sugarless, BUT . . . This one tastes much more intensely like licorice with no chocolate masking. Unfortunately perhaps, licorice has never been a preferred flavor for me. Worse yet, a serving size for this product is 2 pills rather than one -- so double the taste I'd rather skip. More importantly, the sugarless form of the product even at only one pill per serving has at times produced a burning sensation in my esophagus -- particularly if I don't consume enough water with it. The carrier ingredients are slightly different -- unknown if that is why. Maybe some buffer is missing.
