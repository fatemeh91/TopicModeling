review/text: My poor husband gets cold sores when he is out in the sun, especially if out on the water. He felt it coming on & it was a douzy! So painful he had trouble sleeping & he was drinking through a staw to keep from injuring it more. I found this product at the grocery store in the Health food section, & he said the pain relief was immediate. Today it looks SO much smaller & he has no pain. Will definiely get more so he can keep it with him at all times. Will recommend to others!
