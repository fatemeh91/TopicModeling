review/text: I recently purchased this item for my mother. It is an adequate height to provide additional comfort and convenience. The inner circumference of this seat extends deep enough into the toilet bowl that there does not appear to be any likelihood of waste splashing or leaking over the rim. However, the most important aspect which needs to be considered with these seats is safety and stability. None of the similar units I looked at securely lock to the existing toilet. It would seem to me that a design which allowed for bolting the raised seat to the toilet through the standard seat hinge holes would be far more secure. The design of the so-called locking mechanism on this Carex seat is a very narrow ridge at the back which fits under the interior rim of the toilet and, in the front, a narrow sliding clamp with a soft plastic face which presses against the inner surface of the rim. The front clamp is on a threaded plastic rod with a tightening knob on the front of the seat. These provide some friction, at best (consider that the interface is plastic on ceramic), and can be dislodged with very little pressure. When getting on or off the toilet, if uneven weight is placed on any portion of the rim, it is very likely the unit will tip, creating a significant fall risk. The addition of the arms magnifies the hazard, as they provide additional leverage. I would strongly suggest that for safety one of the external frame units with a commode seat would be far more appropriate. (Note that this is an edited and much more negative revision of my original review of this item, based on more experience in use. Also, note that if the patient has a documented medical condition affecting their stability, Medicare may pay for an external frame unit.)
