review/text: I have shopped around for two days for a brace the prevents nearly 100% of side to side movement and this is the ONLY model and brand that I have found that that offers this. I have a fit issue though, so I have not settled on this one. I have a female size 9 foot with large cankles (fat ankles). This comes in size s-xl. I am between L and XL. The L fits the best in the back and under the foot, but toung only covers 1.3 of the front of my foot. The XL is longer under foot so it hits the underside of the front pad on my foot which causes irritation, but the metal says seem to be in a better position. Both laced up fine, but it is really annoying that the measurement on all brand is not the measurement of you heel to top of ankle because that is wear it must fit tight and how all the specialists are actually measuring. If I end of this one I will probably go with the L and add a bit of foam to the front under the laces so I don't get cut up. The other great thing about this model is that it is canvas so you foot doesn't slip around and the laces are cotton so they don't cut into your leg like nylons laces. If you don't need ZERo side to side stability I found that OTC's other model with the form fit plastic stays instead of this metal fits EXCELLENTLY and was the only model that fit well of 12 brands tested. I was an XL in this model, the OTC Ankle stabilizer w heel locking straps . I wish I was strong enough for that one, but not yet.
