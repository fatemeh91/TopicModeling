review/text: I have particularly difficult body hair - shaving causes constant problems with ingrown hairs, waxing costs too much over the long term, plucking is incredibly time-consuming, I've tried electrolysis and laser hair removal...none have worked in any marginally satisfying way.I bought this product six months ago as a last-ditch effort to tame my petulant body hair, having always been afraid of a machine that would rip out my hair. Honestly, I have rarely been as happy with a purchase. I have had three friends buy this product because it is so effective and so very worth it.Word to the wise: it hurts A LOT the first two times you use it, after that you can hardly tell it's doing anything. I actually have to get a mirror and check my underarms because I can't tell anymore if everything is gone. Not only that, it does what it promises and you never get ingrown hairs and razor burn is a thing of the past, it is virtually pain free after the first two times and seems to work on any part of the body you try it on. And I have tried all of them. I have abandoned razors entirely because this is such a satisfying alternative. Things look precise, clean and smooth, and the results last for about a week before you need to take five-ten minutes for cursory maintenence, which is basically painless with the world's easiest cleanup. Like I said, I've never had a problem with swelling, ingrown hairs, excessive pain, I've never been cut in any way - I am so happy I got this.When you first turn the machine on and see the thing spinning, you think to yourself, "Someone actually expects me to put this demonic little machine to my body?" Like I said, the first two times you want to break the stupid thing, or throw it in a drawer and never use it again, but wait until the third time and you will see exactly how great this little device is. It really changes your whole approach to personal grooming, because now it becomes basically without hassle or mess.
