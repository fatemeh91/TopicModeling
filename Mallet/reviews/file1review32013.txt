review/text: Perfect Food is (nearly) perfect. They advertise as "Great tasting greens" and they could not be further from the truth BUT it's a great product for your health. Great energy and I'm the only one of my family of 6 who has not been sick this winter. Need I say I'm the only one who takes it?
