review/text: dont bother wasting your money this crap is not lube its lotion, ingredents are the exact same as lotion it is not water soluble and to wash off you have to really scrub with soap and hot water and even after that my hands still felt greasy sure it feels good at first but i had to really work hard to get off, this is sold at other sites as a novilty item now i know why this crap is a joke
