review/text: Summit DM06N 12oz Dishwasher MagicI thought my dishwasher was a goner. Most of the dishes had to be rewashed by hand, or they were badly streaked. I read a review for this product on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. My dishes are clean and glasses are crystal clear. I'm going to be purchasing a few more of these for the future.
