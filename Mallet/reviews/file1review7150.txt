review/text: This shaver shaves closer than any shaver I have ever used. I also have a Wahl hair cutting kit that works equally well. Both are made in the USA. The price for both were very reasonable. I think that the rest of the makers of shavers (all foreign) will have a hard time beating Wahl for price, performance, and even for customer service that I see other reviewers have mentioned.
