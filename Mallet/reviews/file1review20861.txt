review/text: First off, I quite using the self-cleaning system when the included fluid ran out. It was pointless and too expensive to buy refills. But I found the shaver itself rather mediocre. It requires running over a patch of skin several times from different angles in order to get all the hairs.A razor might be faster and would definitely be less annoying. The only reason I still use this is that I shave frequently enough that busting out shaving cream is too much of a mess/hassle.My advice: buy something without a self-cleaning system and spend a little more money to get something nicer.
