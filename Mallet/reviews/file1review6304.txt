review/text: I've tried many different forms of vitamin C, and I'm convinced that Meta-C is the best, especially if you want to take larger amounts. I've had chronic joint pain problems clear up quickly and permanently with a high enough dosage. And it was the fastest way I knew to accelerate healing of colds and flu, until I upped my Vitamin D to 5000/day - now I just never get those anymore! It's odd to me that Meta-C is so unknown and difficult to find, many other web retailers who carry other nutribiotic products don't carry it. The company should market it better, it's truly wonderful.
