review/text: I have a hard time sleeping with even the tiniest bit of light and this mask is the best I have tried (and I've tested dozens over the years). It's made out of lightweight foam so it hardly feels like there is anything on your face. The extra space for your eyes to blink and move is a revelation after being used to masks where the material is pulled tight over your eyelids. I've noticed in other comments that people are having an issue with light leaking in around the edges. For me, this was easily remedied by tightening the mask using the velcro strap - and it was still very comfortable to wear.The only potential drawback is that after about 3-4 months of nightly use the fabric will start to separate from the foam. This is tolerable until so much of it comes off that it wrinkles up on your face. At this point I usually trade out for a new mask. This isn't really an issue for me as I feel you get your money's worth.
