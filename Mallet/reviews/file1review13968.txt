review/text: This thermofitting teeth whitening tray system is no more than the typical heat-moulded athletic mouthguards you can find at any Wal-Mart or K-Mart store. If you have any experience with these mouthguards, you will find that they do not fit the teeth precisely, no matter how much care you take in moulding them. This is the crucial defect in this tray-system, as with any tooth whitening procedure, you need a carrier tray that is intimately moulded to your teeth. Without a good fitting tray, the bleaching material will leak out potentially causing chemical burns of the gums and other oral tissues.As a dentist I want to ensure that the tray the patient uses is a tight-fitting custom-moulded tray that will not leak.Buyer beware. You may get a good tray using this system and you may not. The stronger the bleaching material, the more the risk of leakage causing gum burning. Some people report this system works and others say it does not. Operator proficiency in moulding the trays to fit the teeth is likely the cause of success of failure. If the trays do not work for you, consider having your dentist make a custom-moulded tray. This will ensure that the bleaching gel will not leak out or get on the sensitive gum tissues. Yes, it will put a dent in your bank account, but it will not likely cause damage to your gum tissue.Buyer beware.konedog
