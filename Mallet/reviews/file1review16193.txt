review/text: This is not the best sponge but it is also not the worst sponge. It is not really soft but it isn't hard either so this is not the problem. The problem with that sponge is that the handle is too big. I used it for my back and because of the long handle it was hard to reach up where my neck is. And that handle looked cheap so I was afraid it would break but it lasted the four months I used it without breaking (i made a couple of small holes in the sponge but that was not the end of the world). I purchased three and I don't regret having two more of these sponges.
