review/text: The Thermoskin line of gloves surpasses my wildest expectations for a glove that relieves arthritis pain. I gave the gloves as a gift to a friend, and since she has received them, they have not come off her hands except to eat and shower. Comfortable and effective, from putting heat into the hand to making it possible to hold cold objects without pain, the Thermoskin gloves are a must have for anyone seeking relief from arthitis pain.
