review/text: I ordered the lavender balm along with the AOS lavender shaving cream (which i like) and was disappointed in the moisturizing capabilities of the balm.Although the smell is fantastic it didn't calm my sensitive skin at all. I have switched back to my old, cheaper standby (Gillette for sensitive skin).Edit- I now use this balm after first applying another product first to calm my skin. I then apply AOS lavender balmand have found that it works well as a sealing layer that has the added benefit of smelling terrific, so I feel fine now about having bought this product.
