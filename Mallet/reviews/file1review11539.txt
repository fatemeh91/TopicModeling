review/text: A total waste of money. I bought 8 Duracell rechargeable batteries from this vendor(NY Electronics). The batteries do not hold the charge. If the camera has not been used for a week or so and I pick it to shoot something interesting, it is so disappointing and frustrating to find out that the batteries are absolutely dead. I am reporting this to the Duracell Company.
