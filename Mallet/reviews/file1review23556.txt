review/text: I like the clean, elegant design and heavy, solid feel of this mirror. It looks nice on my bathroom counter. The three magnifications give it extra versatility -- great for putting on makeup, or for situations where you need extra close visibility, like getting a lash out of your eye (which happened to me just recently, and the high magnification inset made removing the offending object easier than ever).Although there are three levels of brightness provided by the built in illumination, they range from dim to really dim, unlike my previous 60s-era mirror that lit up the entire house and was probably visible from space. I rely on ambient lighting-assist with my new mirror.The on/off and brightness levels are controlled by tapping the base, which is fast and easy, almost too easy as it is common to touch it accidentally. I'm getting used to quickly tapping the base three times to get back to where I was when this happens.Overall, I'm very happy with this lovely, versatile mirror. The built-in light could be a little brighter, but it looks great, and it's got the magnification requirements well covered.
