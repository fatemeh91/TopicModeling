review/text: A friend recommended these pills to me. Definitely not the cure to the common cold, but I find that when I follow the guidelines mentioned on the bottle, the pills work wonders. When I was a kid, I must have gotten sick at least every other month...just to keep me in school, I took antibiotic after antibiotic. As an adult, I'll try anything before antibiotics and I find that with Wellness Formula, my overall health has improved. It is important to take these pills at the very first sign of your cold (for me, a sore throat). Either your symptoms will disappear or you cold will last a couple of days instead of a couple of weeks. The odor of these pills is very strong and the pills are huge (not for the weak of heart) so it is important to take the pills with ample amounts of water and preferably a meal. If you take them on an empty stomach, you won't feel so good (like with many antibiotics). Thank you Source Naturals!
