review/text: First off ON gold standard protein is the best on the market. Hands down. You won't find another brand out there offering its protein packed with BCAAs and almost 5g of glutamine. Sure it costs a bit more, but when you consider quality, the cost/benefit ratio of ON gold standard FAR outweighs competitors. Plus they're low cal, low sugar, low fat. Just amazing.Taste: I've tried vanilla, banana cream, and rocky road.1. Banana SUCKS! (Granted this was ON casein protein, but still) Stay away from it at all costs.2. Vanilla - acceptable, tastes fine with water or milk. Good base for making smoothies3. Rocky road - the BEST standalone whey protein I've ever tasted. Just add water or milk and it tastes amazing.Final word of advice: pick up a tub of whey and another of casein. Take the casein prior to bed for a slow burn that will keep the body anabolic throughout the night. Take the whey just about any other time you need to supplement. It metabolizes extremely fast and gets to the muscles quick.Don't mess with the other BS protein schemes. Just stick with casein and whey. best of both worlds and you can even mix them for an immediate recovery shake with sustained energy.
