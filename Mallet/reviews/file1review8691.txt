review/text: I bought these to replace an old pair of Rubis combination tweezers, but they just don't compare. (My Rubis still work, but are a little beat because I used them for things other than the intended use.) The Tweezerman tip is larger, and doesn't come together as well. The stainless steel material is not as heavy as the Rubis. They might do the job, but I returned them and will order another Rubis for the quality. These measure approx. 3 3/4" length.
