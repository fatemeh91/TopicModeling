review/text: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!! The tub is made of PVC vinyl which is also known as the "poison plastic". PVC is NOT a safe material. Please read up on PVC and it's effects on the human body if you aren't sure about it. I think you will be blown away by what you read. I contacted the company and they said that this tub meets government regulations. Unbelievable that the government doesn't insist that companies use safer materials for the children and the environment.
