review/text: I'll concur with others on the closest shave yet. The head is massive but it glides really well. I completely disagree about the blade on the back being useless. Without that blade, which cuts very close safely, I would not be able to cut my mustache area due to the size of the head. When compared to the Mach3 which you had to use for this area the closeness is not even in the same league. That's my problem area for closeness and so far the Fusion is the best I've used. My only con is how damn expensive the blades are. I'm trying my best to only use 2 a month, shaving every other day and none on the weekends, but that's about the best I can do. That works out to about $6 a month just to shave. I'm going to have to start growing a beard year round and walking to work pretty soon with all of the astronomical increases in prices. What option do you have though?
