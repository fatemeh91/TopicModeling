review/text: I'm mainly using it for strength gain and not rehabilitation...though I work in computers so this could help prevent carpal tunnel by strengthening my forearms. I got the green and I am going to purchase the next size up. Its good to start on the green to get the rhythm down on how to do the Tyler Twist exercises and ensure I am perfect in executing them. When I get the next size up I will not have to focus on technique as much as getting a workout now.My only issue is it does wear my hands down a bit so I have weight lifting gloves to protect my hands from getting blisters/severe callus.
