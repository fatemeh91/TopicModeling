review/text: This cream doesn't come in a tube like this picture shows but I'm here to write about how this cream treated my psoriasis. I've been suffering from psoriasis for about a good 6 years now and still suffer. I've used this product hoping for some relief and skin clear up. I have psoriasis on my face and I've used this product. Umm big mistake to put on your face because it BURNS!! I swim in salt water and lay out in the sun to help my psoriais. But this product turned my face even more red than it already is. I figured this lotion would help to clear up some of the patches so I could use foundation to cover the redness. Nope because a little later my skin started peeling from the product. It works great if you have a really bad itch and you don't want to scratch all you do is apply this stuff! Because you'll soon be in tears from the burning. It does say on the bottle you will experience a tingling sensation. But that doesn't mean it tickles or that it feels like a tingler in the tanning bed. Well just to let you know I'm still on the hunt for a good product and this didn't help. :(
