review/text: Like some of the other reviewers I use these lint-remover refills daily to remove loose fur from my family's cats and dogs. They don't mind my rolling the item lightly over their fur, and since the fur adheres to the roller, it does not float through the house where it could reestablish itself in the food and on the furniture. A dozen of these refills are very reasonably priced here at Amazon. Highly recommended.
