review/text: This is a good product, worth it if its on sale but I wouldn't pay more than $20. Its durable, has a good feel, length and width, but it smells really strongly of PVC! Don't get it if that bothers you, I left mine in a bag with some baking powder for a few days and that helped some, but not all the way.
