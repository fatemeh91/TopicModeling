review/text: It's taken me over a month to get around to writing this review simply because I have been too busy using the Back Buddy. It is AMAZING!I saw my massage therapist use one at my chiropractors office a while ago, then stumbled upon this one on Amazon. I asked my Chiro if he could order one, he said sure, for $75. Told him I saw this one for $35, he said to try it out.It takes a little getting used to, and a lot of trial and error to use it correctly, the instructions are just a bunch of pictures of someone using it don't worry the learning curve isn't steep, but when you find the good spots... it is great! The "S" curves are a little tight for bigger people, I'm 6'2" 275lbs and it just fits me. And I ruined a good suitcase stuffing it in on a trip. I see they have a portable one which may go on my wish-list.So what are waiting for, buy it already!
