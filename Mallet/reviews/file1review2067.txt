review/text: I purchased this item after reading a couple of reviews on Amazon and agree that it is an excellent tool for post-bunion surgery. After 25 years of the muscles and ligaments shortening on the one side of the big toe, it helps to achieve some stretch when I am not walking on it. I use it in at night and it does not interfere with my sleeping. It is made of good quality materials and I appreciate the ability to stretch it further by tightening the velcro. Components: sturday plastic bar lined with thick foam at big toe and a thick, faux suede material over the bunion. Overall: highly recommend!
