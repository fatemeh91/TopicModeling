review/text: The thumb opening is too tight; there's a piece of the appliance that hangs out below the wrist wrap serving no apparent purpose; and the entire unit does not come down low enough on your wrist or wrap it tightly enough to do any good. If it wasn't such a hassle to return stuff, I'd return it.
