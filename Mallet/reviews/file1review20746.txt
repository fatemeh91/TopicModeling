review/text: I've been using a rotary electric shaver since I started shaving half a life-time ago. I always hated shaving, which I why I sometimes skip a day or two. But with a day or two of extra growth, it was always painful to shave.A few years back I tried a screen shaver (don't remember the brand), and found that it missed a bunch of hairs, so I stuck with a rotary.But now that I've tried the Braun 8585, I have to say that I love it. Not only does it not hurt to shave after skipping a couple of days, it actually gives my skin a nice tingly feeling. And now I shave more often, just because it's such a pleasure now. Plus, it gives a closer shave than the rotary, and in half the time, and it misses no hairs.The self-cleaning feature is a nice bonus.The only drawback I can think of is that its lights are bright--I have a clear view from the bed into the bathroom, and at night the lights on the shaver are too bright. The solution is simple, though--I keep it facing toward the wall.I highly recommend this one.
