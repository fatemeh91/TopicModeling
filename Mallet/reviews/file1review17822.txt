review/text: After wearing hard lenses for nearly 40 years, I was suddenly suffering from red, weepy, painful eyes. My optometrist had told me he suspected that I developed an allergy to Boston solutions and told me to try Clear Care which helped but did not give me total relief. I discovered the Optimum line by doing some online research. My progressive RGP lenses are once again comfortable and wearable all day for 12-16 hours. I wish that it were more readily available at consistent prices but am thankful to Lobob because without the Optimum line, my contact lens wearing days would be over!
