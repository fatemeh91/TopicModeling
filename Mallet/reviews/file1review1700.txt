review/text: If you've smelled tea tree oil, you might think this product will not smell very good but it really does. It has a type of minty smell while showering and the tea tree oil smell does not cling to you after your shower.This soap works very well if your skin is prone to fungal infections. Works on feet and is an effective all over body wash. I'm really pleased to find products that just do what they say they will do and this is one of them.
