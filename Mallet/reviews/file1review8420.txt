review/text: It's a BRUSH! There's really not too much else to say.I think it works great for what I bought it for... Washing the inside of 32 oz. Nalgene wide mouth water bottles.The handle is long enough so the entire brush doesn't have to be in the bottle to wash the bottom.It seems to be pretty sturdy plastic. Great purchase.
