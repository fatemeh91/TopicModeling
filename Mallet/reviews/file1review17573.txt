review/text: When I got this trimmer I was enthusiastic. For as long as I had beentrimming my beard I had mostly used another remimgton unit (smallsilver remimgton with several heads and a base that you can stick acharger through). My older trimmer would give me uneven cuts andwouldn't cut short enough. When I saw reviews for this, I figured Iwould give it a shot. After I charged the unit I was shocked to seethat this guy trimmed my beard fantastically. Although, I still needto do some supplemental work around the beard line, this was easilythe best trimmer I had ever used. However, there are two things aboutthis model that I do not like: Cleanup and Battery. You cannot cleanthis unit with water, you have to brush loose hairs out or blow themout. This unit lets you flip open the blades to remove hairs thathave accumulated under the blades. The problem is that under theblades resides a gunk that allows the components to move easily. Iwasn't sure what to do- wipe off the gunk or blow away as much aspossible. Whichever the case, the inside of the trimmer will alwayshave stray hairs in it. My second and most important gripe is the battery. Mine can no longer hold a charge after only two months. I am not sure why you cannot plug and use this trimmer but it doesnt charge when the power is on. This is a problem I had with my older trimmer and a few others- why can't you charge and use? Overall, this was a good trimmer while it was able to keep a charge(2 months). I'm not sure what my options are. I know I can't return it to Amazon- maybe I can get a replacement battery.
