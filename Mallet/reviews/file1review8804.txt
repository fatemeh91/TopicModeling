review/text: I recently was diagnosed with colon cancer. After surgery I had to take 30 radiation treatments. I was exhausted, so I went to a healthfood store seeking advice. I was told about Green Vibrance. I decided to try a packet. I did notice a difference in my energy level. I went back to the store and purchased the largest jar they had. I took it through my treatments and it helped a lot. Since treatments I would forget to take it once in a while and would feel tired. I now take it daily and can tell you it positively works. I have since stopped an expensive fruit and vegetable capsule I'd taken for years and switched totally to Green Vibrance. I'm sold on it. Thank you Green Vibrance!
