review/text: I have worn a blindfold while sleeping for years, because I don't like being woken by the sun in the morning. I needed to replace my old blindfold, and I found this one online. I've used it for a few nights (I wear it all night), and it works great. It is comfortable, adjustable, and lets virtually no light in. My only complaint is that it's not machine-washable.
