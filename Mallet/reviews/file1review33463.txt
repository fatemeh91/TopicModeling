review/text: Have been pleased with the WaterPik so far (in use less than a month). This one doesn't have as much pressure as previous models. There are design flaws that haven't been addressed: where the water tube comes outside from the pump, the stiffness of the tube causes stress that eventually caused the tube to break on the previous model. So far, I'm pleased with this unit.
