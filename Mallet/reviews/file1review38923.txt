review/text: I found the razors worked well, but as I have sensitive skin they were a bit rough. I did research and found they also make a razor with an added aloe strip so you may want to go with that product. They worked as long as other disposables and were very easy to grip -- not those smooth handles that some razors have that slip from your hands when you're in the shower. Overall, I'd recommend them.
