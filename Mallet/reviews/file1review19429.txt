review/text: If ever there was an advertisement for snake-oil, this would be it. We purchased this exact product and found the following:* It didn't work at all. Saw a cockroach within the first 48hrs of switching it on. Had no effect on the rodent that was scratching away under our house either.* The noise it makes is audible to humans and quite annoying - similar to that of a TV with a faulty tube. Our cat noticed it immediately and apparently did not like it.Our rodent problem grew worse until one day it finally made its way into our house - right beside the Pest Repeller. Evidently it was not phased at all by the noise, the "high tech digital pulses", or indeed the fancy blue night light. Our cat, however, made short work of the rodent. I wish I'd spent the money on treats for him instead of this useless device.In short, don't bother with this or any of the other products on the market. Consumer tests have since shown that high-pitched noises don't seem to affect rats, mice, or insects, so this is technically a falsely advertised product. Save your money. Get a cat. Buy a blue night light for less than a tenth of this.If Amazon would have let me, I would have given it 0 stars.
