review/text: I think this is a great product. I use it as a nutritional meal replacement/snack. It contains a little bit of everything to keep me going when I don't have time to eat a well balanced meal, and on top of it all it tastes great. This shake is a great way to "eat" something healthy and stay fueled when you're on the go... good value, good flavor, good nutrition. There really isn't anything negative I could say about this product. Perhaps one could complain about too many calories coming in the form of sugars, but for my purposes the extra carbs only add to the "well-balanced" formula.
