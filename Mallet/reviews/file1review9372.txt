review/text: I initially bought 2 of these-one for my daughter and one for me. It's perfect to send a couple of days worth of pills off with my daughter when she visits grandma for the weekend as 2 different pills are the same shape and color and they need to be taken twice a day (really easy to confuse them).Then grandma saw it and commented that it was perfect for her larger pills she takes twice daily so I bought one for her. Now her friends are all over it and wanting one!
