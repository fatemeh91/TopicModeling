review/text: I liked that the pads were long enough for effective protection. I also liked that there was only one backing to peel off the wings, and that the backing was on top. It was much easier to navigate than some others where you have to peel off two backings and they're on the underside which is difficult to see. In some respects, I wish they were thicker. I would've felt more comfortable with the protection, although the thinness was more physically comfortable.
