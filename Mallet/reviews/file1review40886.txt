review/text: Thursday Plantation is the premiere purveyor of tea tree oil products, and gets a plus in my book because of their sustainable forestry and wildland management practices - I go through at least six sticks a day so ordering in bulk makes a lot of sense for me - The chewing sticks helped me to stop biting my nails, they up my 'cool quotient' and they keep my breath fresh - The flavor is intense and it lasts,and the sticks don't 'splinter' when they're chewed unlike some other brands - Tea Tree Chewing Sticks are good for your health, so try 'em, for your health!
