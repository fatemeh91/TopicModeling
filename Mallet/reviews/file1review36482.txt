review/text: Love this product. I have been buying it for over 2 years now, and it lasts most of the day. I mostly love it for the scent - it's like a perfume! I don't wear most perfumes because they give me headaches (probably from the synthetic ingredients), so this kills 2 birds with one stone. If you are looking for something that will cover up smelly armpits, go for this. If you are an extremely active person like me, you may want to reapply after a super sweaty exercise session.
