review/text: I can't comment on the body fat performance of the scale execpt to say the results are consistent. I don't have anything to verify the fat function against. But if you want to know how much you weigh then this is the scale for you. It's good, maybe too good. It picks up on all the minor weight fluctuation my body goes through in a day. It will even pick up on something as subtle as a glass of water or a trip to the restroom. The weight ranges of the users in my household are 110-225 lbs. and when I checked it against a balance beam scale it as within .2 lbs and as long as I keep it away from temperature extremes the results are always repeatable. Now for the bad news. The scale only has memory for two users and doesn't possess a simple weight only function. Anybody else in the house who wants to weigh themselves must log in as a guest and enter in a bunch of values before they are able to use the scale. This is annoying. It is not user freindly and new users have to be shown how to use it. The previous model had a button people could push to access a weight only function. I very much would like to have that feature back, so if there are more than than two of you then you might be happier with a scale with more memory slots. I will say that I've been through quite a few scales and I have found nothing that comes close to the weight accuracy of my sample in this price range. My comments only apply to the 2201 and please don't assume that I'm suggesting that the weight accuracy of all Tanita products is this good because I don't beleive they are. Thanks to all of you who contribute to these reveiws I've found the information quite helpful!
