review/text: My kids LOVE the body sock we ordered from School Specialty via Amazon.com. It is great for calming frazzled nerves and helping my middle son cope with sensory integration problems. Now we trim his nails while he is in the body sock, and he tolerates it much better. An unexpected benefit - it helps him settle down for sleep at bedtime. Sometimes he sleeps in it all night long. I high recommend this item for kids with sensory issues.
