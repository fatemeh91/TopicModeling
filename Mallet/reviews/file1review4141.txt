review/text: I am not sure what it is, but these blades seem to wear out faster than the ones I buy from grocery stores. I thought I'd get some genuinely good blades since they were in these 'factory packs', but I guess they are not. I will going back to buying from the store and when someone does come with a better blade, I will drop Gilette altogether
