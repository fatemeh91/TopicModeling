review/text: I will prepare a video review for everyone to see what I am really talking about. It says in the leaflet inside your new Tech3 that Cross offers a lifetime as stated on their website as well: "The Cross guarantee extends our assurance of a lifetime of writing pleasure to every owner of a Cross writing instrument through our warranty against mechanical failure, regardless of its age.". Well, I recently sent 2 of these pens back to Cross for repair. They aharged me $10 per each pen, and what I got is JUNK. They were not repaired, they hardly work, the rotating mechanism does not work, it is a complete lie that they are guaranteed. In addition the Satin Chrome pen I purchased last December is starting to peel off the Satin Chrome finish... Beware. It is good while it lasts, once it fails, throw it away. AND NEVER TRY CONTACTING THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE, UNLESS YOU HAVE INFINITE PATIENCE, LOTS OF FREE TIME AND NO SELF RESPECT!!!
