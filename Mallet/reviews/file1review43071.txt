review/text: I'm in the last weeks of my twin pregnancy, and I cannot say to just about everyone that asks, "How are you doing it?"... My answer is this product! I've been able to keep somewhat of a life and manage the pain of carrying twins (who by the way, are measuring and have always measured very big, 87% for one of my boys!)... I have not been placed on bedrest, have managed my back problems and amazingly enough have still been able to spend quality time with my toddler throughout my pregnancy. I say, for those reasons alone, I was more than willing to put up with the straps showing through most my clothes, which might be the biggest con to this product. I didn't feel that was a big deal, and if you really needed to, you could just pin the straps so they do not show. I became a full blown fan of this product when I began to wear it daily during my 6th month, when we went to a vacation in San Diego. I was fully able to enjoy Seaworld, the beach, downtown San Diego and even do shopping. If I didn't have this product, I'm convinced that the quality time during my pregnancy would have been much, much different. I so highly recommend this product to mother's of multiples or any mommy-to-be that has discomfort during their pregnancy. Good luck!!!
