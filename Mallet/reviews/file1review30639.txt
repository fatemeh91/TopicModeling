review/text: Down right the best razor I could have purchased. Before purchasing the Merkur DE I was getting razor burn from the multi-blade cartridges. I tried everything, pre-shave ointments, steaming, creams, gels, different shaving lubricants, I mean everything. Finally I got fed up with having horrible razor burn and ingrown hairs, especially on my neck. I was originally going to go with a straight edged cut throat razor but the more research I did the more I wanted to purchase a Double Edge. I kept looking and this was the razor of choice. I use it with "Derby Extra" Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades and its the more comfortable shave I can get. Still perfecting shaving against the grain and not just pulling the hair out but I'll get there. The only con I can think of is the time it takes to learn to use a DE and the fact that I do have to shave a little more regularly since it doesn't pull the hair and then cut it like the multi-blade cartridges do. All in all more then I could have asked for, haven't had any razor burn yet. And how can you beat 5+ shaves with a $0.20 blade!
