review/text: This is a great cleaner that can be used like any powdered cleanser, but it smells great and is non-toxic. We had the beginnings of ant problems in our kitchen. They were coming from the windows behind the sink. I sprinkled a thin line of this cleanser in front of the windows and the ants wouldn't cross it. We no longer have an ant problem! I think it's the geranium fragrance that keeps them away.I also love this cleaner for cleaning the inside of pots and pans. It works as well as the bleach cleansers on my sink stains without the bleach.
