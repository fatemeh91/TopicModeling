review/text: So I almost purchased a portable handheld water pik just because I didn't want something taking up my counter space. I am really glad I didn't, after using this model I could only imagine how many times I would have had to refill the portable pik. Anyway, this is a really good product. Tthe size wasn't as bulky as I thought it might be and with the speed I use I can clean all of my teeth with one fill. The reservoir is a good size and the pik itself has various speeds to graduate into. If you have never used a water pik before, be prepared for a messy first experience. This one shoots out water in a pulsing action and they say to set it at its highest speed to prime the unit before each use so you are likely to get sprayed and spray your bathroom while you're at it. By the way, I find that it isn't always necessary to prime the unit at the highest setting. Often times if you have a deep enough sink; gravity will do most of the work for you if you point the pik down into the sink. If you hold the pik higher than the reservoir then it will be necessary to prime at a high setting. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the insanely loud tractor noise this thing pumps out. Another person did a pretty comical review of this model and mentioned how loud it was and something about a tractor I think and let me tell you, that reviewer wasn't far from the truth. So don't go flossing your teeth when everyone is in bed. Otherwise I think this was a great buy and have since become addicted to water piking my teeth on a very regular basis.
