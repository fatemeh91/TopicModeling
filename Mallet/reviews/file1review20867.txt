review/text: I got this shaver kit in November 2004 (it's now August 2005), and while the shaver has always performed quite nicely once I got used to it (I previously shaved with blades), the cleaning unit has always been kind of a pain. It's rather noisy to begin with, although that may be almost inevitable. Second, the 'three cleaning programs' that are advertised are all automatic--it chooses which one it thinks needs to be done, and the 'intensive' cleaning uses up a *lot* of fluid. The fluid cartridges have lasted me about six to eight weeks each, and I clean the shaver almost every day.The unfortunate thing is that now the cleaning unit has now ceased to clean, although it still charges the shaver. It started making funnier and funnier noises (different from the normal buzzing noise cycle it goes through) over the last few weeks and finally it just stuck in one particular noise for a long time (more than 20 minutes), and I finally shut it off. It was full of hair clippings and cleaning fluid, and once I wiped it out and tried to restart it, nothing happens. Nothing. So now I have a nice charging stand, but no cleaning.So, in summary, nice shaver, but unfortunately flimsy and cheap cleaning unit. Therefore... three stars from me.
