review/text: This was such a good deal!!! I wanted to try a heated curler and since this one was only $14, I had nothing to lose. But it takes practice to use this curler -- manufacturer's instuctions were too cryptic. It took me two practice runs to get it right. So if you're having a hard time, try this:1. Place wand under clean/dry lashes, right at the base with slots facing up towards the sky. This will ensure the heating elements are touching the lashes.2. Instead of just brushing up to the lash tip from the starting position, turn/rotate the barrel as you move the wand to the tip of your lashes so that by the time it's at the end, the heating elements are facing the floor.PRESTO! After a few sweeps, you'll have perfectly curled lashes.Why I like this product:It heats up fast...takes only a couple of seconds. There is a indicator light to tell you when it's on and another indicator at the tip of the brush to tell you when it's ready/hot. It's about the size of a big tube of mascara so it's easy to carry--you can't put one of those metal clamp curlers in your pocket. Unlike the clamps, you won't pinch yourself or yank out lashes accidentally. It's safe! The heat is only hot enough to curl your lashes and won't burn your skin. Initially, I was scared because since the skin around the eyes is so sensitive, the curler felt very hot when the wand came close to contact with skin. But even after my eyelids touched the heated wand, nothing happened.Why you should try it:This bulkier model is a good price ($14) for people who just want to try it, even though Emoji has a smaller/slimmer model that sells for $50. After seeing the results, I wouldn't hesitate upgrading to the Emoji Petite Heated Curler in the future.
