review/text: I'm a 26 year old man who suffered from cystic acne spots for most of my teen an adult life. Though it seems like the spots have stopped (thankfully!), deep, dark scars have remained in their place. I used this cream twice per day (morning and night) and by the third week, the scars are noticeably fading, some were completely gone. Twice per day might be too much for those with fairer skin; there was a time or two when I noticed some irritation and redness, but a bit of moisturizer helped a lot. Overall, a surprisingly effective product.
