review/text: Terribly sweet flavor, it kind of makes me want to spit it out, it's that terrible. I made a mistake by ordering this flavor instead of what I usually get - the Double Rich Chocolate. That one is delicious, you can mix 3 servings with 16 oz of milk and it is good. While Extreme milk is forcing me to use just 1 serving per 16 oz of milk, to be tolerable. I guess combining it with cereal or using it in some other way might make it less terrible.
