review/text: Well, its a kids review but I'm 21...Which is still a pretty young adult. Anyways..I have been using it for about 2 weeks so far. and so far i have lost 7 pounds...i did exactly as the directions said except i have been doing moderate exercise. you know talking an hour long walk or doing some aerobic dancing for 40 minutes. i changed my diet so that im eating less simple sugars especially in the carbohydrate area. i do about 20 minutes of some toning every other day and that is about it...it actually makes me eat a bit more than im use to but it makes me feel full eating anything i eat instead of select few foods. i drink a good amount of water a day too...it works best if ur drinking low sugar low sodium drinks. and you have to have an empty stomach when u do take it and it works great for me when i have an alarm clock set for exactly 6 hours later after the first one in the morning...mmm but i hit a plateau and this helped me get over it in my weightloss...it helps if ur not stressed out too a whole bunch...when im stressed i loose less weight with it...but Im loosing roughly half a pound every 2 days with it.
