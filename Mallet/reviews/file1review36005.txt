review/text: I've started taking l-arginine as part of Dr. Louis Ignarro's "NO more heart disease" program. This product is a good cost performer for l-arginine. The main drawback is the taste. This is the nastiest, most vile tasting substance I've ever consumed. I first tried mixing 2 tsp with a glass of water. Absolutely disgusting. Next day I tried mixing it with my morning protein shake, which in theory should have 16 oz of fluid + protein powder + berries masking the flavor. No dice. The l-arginine powder flavor dominated every other flavor and I had 16 oz of it to drink instead of 8. Then I tried mixing it with orange juice and couldn't even taste the orange juice. The past few days I've been "straight shotting" it. I mix 2 tsp of powder into a small dixie cup with about 2 oz of water and then chug it. Then I follow it with a shot of espresso or orange juice. That gets the flavor out of my mouth quickly, but it's still disgusting.The product has a strong "barnyard" taste -- 1/2 rotting meat and 1/2 "barn floor," if you know what I mean. My daughter said penicillin was the worst thing she'd ever tasted. I'd rather take penicillin than this.I've ordered the pills, which are more expensive and I'll have to take 5 of them, but hopefully they'll go down easier.
