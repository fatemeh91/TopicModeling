review/text: When I was looking to order henna I specifically wanted to order this brand because I had previous experience using it and it had worked well for me. When I recieved the product however, it was not Shweta brand, but Shelley. I intentionally did not order that brand because I was not familiar with it. Granted, I did recieve a tube of henna, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I also feel that it was a bit chunky and didn't stain exceptionally dark.
