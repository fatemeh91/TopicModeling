review/text: I had a case of shingles in fall 2012. Did a lot of reading and trying of lotions and potions. This particular cream helped the combo of itching and pain better for me than anything else. I had an old one in my cabinet and couldn't find it in stores. But... praise Amazon... i was able to order an adequate supply via my Amazon Prime account.
