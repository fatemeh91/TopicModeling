review/text: This is a great product to have for water bottles, travel mugs, coffee pots, etc. It's got a sturdy handle and the bristles are a nicely firm for cleaning in spots you can't get with your hand. I have these for my kitchen, my office (bowls, water bottles, coffee mugs) since they work so well. Price on Amazon is great too.
