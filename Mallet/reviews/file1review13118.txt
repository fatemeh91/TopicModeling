review/text: I have a condition that causes me to get overheated on a somewhat regular basis. So we have to keep a ready supply of ice packs readily available. As a result over the years I've used a variety of ice and heat packs. While there are a wide variety of different ice packs out there none of the other brands available are really designed to fit comfortably around the neck and keep the ice tolerable to the skin. So when I saw these Elasto-gel Cervical Collars I had to get some. My mom bought me two. I keep one in the freezer and one out to warm up for when the neck hurts.The directions recommend that you store them in the plastic bag that they come in to keep down potential mold and freezer smell absorption. I highly recommend you do this. After having others that did not come in a storage bag they do absorb freezer smell. So try storing any of the flexible gel-ice pack you plan on using on your body in a ziplock freezer bag. Your nose will appreciate this, especially if you are putting it around your neck right under your nose.As I stated I've had these now for over a year, and unlike other gel packs I've had despite frequent use and getting them in and out of the freezer (temperature changes), the gel has not broken down/solidified/crystallized. They are exactly the same as they were when I got them. No broken seams either.Now the bad point, they don't seem to hold their temperature as well as others. They either warm-up sooner or cool down quicker. I would say within about 5-7 minutes the one I keep in the freezer starts warming up. Which is fine for those times when I need a quick cool down, but not as effective if you are using it for therapy purposes (no 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off option). So I store the Ace Bandage ice packs as well, they seem to last longer, but that's because they get colder (I recommend NOT put these directly on the skin). But as I stated the Ace Bandage ones don't wrap around the neck as well even in the sleeves they come with and thus limit your abilities to do anything else but keep the ice pack on. Whereas with the cervical collar you strap it around your neck and you aren't limited.For those of us who have ever used a neck collar, this is EXACTLY what it feels like. I have a short neck so these have a tendency to ride high on my neck pressing into the bottom of my jaw and bottom of my ears. Thus it pretty much immobilizes my head when I use it.Unlike Ace and others, the outer sleeve is permanently attached, so you don't have to worry about separate storage. Has a decent Velcro strap that makes for easy readjustments and repeated use. Because the sleeve is already attached it does keep the bare icepack from touching the skin (a bonus in my opinion).________________________________________Pros________________________________________* Shelf-life is quite long* Sturdy, even after repeated use they hold up* Non-movement limiting, put it around neck and off you go* Good complete neck contact, conforms well (as designed)* Reasonably priced considering quality* Unlike Ace and others, the outer sleeve is permanently attached________________________________________Cons________________________________________* Warms up and cools down too quickly compared to other brands* Can be uncomfortable for those with shorter necks* Unlike Ace and others cannot be purchased in any store (no running to Walgreens or Wal-Mart)* Unlike Ace and others, the outer sleeve is permanently attached (some may see this as a con, I do not)________________________________________I hope this review helps and that the ice packs provide you as much comforts as they have for me.
