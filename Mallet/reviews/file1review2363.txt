review/text: Eighteen months ago, I was at a point where I could no longer look at a computer screen without my eyes literally ACHING. My vision was increasingly blurred, and reading was beyond my tolerance, other than for a few moments at a time. This was serious, serious stuff, since I'm an advanced graduate student and have several hundred pages of text to read each week! I finally couldn't tolerate the pain and went in to see my optometrist -- who discovered I had significant corneal scarring from severe dry eye syndrome. Left untreated, I was destined to lose my eyesight. I was immediately scheduled for two corneal surgeries, and I was prescribed Restasis, oil-based lubricants, and a thicker ointment for nighttime lubrication. Plus, my doctor recommended Theratears.For months, I literally applied drops every half hour throughout the day, and I faithfully used my Restasis and took these Theratears. My reading materials were enlarged to get me through my semester as I awaited surgery. It was a scary time, and I was discouraged, wondering if this would ever improve.A specialist removed the corneal scarring, and he echoed the sentiments of my optometrist about the use of all of these lubricants AND the Theratears. "It really does make a difference," he assured me. Worse case scenario, he added that we could consider tear duct plugs, if these measures didn't help.Eighteen months later, I've cut back to once-a-day use of the Restasis, and my multiple-times daily drops are a thing of the past. I still use the night ointment, but otherwise, I rely on Theratears.If you have severe dry eye syndrome, try this. My specialist even swears by them!
