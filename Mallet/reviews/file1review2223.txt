review/text: I used to own a Braun epilator (an old model from the 90's) in Europe and when I moved to US, I started looking for another one because of the voltage difference. I wanted to give Philips a try and I am very satisfied with it. I use epilator for my legs and my armpit. Epilating lasts longer and feels more comfortable than shaving. 5 stars!
