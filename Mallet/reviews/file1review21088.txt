review/text: This is hands down the best heating pad ever made... My husband has a back issue and this heating pad is a wonder for him. We highly recommend it for anyone with aches and pains. The only thing that sucks is you have to hold down the trigger to keep the pad heating up but we just put a rubber band around it to hold it down. Im not suggesting you do this as its made this way for safety reasons...but it works for us! Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!
