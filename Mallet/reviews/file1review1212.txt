review/text: I love these brushpicks, even though my dentist doesn't. I've always hated flossing, so when I found these, I rejoiced. These little devils get food particles out from between my teeth like nobody's business, and I'm very happy to have found an alternative to regular floss. At night, I follow the brushpick process with my Water Pik, and that takes care of cleaning my teeth as well as massaging my gums. I recommend this product.
