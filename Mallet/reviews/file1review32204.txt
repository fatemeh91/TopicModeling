review/text: I have used this 6" elastic wrap with Velcro end closures for years. The elastic seems to degrade at the ends after a couple of weeks of use - I wear them daily for lower leg circulation help - but most of the wrap stays elastic for an extended period of time. The price is great when purchased in the 10 pack - a fine bargain.
