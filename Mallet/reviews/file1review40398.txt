review/text: All it did is numb my tongue and it barely helped with my sore throat. I'm seriously disappointed, this was recommended to me by a pharmacologist and I was expecting better result. Even drinking tea had better effect for cheaper.My throat feel a tiny bit better, which is why I don't give this 1 star, but I still feel like wasting money.
