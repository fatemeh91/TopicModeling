review/text: Wow. What an awesome product. This was my first experience with a rabbit-style vibrator, but it more than lived up to the hype. The vibrating bullet boasts some serious power and several settings to build up to. Please note that the rotating beads are METAL, which makes them much durable than the plastic beads used in similar products. The length is perfect for me and the controls are surprisingly easy to access. There are a few downsides, but nothing that can not be remedied. The product does have that distinct skunky plastic smell, although after a few washes it fades a way. Plus, this product isn't really designed to be used by your nostrils. It is also girthier than its competitors, but with adequate lubricant it is nothing insurmountable, so to speak. Over all, I would recommend this product (but probably not for beginners).
