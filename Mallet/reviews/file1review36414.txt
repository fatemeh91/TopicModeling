review/text: When I had my baby 3 years ago I wanted really good quality products, and after research I picked California Baby products. Their diaper cream is wonderful and I loved most their products.The bubble bath was great, so much that I did not mind ordering it shipped to Canada and paying all the duty to have it shipped from the states.My most recent order was a real disappointment though. The bubble baths have been watered down. They run like water. They used to be very thick and last a long time. It is almost impossible to make bubbles now it is so thin.We liked a lot of the scents. The cold & flu was particularly helpful when my daughter was stuffed up. Unfortunately this last batch (I ordered a bottle of just about all the scents) had also changed in that you could barely smell the scent anymore.HOpefully they go back to their original quality.
