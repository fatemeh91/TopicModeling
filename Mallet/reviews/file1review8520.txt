review/text: PRO = The handle feels comfortable and sturdy. Very ergonomic.CONS #1 = The bristles are like a soft bristle tooth brush. Ok for light cleaning but not for scrubbing.CONS #2 = The top is too wide for cleaning baby bottle nipples. Our old clean brush tapered at the tip so it can fit narrower areas. Not a problem for cleaning coffee mugs and cups but not too great for baby bottles and other narrow at the top containers.
