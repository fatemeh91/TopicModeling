review/text: This is by far the best flavor I've had as far as whey protein goes. I've tried strawberry banana, double rich chocolate (ON Whey Gold Standard) and strawberry milkshake Muscle Milk. ON Whey wins by far, the other stuff was complete junk compared to this. I will always have a tub of both strawberry banana and double rich chocolate sitting around - strawberry banana to mix with my oatmeal in the morning (DELICIOUS!) and double rich chocolate for the much needed protein after workouts. I'll be sticking with Optimum Nutrition for a long time.
