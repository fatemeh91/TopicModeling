review/text: Many experts believe the most common/cheaper form of magnesium found in drugstores, markets, etc. which is Magnesium Oxide is a real waste. This is due to poor bioavailability. Hence my quest to find Magnesium Citrate or another form of magnesium which has superior absorption. There are several choices which I want to research further. I know Bluebonnet makes a great Magnesium Citrate- at least it works very well for me. Like anything else, we're all different & your mileage may vary. I absolutely like the fact these are in soft gel form and always go that route with supplements unless unavailable.. then my next choice is liquid.. even though I've found a few that are impossible to swallow if your gag reflexes are sensitive to bad taste and smell. Personally I had better results with Bluebonnet, but they're also pricier. If you're looking to save a few bucks, this one might be a good choice.
