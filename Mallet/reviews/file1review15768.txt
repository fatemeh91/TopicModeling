review/text: I used to carry different pens and pencils in my planner, making it very bulky. With the Cross Tech 3, I can easily switch from red to black ink,or pencil lead, allowing me to carry just one sleak looking pen. Refills can be found easily on Amazon too ! My only request would be s small eraser included to clean up pencil marks.As with everything I purchase from Amazon, the quality and quick shipping never disappoints.
