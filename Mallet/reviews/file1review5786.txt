review/text: The included vibrator comes with 3 button-cell batteries... which do not fit inside the unit. Any more than two batteries, and the end cap will not thread on properly. The vibrator can run with only two batteries but the vibrations are very weak.I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement. Same problem.I suppose one could replace the vibrator with another small bullet-style vibe, but why not just buy a better quality product to begin with?
