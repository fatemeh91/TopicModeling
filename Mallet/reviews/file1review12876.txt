review/text: This is a great mask whether you want a cold or warm compress for you eyes or forehead. You can also put it on the back of your neck. It has a nice cloth cover, which is a lot more comfy than those plastic-covered gel masks. It also has an adjustable elastic band to hold it in place. I use it to soothe my eyes during allergy season.
