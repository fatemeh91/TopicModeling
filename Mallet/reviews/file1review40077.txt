review/text: I was very pleased with the Crest Smooth Mint Gel. The squeeze bottle is very easy to use and the mint flavor isn't overpowering. I think the squeeze tube sets this product above other brands of toothpaste because there's no mess involved when using it. You never have to roll up the end of the tube to get the last of the toothpaste out. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends. It definitely lives up to the standards that I've come to expect from Crest.
