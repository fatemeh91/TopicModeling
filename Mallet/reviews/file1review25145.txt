review/text: You'd think that a diaper pail with a power-driven lid would come with an electrical cord, right? Wrong. This junker requires four D batteries that need to be replaced once or twice EACH WEEK.But wait; there's more! Installing new batteries requires taking off the smelly lid and unscrewing THREE small Phillips-head screws that hold the unwieldy battery cover in place!You couldn't come up with a stupider design if you tried.
