review/text: Wart STICK works like a CHARM! As long as you actually follow the directions, and, um ... use it. LOL! Chasing after warts may be one of the most boring and tedious things you'll ever do, but the reward for success is ELATION. This is the EASIEST and MOST CONVENIENT way to apply salicylic acid, no doubt about that. It has the consistency of a lip balm for chapped lips, so you can have an idea from that how great this stuff is. This thing is: you can NOT &#34;take a day off&#34; because warts are sneaky like that, and they seriously want to keep doing what they've been doing, so they'll make huge leaps and bounds during the 48 or 60 hours you're not paying attention, and that puts your whole process back about three days ... so, you may as well chase after those annoying things every day without fail, and just get it over with. Buy PediFix Wart STICK now!! It's great stuff and IT WORKS.
