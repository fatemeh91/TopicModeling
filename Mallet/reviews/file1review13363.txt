review/text: We use this sheet protector for our 3 1/2 year old son while he's night potty-training top help with bed-wetting accidents. It is great as it prevents us from having to wash all of his sheets and pads if he has an accident. The size is great because it is large and covers so much space, even in his full sized bed. And, the top is soft enough to be touching skin. Also, the no-skid bottom works well, keeping it in place throughout the night. Now, if we could just prevent him from peeing on the comforter! But, that is a different issue altogether. :)
