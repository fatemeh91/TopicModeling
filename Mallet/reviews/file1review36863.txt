review/text: This stocking aid is like a miracle worker!When my left hip became arthritic, I could no longer put my socks on or touch my toes. I struggled daily with so much pain.The Duro-Med flexible sock aid is actually fun to use, and I cannot believe how easy it works. I even use it to put on my other sock, even though I have no problem with my right foot.I advise everyone who has problems such as I had to invest in this very inexpensive sock aid. You will love it!
