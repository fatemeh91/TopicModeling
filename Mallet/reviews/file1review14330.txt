review/text: It seems no retail store in Massachusetts ever has the HQ177 in stock. Since its not the newest Norelco razor currently out there most stores don't bother to stock it. Makes no sense since most men don't buy new electric razors ever couple of years. They do last quite awhile and there is no need to update a razor frequently. You do need new heads and cutting blades depending on useage and thickness of your beard. I placed my order and got the HQ177 in 2 days. Great service.
