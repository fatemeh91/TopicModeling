review/text: I purchased this for my father, he started having trouble getting his socks on. There are several products out there and I didn't know which to buy. This item was the only one with a review and it was positive so I decided to try it first. The price too was an incentive to buy and shipping was free! I gave it to dad, he looked at it and said what is it? I told him to look at the instructions. He was using it 30 seconds later and he loves it!
