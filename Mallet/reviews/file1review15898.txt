review/text: I am in my 8th month of pregnancy and this is my 3rd. My tummy muscle is not as strong as before. The Dr says that the baby is already sitting low and recommends that I get a maternity belt. This is the only brand that I saw at Babies R Us.I cringed when I paid for the belt but forgot about the cost when I had the belt on. It felt good! Lifted the baby from my bladder, I do not feel the weight on my hips anymore and it gives me balance when I walk or stand up. I was able to even run for the bus this morning!4 stars as the velcro parts do get scratchy if you're not wearing the belt over any clothing but am not bothered by it.I wonder why I waited until the 8th month to get this belt but I highly recommend this to every pregnant moms who are starting to feel the strain on their bodies from the weight of the baby.ps - the baby was rather 'rebellious' each time I have this belt on. She tries to fight for more space!
