review/text: I love the smell of orange oil products to clean my home, using not only this one but also CitraSolv and Sun & Earth, and it is reassuring to know they are made from mostly natural ingredients and non-harmful to you or your pets. This year we developed a carpenter bee problem around the eaves of our home, which in my case is close to my side entrance door and a source of fear when I would encounter hovering carpenter bees at eye level. I went on google to see what could be done about repelling bees, and as always received an education about natural products as repellents (which we much prefer to pesticides), and it seems the orange oil is a highly recommended bee repellent. In the evenings I will occasionally spray this product around my doors, windows, and the eaves (which we also learned to plug up with caulking to prevent nesting), and it REALLY works -- the bees left the area, and now I just see them pollinating the flowers which is as it should be, so I would highly recommend this product as well as any others containing orange oil for protection from bees.
