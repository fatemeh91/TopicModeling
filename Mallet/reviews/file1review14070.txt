review/text: This organizer can hold about 60 or so diapers, more if you stuff some in the back space. I like the little pockets on the sides, but going by the picture, it looks like all the compartments sit straight out/flat, but they don't. They're all slanted forward which makes it hard to hold some of the items I wanted to put in it. Also, I first tried to hang the organizer of the side of my son's crib, but the straps that are connected aren't quite long enough so I ended up needing to hang it on the wall. So with all that said though, not too bad for the price.
