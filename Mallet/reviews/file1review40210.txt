review/text: I was happy with how clean and fresh my mouth felt after using this toothpaste. However, the taste isn't great. I didn't notice much of a change in the color of my teeth, but I've used it for only seven days. Perhaps with continued use, some whitening will occur. I prefer a gel toothpaste, so this seemed a little chalky to me. I will continue to use it to see if my teeth become whiter. If that happens then the poor taste and texture will be worth it.
