review/text: I tried everything to get out the brown buildup in my dishwasher. Nothing worked and I continued to have 8 years worth of nasty looking residue. I bought a bottle of Dishwasher Magic through Amazon. I was very skeptical but was ready to try anything. One bottle placed in the silverware try, using the hottest cycle available, and the inside of my dishwasher looks like it's never been used. Great product!
