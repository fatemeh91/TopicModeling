review/text: I am 45 year old female and have had chonic sluggish bowel and constipation (like not going to the bathroom for a week at a time) since I was a very young child. Went to all types of doctors, was prescribed medication, told to take miralax daily, etc. Nothing ever worked and no medical answers. Now as gross as it is, if you have never suffered this type of chronic constipation it actually makes you sick and you get to the point you cannot eat because of all the backed up toxins in your colon. I have always been very active, played sports, cylcling and running and drank at least a half gallon of water every day and still I was constipated. So that was not the probelm. I had tried every colon detox system on the market and spent lot of money. However, when I stumbled upon this product I took a chance and I have to say this has been the answer for me. The oxy-powder works wonderfula and as advertised. For me it is work the money. I have spent much more than this cost over the years for both prescription and colon cleansing products that did not deliver. Oxy-Power WORKS......try it and you will never use anything else.
