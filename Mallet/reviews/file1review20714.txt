review/text: Over the last 30 years I've tried 4 or 5 electric shavers. I always had to trash it as it either irritated my skin or pulled the hairs out instead of cutting them out. The Braun 8595 is great! It took several days to get used to, but it has performed like no other. I have used the ole blade once or twice simply because I was on the road and failed to pack my new shaver. I don't forget it anymore. I especially like the cleaning each time I use it. Makes me feel that it maintains that sanitary condition.
