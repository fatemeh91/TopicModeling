review/text: I have severe muscle stiffness and pain in my neck shoulders, and have done a lot of stretching and exercise in attempts to ease the pain, but nothing has been as wonderful as this. It takes some practice to figure out, but the possibilities are endless. The neck, Shoulder, rib, and lower back are all within reach, and the device is capable of holding a lot of force. I found I've been able to adjust my lower neck, mid back, and shoulders with only about 5 minutes of effort. I've pushed and twisted as hard as I can, and there's not even a hint of yielding or cracking. The beauty is that it's got so many different positions, and the pressure points are arranged in so many different spots, that it will work wherever you need it.Sure, the think looks funny, seems excessively large and your friends will probably comment about it being some kind of wierd sex toy... but just go with it, it's awesome.
