review/text: The past couple of months, I noticed that I have less energy and would get sick more often than my normal 'sickly' rate. As they say, when you hit the 30's, your body changes and I suspected that it might also be that my son is a preteen now and required more parenting. That's how I started my search for the ultimate women's vitamins. My criteria was simple - cheap and effective. This fit the bill. It is recommended to take 3 tabs a day - but I only use 1 a day. I feel better, I have more energy. The only 'complain' I have is that my pee is really yellow. But it's a normal side effect. Plus, I get to motivate myself to drink more water just so I can get a better colored pee. TMI. My other 'complaint' is that it smells like some organic farm soil. But it's normal with multi-vitamins. I give it 5 stars because it was the 'perfect' supplement to my otherwise healthy self.
