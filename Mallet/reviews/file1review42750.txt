review/text: I have been shaving with Remington razors for about 10 years now. I've had the MS-290 about 3 years. I recently changed to a Braun 340 and I find it much better than the Remington. I'm sorry I didn't make the change earlier. Here are the pros and cons:Pros:1- Close shave2- Gets almost all of the hairs with the exception of few here and there and on the neck.3- Fairly comfortableCons:1- Very loud. It vibrates and makes loud noise.2- The top compartment does not mount well and sometimes pops off.3- Does not support cord shaving. Only cordless.4- After the first 2 years, battery starts getting pregressively bad so one has to change shaver not because it doesn't work but because battery won't hold a charge.5- long charge time. 15 min charge time for a shave6- Have to move shaver over face over 5 times to shave all hairs. Sometimes even more.7- No spring flexed cutting head. As a result shaving is somewhat rough.I gave it a 3 because it did the job for me for many years. But I would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Braun which is much better and smoother.
