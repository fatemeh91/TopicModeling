review/text: I bought this set hoping to save money on haircuts, and when it arrived I realized had gotten much more than I expected for $27. This set of clippers seems heavy duty and it comes with a wide array of clipper guards. I would urge anyone looking for a low-cost high quality set of clippers to buy these.
