review/text: This little vibrator is great - very powerful for such a little vibrator. You can also buy sleeves for it, but I prefer it without. The one I bought from Amazon this time was a gift for a friend, but I have one, too, and this is about the third or fourth one I've bought. The best thing about it is it's easy to slip into your purse so you never have to leave home without it. You just never know when you might need it ;-). And because it's pretty innocent looking, I don't feel embarrassed packing it in carry on luggage and having an inspector open my bags.
