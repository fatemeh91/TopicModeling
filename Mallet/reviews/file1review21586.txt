review/text: How a colorless, odorless and tasteless liquid does so much, I don't know. Without it, I die. Thank goodness I can buy it here. "Air Juice", as we call it in Georgia, falls from the sky but never in convenient plastic storage containers as described above. I drank several bottles of this with few ill effects - and none of the congestion that I got from the Bovine Nectar I had previously purchased.
