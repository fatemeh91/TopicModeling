review/text: I tried this product with the fertility cleanse kit. I can't say it did anything for me. If you research the individual ingredients from a legitimate source (e.g. consumer labs or the NIH), you won't find anything to support the claims of what it is supposed to do for the liver. I also didn't notice any improvements in my cycle which this was supposed to help with.
