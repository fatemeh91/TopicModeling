review/text: I've owned this 9400 Power Toothbrush for almost two years now and couldn't be more pleased. It really does scrub your teeth and gums.Perhaps the most impressive aspect is, I haven't had my teeth cleaned in three years.But each time I visit the dentist (for a major dental procedure I'm currently enduring), he tells me, "You're teeth and gums are in excellent shape. I don't say this very often but you really don't need to have your teeth cleaned."I'm 48-years-old and prior to purchasing this toothbrush, prior dentists would tell me that I wasn't doing a very good job of cleaning my teeth. This Oral-B has made toothbrushing a simple and easy affair. I no longer dread scrubbing away at my teeth (as I once did).It holds a charge for 10-14 days and is easy to use. I highly recommend this toothbrush, especially for 40-somethings who are hoping to hold onto all their teeth!
