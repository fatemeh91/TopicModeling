review/text: I first tried a 2lb container of the 'Natural Strawberry' and loved it. I mix it with bluebrries and it's a great way to start the day. I liked it so much that my next order was for the 5lb container. I thought I was getting the same thing - strawberry, but the 5lb was 'delicious strawberry' and it's not good in comparison. It's got a plastic artificial sweetener taste that is so overpowering I can't even taste the blueberries. Be careful when selecting a flavor. The product mixes well and I definitely feel better... more energy.
