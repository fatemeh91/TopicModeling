review/text: I got this for my 3-year-old son who is potty training. I wanted a potty seat he could get on and off of easily as well as be comfortable and keep the pee from splattering everywhere. This one fits the bill perfectly. He's not scared to use it and he fits on it very well. The splash guard seems to do its job as long my son keeps his aim in the toilet! I would recommend this seat to other mothers of little boys and girls. It's been worth the money spent on it!
