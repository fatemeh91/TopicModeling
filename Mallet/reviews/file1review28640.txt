review/text: I'm 3/4 of the way through my second 2lb container of the mocha cappucino flavor but decided to try the coffee in the 5 lb size (because it was such a great deal) in the hopes of getting my scrawny 13.5 yo son to try it. But after mixing the coffee flavored powder with skim milk and discovering that it tastes like a coffee shake I'm no longer willing to share it with him! I happen to love coffee in general so it's not surprising that I prefer this flavor to the m.c. It's also not as sweet as the m.c.
