review/text: I like the Panasonic ER112BC a lot, but it vibrates a little and tickles the inside of my nose during use (so 4 stars). Those of you who are looking for a practical product that is inexpensive, works well and are not ticklish this is nose trimmer is for you. BTW, it works well on ears also.
