review/text: I love this bottle brush! It's long enough to get into our very tall 32-ounce bottles. It's sturdy enough to move it around in the bottles to get them nice and clean. The way the bristles are situated also helps get the bottles clean. I've used in glass vases and other narrow necked items and because it is so slim there are very few bottles it won't fit into. It has also lasted longer than several other bottle brushes we've tried. Very pleased!
