review/text: Recently my family went through a major crisis. Everyone in my home was feeling stressed out, Sparky, my dog, was panicing. He has a prescription for Xanax which he usually, only takes during situations, like thunderstorms. This situation was so intense that even the Xanax did not help him.Out of desperation,I decided to go to the health food store to see if it had Rescue Remedy. I had read that Rescue Remedy treats the energetic body or aura. I sprayed 2 squirts into his energetic body above his back; he completely relaxed as soon as the spray connected with his energetic body. The effects were miraculous.During this crisis, I sprayed every room in the house a few times a day; everyone was able to deal with the issue and handle it well.The spray can be used for a wide range of situations. Here are some other situations you might want to try using Rescue Remedy Spray.1. Your neighbor comes over outraged because of something her boss said. When she finally leaves, you feel exhausted, and your home feels like she is still there. Just spray 2 squirts in each room, or the room she was in.2. Any kind major life experience that involves big changes. Such as moving, sickness, etc. Spray the home.3. Your plant is sick. Give it squirt a few feet above it, so you are only spraying the energetic body.4.Spray a few feet above your computer when it acts up.I recommend this miracle spray for everyone.
