review/text: I can't believe how wonderful this product is. I just recently discovered deodorants and had no idea that you could reduce armpit stench by just rolling something like this on your hairy armpits. For years I wondered why people avoided me and why people seemed to crinkle their nose when they were around me. I thought the reason I had trouble with attracting girls were my admittedly Marty Feldmanish like looks. I guess I didn't get the hint when my prom date in high school upchucked all over my lap when she layed her head on my shoulder. I had always wondered what that foul thick gag inducing stench that always seemed to be around was and where it was coming from. I just assumed it was the nearby industrial chemical plants that was causing this odoriferous collection of fumes that seemed to follow me around. Sure, I bathed once in awhile, but that sulfur likepungent foulness couldn't be me could it? Sure enough, I tried this product and I was finally allowed to gain entry to our local supermarket again!!! I am now working on being allowed back in my local movie theaters, as they apparantly had lost a lot of business and several had closed claiming that customers were complaining of the pungent stench during the movies. After using this product, far fewer people blow chunks when walking past me. Thanks SpeedStick!!!Product Disclaimer: Will not work on anyone named Booger.
