review/text: I really love these maxi pads! They offer great protection for overnight, or on those heavy flow days. The best feature is the wings. They really help protect your panties from spillage you sometimes have from other maxi pads. These maxi pads are super thin too. You hardly know they're there. There is plenty of adhesive to keep the pad in place. This is a very reliable product that I plan to use indefinitely.
