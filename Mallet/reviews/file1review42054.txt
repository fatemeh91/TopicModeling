review/text: I love the product! You can feel it working! I would re-order, but the only issue is when you pour out the product, much of it leaks out of the top and down the side. The bottle needs to be re-worked! The product is so expensive that you don't want to waste a drop and I find that I can't help but waste some almost each time because the neck of the bottle causes slight spillage.Otherwise, I love the mouthwash!!!
