review/text: Our daughter used this for a little while but I had to keep watching her because even though she is petite it seemed like it was easy for her to scoot onto the back of the seat. I also found it hard to clean because you have to untighten the hinge to take it off to clean underneath. At preschool she was using the stand-alone potty so we bought the babybjorn equivalent and she now just uses that instead. That is easier to clean than I thought.
