review/text: I bought 2 of Babybjorn toilet trainers since my daughter was one and a half years old. They are great. My daughter love them. They are very stable on the regular toilet, unlike some other brands. The locks work very well, just a little difficult to clean. I just bought the pink one to put at her grandma's house. It's very cute.
