review/text: When I first tried it, it was great! It kept my posture perfectly aligned, but as the band stretches it doesn't stay where it should be any more. I bought 5 all together so I change it every day. For the money I guess it's worth it , but not for long term. It's a great reminder that my shoulder rolls forward all the time which in long would create that "hump back look". Thank you for this product. R.,RN,CPAN, ICU, BLS Instructor, ASPAN member
