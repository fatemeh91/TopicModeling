review/text: My Mom got me my first oral B electric and I fell in love. Really! They make your teeth feel so clean. When the one my Mom bought me would no longer hold a charge I bought this one. I went with the same one. I would recommend leaving it off the charger like it says to do in the manual. I didn't with my first one and I think that is why the battery life was shorter than one would expect. I did have braces and brushed at least 3 if not more times a day so maybe I just used it up. I have already gotten more battery life out of this one, than my first one and I do leave it off the charger.
