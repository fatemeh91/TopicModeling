review/text: Bought this based on the mostly positive reviews here after my old Norelco trimmer died (which I was a huge fan of), and much to my chagrin, it just died on me a few minutes ago, after about 2 months of use. It wasn't even that good of a trim anyways, I had to go over the same spots constantly; this was never a problem with my previous trimmer. I just ordered a new trimmer, hopefully it'll last longer than a pitiful two months.
