review/text: First, let me say that I've been a devoted Waterpik user for at least 20 years, so this purchase was a replacement for the last one I wore out. That said, this new machine is the best one yet (with several improvements over my last one, which was otherwise identical). Also, it was sent super-fast, and was very favorably priced, so I'm rating this transaction 5 STARS, because they won't let me go higher! In other words, a perfect transaction.
