review/text: This is my second order for this product. The first order I have was for an 8 oz and for the infant version. My 4 year old and my 2 year old finished the 8 oz without any complain and my baby have also finished his so I decided to just order this larger package for all 3 of them.The infant version is only 2 oz. and cost 5x more per oz as compared to the children version. I checked the back and noticed that it has the same content so I emailed the company and ask what is the difference between the two version and if the children version is safe to be used in an infant. The company's reply is that the only difference is the packaging and the flavor. The Infant version is non-flavored while the children version have a strawberry flavor in it. He said that babies don't usually respond well to the flavored version but it is safe to give if the baby is willing to take it. So, I ordered this bigger bottle and transfer some of the content to the original infant DHA bottle that I have and tried it to my now 4 month old baby. The company representative's claim seem to be true as from time to time, my baby will try to push out the strawberry flavored one. I have to split the 1ml tube into 4 small doses. I give him a few drops, wait for him to swallow before giving another drop to prevent spillage.If you have small children and a baby, try to give this a try an save more as compare to buying 2 separate version for your kids.-------------------------------Update - 05/14/12-------------------------------Buying another bottle. After a few days of giving this flavored version to my baby, he started to take it without any problem. We just started him with baby food a month ago and I also started to give him this version in a spoon instead of using a dropper and he takes it without a problem. His 2 other siblings just turned 5 and 3 and still loves this product. My 3 year old actually likes to hold on to the spoon so he can lick it clean.
