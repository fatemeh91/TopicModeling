review/text: My husband has a terribly painful case of joint pain in his hips and knees. He has taken this product for over a year and swears by it. It greatly lessens pain to the point of making it tolerable to hardly noticeable. He also uses kratom powder which is a very good muscle relaxant and natural pain reliever used in herbal medicine in parts of Asia and India. When the pain is very bad, it makes him feel much better. It is hard to find but of course it is on amazon,Warrior Mist Vicozen Combo (Vicozen Only - (6 bottles)).Another good supplement for joint health he takes is cissus powder which is something we both take consistently for overall joint health (I have a mild case of carpal tunnel, it helps slow down the inevitable). The cissus powder has a natural inflammatory effect on joints and ligaments which make it a necessary supplement for my husband to take with the Glucosamine and chondroitin. Very effective for it's intended purposes, and just for maintenance too. A very wonderful group of products that have no negative side effects as far as either of us can tell.
