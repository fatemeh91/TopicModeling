review/text: I used this product recently for the first time, during an offshore fishing trip. Admittedly I used it in conjunction with Bonine, but the effects were almost immediate, I had started to feel queasy in moderate to calm seas about 3 hours into the trolling expedition. I was able to eat, drink and fish as normal.I had no issues with the odour, which is a bit loud but not all that bad. It's very easy to apply and does what it promises.
