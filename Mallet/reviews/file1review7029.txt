review/text: AFTER READING ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS ON THIS WAHL SHAVER I DECEIDED TO BUY ONE ON 6-9-2010. THREE WEEKS LATER THE ATTACHED TRIMMER LITERALLY FELL APART. I CONTACTED AMAZON AND THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT. AFTER LESS THEN ONE WEEK OF USING THE NEW REPLACEMENT THE SHUT OFF SWITCH DIDN'T WORK. THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD SHUT OFF WAS BY LETTING THE BATTERY RUN OUT. WITH TWO WAHL SHAVERS GOING BAD IN LESS THEN A MONTH, THERE WON'T BE A THIRD. I'M RECEIVING A FULL REFUND AS OF 7-9-2010. ALSO TAKE NOTE THAT "AMAZON SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT THOUGHOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND AMAZON WAS WHO I BOUGHT IT THOUGH". ALSO TAKE NOTE, I CONTACTED WAHL AND FOUND THEIR COMPANY LACKING AMAZON SERVICE.
