review/text: Apparently I'm not the quickest person as it took me a few months to realize why my face was so irritated. Razor burn and acne like i was in high school again was what this razor did for me. It also hurt, and a clean shave looked 8 hrs old. 5 blades cutting at my face was just to much for me. I've actually reverted back 60 years to a 1950s model Gillette Safety Razor, Badger brush, and mug of shaving cream. The shave is 10x better. It's closer, non irritating, and is an enjoyable experience. If your having skin problems, they may be from these new super duper shavers!
