review/text: Ok this is a product which simply fills a specific need, and satisfies that need very well. In other words, "does what is says it will do on the tin".Bendable so it gets to the nook and cranny's.I'm happy with the purchase, and would buy again if I somehow break this one... "melt it?". Not quite sure other than loss or theft why I would need another one though.
