review/text: I got a sample pack of a few of these in the mail. I tried them out on my son. They worked great and I loved the easy clean up. I checked them out at the store, but as much as I love them, I couldn't justify the price. I did by a box, but use them strictly for when we eat away from home. I also bought a five pack of plastic bibs and I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher and they come out clean. These are a good idea, but too expensive for everyday use.
