review/text: This is my first electric razor and I now keep a good close shave. Up till now I've just bic'd it off without trying to get it close. I cannot compare it to any other electric razors, but it is especially good for me around the mouth and chin. It is actually smooth around there, and I have never experienced that before, and if I were in a position to kiss a girl I could do it with a free conscience. It is not so good on the neck which I've heard is a drawback of these foil style razors. I now shave every day.
