review/text: The Balance Almond Brownie Bar provides a nutritious alternative for when you need a chocolate fix. Unlike other nutritional food bars I've tried, this one pays close attention to providing not only the vitamins you need but also the minerals. Without sacrificing taste, it provides a good balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. While it did taste rather good (especially compared to some of the other brands of bars I've tried that resembled flavored cardboard in taste and texture) the Almond Brownie Balance Bar is somewhat dry, though consuming it with a tall, cold glass of milk resolves this issue.
