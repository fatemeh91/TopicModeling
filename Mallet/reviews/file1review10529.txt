review/text: I bought this for my mom, and within a few days she received it and she was very pleased with the appearance of the floral design, more fun than the plain ones! It is adjustable so that whether you're short or maybe taller, no problem, it is simple to adjust to your height and give you the product that you need for added stability! This is very sturdy and a well made cane to give years of added assurance in ambulation.
