review/text: I read the reviewed before purchasing this product and everybody was saying positive things about and since my husband and I need to add a supplement to our diet and workout program we decided to purchase it. We have been using it for about two weeks as directed and we have seen small changes mainly with digestion. As of now we don't feel any energy boosts. We usually take in the morning and it is fulfilling and it does keep us full for a while.
