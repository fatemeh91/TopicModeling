review/text: The Cruder is just a mediocre razor and a less than mediocre trimmer. I purchased it as a replacement to my travel razor and thought the trimmer would be an added bonus. Its okay for occasional use but for everyday, consider getting something better because with the Cruder, you are getting what you paid for.
