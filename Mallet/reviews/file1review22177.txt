review/text: This product does exactly what it is suppose to. I have tried the Husks Powder and yes it is a little hard to swallow, but I have since purchased the Psyllium WHOLE husks and I like it a lot better. I mixes so much easier whether it be in water or juice and is not as hard to take. I will continue to purchase from Vitamin Shoppe since they have the best deals.
