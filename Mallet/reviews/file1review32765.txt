review/text: It's not incredibly delicious and it's not going to keep you satisfied forever, but it does its job pretty good. My only complaint is that even if it says it can be stirred with a spoon, it takes a lot of stirring to dissolve and sometimes a significant amount of the powder ends up in the cup instead of in the milk. For the price, however, it is a very good product.
