review/text: I have bone spurs, and I have tried everything. My doctor wrote a prescription for a specially made padding for my heel. He showed me, they were padded heel cups, cut out in the center of the heel. I found out they were going to be $80 or more. After the shock, I went to Amazon and ordered Tuli's Gel Cups. Tried them out and was instantly relieved from the pressure. I took a small cutting tool, cut out the whole, just like the one I was shown and have worn them since. It is amazing how my feet feel, I know longer have that severe, throbbing pain. These were price far lower than any I have seen. The best thing I could have done for my feet.
