review/text: Oily or combination skin requires a gentle cleanser that will not over dry nor leave oily residues. This gel cleanser is gentle on my skin leaves it clean and fresh not dry. Great for make up removing including the eye area. The essential oils smell is very pleasant. The pump is great helps you dispense the perfect amount one pump goes a long way. Worth the price.
