review/text: i started using these in the 90's, my mother turned me on to them. they are addictive! i cant eat a meal or even a snack without using one afterwards. my plaque level has decreased significantly since using. they are great! let them moisten in the mouth before picking or they will break. i personnally prefer the non-mint, they used to have orange flavored but im more of a plain type person. try it, you'll like it.
