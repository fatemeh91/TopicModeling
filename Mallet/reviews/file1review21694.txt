review/text: My mother bought this tub for my son as a transition from his plastic infant tub, and we have thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm very frugal and absolutely hate the idea of filling up the whole tub with water for my little guy's bath every night. This tub is a wonderful solution. He was a little nervous when we first began using it, but it only took a few days for him to love it. He is now nearly 21 months old (of average height and weight), and there is still room to spare in the tub. We'll use it as long as we can. It's also great for travel, especially by car, because you can keep it inflated and pack things inside it. Or if you're flying, it's easy to deflate and pack in your bag, and quick to inflate by mouth. By the way, we're on our second one, as the first split at the seam. That's why I didn't give it five stars.
