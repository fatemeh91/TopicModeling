review/text: This is the best beard trimmer I've had so far. Have tried 2 other ones and they dont compare to this by remington.The trimmer feels great in the hand and doesn't feel cheap and krappy.And it cuts very well and smoothly, easy to clean, and you only have 1 piece so you don't have to worry about losing pieces and having to switch pieces.All in all if you're looking for a beard trimmer this is the best one out for the price.
