review/text: I have always used Energizer and they have never let me down. Ordering these in a 2 pack of 16 count means you will have to do the remote battery shuffle when one set dies. Stick these away somewhere out of the way and you will most likely always have them available to you. I find myself using more and more batteries, so it is always nice to have a bit of a stockpile.
