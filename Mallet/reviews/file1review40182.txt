review/text: I used the paste day and night and it did nothing. I don't drink coffee or smoke cigarettes neither do I eat foods that stain your teeth. This is probably only food people that have teeth-staining habits such as the above. I just didn't see a different after about 2 weeks of use. If you want a whitening paste, try a better quality brand.
