review/text: I know there are those who note the sugar content of this product, but I have a different take. I am not a regular water drinker even though I know it is the way to go. By making a morning shake with Slim Fast powder, flax seed meal, skim milk and ice in the blender, I know I am getting lots of water, calcium and omega 3s when I start the day. It may not be for everyone, but it works for me!
