review/text: Just one blast under your tongue is enough to meet your RDA of B12.After having bariatric surgery, B12 is one of the &#34;Big Four&#34; vitamins that post-oppers need to take daily. So having this in spray form, really is a convenient, effective way to stay compliant.The taste is inoffensive, though it claims it's grape, though I've never tasted a grape that tastes like this:)A little goes a long way. I can usually get one year of doses out of one bottle.This is my go-to B12 supplement. If they ever stop making it, I would truly be heart broken. Buy it. You won't regret it.
