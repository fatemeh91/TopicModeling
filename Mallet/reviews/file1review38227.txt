review/text: Okay I so I'm reading the book the four day diet and Ian talks about this product. Not this specific one but it's the same as the one he mention. I had c-section so my digestive system isn't the same anymore from all the moving things around in there. I used this product and the same day it worked. It doesn't give you the cramping feeling you get from Lax's. It's a all natural feeling and i have been using it for about a month now and i feel like I have energy and i don't feel bloated. If you drink it before eating you will eat less I lost about 10 pounds. It's not a diet supplement but it does get rid of body waste that won't come out on it on.
