review/text: I have been researching wetshaving for approxiametly two months now. I ordered this razor and shaved with it using some Taylor of Bond Street avocado cream along with a vulfix brush last night for the first time. I love the feel of the razor and it makes me feel like a true gentleman. You feel distinguished using this razor but I think I'm going to try some different blades. The merkur blades were okay but I think I want a closer shave. Overall, an excellent razor.
