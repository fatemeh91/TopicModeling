review/text: I started using this brush about a week ago and am already noticing some results. It's easier to get the hard to reach areas (such as wisdom teeth) and cleans better behind the teeth. If you're pressing too hard, the brush will stop spinning until you apply less pressure.One major thing I'm noticing is that my gums are beginning to fill in the tiny spaces between my teeth again. I used to think my gums were perfectly normal, but I can now that they weren't and that their health is being restored. It's a good feeling.
