review/text: Well I like this product pretty well, it is kind of hard to put on and must come off to go to the bathroom. It gives good support but the belt that is so post to go over the top is not helpful and way to big. I am larger like 1x and ordered the extra large everything fits but the top belt that you don't really need, gives some relief off your back.
