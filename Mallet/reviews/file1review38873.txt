review/text: When I ordered these tests, I thought they were going to be the regular +/- tests. When I received them, I just threw them in my bathroom closet until I needed them. So this morning, I opened the box and pulled one out and thought that it was a really "hunky" test-not even thinking twice that it was a digital test. So, just a little bit ago when I opened the stick package, it was a digital test! I was pleasantly surprised!!! I know the digital tests are usually quite a bit more, so I felt like I got an even better deal for 5 tests!
