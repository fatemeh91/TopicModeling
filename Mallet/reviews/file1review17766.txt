review/text: This trimmer worked perfectly for my beard, except after six weeks it stopped charging. I even tried a different charger, the charge light doesn't light up and it doesn't charge at all.Since it broke down past the 30 day return policy, there's no recourse with their customer service either. No matter how good it is when charged it's just a paperweight now since I can't charge it.
