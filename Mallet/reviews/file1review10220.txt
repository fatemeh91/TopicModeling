review/text: Energizer batteries seem to work the best in the little toys that require them. I have tried the Duracell batteries but seem to go dead in a very short time. I would recomend the Energizer batteries for use in the toys and such items so you won't have to buy batteries as often. Not only are they reliable but they last longetr which means less batteries to fill the landfills when they are all used up
