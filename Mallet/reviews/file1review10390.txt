review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.
