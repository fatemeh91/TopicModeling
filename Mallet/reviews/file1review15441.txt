review/text: I have been using cascade complete for quite some time. It works really well with my machine - I really like it, BUT ordering it online was a BIG mistake. Both the boxes broke and the detergent got everywhere which made opening the packaging a big mess and lost me about 1/4th of the detergent. I would recommend getting Cascade, but get it at your local store - NOT on Amazon.
