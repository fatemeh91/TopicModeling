review/text: Kotex makes wonderful personal products. I have used many different products and am happy to speak about these. These tampons are long and a bit bulky. However, they are well worth it. The plastic applicators on these tampons are easy to use and keep your hands free of messes.This particular pack had 3 different sizes. The regular I recommend for very heavy light days to light medium. The super are for medium to very light heavy days. The super plus I recommend for nights and very heavy days only. The reason I rate them like that is that Kotex tampons are super absorbant, so wearing the right size will allow for leak free days.With this pack it has you covered for most days depending on your own flow. Instead of having several boxes you buy one to cover the various days.
