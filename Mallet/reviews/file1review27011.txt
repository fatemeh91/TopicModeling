review/text: I've tried and enjoyed both the Double Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream flavors-- Double chocolate is okay blended with water, and tastes just like chocolate milk when mixed with milk. Vanilla ice cream I don't like as much with just milk or water, but it is good for smoothies-- I'm not much of a "vanilla milk" person, but it does taste quite good and tastes very creamy, to me.After scouring reviews, we decided to try the Rocky Road flavor. BIG MISTAKE. It tastes very artificial (like almond extract, is the best corollary I can come up with), and has returned the dread I used to associate with having to choke down a protein shake. If you add peanut butter or a banana to the shake, it helps a lot, but you can still get the odd, fake flavor. Ewwww. Stay away from Rocky Road! We now have five horrible pounds to try and get through. Might end up giving it away, if I can't figure out a way to make it palatable.That said, all three flavors we have tried blend up very smoothly (yes, even nasty rocky road), with any of a variety of methods! I use (depending on the situation): an immersion blender, a shaker cup, a blender bottle, or even a spoon if you are willing to take an extra 30 seconds!I do like optimum nutrition whey protein still, but now I know that they DO have bad flavors, so I'll be more careful reading reviews and watching for criticisms in the future!I am a 28 year old female who weight trains for strength and functionality-- my significant other also uses protein powder to help achieve his fitness goals and shorten recovery time.
