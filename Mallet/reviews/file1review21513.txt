review/text: Difficult to think of anything too exciting to say about toothbrush heads, but my dentist recommends this brand. My only criticism is that they are all the same colour - for families it would be useful for each person to have a different colour toothbrush head so they do not get mixed up. The product is small enough to fit into a standard envelope, but I was sent mine in a cardboard box 302311cm, which annoyed me a great deal. Aside from the inconvenience associated with it not fitting into my mailbox, using such boxes is very wasteful. Also, the P&P charge was about $5.
