review/text: I go to the gym religiously for about 5 times a weeks and I drink this stuff like water. My muscle restores pretty quickly and this proten shake does not give me the gassy feeling other protein shakes give me. I have high energy level during workouts and I don't feel so sore. I like that it is low sodium so i dont have to worry about high blood pressure. I am not picky with food so this shake taste pretty good to me. definitely recommend it.
