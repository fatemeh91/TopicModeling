review/text: This is the second Remington beard trimmer I have owned and the batteries in both stopped taking a re-charge after about two years use. Not coincidently there is a two-year warranty, and this one died almost exactly two years from the purchase date. When it is running it works very well in trimming my beard, but I don't like having to replace it every two years.
