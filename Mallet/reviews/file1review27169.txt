review/text: I bought this along with the chocolate one and both are great. The flavor is delicious. I don't even have to use a blender to make it. All I do is measure out a scoup of the powder and slowly stir in my liquid Nothing could be easier than that. I mix mine primarily with water. The flavor is so good you really don't need to mix with anything else unless you want to. I have though bought those strawberry/banana smoothie drinks you get in the produce section to vary up the vanilla. I use 1/2 cup of the smoothie and 1/2 cup water and it make for a yummy treat, great for a quick breakfast. I love getting that punch of protein without a lot of sugar. I think this product is high quality and have recommended it to my family and friends.
