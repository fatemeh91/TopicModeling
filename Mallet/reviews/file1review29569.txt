review/text: I'm following the Vaso Guard therapy from "What your doctor won't tell you About Hypertension". The author has a list of vitamins,etc to take and lists specific forms of the vitamins.The author (also a doctor) really emphasized the benefits of celery. He suggested either several stalks of celery a day or a celery extract.
