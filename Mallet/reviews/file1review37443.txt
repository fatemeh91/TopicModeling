review/text: I owned an epilator in the 80's. I found it too painful to use, and eventually threw it (and the $75 it cost, a lot of money to me back then!) away.So it was with some trepidation that I decided to try the new generation of epilators - I received the Silk Epil a few weeks ago, sat and stared at it for a few days, and finally bit the bullet. So much less painful than the old one! I was even able to use it on the tender bikini area (after using the enclosed clipping attachment). This is NOT pain-free, don't kid yourself, but it certainly isn't worse than waxing. In fact, because it's your machine in your own home, you can do a little at a time, take a break, and come back to it.One note - it was not a success on the armpits. Too sensitive! I'll stick to the daily razor for that area, I guess.I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 because I found the shaver attachment to be adequate but less than my shaving dream come true. The epilator itself is great!
