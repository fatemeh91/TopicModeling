review/text: I bought this for my wife. She's 7 months along and teaches so she's on her feet for about 5 hrs a day. She was having a lot of discomfort and this cradle really seems to have helped. Her only complaint is that its not that breathable so it gets a little sweaty on warm days. Still a great product though!
