review/text: I've been experimenting with Trigger Point work for over a year now, and this find is a game-changer.For anyone that has been trying to get those hard-to-reach spots by kneading with fingers or leaning into strategically-placed tennis balls and the like, this tool is a must-have.

Using this has helped me get creative with trigger points that I hadn't even attempted before.Pro's:* They really have engineered the spacing of knobs and shape of the device to be optimal for different parts of the body.* SturdyCon's:* The name: BodyBackBuddy, really?
