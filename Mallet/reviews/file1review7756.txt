review/text: This is a really uncomplicated, multi-use kitchen tool. I know that it is just a kitchen brush, but it is effective and quick. I also like that it has no soap in the handle. Those brushes are lame; they leak, and anyway I don't necessarily always want to use soap.My old one is a few years old, and I really want to replace it, but can not find it anywhere... even here. Please make more.
