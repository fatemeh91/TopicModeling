review/text: I am sorry, but I cannot share the enthusiasm for this product. The readings are innacurate - several readings taken at short intervalls showed deviations of up to 2.5 degrees. To prove this, I repeated the test on myself with the same results. This is very critical since most doctors recommend a visit to the emergency room if the child's temperature exceeds 105. With this thermometer there is - at least for me - no accurate way of telling.In addition, the button that activates the reading process gets stuck a lot, thereby producing no result at all. I finally replaced it with a professional model, the same kind that doctors use. Expensive, but worth it.I am usually a fan Of Braun products. Not this one!
