review/text: I have taken these and the Source of Life prenatal vitamins for a couple of years now.1. No stomach upset ever, I always take these with food regardless but regular vitamins would always make me nauseous.2. Since I started taking these my resistance to colds and other bothersome bugs have gone way way up. I have only had one single cold in 2 years and that despite people around me coming to work with various sneezy/snotty/coughy/pukey varieties.I don't know if I really notice an energy difference between taking and not taking them but they certainly keep my immune system in tip top shape!If anyone is worried about cost, I'd suggest looking at what else you spend money on that isn't good for your health. Cut it out and divert the funds to buying these - your body will thank you!
