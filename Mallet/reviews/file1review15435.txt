review/text: My 12 year old has never willingly eaten a vegetable and only occasionally will eat fruit. I was very concerned about his nutrition and since he is able to swallow pills, decided to start him on these mini-tabs.We have seen a definite increase in his energy level and the dark circles he once had under his eyes are gone! The tablets are not small (I'd hate to see the regular sized ones!) but they are packed with vitamins and minerals and even if he takes half the adult dose (which is 6 tabs per day) I know it's an improvement.We feel that Source of Life is worth every penny.
