review/text: Couldn't find these in the store where I purchased the toothbrush (wally world), so that was frustrating. Why sell a product that needs refills if you aren't going to provide the refills? :) At least I can get the refills from a aupplier on Amazon for now, although not with the combined free shipping offer. The company shipped promptly.
