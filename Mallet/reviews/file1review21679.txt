review/text: Got my snug-tub today. Ordered on Fri. and it came on Mon. Blew it up and used it right off. My 18 mo. old grandson loved it. He splashed around and kicked in it. He was scared to death of the big tub, even with the baby support seat. He screamed when I put him in it. This tub he took right to it and cried when I took him out. He liked the colorful fish and soft sides and being able to move around. Like that it has suction cup to hang to dry. Good deal.
