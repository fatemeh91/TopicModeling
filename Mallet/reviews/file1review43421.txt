review/text: I have some pretty bad varicosities, and for my last two pregnancies, I have not been able to function without this V2 prenatal cradle. That said, I always pair it with full-length compression hose. They complement each other: the Prenatal Cradle holds up the compression hose, while the compression hose keeps the prenatal cradle from giving me what would otherwise be the ultimate wedgie. Of course, that means extra layers, but I suffer the discomfort of wearing these things in favor of avoiding pain.Don't plan on using this for more than one pregnancy. I used it for two, and through most of the second pregnancy, it was very uncomfortable. I'm 27 weeks along, and I've worn this since around 16 weeks, and I wore it for around 23 weeks total my last pregnancy. I've had to mend some of the seams this go-around, but the worst is that the wide elastic around the waist eventually gets a perma-crease to it, which is uncomfortable to say the least.I have to pin the shoulder straps of the cradle to my bra straps, otherwise I wouldn't be able to wear anything but high-collars.I also wish the velcro on belly strap was smaller-- the velcro on the crotch strap doesn't cover it completely, so the hard edges of the belly-strap velcro chaffs. Again, the compression hose adds a bit of comfort here, but then it takes the chaffing and wears in those areas.
