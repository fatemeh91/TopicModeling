review/text: This lotion has a pleasant smell and its consistency isn't so thick that it doesn't absorb into the skin. My one complaint is that it's too messy to apply, with scrub beads falling all over the place. It's a good idea to make sure you're over a tiled floor when you use this. Overall, my skin felt a bit smoother, but I wouldn't recommend this product to friends and family because I know they don't like a messy product either.
