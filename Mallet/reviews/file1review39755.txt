review/text: This is a truly amazingly versatile product. I have used a number of "coolpad" type products to support my laptop, but this one is the best. It works marvelously on chair, couch, bed, anywhere. The legs fold so that you can rest it directly on your lap. The top tilts and locks so you can adjust the viewing angle to suit your needs. You can also use it to support a book handsfree (a cookbook or manual, for instance). It folds down into a nice compact flat package for easy storage. It is a bit heavy, (about 8 lbs) but that's the price you pay for solid construction - and a lifetime guarantee. Highly recommended.Pros:very versatile, flexiblefolds into a slim profile for easy storagewell built, sturdy, lifetime guaranteeCons:A bit heavy for travelBase model is unfinished (bare wood)***Update 07/15/2012***I have recently begun learning how to play the guitar and the bed desk works brilliantly as a bookstand for my instructional books (which tend to be big and floppy.) I fold the legs under and put it on a table and it holds the page in place so I can keep my hands free. After 4 years, I still think it's a great product for laptop owners, bibliophiles and musicians. a++++
