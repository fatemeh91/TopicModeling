review/text: One serving of this contains 15g of protein. The serving size is two tablespoons which equates to 1 fl. oz. I fill up a four oz. flask with this and can easily take in the exact amount of protein needed.Additionally, it doesn't require refrigeration (I emailed twinlab and asked about this since the bottle doesn't say). It's perfect to take on long runs so I can immediately get some protein upon finishing.
