review/text: I switched from Metamucil to Tummy Fiber in January. This product provides more consistent results and is very easy to use. I read some reviews saying it didn't dissolve but in fact have had no issues at all. Follow the directions on the package. Using this fiber I have less bloating and gas than other fiber products. I have also had fewer IBS episodes since switching. I have gone from 1/4 teaspoon 3 times a day to 1/2 teaspoon 3 times a day and may keep this dosage as I am having fewer IBS episodes now than I can remember in a long time!I am VERY thankful I found this product and the peppermint tea and capsules!
