review/text: I have cherry kitchen cabinets. You can't really see the dirt unless you look closely, and then it's almost embarrassing to see all those missed dribbles and fingerprints. Most spills wipe off with a little vinegar water and a terry towel or some pledge wood cleaner, but around the knobs...! That's another story. I read about this product in a magazine, so thought I'd give it a try, hoping to get the built up sticky grime off from around the knobs. First I applied the cleaner with a damp cloth as instructed, rubbed and rubbed, but it only removed the lightest of smudges. I applied it more thickly and waited a few minutes, and using a sponge with a gentle scratchy pad, meant for Teflon pans, I went at it. That worked. When I was done I saw that one cabinet that gets used a lot, had actually been worn clear through the varnish to the raw wood. I don't think the cleaner and scratchy pad did this. The wood had just been so dirty that I hadn't noticed the 15 years of damage!I wonder if I had just used the scratchy pad and my vinegar water, if it would have had the same results without this product? Any how, after gently scrubbing away the soil, I polished away the excess product with a soft cloth. It leaves a waxy feel to the wood surface, sort of like the waxy feeling that treated apples feel like when they put that shinny stuff on them at the market, or if you were to rub candle wax on wood... not really a slippery feeling. I just wanted the cupboards clean, not waxy. But maybe that will protect them from getting as dirty in the future. Meanwhile, I need to get some varnish out and fix the one cupboard door before it gets grimy again. So I rate this product a three because it didn't clean away the old build up without considerable effort.
