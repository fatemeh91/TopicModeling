review/text: I've had a really tough time with several products made for stainless steel. They streak like crazy. I had a small amount of this from a previous resident and it's great stuff. I had done some research and people say mineral oil is good for putting a fingerprint resistant coating on the appliance and this has mineral oil in it. It puts a great shine on with no streaking.
