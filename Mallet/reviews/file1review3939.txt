review/text: I bought this because my teeth were beginning to yellow. My dentist (of course) suggested that I use an in-office whitening system that would cost a LOT of money. I decided I would give the Crest system a shot before I took the plunge with the dentist. This worked GREAT. In a couple of days my teeth had already begun to get lightened. Now, after the whole 7 days, I am pleased. They could be whiter for sure but they are absolutely good enough (especially at only $25). Application was pretty easy - be sure to press down the strip as much as possible as a lot of saliva collects while they are on. I got a little tender but nothing I would even remotely describe as painful. I am super glad I bought these!
