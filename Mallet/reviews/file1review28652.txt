review/text: I have always been a big fan of Optimum Nutrition as a brand for a long time and I've always found there protein products to be superb. I've seen great results by taking this product and will probably never buy a different brand. On the downside, the chocolate malt flavor was a little disappointing. I have found that the flavor is fairly bland and not tasting a sweet as i thought it would. Two of my favorite flavors ON offers are Caramel toffee and chocolate mint. Overall, i would buy this brand of protein, but not this particular flavor.
