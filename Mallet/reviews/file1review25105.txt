review/text: Okay I ran out of my usual protien powder so I thought I would try another supplement and I grabbed this. Really how bad can you make chocolate powdered drink mix, really bad. The smell is sickly sweet slightly chemical, the taste is vile just plain vile. Way to sweet if this is chocolate then it it came from a a better living through chemistry gone wrong. Also it makes sludge even when well blended. It is this thick not quite shake like dare I say liquid. While the product may have benefits in its formulation that make it good for someone training and working out, if you cannot consume it then it does you no good though.
