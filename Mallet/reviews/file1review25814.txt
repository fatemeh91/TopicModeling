review/text: I have owned a number of beard trimmers and maintained a variety of facial topiary. This is by far my favorite yet. I am picky about trimmers, too. In fact, I bought this trimmer only two weeks after buying and trying a different trimmer and being totally disappointed. I gave that one to my dad, and stepped up to the ER203K. How can I be excited about a trimmer? One reason is enough -- this trimmer has the finest and most numerous adjustment settings of any trimmer I have ever found. With my previous trimmers, I was always stuck between settings -- I could never get those extremely dense areas of my beard short enough without accidentally leaving a whole in my beard. Not with this guy, though.Everything else (battery life; cord; construction; ease of use) is very good about this trimmer, but the setting selection is what I really can rave about!
