review/text: First, the facts, because they're hard to find and ought to influence your decision:-- There are a dozen settings from 2 mm (1/12&quot;) to 18 mm (3/4&quot;).-- The battery should run the unit up to 40 minutes.-- A full charge takes 8 hours.-- The manufacturer estimates the battery will last about 400 uses.-- The cord is five feet long.-- You can remove and replace the knives.-- You CANNOT replace the battery: once it dies, you throw the unit out.Some comments, in no particular order: The knives are really sharp. The shape of the head gives you good control. You need to pay attention to the charging; you shouldn't leave it plugged in more than a couple days at a time (&quot;this may damage the batteries&quot;). An occasional oiling and cleaning is recommended.I'm happy with the performance and the quality, but this one gets only four stars because you can't replace the battery. We do, indeed, live in a throw-away society.
