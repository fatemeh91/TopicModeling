review/text: I just recieved my 2lb chocolate malt today in the mail, when I opened the package, I find out that the seal is broken and that only 1/3 of powder is in the container. I have found no way to contact them other than packaging feedback. I will no longer be purchasing anything from amazon unless they take care of this scam.
