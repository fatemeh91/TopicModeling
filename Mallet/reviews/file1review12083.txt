review/text: This is my first time taking prenatal vitamin. I spent a lot of time reading reviews for different brand of prenatal vitamin, before decideing on these. I have been taking this vitamin since early pregnancy, and I am 2 months after giving birth. I never had any problem with them.Vitamins that are foodbased work better for me. I like them because it is only one pill per day and they never made me feel sick to my stomach. I felt great all throughout my pregnancy.I would highly recommand them to any pregnant or soon to be pregnant woman
