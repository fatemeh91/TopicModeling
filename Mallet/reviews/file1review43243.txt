review/text: I wish Champion Nutrition was a more popular name brand. It's a name I trust. Every product that I have purchased from them has been top notch. With all the 'mostly marketing' products out there, it's nice that a company like Champion Nutrition has a product that I know is superior and they keep their prices at a reasonable level.Their shakes are the best tasting shakes around, period. I've tried them all (my neighbor owns a GNC) and this is by far the best tasting shake on the market. And the built in nutrition is awesome.If you haven't tried an Ultramet shake, buy a box, it'll be your favorite shake quickly. And unless you get suckered into another shake with more/better marketing, it'll be your go-to shake forever.Thanks Champion Nutrition! Now lets work on getting you more famous!
