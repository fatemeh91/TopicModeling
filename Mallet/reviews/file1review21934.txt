review/text: I am so thankful for this product. My daughter has gas after every meal. The doctor told us that it is the colic, and that we should try Mlyicon. They told us to give it to her before every meal. If you only use it once and a while, it gives her diarrhea. It works most every time. We give it to her before all meals, and then again after her bedtime meal. We also give it to her throughout the day when she is in obvious pain. Mylicon relieves this pain within minutes. I recommend this product to anyone who has a child who has the colic or just looks like their belly aches due to gas.
