review/text: I've used Michem for a long time and love the product but there's one problem each time I order "SPRING FRESH' I get 'SHOWER FRESH' instead! I want to know why this keeps happening. Do the people who handle this know what their doing?! After it happening for the third time I am ordering it from another sorce. I have nothing against Amazon but this on going problem has gotten to be too much. I get nothing but the runaround each time I tried to talk to these people.
