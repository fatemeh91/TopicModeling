review/text: I saw a few bad reviews before we bought this, but there were enough good ones to take a chance. It has paid off. Six months of constant use with no problems whatsoever. No leaks, no issues except for the valve I can't push in. I was afraid that would be a problem, but it sticks out of the bottom and is unnoticed by me and the baby.Baby got used to it after one "what the...?!" bath. It was nice to get away from the sink at bath time. (I'm sure I'll look back at those old pictures and miss those days, but for now we're enjoying the tub scene.) Baby was less than a year old when we started using it. She's 17 months old now, is big for her age and it will still be a while before she outgrows this tub.We keep it inflated so I don't have to hyperventilate blowing it up for each bath. It has stayed inflated all this time. (I added a few puffs of air one time and that was after about 4 months of use.) It has a suction cup on a outer flap, so I dump the water and stick it to the shower wall to dry. That may be why we have no leaks, but I obviously can't confirm that.Based on our experience, I recommend the product.
