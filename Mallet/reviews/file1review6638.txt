review/text: The problem for me with the cane is that I have fibromyalgia/myofascial pain syndrome and when I use my muscles they tighten up and stay that way. It hurts and restricts my movement. So, when I use the cane I am holding it and applying pressure to the knots in another part of my body, all the time working the arm, shoulder and neck muscles, causing more problems in THOSE muscles. If you are normal, I think the cane would be great. I prefer the Knobble or just a rubber ball.
