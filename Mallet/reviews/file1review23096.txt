review/text: Item was what I was looking for but I was disappointed that the handle comes apart every time I use the sweeper. Sweeper is actually very good...handle, not so much. PLEASE Bissell, correct this problem...it is a problem. I had to Duck tape the handle together! It is disappointing to have to "rig up" a brand new item! Other than that, it does what I need it to.
