review/text: I got the 'Extreme Milk Chocolate' flavor and am surprisingly happy with the product. I'm not that big of a fan of changing products after finding one I like. However, my old protein powder was starting to add up a lot. Not only does this shake actually taste like chocolate milk when you use milk, but it has more protein than my last, more expensive protein powder. It also mixes fairly well when shaken. I recommend this to everyone.
