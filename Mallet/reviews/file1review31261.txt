review/text: We have had a couple of these tubs for bathing our disabled son.The latest was the new improved one for sale here. After 3 uses the hose coupling came apart spilling water everywhere and the tub could not be repaired. We also found the new shape combersome and too high. After owning so many of these tubs with problems from seams giving way to the hose falling off we have decided to look for a better solution to bathing our disabled son. If better made this could be a good bathing solution.
