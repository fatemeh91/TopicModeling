review/text: I was a little worried about the pain that may be involved. But it's not so bad...depending on where you use it. Legs are no problem. Even bikini line wasn't bad. My friend said it well when she reminded me that the first time I plucked my eyebrows tears ran down my face and now I barely feel them. And I didn't think that it was nearly as bad as the first eyebrow tweezing incident. Maybe I'm tougher now.Anyway I think it is a lot better than shaving, and I have no compliants about the Braun 3370. It is a great product.
