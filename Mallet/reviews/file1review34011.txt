review/text: This cream did not provide relief for my excema, which is centered around my neck area. I have had excema (dermatitis) off and on for years, but it has become chronic since a particularly bad period for my hay fever allergies last October. I have no medical insurance, so have been hunting for an over the counter remedy.
