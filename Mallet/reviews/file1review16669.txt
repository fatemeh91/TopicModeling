review/text: This lighter is awesome!! I believe I paid nine dollars & forty-nine cents with free shipping... how can you go wrong? If you include the extras that I bought (flints, wick and fluid), I paid about eighteen dollars total... which is still less than the cheapest Zippo I've seen in the case at my local gas station! NOTE: This lighter comes with a wick and single flint already in place... all you need to do upon receiving it is add lighter fluid. Also, there's plenty of youtube videos out there showing you how to add fluid, change a flint, change a wick, etc. if you don't already know how.I was going to get a chrome version of this which I found for ten bucks, but once I saw that this was lower priced, I decided to go with this one. Plus, with this Zippo, it already looks "worn in" so you don't have to worry about it getting scuffed up in your vehicle or pocket. I almost bought one of Zippo's BLU butane series lighters (because I smoke cigars too), but after some thought, I could'nt imagine someone like John Wayne lighting his smokes with a Zippo BLU butane, so that kind of sealed the deal for me... not to mention that the cheapest Zippo BLU is 3x the cost of this little beaut. After purchasing this lighter, strangely enough, all my friends who smoke want to get their own Zippo and they ask to borrow this when they light their smokes instead of using their little Bic lighters. I'm very pleased with my purchase of this Zippo from Amazon... for the price, it's hard to go wrong!
