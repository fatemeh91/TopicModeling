review/text: I've been a customer of Optimum Nutrition for quite some time now and I have always been trying new flavors. I have to say that I've tried at least 7 different flavors now and this one has been the WORST. It tastes absolutely horrible. The only good thing about it was the fact that it was optimum nutrition so I knew it was good protein and it mixed really well...Or was it? When I received my package the plastic wrap was sealed but when I opened the jar the stay fresh seal was slightly open.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TASTE. Had to force myself to drink this one when I was MORE that happy to drink all the others.
