review/text: I have suffered with hemorrhoids for several years and was determined not to go through surgery a second time. When the product I previously used was taken off the market, much to my dismay, I had to search for a new one. I looked up the reviews on Mayinglong Musk Ointment Cream and took a chance. I am pleased to say I'm glad I did. Even though the smell of the musk can be a bit much I decided the relief was well worth it. I had a severe episode and needed relief. I followed the directions and used it 3x a day. It soothes and cools the itching and burning. I also incorporated some changes in my diet and drank more fluids. I am happy to report that my hemorrhoid has stopped itching and burning and has shrunk.I would recommend this product to anyone who is suffering with the unfortunate condition of hemorrhoids. Be willing to tolerate the musk scent. And you certainly can't beat the price. Compared to what you pay for store products this is a steal of a deal. I am already purchasing more just in case. I am grateful to the others who reported their results with this product and hope that my review will help someone else who is suffering make up their mind to give Mayinglong a try.
