review/text: I have been using this product for 3 months now. Not pregnant yet, but what I did like was how it regulated my cycle. I have been off the pill for over a year and I still was unable to track when my cycle would start. I was pretty irregular and it was frustrating. Within the first 2 weeks of being on the product I began my period when I was supposed too. So, I recommend it for someone who is like me that got pretty messed up from being on the pill.
