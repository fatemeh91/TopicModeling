review/text: They work well the first time, maybe the second - but after that the gel quickly disappears and they fall off the skin quite easily. With medical needs coming first, you are best off to get high quality pads that can be used over a couple weeks. The brand (I forget the name this moment) that my physical therapist uses kept working even after two weeks. I don't know if the ones reliamed ships are just old, or just not very high quality but you will waste more money by going through the pads quickly rather than purchasing higher quality pads at a higher price. Buyer beware.
