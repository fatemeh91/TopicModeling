review/text: I wouldn't buy these again. Firstly, I could not withdraw a sheet from the center of the roll without tearing the edge. I finally had to pull out the entire center which consisted of perhaps a third of all available sheets, then I couldn't reinsert those that I didn't need to use. I wrapped those in saran plastic wrap for later use. I also wrapped the entire container in saran wrap to keep the towelettes moist for later use. I really couldn't see any before and after difference.
