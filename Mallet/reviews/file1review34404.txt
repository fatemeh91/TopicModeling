review/text: Could not be happier! Works as advertised...a smooth ride every time! Some have remarked that the construction of the bottle lends it to leaking, which is true. However, this can be minimized by not removing the safety seal upon arrival, and instead poking a small hole in it with a needle. Mine just dribbles out now, and anytime it gets knocked over, it is no big deal.Highly recommended...
