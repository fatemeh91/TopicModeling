review/text: I love this thing. It's just right for me.This is definitely a compromise. It's not as good a shaver as, say, a Braun Syncro, and the trimmer is not as good as a dedicated Wahl trimmer. For example, you can't set the trimmer for longer hair. Short beards only, please.Still, the trimmer has a small end that's good enough for ear and nose hair. You can use it in the shower and you can clean it with water. For me, though, the biggest advantage is that I can replace a bathroom drawer full of gizmos, their cases, chargers and accessories with this one unit.Much nicer.
