review/text: I learned from people interested in naturopathy that Jarrow is a brand to be trusted for purity and potency. I have been using their sustain formula by taking one with plenty of water every night a few hours after my last meal, and one every morning before I make my breakfast. I take it for its antioxidant strength. I understand that amino acids like NAC work much better when taken on an empty stomach. I like the idea of taking a time-release form because NAC has such a short half-life. This tablet isn't the easiest to swallow: it has an unpleasant taste and sharper edges than a capsule, but at least it is shaped like a capsule instead of being circular.
