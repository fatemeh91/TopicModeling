review/text: I ordered this brush on Amazon. Don't be surprised with the appearance upon arrival. It appeared flattened on one side and I was questioning returning it. Within a couple of days, the brush fibers relaxed and it now looks totally normal. Overall, hey, it's just a bottle brush. It works well and cleans your children's ears out perfectly when you find out they are not listening to you!
