review/text: This product tastes great. It's the second time I've ordered it. Don't know about any other flavors. Kind of want to try "cake batter."I went to GNC to purchase a similar product and it did not taste as good as the Met-Rx product. This might cost a bit more but the taste compensates for it. I love the individual packets.I add spinach, kale, blueberries, bananas, strawberries, almonds & wheat germ. Very good shake in the morning.Gonna keep buying this stiff until something better comes out....
