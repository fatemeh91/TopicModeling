review/text: I used these pads for a few months. I have barely any leakage, and they contain minimal amount of breast milk well. I wouldn't recommend for moderate or heavy milk flow though. The major problem with these is no curvature. They are flat and get dislodged constantly exposing the nipples. I leaked few times on cloths on the street as well at nighttime frequently. Lace on the back doesn't do anything to hold them in place. They are also visible under clothing. After several months of use the surface became rough, so they are becoming very uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend these.
