review/text: I bought this Oral-B Triumph for myself and have been so pleased with the results. I have been a long-time electric toothbrush user, but this one surpasses any brand I have previously used in producing that feel of clean, polished teeth (and I haven't even used the polishing brush yet). My gums feel stimulated and healthy, too.My Mother and adult son have peridontal disease, so I purchased an Oral-B Triumph for each of them as a gift. It has not been long enough to judge any effect, but I am hopeful they will see improvement in gum health.The ability to choose a softer brushing has been a good option for me as I have one tender spot on my gum where I put it into use.
