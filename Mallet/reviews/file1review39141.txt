review/text: Bought this for Xmas as a stocking stuffer & it was a bigger hit than the ones under the tree. His old one had gotten so bad he felt it was just tugging the hair out & that one was 3 times more expensive & lasted about 24 months with infrequent use. He loves to shave his head & this gives a quick clean shave that he really likes. He even trims his mustache & goatee. Lots of attachments that he doesn't use because he just shaves to the skin, so can't comment on the usefulness of those.
