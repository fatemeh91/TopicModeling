review/text: I give 5 star to this charger.It is fast.Does the job if you use it in the USA.However inspite of some misleading information about using overseas this came from Amazon with a wall plug adapter that can only be used in the USA.On the manufacturer's web site a mention is made of DPS-3000e but no other details. The information sheet that came with the model I got mentions specification for AC adapter "AC 120V/AC239V/AC220V, 50-60Hz".HOWEVER the adapter I got can only be used with 120V AC 60HZ.So I am disappointed because I had been led to beleive this item will work abroad. SO be warned if you are planning to use it abroad at AC 220V 50Hz better look for another unit.
