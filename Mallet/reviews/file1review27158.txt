review/text: I researched protein powders by reading reviews and forum postins and on whey protein was one i kept seeing again and again. It was cheap too (comparatively) so i jumped on it.I'm trying to bulk up for my first year of college and this was the first powder ive tried. And its fantastic! For taste anyway, i havent had it long enough to look for results. With water, its ok, kind of bland but not bad tasting at all. A bit gooey, could be a bit sweeter, but i still liked it. I have only tried mixing it with a spoon and it easily dissolves but clumps in goo floaters. Not a problem for me.When i tried it with milk it was delicious! Tasted just like milk chocolate powder you get at grocery stores. Its almost too good as now when i get close to finishing my workouts i look forward too much to the postworkout snack and lose focus. Highly recommended!
