review/text: I am one of those first-timers that researches EVERYTHING... so when I first got pregnant I spent a lot of time researching the best prenatal pills. To put it simply, these are amazing. Other than being really nutritionally impressive, there were two "MUST HAVES" on my list --First, I HAAATE when I have to take pills three times a day... I always forget/give up after about the first one (which makes it pointless). This is ONE PER DAY. It's very, very nice and easy to remember.and even MORE IMPORTANTLY, they don't make me sick! I simply do not need the extra misery of being sick from my vitamins in my first trimester. I have had ZERO stomach aches or nausea from these. A HUGE deal to me (and frankly, the only time in my life a vitamin hasn't made me sick... it's a miracle).Anyway, I hope this helps!
