review/text: For several thousand years it has been known that the breath can be used to calm the mind and nervous system. Dr. Erik Peper the internationally famous biofeedback expert says:"There are NO absolute respiration values; range varies with the individual. Respiration is a continually changing homeostatic system. Pathology may be induced by forcing the system to match normative standards such as breathing at a fixed pace or volume. The breathing rhythm needs to be dynamically adapted and varied for each personEmwave and StressEraser do not allow for that breath variation and can cause increased tension instead of less. As far as the HearthMath Cut Through technique that is a Red Herring to create a marketing hook. Remember the KISS principle - keep it simple - diaphragm and reduced breathing is free- simple to learn - totally portable and is the core of HRV training.When you are watching a screen performance anxiety is a high possibility - also once you learn to meditate you can access the quiet stillness where the bodies wisdom resides. Technology blocks this important benefit.
