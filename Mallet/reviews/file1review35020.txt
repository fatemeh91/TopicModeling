review/text: I used this recently to prevent catching a bug two friends had (nasty cough). It did the job, and the little bit of phlegm and sneezing I was experiencing DISAPPEARED! Made me happy I didn't catch it, and plan to definitely use this in the future whenever exposed to prevent catching other's bugs.
