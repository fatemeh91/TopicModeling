review/text: I am a "dyed in the wool" ginger-lover and looked forward to a veritable explosion of hot, spicy, tangy ginger in my salivating mouth.Bummer...what was delivered was a somewhat honey-flavored confection...that was merely bland in its intention. Disappointing in demeanor...exhorbitant in cost.
