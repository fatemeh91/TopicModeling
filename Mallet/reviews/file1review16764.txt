review/text: There was nothing wrong with the product. It was me. I wanted a liquid paste wax, but I was mistaken on the brand. However I received the product above mentioned in excellent time and it put a nice shine on my hardwood, but just was not the type cleaner I was use to. Therefore I only gave it a 3-star rating. M.
