review/text: I couldn't imagine spending $30 on a seat adaptor -- so I didn't. I bought a cute character one with handles. It slipped and slided every time my daughter got on it. I bought a soft puffy one with ducks. It was much too high and slipped even more. I bought a stand-alone seat... she wouldn't use it. Finally, more than $50 later, I bought the $30 baby bjorn trainer. It fit perfectly. It didn't slip. It didn't slide. It has a loop at the top to hang it. AWESOME product!! I only wish I had found it first.
