review/text: This is a great pill organizer and perfect for anyone who take larger sized pills 4x daily. Prior to this, I had a lot of trouble finding containers that fit all my pills. And then there is the problem of carrying them around. Those great big 7 day, 4x a day organizers do not travel well, et cetera.These are super easy for carrying around. The tray holds all seven, so in the morning I can just grab the one for that day and toss it my purse without having to carry around a massive amount of pills. And still having all 4 sets with me and separated makes it a lot easier when I am out all day and have to take 2-3 sets of pills away from home.It would be great however if they made a set like these only with 6 instead of 4 compartments (I know this company also makes ones with only 2 compartments for those who take pills less often.) My grandmother has Parkinson's Disease and has to take pills 6 times a day, and I know there are many other people who need to take there medications more than 4 times a day, and there just are not enough (any!) options for those people.I will say, one other downside is an issue others commented on, the lids do not open all the way making it a little difficult to fill and empty, as well, they are slightly difficult to open.When I first reviewed this product right after receiving it, the flip lids looked flimsy to me, and I was not sure how long lasting they would be. Well, it's been several months since I bought these, and I have had no problems with any breaking. My only problem has been that I lost the Thursday box, so now I'm back to buy a new set.
