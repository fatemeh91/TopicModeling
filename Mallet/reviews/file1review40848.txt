review/text: My son is 7 years old and weighs about 38 pounds. I have tried many alternative vitamin and herbal products for him while trying to keep him off prescription drugs for his adhd. He couldn't control his impulses in school. Constantly talking,making noises,always out of his seat, not listening to teacher and refusing to complete his work. He couldn't concentrate and was prone to temper tantrums.I've had him on bright spark and focus for a couple weeks now and his teacher can't believe the change in him. He does his work, stays in his seat and doesn't make noises all day. He is bringing home greens now ( good behavior reports ) where before it was reds every day!! I would recommend trying these products together but the bright spark by itself did a make a difference. Good Luck!!
