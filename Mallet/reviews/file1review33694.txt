review/text: I owned Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser before this one, I still prefer the original it has a larger water capacity a stronger water jet stream, the more expensive one claims to have 10 PSI higher water pressure than the original I don't believe that to be true. Each waterpik last about three years on average, I work from home so I can have the opportunity to use it after each meal or snack my dental hygienist says it's a pleasure because I have so little oral plaque and no cavities for the last 15 years.It is money well spent to keep from having a cavity.http://www.amazon.com/Waterpik-WP-100-Ultra-Water-Flosser/dp/B000GLRREU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1359149171&sr;=8-1&keywords;=WaterPik
