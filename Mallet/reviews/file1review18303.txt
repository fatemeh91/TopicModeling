review/text: I've used my hydro-pack for over 30 years on everything from broken ribs (3 times) to injured shoulders, back ache and more. It speeds up the healing process, reduces pain, and relaxes muscles. It's good for preparing the injured muscle area for massage which I do with my foam roller. Mine started to smell funky so I boiled it and put a little non chlorine bleach into the pot. The funk is gone and the pack is going strong. A great product that lasts.
