review/text: I finally got my old Nalgene bottle cleaned out that has been hiding at the back of my cupboard with this great brush. I thought the bottle WAS clean until I saw that the slightly cloudy film that was on the very bottom was not there anymore. I couldn't be happier knowing that I won't be drinking anymore germs or excess cleaning products that failed to rinse. When this one wears out I will purchase another.
