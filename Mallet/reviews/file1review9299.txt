review/text: I have only owned this product for 5-6 months and I bought two, ie: the effective usage for each is only 90 days use. The ONLY positive things to be said is that these do work fairly well when wanting to pack a limited number of daily doses for a long week-end trip. The minuses are many. First, I am 66, and take daily heart and diabetic meds (over 12 per day), and of keen mind (I am a highly productive member of an elite group of auditors at a major bank). Due to the "convenience" of separate daily packs, these are easy to hide, lose and get out of order. If the user has even early dementia, good luck. Frankly, I have difficulty tracking down all of them at least monthly. Second, the design is flimsy. The hinge on the clam-shell on most of my 14 (2 sets) have already weakened to the point that refilling them takes both manual dexterity and patience. I find myself pushing the lids open for each of my pills, which is annoying and time-consuming. If the lids are opened more than a perfect 90 degrees, the entire clam-shell rolls over backwards and the pills drop out. In addition, unlike the 7-day am/pm rectangle, you can't open just one side, so you have to hold your fingers over the pm pills to avoid spilling while dispensing the am pills. Can't imagine what I would do to fill these if arthritis or dementia set in, not to mention the patience required. Finally, the overall space is required to store is more than double that of the 7 days am/pm rectangle style I just re-ordered today to use these ONLY for the aforementioned long weekend trips. In fact, I found that it was very easy to misplace these on just those trips unless you put them in a separate zip-lock bag. Overall, the concept looks great, but in the real world of full-time use: DO NOT BUY.
