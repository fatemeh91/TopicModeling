review/text: This actually is a very good product. I'm just a simple guy who goes to the gym 3 times a week to be healthy and of course to try to build a good looking body (without steroids and stuff like that) so honestly i can not say this really help you build body mass fast. But is has decent "good" taste and medically speeking, you do need protein if you are lifting weight, just don't spect magic.
