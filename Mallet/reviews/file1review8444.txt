review/text: OXO generally makes a good product. This is a nice brush. But for cleaning out my NISSAN 34oz themas it barely does the job. The handle should be about 3 to 4 inches longer and the bristles could be a little stiffer. A mix of stiff and softer bristles would be ideal. It works well for cleaning out my NISSAN Tea tumbler. Stiffer bristles would make getting the little ring of fine tea leaf residue that always seems to collect at the bottom and just wont rinse out at the end of the day when I finally get home. Its a good product just room for improvement.
