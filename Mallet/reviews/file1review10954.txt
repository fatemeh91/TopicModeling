review/text: I love this product. Just one thing to watch out for. If you are spraying your back be careful not to let spray run down your back and enter the crack of your rear end. It burns. I spray my hands and apply to my low back to prevernt this. I 'm passing this along to keep anyone from learning the hard way. I even use this product on my arthritic hands. It works.
