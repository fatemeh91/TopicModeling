review/text: If you are looking at buying this for yourself, you probably practice martial arts. Just buy it, you'll save huge amounts of money vs buying single rolls. This stuff works great at keeping your joints together when the ligaments have had all they can take. Easily tears in half for making thin strips for wrapping fingers. It also sticks well so that gause won't fall off. Need a quick patch for a torn gi? Just grab some Coach tape and you'll be back in business in no time.
