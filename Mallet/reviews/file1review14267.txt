review/text: SUMMARY: Poor quality - two units failed after short time.REVIEW: I bought one of these late last year in the hopes of reducing, if not eliminating the need to scrub the shower. There were several issues:1. Sprayer would not cover all areas of the shower (lower portion of walls as well as far wall received insufficient spray).2. Unit stopped working after pressing button two times in succession. Remvoal/replacement of batteries does not resolve. I suspect that a circuit which controls the motor burned out. Since the unit developed a crack in the housing as a result of it falling off the hook, I did not attempt to return the unit.I bought a second unit, thinking that perhaps only the one was defective (perhaps due to dropping). The same problems noted above were observed with the second unit. I returned the unit to the store for a refund.CONCLUSION: I don't recommend purchasing this unit due to its inadequate coverage and poor reliability. Either stick with the "elbow grease" method or buy an attachment for a power drill.
