review/text: I bought two of these terry changing pad covers when my first child was born. We now have a second child, and the covers are still holding up nicely. They wash and dry very well with any load of clothes. There seems to be no pilling to or from other garments. The colors do fade, but no more than what is expected. Best of all, stains wash out well with a stain remover (just like a towel). For all of the stains I could not get out of my children's clothing and bibs, it's nice to know their changing pad covers always look clean.
