review/text: I think that Zantrex-3 works exactly as it should. No, you are not going to take the pill, continue to eat as you normally do, and magically lost weight. If anyone finds a pill that does that, please let me know. Basically, Zantrex-3 is a caffeine pill. Sure, it says it contains all kinds of really impressive-sounding ingredients, but it boils down to a caffeine pill. And caffeine pills can and do work for weight loss in the sense that they suppress your appetite and give you a boost of energy. So, this pill can give you that extra edge a lot of us need to lose weight, but it absolutely must be used in moderation and along with exercise and proper diet to work right. Can it make you feel nervous or jittery? Yes, just like drinking 5 cups of coffee could. I suggest following the instructions and taking the pills with a lot of water 15-30 minutes before eating. I would only recommend taking no more than 4 pills a day (though I believe the bottle says you can take up to 6). Four pills should be plenty to get you through your day. The bottom line is not to expect some miracle with this pill, or any pill for that matter. It can give you an extra edge and assist with weight loss, but nothing will just magically make extra weight disappear without exercise and a proper diet.
