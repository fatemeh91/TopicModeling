review/text: I ordered the foil and cutterblock replacement kit because after three or four years of use my foil developed a tear and I couldn't find a replacement in any stores near me. I didn't really want the cutterblock but I was pleasently surprised at the difference it made. With the new cutterblock and new foil it's like having a new razor again. True the kit is more expensive than I expected but not nearly as much as a new razor.
