review/text: I very much looked forward to the support of this cradle during my twin pregnancy. They don't seem to be sized for petite women; rather taller women with long torsos. I tried two different sizes and neither fit appropriately for me. Both fit well through the shoulders but were baggy through the middle, thus not supportive, even in late term. Alas, I returned the cradle for a full refund.
