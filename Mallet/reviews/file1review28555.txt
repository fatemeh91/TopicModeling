review/text: I have tried several other proteins and although they were not bad, I soon started to notice the expense they were becoming. I then started doing some research through some trusted websites and came upon this brand, and I must admit that I will never try another brand again. This brand makes all the supplements you need for anything that you're into, and this protein in particular gives you the most for your dollar.- Servings -With 75 servings in one of these, with a subscription through amazon you will be paying less than .50 cents for each serving. Each serving giving you 24 grams of protein, among other things as well that are included (see label).- Price -As stated earlier, you cannot go wrong with this brand of protein. You simply cannot ignore the quality of the protein and the relatively cheap price for which it sells.- Taste -Delicious! Do not be fooled by the natural look, this brand has done its homework and they give you quality. You don't see any shinny containers, huge muscle guys on the label of the container, or anything that screams buy me! They rely on their quality to speak for itself. The taste of this protein is pretty good, specially with a low sugar content and it is super easy to mix.Overall, I cannot be more satisfied with this protein and I will not be praising it anytime soon. I highly recommend it to everyone I come in contact with, I hope this helps you as well.
