review/text: I have used this product since it came out. I have a very tough beard and very tender skin. Not a good combination. I like the pleasant smell of Afta. It soothes rather than burns and I am seventy years old and people often mistake me for being in my fifties, many people comment upon the pleasant smell of the product. I think that the product moisturizes my skin and helps my skin remain youthful in appearance.
