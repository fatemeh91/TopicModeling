review/text: I wanted to love these as other reviewers have. I don't think my children move around when sleeping much, but the pads bunched up.I bought these for my 8 year old and my 4 year old. Both still in pullup/goodnights. Bedwetting is an unfortunate heredity issue.They used these pads for about 7 weeks. Not one night did these pads stay in the right spot. My 4-year-olds was bunched up before 10 PM (when we checked before going to bed ourselves)and the 8-year-olds was by morning.So...I still had to wash sheets every day. Along with the pad protectors. I must add, that the pads held up to being washed many times and are still soft.I like them enough, that I am considering putting velcro to hold them in place on the sheets or just sewing. I would recommend getting the ones with edges you can tuck in.
