review/text: I purchased this pack for a corporate leadership training course.I needed something light weight, but comprehensive. This kit fit that criteria.It has everything from cotton swabs, bandages, sterile dressings, diarrhea medicine, allergic symptoms medicine, gloves, safety pins and much more.Flat out this was the most comprehensive light weight kit that I could find. I'm very please with the value of this product.
