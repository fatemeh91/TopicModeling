review/text: Too many times I've watched commercials for toothbrushes and wondered how many times we can reinvent the wheel. They come with raised bristles, uneven bristles, tongue cleaners, cheek cleaners, ergonomic handles, smart bristles....You can forget them all. The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care -- and sonic dental care in general -- is the next generation of dental care. As someone who's had far too familiar a relationship with my dentist, I finally took the plunge and made an investment in my teeth. If you're like me, wondering just how much better an expensive gadget like this is than a $3 toothbrush, let me assure you you'll know the answer the first time you use this.After you get used to the skull rattling (and it does go away after the first couple uses), you'll actually enjoy the feel of the powerful brush head against your teeth and gums. The depth of the cleaning is immediately noticeable and refreshing.The Oral-B comes with both a floss action brush head for every day cleaning and a polishing head for occasional polishing. The settings on the brush are diverse, allowing for firm, soft or massaging pressure depending on your preference. You can also set the brush to remind you to move on to another areas of your teeth every 30 seconds so you get a thorough, even clean. The display keeps track of battery life and the whole unit fits nicely into the compact base or the included travel case.I don't like buying $100 shoes when I can pick up a pair for $20. I didn't think I could ever spend $100 on a toothbrush when my grocery store sells standard models for a couple bucks. But the older I get the more I realize you generally get what you pay for. If you're like me and wouldn't mind if you never saw that big needle or heard that whining drill again, make the investment on the front side by getting the Oral-B. It really will help you avoid the back-end dental bills.
