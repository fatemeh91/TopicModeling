review/text: I ordered these to wear &#34;all the time&#34;. They are for my second ear piercing which is slightly higher up on the lobe. I had them pierced a few years ago but they are still dificult to get earrings back in when changing. These are great because the backs lock on and the post is slightly larger, not longer, than a regular pierced earring. They are also a very nice color and look great. I have gotten many compliments.
