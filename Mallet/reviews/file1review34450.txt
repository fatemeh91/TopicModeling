review/text: This stuff is awesome. I tend to stay very dry no matter what the situation. My bf showed up with this and, it was instantly a hit. No more battle wounds or day breaks to heal up:p However, the dispenser tipped over on the hardwood floor and in a second the entire bottle looked like an oul slick, that put BPs slip up to shame!! Beware... Only a small amount needed!!
