review/text: I have bought Remington and Norelco , the Wahl 4000 beats them all, screen or rotory. It has more power and I can get nine shaves on one recharge. The others I was lucky to get three.The only thing I do'nt know about is how long it will recharge, because I have only had it for one month.The others were terrible, they would only last about 11/2 to 2 years.If I get the 6 to 7 years they advertise, this is the razor I'll always own!
