review/text: I've been taking Green Vibrance every morning for the last 5 years upon my naturopathic doctor's recommendation. I suffered with seasonal allergies (both spring pollen and summer ragweed) for over 20 years. Often I would end up with a case of bronchitis because of it. I started taking GV in the spring of '05 and haven't had seasonal allergies since! It must do wonders for the immune system and detoxifying the body in general.
