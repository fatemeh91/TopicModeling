review/text: At first glance this scale looks fairly sophisticated. Looks can be deceiving. I'm fairly certain that the body fat sensor don't do anything at all. Why does a body fat measuring device need to know if you are an athlete or what your height is? If is truly measuring resistance through your body this info should be irrelevant! What it is actually doing is calculating your BMI. That is completely useless if you want to know your bodyfat percentage! Don't believe me? Change your height! Your body fat will go down if you say you are taller and will go up if you say you are shorter! In exact accordance with a BMI chart! Utterly useless!!!I rated this a two because the scale works very well. People having trouble with the scale must be using their unit on carpet! That or their's is defective.
