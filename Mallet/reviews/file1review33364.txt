review/text: These blades work ok. You really need to know what your doing with a safety razor to use these. They work better than 8 blade disposable crap from the grocery store, but there are better DE blades out there for the same price. Astra and Feather are the best, even Shark performs better. It's all about face type though. Keep trying until you find one that's right for you. Just make sure you know what you're doing first.
