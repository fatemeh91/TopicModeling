review/text: I gave this as a holiday gift and it works great.PROS:Relatively quite operationHeats water quickly to desired temperature, not too hot!Powerful jets really provide soothing relief for tired feet.Well designed to prevent splashes and spillsCONS:You cannot add oils or salts as this voids the warranty.Inter-dimensional Portal setting opens a rift between dimensions and causes beings from another world to grasp at ones feet (this may be an advanced massage technique).So overall I find t to be a great product at a great price, but as you can see in the photo, the misshapen hands from another dimension pawing greedily at your shins can be very distracting.
