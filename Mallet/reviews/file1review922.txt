review/text: These feel great. I have a set at work and one at home. Whenever I'm sitting at my desk I roll them around under my feet. They're a little stiffer than ones I've had before which is nice - I can press as hard as I want and they don't cave in on me. They've helped my poor feet feel better during and after a long day.Another product I really like that you might look at:Rosallini Compact Foot Care Relax Plastic Roller Massager Pink White
