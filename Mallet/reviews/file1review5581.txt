review/text: When my dentist suggested I try using a Proxabrush with its replaceable brushes I thought, "What a pain!" I really did not want to be bothered. Just like when I first began flossing it takes a little time to learn how to use it and I when through a couple of the replacement brushes in the first week. But now that I know how to use it I use it at least twice a day and carry the portable Proxabrushes with me as well. It is wonderful to get all the stuff out between your teeth.
