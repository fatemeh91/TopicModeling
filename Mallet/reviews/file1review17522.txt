review/text: Though marketed as a trimmer, I expected to be able to get a decent shave/detail out of this as well. With most trimmers you can remove the adjustable length setting part to shave off stubble and/or detail your facial hair. Not the case here. Even with the adjustable head removed, there is a good few millimeters gap between the blades and the guard, preventing you from getting even a modestly close shave. Not what I was expecting.
