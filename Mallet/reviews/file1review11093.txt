review/text: This is the garlic pill to take when you're having a MRSA outbreak. The Allicin is what kills the MRSA naturally!And it also helps you with your cholesterol & blood pressure!I take it everyday for my MRSA & cholesterol & blood pressure.I've had MRSA since 2005, and started the garlic in fall 2007 & I still take it everyday! It helps & works!
