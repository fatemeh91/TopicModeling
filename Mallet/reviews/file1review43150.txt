review/text: Worked well for the price, my only fault (completely my own) is that I ordered it to wash interior windows but never thought about the fact that it can't get down into the spot between the window and dashboard.The squeegee itself though works great, I love the little wiper blade on one side, and the sponge on the other just like a real one. I didn't find it to be too stiff or flimsy either, the exterior of my windows are crystal clear. I just have to find a solution to the inside windows!
