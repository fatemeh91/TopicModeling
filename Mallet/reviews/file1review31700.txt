review/text: I bought the Caribbean Lemon roll-on deodorant directly from the Fa site. I was searching for a roll-on with a clean light fresh citrus scent. The product works fine, but the fragrance is reminiscent of a bold, masculine shaving product or deodorant, such as Old Spice/Mennen. While the scent doesn't dominate for more than hour, it isn't my cup of tea. Years ago, I used Jean Nate roll-on deodorant (no longer available), and I thought the fragrance might be closer to that.
