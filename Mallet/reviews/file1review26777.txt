review/text: So far I've tried cookies and cream and mocha cappuccino. Both are good. Prior to Optimum Nutrition, I tried some brand from the pharmacy that tasted like artificial sweetener. The mocha cappuccino is awesome because it isn't overly sweet - plus coffee and chocolate, how can you go wrong?
