review/text: I bought this product with the intention of getting some benefit from it's relaxing properties. I took at first two at a time, then four, six eight... nothing of note happened. I'm thinking that either the product is complete bogus, or that the chemical properties were altered when it was shipped (it states to be stored at room temperature, and I have a hard time believing that it was shipped at room temp.). Either way, don't bother with this product.
