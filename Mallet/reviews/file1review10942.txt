review/text: I've been using this brand for at least 8 years now. I've tried just about everything on the market for lactose intolerance and nothing works except this product, and it works perfectly! If any food I eat, not just milk products, gives me a loose stool I just take one of these and I'm good to go. I like them much better than Pepto Bismol! lol As well as they work I still limit my intake of dairy as my system is ultra-sensitive.
