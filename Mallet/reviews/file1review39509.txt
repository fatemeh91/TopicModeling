review/text: I am a young teenager so I guess you could call me a &quot;beginner&quot;. Teenagers at this point always have to make sure they have great protection. And I can say that Skintimate Moisturizing Shave Gel, Sensitive Skin offers plenty of that. I've only nicked myself once (which is a miracle)! Parents at this point are also very protective about what products thier child is using and the protection. Both my mother and I approve of this product and I hope you do too. I haven't tried any other scents from skintimate, but I am looking forward to it!
