review/text: I don't see any real benefit to this. I was using this with toothpaste and my teeth did get a shade or two browner (as opposed to using electric tooth brush from sonicare).Also, sometimes, if I angle the brush the wrong way, it irritates my gums.I feel much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush. Maybe there is something to this ionic technology, but its not ENOUGH to whiten teeth and help prevent cavities (a small cavity I had got slightly bigger).I'm keeping this brush exclusively for dry brushing ONLY. This is worth less as a main cleaning tool.
