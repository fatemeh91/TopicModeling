review/text: UPDATED: October 22nd, 2012I'll keep this short & sweet: Aside from the great price per pound of pure 5 grams of L-ARGININE, this tastes like PURE SATANIC EVIL.The powder itself is pretty odorless, but:1) When mixed with water only, tastes like sewer/toilet/poop water.2) When mixed with milk or protein shake, the taste is still there, it will ruin ur shake...3) When mixed with orange juice, the aweful taste is 75% gone, but the OJ gets too creamy.4) When mixed with Lemonade, the taste is about 90% gone, but way too sweet if you get it the pre mixed kinda like Turkey Hill..THE BEST WAY TO GET RID OF 99% OF BAD TASTE IS THIS:Mix it with a low calorie (5 cal) lemonade powder mix like crystal lite or other low cal mix... Lemonade flavor is the best...it somehow neautralizes the HORRIBLE FLAVOR.BOTTOM LINE, will I buy it again? YES, until they comeout with a cheaper good flavor ARGININE, this is it...UPDATED: October 22nd, 2012
