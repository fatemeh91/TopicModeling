review/text: I can't believe how much I love these. I cannot ever be without them now that I have tried them. The tiniest shortest hair is grabbed by these. My skin on my chin and upper lip is so soft and absolutely no hair. Used in conjunction with a magnifying mirror, you will never have any stragglers left on your face. They can pull any length facial hair out. Even if it looks like a speck, it grabs it and removes it. If these were twice the price I would still own them. I have tried everything for facial hair removal and nothing no matter how high tech or costly it is, can remove ALL the hairs on the face except for these tweezers. They have a very precise tip and it grabs anything. Great for splinters as well. I highly recommend these. Best tweezers I have ever owned in my life and I am a senior citizen so I have tried many things over the years.
