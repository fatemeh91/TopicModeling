review/text: I found that the optima generally broke off the hair on my legs more often than it removed it from the root. This results in a need to either shave or use the epilator again within a short period of time. I also found that it wouldn't even pick up some hairs despite my going over the area repeatedly. Overall I had hoped that this would replace shaving which it hasn't so it was generally just a waste of money.
