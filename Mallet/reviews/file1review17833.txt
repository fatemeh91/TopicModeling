review/text: When I checked with my optomistrist office on what to use to "really" clean my gas permeable lenses, I was told to buy Optimum. I'm glad I did! It is a great cleaner and goes beyond my expectations. I've been wearing the gas permeables for many years and this is really the best product I've used for cleaning. Great job and I highly recommend using it daily.
