review/summary: Excellent texture, but too expensive review/text: If you need dry wipes for cleaning a baby, then these are the best quality I've found. The Medline are good bang for the buck dry, but when you wet them they are too rough; probably too tightly woven even though smooth on the surface when dry. Would give PeeWees 5 stars if it weren't for the price. Also wish these dry wipes came with dispensers. Doesn't anyone make dry baby wipes that come in dispensers just like wet wipes? It would seem like an obvious product to make, but I haven't come across any yet.
