review/text: I've been on the Herbalife nutritional supplements for about 3 months now and while i am probably an extreme case due to the amount of exercise i regimented myself to; i firmly believe that Herbalife helped my body to lose over 35 lbs since the beginning of the year. After completely revamping my nutrition and exercise schedule, i take great pride in the weight i've lost. I know it is an expensive product but if you are serious about losing weight, and promoting a healthier lifestyle i stand by the product through and through.It's not going to be easy, losing weight is slow and tedious and a culmination of good daily decisions to eat right and exercise. I, for example; ran for 45 minutes a day 5 days a week for a month (and continue to do so 3-5 days a week), while also cutting out ALL FAST FOOD, SODAS and Alcohol. After the first month of sacrifice, I've since returned to having 1-2 drinks a weekend but thats just because i love my booze! =) 4 Small Meals a day of high protein and 1 colorful balanced meal of healthy veggies, carbs and lean protein (chicken or fish) and i was on my way. I'd love to help anyone else that is interested and dedicated to changing their life like i did! Thank you Herbalife!
