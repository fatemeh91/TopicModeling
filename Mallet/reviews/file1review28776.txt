review/text: I have never tried protein shakes before, so I did my research before I bought this product. I am glad I ended up buying it. I enjoy the taste and I can feel the difference after a good workout at the gym. I feel recouperated very shortly after I drink my shake. I recommend making a shake using a blender and experiment with different fruits and other ingredients to make your shake taste even better and for added benefits. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
