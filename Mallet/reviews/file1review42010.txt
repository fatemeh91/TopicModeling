review/text: I purchased this unit as a Christmas present for my father. The battery is charged, the horn works, the brake releases, but the unit is apparently defective and will not budge. Aside from that, the stickers are all curling off either from poor design - they don't fit well - or a poor adhesive. The box was in fine condition when it arrived so I chalk all these problems up to really bad QA out the door. I will be talking to their tech support ASAP and have to tell my dad he won't be getting his present until next year. Hey Invacare QA, have a scroogy Christmas!
