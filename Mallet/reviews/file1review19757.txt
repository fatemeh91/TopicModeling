review/text: The Baby Bjorn potty seat is super easy to use - just stick it right on the seat and turn the dial to tighten or loosen. It works perfectly with our elongated toilet. Our 2-year old son uses it with ease and is perfectly content to sit there for a long time - sometimes longer than I want him to - he's happy just hanging out on there reading his books. That said, I do notice that his bum is red when he gets off, which makes me wish the seat were cushy. However, he does not seem uncomfortable sitting on the seat at all and will sit there for 20 minutes sometimes. So, I guess he is comfortable and whatever is causing the redness doesn't bother him.
