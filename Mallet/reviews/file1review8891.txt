review/text: This review is a copy of my review of the Kilo size GV but I wanted to rewrite it for those who may only want to buy it in the smaller size.I was VERY leery about trying this product, BUT, to my surprise, it is the best tasting drink on the market. I truly thought it would have a "green aftertaste" and I was wrong, it is just a "delicious" taste.I mix mine with either 8 oz of pineapple juice or orange juice (or a 1/2 and 1/2 combo, add 1/2 scoop of ON Platinum Hydrowhey or ON Gold Standard Whey Strawberry flavor, and a scoop of Vibrant Health's Rainbow Superfood. Each shake costs me less than $2.40 to make. IMHO, MUCH cheaper and better for you than any other shake on the market!It is so good, that I will occasionally have another shake in the afternoon. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but compared to other products, this is far superior in quality. Amazon does have the BEST prices and if it is purchased in the bulk size,you get a better deal.I also believe that Vibrant Health's policy of letting the consumer know EXACTLY what is in each scoop of powder is terrific. God only knows what is in the "proprietary" blend of my former shake! So, I would try it and buy the small size first, then if you like, buy in bulk, because it will be cheaper!Enjoy!
