review/text: I have had problems with my teeth for years. I decided that an electric toothbrush might help. I did a lot of research before deciding on this one. It hasn't disappointed me. I was really interested in the floss cleaning action head. I really didn't feel that I needed all the bells and whistles that the new 9900 model has. Basically this brush has the same features except one less brushing mode and it doesn't have the wireless display. Quite frankly, I really don't see the sense in the wireless display. I think it would be hard to keep an eye on that and brush at the same time.I couldn't believe how clean my teeth felt after the first time I used the brush. I felt like I just walked out of the dentist office. I've noticed that my teeth are even a little whiter now too. It is a little hard to get use to if you've never used an electric brush before. After a month of use,I'm use to it. The recommended 2 minute brush time flies right by. I get a little happy smiley face on the display when I'm done.I read 1 review that they writer was disappointed in the floss action head. They complained that it doesn't replace flossing. Please note that it's specifically mentioned on the box that it won't replace flossing. I find it really does a great cleaning job!
