review/text: I am in the 40's. I developed a knee problem starting in my late 30's and I was afraid of walking on stairs. I also had sore arches when I began to play raquetball two and half years ago. I tried various insole pads and sports creams, which didn't work. One day I saw the infomercial and ordered one pair. I have worn them ever since because they have taken pain off my knees and soles completely. Now I can play hard on the court thanks to them.
