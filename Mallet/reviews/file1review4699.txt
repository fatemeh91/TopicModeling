review/text: I ordered this item on dec 17 and it got here on dec 23rd! Did not expect it this year at all. Great shipping speed! I have been taking Herbalife formula 1 shakes in conjunction with other Herbalife products since january 2011. I have lost 40 pounds. This tastes so much better than other competitive brands. I usually add 2 scoops with 8oz of nonfat milk, 1 banana, and 2 frozen strawberries. YUM. Then I vary the fruit I use. Its a great healthy breakfast or even meal.
