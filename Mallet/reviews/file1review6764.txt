review/text: I really wish this was less strange looking. A couple knobs I don't use in particular pretty much make it look like a contorted pleasure toy but it's effective and there's no better way to work the knots in your shoulders and traps. I wouldn't even know how to work those knots in the middle of the back without it, especially with my tyrannosaurus-rex short arms. I bought a trigger point reference to go with it. I recommend that as well but you can find them on your own if you experiment. Currently using this when knots in the traps causes neck tightness and shoulder pain. Also this makes for a great self foot massage too. It's easy to underestimate how much discomfort travels right from the soles of your feet upwards. I've recommended it to friends who once they got over how silly it looks, realize it's effective. That being said, it's better than some gimmick but it's not a miracle tool and not a substitute for physical therapy, medical professionals, and so on and so forth.
