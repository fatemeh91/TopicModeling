review/text: When I went to use it recently, the battery was dead. Had only used it once before.My 2 year had a high fever, and I was left with nothing to check her temperature.I was just about to purchase a new battery, when I read these other reviews, so have just decided to dump it instead.Some companies will stop at nothing to make a quick buck, even at the expense of babies and kids.Next time I will avoid Vicks, and find something a little more reliable.
