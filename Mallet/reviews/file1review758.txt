review/text: I grew up using these on dishes (mainly pots and pans) because my mom always said they work the best at getting off stuck on food without ruining your pans. Then, once they get old, after a month or two, they "graduate" to scouring cloths for cleaning sinks! Now that I am an adult, I can't stop using them. I even have my husband hooked! These are becoming harder to find in local stores and grocery shops, so I ordered them...and got a great deal!
