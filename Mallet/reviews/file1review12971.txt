review/text: I got my father-in-law one of these two years ago, since he suffers from a degenerated disc in his neck. He uses it every day to help relieve the pain. I just bought a second one so he can keep one in the freezer here at our house and won't have to suffer when he's away from home.It's made of heavy nylon/plastic, which doesn't seem to get brittle with age. The gel inside gets a little stiff but still bendable when frozen, and it stays cold for about an hour. It re-freezes quickly and folds so it doesn't take up too much room in the freezer. The shape of it is perfect for neck and shoulders, and it's not too heavy on his neck.A great product - nice enough that I bought a second one.
