review/text: The shaver is expensive but the system does work. The first cleaning cartridge lasted over 5 months, using it every 2 to 3 days on average. No evaporation loss that I could tell. You can add a small amount of alcohol to extend it but I am not sure that is within warrantee, etc. I did shake the shaver blade out before using the cleaner, so that keep the fluid clean and fresh. However, when I finished the cartridge there was a very fine screen on the intake side so it may not have been necessary. One thing to note is that you cannot take this on a plane - even if you check luggage.I am sensitive to smells, but the lemon scent was not a problem even though I could smell it when the freshly cleaned razor was right under my nose. I have a hard face to cut and, as I am getting older, it gets harder to do a good job. This razor is a good compromise. Safe and close but not as good as a blade. It does have a problem with longer hairs on my neck. You need to keep the skin very tight to get a close shave and do it every day. The battery is very long lasting and I don't need to travel with the cord for a 4 or 5 day trip.
