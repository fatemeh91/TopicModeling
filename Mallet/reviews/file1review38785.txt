review/text: If you are sick of that whey-like chocolate phony taste that comes in so many diet shakes, this is a much better choice for you. It's the only one I can drink now that makes me think of REAL chocolate and not "chocolate cardboard" as I like to call it.I did get better results with some of the other brands but I suspect it's because I wanted fewer of those as sometimes I'd just get sick from thinking about the phony, chemical flavor they called "chocolate."By the way, this mixes very easily in your shaker. You don't get those left-over little globs all around the bottom.
