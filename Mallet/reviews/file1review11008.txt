review/text: I bought this as a "gift" to my sister. She has bad breath and uses everything from listerine and other mouthwashes, soap on her teeth, different toothbrushes, etc and still has problems with bad breath. I gave her this and less than 2 weeks later, she LOVES it!! It has solved her bad breath problems and the only downside for her is green feces when she goes to the bathroom but that's it!
