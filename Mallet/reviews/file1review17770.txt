review/text: Have been using Norelco Beard Trimmers over the years...battery failed to recharge and I was forced to consider a replacement. Switched to the Remington MB-200 and was amazed at how wonderful this trimmer performs....it is sleek, has blades that never need to be lubed, and holds a good charge...completely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend over similar Norelco trimmers.
