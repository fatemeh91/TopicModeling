review/text: This was a nice when I was on a road trip and needed a neck pillow so I wouldn't ruin my neck if I should chance to fall asleep in the car, but this isn't exactly an ideal product. I don't know if this is a problem everyone would have, or if it's just because I have such a little neck, but unless I sit there holding the neck-pillow closed tightly with my hands, it provides no cushioning and I cannot feel the massage. If I maintain the uncomfortable posture, I can feel a little massage, though the pillow is too tall and so it comes up about halfway behind my head, making the position less-than ideal if I mean to lean back at all. Neck pillows are always too big for me, though, (I am 5'3 and weigh about 98 pounds) so if you are "average" it might be fine.
