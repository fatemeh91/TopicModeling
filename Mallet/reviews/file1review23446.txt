review/text: I was at a local uniform shop today buying scrubs when I saw this stethoscope. As a guy, I'm not too interested in the heart shape of the head, but I always wanted to try an acrylic-head scope (like Ultrascopes) since they are supposedly very sensitive.I tried out this Prestige, and was pretty impressed: the soft ear tips were comfortable and blocked out noises well. The whole thing wasn't any heavier than an average stainless steel head scope, and the sound was really great! Even while wearing a sweatshirt, I could go over all five points of the precordium and distinctly hear everything I had to hear. I could hear breathe sounds quite well, too! I know this scope comes in a clear, round head and a smiley face head - these may be a bit more masculine :)One point I thought was interesting and that I would share: There actually IS a diaphragm and a non-chill ring on the head of this scope - you cannot see it in the pics. I always assumed it was entirely acrylic - nope!I was really impressed with this scope, especially for the price. If I didn't already have so many scopes floating around, I could honestly see using one of these.
