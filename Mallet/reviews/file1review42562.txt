review/text: Really only 3 factors I use for judging whey powders:1. Price = very good2. Taste= just okay (the mocha flavor tastes a little.... off)3. Mixability = good (I use the shake-by-hand method with milk, and it mixes well after about 1 min of shaking, no graininess and minimal clump-age)Overall, certainly worth the price. I might suggest trying a flavor other than mocha, but I can't really vouch for the others.
