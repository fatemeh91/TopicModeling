review/text: This cleaner had great reviews and I too thought the same initially. However after a month or so of use, My contacts started developing some deposits and at one point it was one big blob which this cleaner along with the soapy solution wasn't getting off. I tried my old boston advance cleaner and viola! it was clean the next day. So I still use it but clean with boston once a week till I run out and then I might just buy the Boston cleaner in future.
