review/text: Im glad I didnt let all these bad reviews of this product keep me from buying it. I think its fantastic. At first glance the whole idea of a vibrating flosser may seem a little over the top and silly but guess what, it works. I can totally feel it cleaning out all the nasty grime inbetween my teeth. Its easy to use, its extremely effective, I gotta give it what it deserves. 5 stars
