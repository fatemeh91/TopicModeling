review/text: I like it very much. There is only ONE thing I do not like about it. I do not like the odor of a pill that comes right out of the package. I though these were supposed to release the odor only after reaching the stomach where the &#34;enteric&#34; coaing was dissolved. Many times I find it hard to keep from wretching due to the strong odor when swallowing a pill
