review/text: Very convenient and solid feel. Major detraction is that the lead is not continuously retained securely. Pressing on the lead holder without the lead extended usually restores proper operation, but often must be repeated. Cross wants $10 plus insured shipping to them in order to examine and repair. They would not consider simply sending a replacement pencil element. Too bad because this is a good writing instrument.
