review/text: Like many others I'm not too big on the taste of this stuff, and it does work like magic. So... what I've found works nicely is I mix a full bottle of RL Extreme in a full (1 quart) bottle of Powerade or Gatorade. I sip on it throughout the day and instead of getting a rush I just keep a nice consistent level of energy. Plus the funky taste of the Redline actually tastes pretty good in most flavors of Powerade.
