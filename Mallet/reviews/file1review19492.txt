review/text: Excellent potty seat. LOVE that it's adjustable and solid. It does not slide around like other seats and is contoured just right for little tushies. I bought 2 other cheaper seats but neither fit our toilet seat very well and were uncomfortable for my son. I wish I would have spent a little more and bought this one first! Highly recommend!
