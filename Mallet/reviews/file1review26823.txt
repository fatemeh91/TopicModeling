review/text: Based on the reviews, this seems to be a popular product. I bought it and tried it out. First thing I noticed is that it's very sweet. Much sweeter than other protein powders I've used. My mistake for not noticing earlier but the ingredients list includes Sucralose, which has been linked to migraines, liver disease and tumors. It's also just REALLY sweet so a little goes a long way.Unfortunately the seller does not accept returns so I'm stuck with a 5 pound can of unusable product.
