review/text: Hi,I am writing this review because I recently started taking Dexatrim Natural to suppress my appetite (mainly at night) and it is working wonders for me. I'm a good 65 lbs overweight and I've tried EVERYTHING (including willpower) to diet. The fact is, if I crave the food, and it's there, I'll eat it. If it's not there, I'll go buy it. Once I came to terms with the fact that I was powerless against my cravings I decided to look for a natural herbal appetite suppressant/metabolic booster. I found Dexatrim Natural, did some research, decided it was safe (no Ephedra) and tried it.I've always known that 95% of my problem is the fact that I consume about 1000-1500 or more calories almsot every night before I go to bed (AFTER SUPPER). I couldn't stop no matter what I did. It just seemed impossible and I kept putting on the weight. So I decided to target my appetite suppression to night time. I take 2 pills an hour or so before supper, and when I eat supper I only have enough appetite for a light meal. Then I have ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST in food after supper. I go to bed without a thought of food or guilt about overeating.This stuff works WITHOUT the Ephedra. You hear many people saying &quot;If it doesn't have Ephedra it doesn't work as well&quot;. Good luck convincing me. I've already lost 6 lbs in 2.5 weeks. When I start exercising the weight will probably drop even faster. I also have more energy.So go natural if you want to suppress your appetite safely and effectively. That Ephedra has been shown to be dangerous for some people, and it's not worth the risk.Just be aware that it has caffeine in it so if you are sensitive to that don't do it. And you might want to cut back your coffee intake to compensate for the extra caffeine.
