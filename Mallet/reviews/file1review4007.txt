review/text: My short, and to the point review: Keep your 3 blade Mach-3 razor unless you shave EVERY DAY. If you let your beard get a little "scruffy", the Gillette Fusion Power razor feels like Velcro catching across your face! There are simply too many points of contact along your face with this razor. It is a very nice, well constructed product, but five blades are just not reasonable in my opinion.
