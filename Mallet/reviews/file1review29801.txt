review/text: I have only had the unit for a few days and already have a problem with the "aroma" part of it. The pads that came with the unit barely had any scent. Fortunately, I had purchased a couple additional boxes of the menthol/eucalyptus, and they work great. I'll add oils to the others (NOT THEIRS lol) and place them near the litter boxes so I can get some use out of them....
