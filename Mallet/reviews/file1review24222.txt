review/text: For less than $3 you won't find a better deal; plus it's handy and will be helpful on my rotations in the hospital next year as a med student. My only complaint would be that I wish it had letters instead of numbers but I knew that before I bought it so as long as you're aware of that, I think you'll love it. Make sure you don't spend more than $3 because some sellers definitely charge more
