review/text: The person who said this in not the "right" kind of B12 was wrong.From the label: Vitamin B12 as Cyanocobalamin, as Methylcobalamin (Co-enzyme form)and asDibencozide (Co-enzyme form). A total of 5000 mcg of B12 per teaspoon.It also has Vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, and Folic Acid.It's very easy to hold under your tongue for 30 seconds, and doesn't taste bad when you swallow it (a little bit of a medicine taste, but very mild). I just take a drink of juice, or something else, after I swallow it.I am not an expert, but after reading about B12 in many places, it seems that all forms have some advantages. From what I've read, the liquid under the tongue is the best way for your body to absorb it.
