review/text: My scalp has been flaky & itchy for the past year, i've tried everything to help soothe it but hadn't considered a fungus shampoo until just recently, so a couple nights back just before I shampooed my hair I applied a small-medium sized amount of this soap into my hair & rubbed it about, then I proceeded to shampoo my hair like normal.And I gotta say this really made a difference, the following morning when I woke up not only was I COMPLETELY free of an itchy scalp but my hair looked extremly healthy.It's been a couple nights since (I wash my hair once every 3-4 days) & overall my hair STILL maintains that healthy look about itself and my scalp, while it has gotten partially itchy again (probably because of my being exposed to the sun yesterday) is nowhere near as bad as before!I'm definitely gonna try this soap out again tomorrow night!
