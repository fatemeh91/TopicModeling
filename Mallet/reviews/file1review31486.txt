review/text: This, and the .5 (for day hikes) are the only kits I carry now; I leave a larger kit in the vehicle. I haven't found a more useful and lightweight kit out there. Nothing but the essentials, with room for a few personal meds.I think this and the .5 are the best buys for the money -- the .7 isn't enough more or less.If you are serious about weight, and confident in your abilities to manage a situation with a "limited" amount of gear, this is the kit for you.
