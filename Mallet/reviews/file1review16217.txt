review/text: I got 99 condoms (one missing is no big deal); but, they were all Durex, is alright thought, the Durex came in good Variety, and for 20 or so bucks is still a good deal.Condoms I got (all Durex)......"Extra Sensitive" 25 Condoms"Intense sensation" 24 Condoms"Maximum Love" 26 Condoms"Performax" 24 CondomsThe condoms are no wear near expiration date (Earliest expiration dated is "2013- 06".)It came VERY discreetly to my mailbox and fast too.I didn't give a full 5 because I WAS promised other brands beside just Durex, and that one missing condom is just human error w/e.
