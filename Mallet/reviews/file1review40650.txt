review/text: I have a potty training two year old, mischevious one year old and a puppy. We really put cleaners to the test, and this one rocks! It cleans great and I love that I don't have to worry about it being near the kids or dog. More than that though, it makes everything smell clean and fresh. I've been using it to spot clean my carpets. Not only do they look clean, the pee smell is completely gone! My only warning would be that it is pretty fragrant. If you're smell sensitive, you might want to avoid it. It doesn't smell bad, it smells like parsley. But the smell is pretty strong.
