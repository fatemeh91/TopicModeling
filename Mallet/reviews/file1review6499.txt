review/text: I hesitated to buy one of these for a long time, even though I have a number of muscle knots and trigger points that bother me. I kept telling myself, why not just use a pen, or similar object -- how could this device really be all that different and better than something I had sitting around the house?I finally broke down and bought it. The thing I want to point out about this miraculous device is that the handling of it is the magic. Not just the shape, but also the placement of the knobs, makes it extremely easy to manipulate this tool in ways that aren't putting additional strain on you while you try to work out muscle knots. The balance point and weight also add to the genius of this design.It is extremely adaptable. There are two knob shapes, round and more pointed, and each really does give a different effect.I would say this device is safe to use unless you are a person who lacks body awareness. Some people do, it's nothing to be ashamed of; it likely just means you were never involved in any sports or the like. But if that is the case, and you should be honest with yourself, then you shouldn't use devices like this, because you could possibly hurt yourself. Of course, you want to be sure to never apply this to a joint or bone, the spine, etc. I was always advised by masseuses and health practitioners that it's usually best to start with the feet (tense feet disrupt your ability to relax other body areas), and always manipulate such devices toward the heart (i.e., if you are doing your arms, start at the lower parts and work your way up toward the shoulder, rather than the other way).
