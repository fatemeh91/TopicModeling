review/text: These blades are counterfeit! I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens. It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off, versus 9 shaves with the same blade from Walgreens. Shaves were all in the shower at the same time of day with the same shaving cream. They are just plain fakes. I tried this test with 4 of these blades, and the same result happened every time. They are just plain fake!
