review/text: I have plantar fascitis and was hoping to be able to mold this to fit high arches. I still haven't figured out how to do that- I tried boiling and bending them but it didn't seem to want to bend. When I have them in my shoes, I can feel they are there, but when my weight is on them, they just seem to flatten out since there's no actual material keeping the arch there (just hard plastic bend upwards). They are better than nothing, but not as good as orthotics from the walking company or doctor.
