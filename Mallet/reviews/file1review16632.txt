review/text: My girlfriend and I ordered these as cheap Christmas presents and had them engraved at our local shop. Everyone loves a Zippo with their &#34;call name&#34; on it! Do the same and watch your buddies faces light up. Even the guys that don't smoke loved getting something with their nickname on it!
