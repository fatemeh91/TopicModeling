review/text: This grab bar is heavy and secure. We put it up opposte the toilet so that when my mother gets up from the toilet (She is in late stage Alzheimer's Disease and her balance is not that good any more), she has something to hold onto that is heavy and prevents falls. She used to hold on to the towel bar but that was not so heavy or secure and would come loose. Mother fell a few times. Now, however, we use the grab bar and it is great!
