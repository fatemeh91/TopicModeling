review/text: My 2 1/2 year old son had a very runny nose, slight fever and overall miserable. Last night after his bath I rubbed some on his chest, back and on his feet. Within a half hour his nose wasn't running anymore and this morning he woke up a different little man. He looks about 90% better from his cold and I'm one happy camper. Thank you!
