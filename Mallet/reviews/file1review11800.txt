review/text: I've used a few kinds of why protein over the years, but this one is definitely my favorite, mainly because of the taste. Whey protein like this is basically the same thing no matter what brand name, and the main thing that differentiates it (in my opinion) is the taste. Coupled with plenty of hard work at the gym and a multi-vitamin, it'll help you build muscle.I've forced myself to choke down some pretty nasty whey protein in the past, but with Champion Nutrition Pure Whey Protein Stack - Chocolate, I actually look forward to having my protein shake after I'm done lifting.I would recommend mixing with skim milk, but water isn't terrible either.
