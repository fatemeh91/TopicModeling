review/text: I am a practicing dental hygienist ( for the past 9 years ). One of my patients asked my oppinion on ionic toothbrush, so i decided to try it. I red all reviews, it sounded good enough, so i purchased it. It sucks. What a waist of $25. It doesn't do anything. Even a manual toothbrush does a better job. If you want great results, use Oral-B or Sonicare. Yes it is more money, but so worth it.
