review/text: As they recommend, take one at the first symptoms of cold and then another one - after 6 hours. It does work - even if you get sick, it only lasts a day while the others in the office sneeze and cough for a week. Price seems a little steep at first, but prospective changes once you realize that you don't have to spend money on cold medicine and you don't feel as beat up.
