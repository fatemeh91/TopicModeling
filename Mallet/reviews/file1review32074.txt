review/text: I purchased a six-pack from amazon, and used one on brand new Billabong board shorts within minutes of lightly dropping a dab of pizza filling. My initial test of the tide-to-go stick worked alright... within several hours, I looked again and noticed that some color had faded out where the tide was applied! I read the stick precautions and saw no warnings with regards to color loss. Always test on a hidden location beforehand and all of that, but I am extremely disappointed. What is in this thing, bleach? No warnings on the stick to speak of!I am never buying another Tide product.
