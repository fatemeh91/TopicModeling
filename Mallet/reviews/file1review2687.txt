review/text: oh the gauntlet of lubes can be overwhelming but in my searches i have found what i consider to be the best. pjur woman.this is not a thick, goopy, heavy feeling lube. this is light and sweet jesus, it is so smooth and sexy. (concentrate on the review karrie...)there is no odd heating or cooling, nor is there any irritating fragrance added. just gorgeous slip and slide. i have also found that it leaves the skin of my lady bits soft and smooth.the only improvement i would suggest is a more convienent cap. the one on the bottle is a screw-off cap. a pop-top would be better, IMO. hands get slippery...
