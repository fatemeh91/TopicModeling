review/text: I purchased Nature's Way DIM Plus from a local vitamin shop. I paid a lot more than the current price listed on Amazon. So, it seems to be much cheaper online.A good friend of mine started taking this after having it recommended by a nutritionist. She experienced hormonal headaches and needed to find something to help. I also get these headaches along with long periods and bad cramps. We are both in our mid-40s.My friend had great success. Her headaches went away and her period now only lasts a few days. I was encouraged so I started taking DIM a few days ago. I took a 100mg tablet after lunch and another after dinner. A total of 200mg. My results - worsening cramps and prolonged headaches. I also seem very grouchy - just ask my husband. DIM seems to have made things worse. Or is this just my imagination? Yes I've only taken this for three days...it's difficult to bring myself to take more when it appears to me making things worse.I assume I am prei-menopausal even though I have not had this confirmed by a doctor. Two of my older sisters were done with their periods at the age of 50. I am 46.So... have any of you experienced an increase in symptoms after taking DIM? Is there a period of adjustment I need to get past?
