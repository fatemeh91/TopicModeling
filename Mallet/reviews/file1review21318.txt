review/text: The dental hygienist commented that my teeth looked cleaner with less plaque than before and asked if I was using an electric toothbrush. I said yes and she told me to keep using it. Local convenience stores were selling replacement heads for $25, but Amazon sold them for a lot less. The shipment arrived quickly too.
