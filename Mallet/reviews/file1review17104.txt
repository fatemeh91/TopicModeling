review/text: I have had a beard for several decades and have been through several beard trimmers in that time. This one gets the job done, but it seems to do it a little better than the other razors I've had. I can't pin it down as to how it's better, but I do know that the lower price was a nice difference. I even bought a second one for a friend of mine who asked me what's the best way to keep a beard under control. He is satisfied with the Remington too. One tip: remember when you have taken the cap off for close trims. I forgot I did that one day and had a big surprise when I went to trim back my sideburns and suddenly there was nothing there. That was the first, and hopefully the last time I have a goatee. Yes the Remington can trim real close too.
