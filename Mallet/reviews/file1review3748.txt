review/text: Disclaimer: I'm not a health professional.I have tried everything, from the highest fiber cereals to high fiber supplements, etc. Nothing worked on me, and my stomach was always bloated from lack of elimination. This product is the only thing that works for me. I take 1 pill per day, and it has solved my elimination problems. No pain, no gas, no negative side effects. I hope this company never goes out of business!By the way, I don't work for this company. This is an honest review from someone relieved to be relieved from a lifetime of constipation.
