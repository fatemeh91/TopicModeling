review/text: I recently purchased Jarrow's xylitol because I was out of my usual brand and the only place I could find any xylitol was in Whole Foods. Apparently Whole Foods only stocks Jarrow. Anyhow, I recently purchased Jarrow's xylitol and, to quote Julia Roberts to the nasty saleslady in Pretty Woman, "Big mistake. Huge."This product has the fine, powdery consistency of baking soda and seems just as inclined towards clumping, even with the addition of a chemical anti-clumping agent. I'm not sure whether it's this fineness or this chemical additive (silicon dioxide), but when I put a little spoonful into my mouth, instead of dissolving evenly into a sweet, clear liquid, it turned into a thick glop. It also has a weird aftertaste that I've never noticed in other xylitol brands. Those of you raving about this stuff ought to sample a few other brands first.
