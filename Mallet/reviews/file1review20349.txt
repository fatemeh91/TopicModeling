review/text: I bought this as a replacement for a previously lost microfiber cleaning cloth, and while I preferred the finished edge on my old cloth, this one cleans a far sight better. It also comes with its own little carry case so it doesn't get lost/dirty in the jumble of your pocket or purse. If I lose this one, or something happens to it, I will definitely buy this again.
