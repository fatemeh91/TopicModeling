review/text: Doesn't fit all tile surfaces as depends upon tile size and distance between tiles. Heads are large for small tile size and if you get head to fit on one tile the second head lands on grout surface and it can't attach. Cost to return was $20 UPS - for a $30 product - I donated it to an elder facility rather than waste any more money. Product description should be very specific re: how to measure for this rail before purchase.
