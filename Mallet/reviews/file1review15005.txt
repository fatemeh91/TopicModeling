review/text: I'm a vegetarian and I needed a multivitamin. After weeks of taking this I noticed my dark eye circles disappear and my skin get a healthy glow. My nails did grow but they were extremely brittle and I ended up having to cut them off. My hair is pretty much the same.This product does indeed stink. It seems to be getting progressively worse as the weeks go by. I throw them one at a time in the back of my mouth to avoid the horrible taste. Overall it's good for my health and skin, but nothing much else.
