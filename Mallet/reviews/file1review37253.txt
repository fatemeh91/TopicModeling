review/text: These arrived today and I put them on immediately and am feeling pain relief for both of my extremely painful hands. These gloves work better than narcotic pain meds for me. I am typing this review while wearing the gloves. Also the gentle heat they produce is simply wonderful. I wish there were products for other parts of my body such as my neck, shoulders and back.
