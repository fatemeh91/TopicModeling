review/text: I used one of these on a baby goat that had broken its leg.Splinted it to get it to the vet. Vet X-rayed the leg and said the break was simple enough - just leave this splint on and change bandage as needed.So, it also was good enough to use as a cast - in this instance. I would not recommend it without medical approval. Just mentioned to demonstrate the quality of the product.
