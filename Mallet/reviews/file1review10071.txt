review/text: I purchased the set because I like the smooth flow of Waterman ball point pens and the style (cigar-shaped) fits my hand well. The only things I was concerned about were the brass lining and the 0.5 mm lead for the pencil.The cigar-shape does fit me well and I am quite pleased with that. The concern about the brass lining is still a slight concern. Since I collect vintage pens and pencils, I know that a writing instrument does not need to be heavy to perform well. The old instruments were light because they were used for long sessions of writing and to not tire the hand. In at least the last 20 years or so, manufacturers of quality writing instruments try to equate weight with quality. It doesn't correlate. Think of the Lamy 2000 set. Its a tough, lightweight plastic and typically is listed among the top performing instruments. The 2000 is Bauhaus designed and is close to the cigar shape. The only thing I don't like about the 2000 ball point is the lightness (less contrast) of their ink compared to the Waterman. The 0.5 mm Waterman pencil is better than I expected. The ferrule that hold the lead seems to be such that the lead doesn't always break when I'm writing.All in all, the purchase was good, but the combined pen and pencil can drag down on some shirt pockets. I'd give 3 stars out of 5!
