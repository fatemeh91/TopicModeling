review/text: Well it's supposed to be protein so I wasn't much thinking about how it will taste as long as it doesn't taste or smell gross. But now that I think of it, I think I would surely not give a name as Double Rich Chocolate. No it isn't like chocolate nectar so no. But hey its a great deal for a whey protein, not so expensive and surely drinkable, I've been having it 5 times a day for 2 months and I ain't complaining. Although it's either this or casein(which I take at night) that some times gives me gas!
