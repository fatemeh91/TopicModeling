review/text: I "splurged" and bought this potty seat for my 4 year old son. I love the fact that it is plastic, and easy to clean. It adjusts well to the toilet seat, and it stays stationary. The splash guard keeps things where they need to be. :) The prior potty seat we had had a foam seat that eventually cracked, was difficult to clean, and it did not keep things where they need to be. I so wish I just bought this one the first time around!
