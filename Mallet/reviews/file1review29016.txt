review/text: I been using this type of razor for 6 years, but needs replacing every 2 years because the razor gets dull. It is cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the blade inside. Overall, it is just ok. It does not shave as easily as I hoped and it misses longer hairs and small fine ones, so you got to shave the same area over and over again. I would not recommend spending over 60 bucks for this German-brand made in China shaver...and do not bother buying the newer model called Cruzr 5 - it is a piece of junk!
