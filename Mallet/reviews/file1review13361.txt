review/text: I purchased this for use after total knee replacement surgery. This was great for keeping the moisture from the ice packs from getting on my sheets and mattress. This product is nice and large and takes up most of one side of the bed. I used this for several weeks and found it laundered and dried without problems. I had planned for the price point to just toss it when I no longer needed it but it was still like new so I put it away with my linens in case I ever need it again.
