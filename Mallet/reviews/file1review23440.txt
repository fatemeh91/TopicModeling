review/text: I actually bought this as a gift for my wife, & she loved the sentiment, but not as much as she loves her stethoscope.First & foremost it works really well in a general purpose/nursing environment. I have played with it a little and it would work well for a woman in an EMS situation also, especially with peds. It has great sound & clarity. She (and everyone that borrows it) love the soft feel ear pieces even more than the fun shape.And secondly, she gets lots of compliments on it, and everyone is asking where she got it.I actually worked with a nurse that had the Breast cancer pink ribbon version and she told me where to find it. But when I saw the blue heart I knew which one my wife would rather have. Anyway, the point was that my nurse friend loves the large head because it balances perfectly when it is wrapped around her neck.The only negative anyone has had with it is that does not fit well under the edge of a BP cuff, but that is easily remedied by moving the cuff up a little.
