review/text: I was looking at a survival kit for hikes, mainly to appease paranoia about being lost in the woods and all that it entails. If you look up kits on the internet, there's literally a million ways and thoughts on how to approach it.I have other items from Adventure Medical Kits, and found them to be top notch. The advantage is that with this Pocket Survival Kit, a lot of the effort for searching for the smaller pieces has been taken care of, but it doesn't include everything you might need. This kit is a good foundation to build on.The problem is that in my zealousness, I opened the bag and took things out to inspect it, and have a difficult time putting it back in. If I wanted to add anything to the bag like a small knife or water purification tablets, I'm pretty much out of luck. You might want to consider getting aAloksak Waterproof Bagsto put things in once you've got your kit built.It's a great kit, and I'm glad I bought it even if it just sits in my backpack, never to be used. But at the same time, what makes this truly valuable is that you know what each item does and how to use it properly in the event that your life depends on it.
