review/text: These spoons are wonderful!! I need to send a spoon in my kids' lunches every day. These are sturdy with a big spoon bowl. The are about the same size as a regular plastic spoon, but I feel less guilty when the kids throw them away because they will decompose. These were my test, I plan to buy the forks and knives as well!
