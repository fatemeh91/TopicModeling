review/text: Does the product work? Yes - that can be seen in any review here. I would like to bring up the topic of packaging - I will be brief. Is this huge, plastic box really necessary to carry 28 one millimeter thick strips? In a time when conservation is a buzz word and petroleum products should be kept to a minimum for a variety of reasons, Crest decides to package a tiny product in a small boat. Seriously, this is a huge waste. Not to mention, the cost would most definitely drop if a more practical box were implemented for future customers. In short, I would like to see a more environmentally and financially responsible company helping me achieve my shallow need for whiter teeth.
