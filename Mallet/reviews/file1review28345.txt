review/text: Ive had tons of those pre made protein shakes etc and they always taste like S***!! So I was so of skeptical to spend the money on this and it taste disgusting. I ordered the double chocolate one. And Right when you open it it smells like chocolate so I was like ok Ill try it. I make mine in a shaker bottle. Put in 1 scoop and fill the shaker cup up half way and shake and drink. It tastes like cold hot chocolate. I was so surprised. It makes drinking 2-3 protein shakes a day a nice treat. Cant wait to try the other flavors.
