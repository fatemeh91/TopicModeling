review/text: I don't care how disciplined you are, if you don't like the TASTE of your whey product, you're probably not going to stick with it. This stuff I can stick with. It's obviously a good product too, but the taste is what really makes me look forward to the next shake. Haven't found one better yet! Oh, and it's also cheaper than many others. So guess what....5 stars. Duh.
