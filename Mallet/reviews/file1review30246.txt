review/text: This product supercedes a previous model that I had for about 10 years- I bought it because the numerous attachments from the previous model fit this model.This vacuum cleaner has 1) Lots of power, 2) is easy to use, 3) and is easy to maintain & empty.Be aware that it is NOT cordless and does not come with numerous attachments. I use it primarily for clean-up after working on various projects, hobbies and cars.
