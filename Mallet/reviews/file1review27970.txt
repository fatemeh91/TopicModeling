review/text: I ordered the Cookies n Cream flavor. It doesnt really taste like cookies n cream, more like a coffee flavor still tastes great though. Mixes very easily in a shaker bottle or even in a cup with a spoon. Anyway I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality whey that wont break your bank.
