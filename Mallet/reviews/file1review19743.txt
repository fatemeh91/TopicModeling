review/text: I was somewhat skeptical of potty seats as the ones we've owned slide all over the place.This seat is super comfy, no pinching, no crevices for the pee to get into, 1 piece molded plastic, easy wipedown if needed. Super easy to adjust and it FITS tightly to the seat, no sliding at all. Comes off with one hand, my son can do it. Seat has large enough hole that things are comfy for my little guy. We also own the Bjorn potty chair and it's just as great. Both have alot bigger opening than most potty seats and chairs, so they work well for older kids too.
