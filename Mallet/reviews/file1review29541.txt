review/text: I drink a lot of mate and have multiple bombillas. This is a sturdy straw that works well but the only downside is that the filter doesn't separate, making it harder to clean. I would recommend a bombilla that screws apart at the bottom for easier access to the little leaves that may get stuck in there.
