review/text: Hands down, this is the best chapstick I have ever used. When Whole Foods runs out, I go on missions to find it. After letting my friends use it, they too trek the metro area in search of this wonderful, beautiful, essential stick. It's good to know that Amazon is here to help. You really don't have to apply it often, and I live in dry dry Denver. It has sunflower oil and shea, which are natural sunscreens, and it smells delicious. I've had men come to me to ask me what I'm wearing that smells so good : ). It is such a good healer that I use it on my daughter's scrapes, and on my cuticles sometimes too. LOVE IT! I just wish this company would make it more accessible.
