review/text: I ordered this product with high hopes, but after using a whole bottle I am still not sure about it. The ingredients on the website are described as "high quality oxygen based", but after really reading through them, the ingredients seem very similar to a regular magnesium-based laxative. The directions say to take a large number of pills over the course of several days, and it'll definitely make you go to the bathroom - but it has the same effect as a regular ole' laxative, in that it causes your bowels to just retain a bunch of water so that the next day you go to the bathroom a bunch but it's extremely watery.I have IBS/C and took Zelnorm, which WAS a miracle drug...unfortunately it was taken off the market due to health concerns. I decided to try out this product to prevent/reduce bloating - but when I take it at night, the next morning I am SO BLOATED until I go to the bathroom like 5 times. If I only go to the bathroom once, I'm still totally bloated - I guess from all of the water that has been sucked into my bowels as a result of taking the pills. I have found however, that taking 4 pills at night will make it easier to go to the bathroom the next day without all of the water.All in all, I'd say take this stuff if you need a laxative - but it is not the "miracle pill" that it claims to be. I was pretty disappointed.
