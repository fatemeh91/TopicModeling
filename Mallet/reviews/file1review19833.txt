review/text: BabyBjorn has done it again. We have this potty seat, as well as the little Bjorn potty chair and step stool and we love all three products.The potty seat is comfortable and easy to put on and take off. It looks sleek, unlike those unsightly, bright "character" potty seats. As a result, I'm more willing to keep this seat on the potty all the time, which in turn helps my son get on the toilet faster, which in turn means fewer accidents!At first I was hesitant to spend $30 on a potty seat, but now I see this product is worth the money.
