review/text: I've been taking these supplements for the past five years at the recommendation of a naturopath after I was losing weight and not being able to digest any amount of fat, and not much carbs, proteins or dairy either. After five days on this, essential enzymes, and cutting out gluten, I gained 5 much needed pounds in a week. I take these supplements with every meal, and if I run out or forget, my stomach pays the price with severe indigestion. My mom tried the supplements too, for similar issues, but they don't work for her. Definitely worth trying out to see if they work for you like they have for me.
