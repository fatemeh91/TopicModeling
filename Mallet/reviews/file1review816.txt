review/text: The kit arrived and it does indeed have pretty much every little piece you might need. There was some jumbling of the contents and the little screws had escaped from their separate boxes, so things were mixed up. The tiny screwdriver tool worked, I was able to repair a pair of reading glasses and so 4 stars. The price is OK too.
