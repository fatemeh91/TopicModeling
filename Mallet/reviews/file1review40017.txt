review/text: Well, as far as toothbrushes go, this is a pretty good one. I like the angle of the brush and like that fact that the end bristles were longer. They got to my back teeth nicely. The brush itself was slightly curved so it fit my teeth better, so I felt they brushed better. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the handle was round so it didn't fit into my toothbrush holder. I'd recommend this to other people.
