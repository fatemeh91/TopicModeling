review/text: I bought this unit about 3 weeks ago and within one week the cuff pump doesn't pump up as it should. I checked with the seller (bought it online), she said that she has the same experience once.I called Omron and they said that I can send it in for repair along with $5.00 for return postage. I told them that this is a defective unit (manufacturer's defect), they should not charge customer for return postage.I feel that Omron who shipped the defective product should have the courtesy to paid for their own postage. The fault is with them and not consumers, thus we should NOT have to paid for their mistakes.This is the first and last for me, I do not recommend buying any unit from Omron. There are many other choices, make sure that you do your research and watchout on those rules regarding warranty information.Good luck.Unhappy consumer
