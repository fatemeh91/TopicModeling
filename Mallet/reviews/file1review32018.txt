review/text: I'm new to taking Perfect Food and it gets a little getting used to, however, that said, the stuff doesn't taste bad really, different, yes, but bad, no. I've discovered that when I take it mixed with lime or lemon juice it helps with the ease of drinking it. It is full of wonderful stuff that I wouldn't be getting any other way. I recommend this to anyone trying to get more greens in their diet.
