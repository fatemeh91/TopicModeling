review/text: I've owned roughly 5 trimmer before this and let me just say , this one takes the cake , and the chicken and the soda. Cool looking design , fits your hand perfectly , not very loud yet powerful. Comes with a cool styling comb and cleaning brush , VERY easy to use and I just took it out of the case and been using it for a month now and I have not needed to charge it yet. Definitely deserves the many 5 stars it has been awarded.
