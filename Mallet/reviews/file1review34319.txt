review/text: This stand does not stay in position. It is very cheap and not worth the money I paid. The part that is suppose to hold the hair dryer is very weak.The stand itself falls over at the slightest touch. The pole does not stay in the long position and is very hard to adjust. Please don't waste your money. Wish I would have read the reviews before buying.
