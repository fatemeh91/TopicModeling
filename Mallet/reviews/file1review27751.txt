review/text: This is the second time I purchase ON whey, the first time I bought the double rich chocolate. It was very rich and sweet, too sweet at times. Then I bought the cheap stuff at Costco which said was the same as Cytosport Muscle Milk and the taste just wasn't good at all. So this time I went with ON Coffee flavor. Reading the reviews here, people said its very good, some said it taste like coffee ice cream and some said its like Starbucks Frappuchino. I tried it just now and I absolutely love it. Its very tasty, not as sweet as the double rich chocolate and definitely not like Starbucks Frappuchino which I find too sugary. I would say its like a low fat coffee ice cream flavor. Being a coffee lover, this is absolutely perfect. I usually drink whey after workout, but it looks like I will drink it more often even on non-workout days since it can satisfy my afternoon coffee craving! Definitely recommend this to others needing to buy whey and for coffee lovers too since it is much more heavy than Starbucks cold coffee drinks!!! Good source of protein and use 1% or low fat milk.
