review/text: Our daughter was seven when we bought the product, dri sleeper. She had been wearing pull-ups for years and was getting very frustrated with them. We told her about the alarm system and she was very excited to try it out. Within three weeks she was pull-up free and has been ever since. We would recommend this product to anyone with an older child trying to overcome bed-wetting.
