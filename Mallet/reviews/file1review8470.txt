review/text: This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1" or 1.5", I'm not sure). I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase. I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed. I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush, whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape). I really prefer this one, it cleans so well, stays clean, and seems indestructible!
