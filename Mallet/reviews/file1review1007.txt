review/text: I was literally pumping only 2 to 5cc (32cc make an ounce) for my newborn who was almost 5 days old when my lactation consultant told me to try this. Within days I noticed I was consistently pumping an ounce then gradually more, by day 10 I was barely supplmenting with formula. This stuff is like a miracle worker. Be sure to not drink anything before and after wards for at least 20 minutes. This makes the product more effect.Yes it taste pretty bad but order the alchol free and no problems. It's so worth it, it's for your baby. They deserve the best and our breastmilk is what's best for them.
