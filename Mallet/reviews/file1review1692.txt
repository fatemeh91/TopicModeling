review/text: This is my first review evever but after having problems with Athletes Foot and Heel cracks for almost thirty years this stuff has cured it in less then 4 weeks. My feet are looking better then ever and now I am actually realizing that it removes the callus built up as well. I have used this in conjunction with a tea tree oil that I massage directly to my feet when in the tub maybe once or twice a week. The only negative I realize is that my feet are smelling and sweating a little now which they have never before. But this is a small sacrifice now that I am able to walk on them without the pain and bleeding.I am reordering now. Get the soap, it works.
