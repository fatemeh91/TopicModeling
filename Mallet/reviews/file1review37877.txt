review/text: If you are like me and have a kid working on his molars, you are desperate to have anything that resembles Hyland's Teething tablets. I remember those good old days of Hyland's! Well, this product was not a good replacement for us.To begin with, you actually have to dissolve the little suckers and rub this liquid directly on the gums of your screaming infant. My child is not very cooperative when he is in his teething mode. It was virtually impossible to get this stuff rubbed onto his gums. And when I do, eh...this, too, shall pass, right???I've taken to adding the pellets to a nice warm bottle of milk, but this is not the intended use, so I don't think it is really working. It's more of a panacea for me, I think.I will keep looking. I am sooooooooooooo regretful that I did not hoard Hyland's when the recall thing started up. I understand people want to protect their children, but really, how much damage could they have done? And such an effective product, too...
