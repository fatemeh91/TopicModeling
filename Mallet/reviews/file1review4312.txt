review/text: These are the read deal Gillette Fusion blades and they provide an excellent shave. Some reviewers (old reviews I think) have said that these blades were knockoffs but that is not true. Great price on great blades and the eco-box shipping works just fine holding the extra blade cartridges until you need to swap in a fresh blade.TIP: I found that storing my razor vertically with the blades down has been a tremendous help in extending the life of my blades. They don't get rusty like they can if you lie it horizontally or vertically with the blades up. Try it and see!
