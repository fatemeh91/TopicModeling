review/text: 2 Stars is generous but I gave it 3. Pros: Looks nice, is comfortable in the hand, battery life is good, never pinches and is relatively quiet. Con's :(the reasons you want a nose trimmer are not solved. It misses many nose and ear hairs as they do not seem to be directed into the slots easily and takes much time since it misses so many and doesn't cut them short enough (it is why there is no pinch). You can hear it working as it slows the blades, but you look and still see the ones missed. Frustrating! Seems like there has got to be an efficient model that is powered. I may end up with the well rated manual model. I feel it is not worth the money and there is a good chance of disappointment.
