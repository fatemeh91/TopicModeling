review/text: I bought this for my son and read the reviews about the splash guard not extending down far enough. I decided to take a chance and found out that it does indeed lead to spills onto the actual toilet seat and under the toilet trainer seat too. It's not that big of a deal to me because it's not like it's going all over the floor. I just do a quick wipe of both seats after my son is done. It takes two seconds and I do this so I don't get a smelly bathroom. When my sitter and husband watch my son, they don't do any cleaning up of the seats and I have yet to notice the bathroom smelling. We have an oblong seat and it fits perfect. We don't even use the adjust dials and it stays in place. I gave it four stars because I really like it even though the splash guard does not extend further down.
