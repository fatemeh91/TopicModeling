review/text: The 8825XL is the least expensive model in Norelcos top of the line Spectra series. Its still very expensive but the shave is about as good as an electric gets. Quality of construction is unsurpassed. Cleaning it is a piece of cake. Just flip the cover and rinse under a tap. Older, non washable razors were a pain to clean. The built in trimmer is about average for an electric which means that its not very effective. Most important is not so much how close a shave it gives ( most electrics shave close for the most part) but does it get ALL THE HAIRS? Shaving the neck and below the jaw is the real test for an electric. The Spectra shines in these areas as do rotary razors in general ( an inherent weakness of the foil razor designs such as Braun and Panasonic).The only trouble with rotaries is that they can be irritating to SOME people. The Spectra addresses this with a sensitivity adjustment wheel which sets the stiffness of the floating heads. Most sensitive = least stiff, which means that less pressure is needed when shaving which will greatly decrease the chance of irritation. Because of this feature, those who have had irritation trouble with rotaries in the past and are not satisfied with the lousy neck shave of foil razors , should definately check the Spectra out.A great razor overall but is it worth it over the cheaper Norelco models? The shave is slightly closer, more comfortable and the washable feature is a great time saver so YES I will say it is worth it.
