review/text: 24 Grams of Protein in about 60 seconds flat. It doesn't get any easier than this. This is THE best-tasting protein whey I have tried. It tastes just like chocolate milk, only thicker. The powder mixes easily in my shaker bottle, even without the wire-whisk ball. I've noticed that some other protein shakes are gritty in texture, but the Optimum Nutrition stuff is smooth, with no hint of grit. I've tried it with water, 2% milk and Silk. The best flavor/consistency can be found by mixing one scoop with 7 ounces of Silk...excellent stuff!!However, it should be noted that the "5-lb" container is not 5.15 lbs (77 servings) shown on Amazon or Lindberg. It's 5 lbs flat, which will net 74 servings. I opted for Double Rich Chocolate, so maybe there's a discrepancy that's dependent on flavoring.
