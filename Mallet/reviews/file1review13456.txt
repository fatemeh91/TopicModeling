review/text: I've been using these for years because I love them. They make for a great shave. It's too bad that it's getting harder and harder to find them. I know that Gillette, et al., try to convince us that we need more and more blades to get the job done, which is fine.... I'm not convinced. I'll stick with the product as long as I can.
