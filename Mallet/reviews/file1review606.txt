review/text: I am a woman with Multiple Sclerosis who is ambulatory but has difficulty at times after steroid treatments, in the heat and with general stamina. I purchased this walker because I loved the fact that there was no assembly and it had a "cool" look to it. It definitely looked different from most.This thing is the SUV of walkers. It's not feather light but it certainly is sturdy. There is no assembly required and you simply pull it out of it's large box and go. One push of a lever and the rollator collapses (folds) vertically so that it can fit easily in a trunk or back seat. The wheels are large and smooth and this thing actually handles curbs and grass and changes of terrain easily. It's rough and tough and looks like it can take a beating and handle abuse pretty well.The seating is very comfortable and this rollator adjusts easily (arm height) with simple lever pushes. There are no brake cables or anything to assemble. It's ready to go out of the box and that is one of the reasons I chose it. I also bought this one because it looked a little different (resembles a baby carriage more than a traditional rollator or walker).It drives smoothly, is easy to operate and is extremely comfortable. What more could I ask for?I bought the blue version since I saved about $100 on Amazon compared to the other colors. The blue and silver is very nice. This thing will definitely get a lot of use from me.
