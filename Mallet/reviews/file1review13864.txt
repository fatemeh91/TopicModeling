review/text: I bought these slippers for my mother who has chronic cold feet. The warmth is great, but like the other reviews have said you are unable to walk in them with the heat packs inside. If I'd known this I wouldn't have bought them. If you are sitting around they are very warm and last about an hour. For someone like my mother they are ok except she has to take them off before walking with her walker. I think they would be perfect if somehow they were made with the heat pack on the top and a hard sole on the bottom. I use to have a pair with a heated gel pack on the top and they worked very well, keeping my feet warm for along time even while walking. You might consider this and if you make this change I would be interested in a pair for myself.thank you
