review/text: This stuff will never go out of style. Cool astringent qualities on applcation . . . then a lingering very fresh, very masculine scent(and not at all overwhelming or offensive).Working against this product are the same things that work for it: It has been around forever and it is cheap. Therefore snobs won't touch it.My favorite after shave.By the way -- my present supply is in a plastic container labeled, "New Shatterproof Bottle!". #1. Don't lie to me. The marketers don't care if it's shatterproof or not. They want to improve profit margin. The plastic is ok, but we really don't get excited about it. #2 Whoever designed and then signed off on this horrid bottle should be fired. I suspect in the interest of getting the consumer to use more, the hole in the top of the bottle is too big. It is absolutely impossible to dispense this into your hand without some of the product running down the side of the bottle and leaving a blue stain on your sink (or tabletop!!!) when you set it down. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.
