review/text: Good price, great adjustability, perfect size but will not hold a charge.Every time I take it out of the bathroom drawer to use the battery dies after 3 seconds of being turned on. I then have to charge it before every use which is very inconvenient.It's also louder than a few others trimmers I have owned.
