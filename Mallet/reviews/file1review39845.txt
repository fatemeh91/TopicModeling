review/text: I've owned one of these for years and never had any problems with it. I wouldn't say it's super heavy duty and I don't try to use to pick up very heavy objects, but it's indispensible for getting small items lost behind appliances, sofas, desks... or just trying to reach the odd thing up high. Have not lost any suction cups or has the device failed in anyway. I would recommend.
