review/text: I used this tooth paste and though I usually think that Colgate makse some of the better tasting toothpastes I don't like the taste of this baking soda whitening variety and I think the taste is too bland and tastes like mint gum after you have chewed on it for several minutes and it has lost it's flavor and while I like other Colgate tooth paste varities I won't be using this particular one again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they happen to actually like the flavor of gum when it's lost it's flavor!
