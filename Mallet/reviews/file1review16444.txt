review/text: I bought this product after hearing about it from a few friends and looking online about different powders for razor burn and skin irritation. I wasn't too thrilled with the price and the only size that was available anywhere in my town was the 6 oz. size. I have used basic baby powder for chafing and razor burns and it always seemed to work just fine. However, I wanted something that was medicated to help with a minor skin irritation that had been forming on the top of my elbows and triceps. I must say that this powder is by the far the best I have tried out of all the powders that I have used. It helps with foot irritation, chafing after exercise, skin irritation, and even razor burn. If it's irritated this powder will fix it.The only con I can see about this powder is that it is definitely not unscented. It has a very distinct 'medicine' smell but it is very faint so it doesn't pose too much of a problem.Overall, if you're looking for a good medicated powder that can solve a lot of problems... this is definitely an easy and safe buy!
