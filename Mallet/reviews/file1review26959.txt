review/text: Having tried many different protein shakes and bars, this one is by far the best tasting. It's not dessert or anything, but if you make it with at least half of the liquid as whole milk it's really great for a protein shake. It's not bad made with just water either. With my last pregnancy my OB suggested that I get at least 75g of protein a day (which is quite a bit if you look at nutrition info). I brought in the nutrition label for this product and she approved it as safe for me to have once or twice a day while pregnant. I'd suggest asking your own OB before starting to drink them all the time, but they're the best option in my opinion.
