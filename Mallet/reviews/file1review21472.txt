review/text: This is a genuine Oral-B product, not an aftermarket knock-off. Brush heads fit perfectly on the motorized toothbrush base unit.The blue &#34;tell-tale&#34; bristles seem to lose their color rather quickly (which is supposed to indicate time for a replacement). If you followed this indication, you would be replacing these rather expensive heads way too often.
