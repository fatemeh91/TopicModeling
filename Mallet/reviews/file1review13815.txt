review/text: I ordered this as a gift for someone, but decided not to give it to her because a fine gritty dust sifts out through the wrap (heated or not). This dust gets on any surface you place the wrap on, including yourself. It was also kind of bunched up and too firm/almost crunchy especially in the part that curves in front of you. I have purchased other similar products (Bed Buddy)and was very satisfied--just wanted to try something that would wrap around the neck more. I wonder if all of the Happy Company products are like this one?--ugh!
