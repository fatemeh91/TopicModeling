review/text: I had first bought a cheaper character potty seat to lay over our adult toilets, thinking that seeing the beloved characters would inspire my daughter to sit on the potty when beginning to train. She did sit on it, but it was VERY unstable. It would slide around our toilet, and often "stick" to her when she tried to get up. I always had to be near her to make sure she didn't fall. After reading other parent reviews, we ended up buying this toilet trainer and the babybjorn potty chair, and am very happy with the results. My daughter sat in the potty chair in the beginning and was trained within a week. After about 2 weeks of using the chair, my daughter wanted to sit on the "big" potty like her parents and switched to this trainer without any problems. She's 2 1/2 and on the taller side (38in), and fit both the chair and trainer just fine. The trainer stays put on the toilet when my daughter is getting on and off, but is easily removed when adults need it. It's lightweight and easily transportable (to grandma's, etc.). the high splashguard keeps pee from spraying out and the whole thing is easy to clean. Very happy with the purchase and wish I had just bought this in the beginning instead of wasting money on the cheaper ones.
