review/text: Got this for a friend at our company's Christmas party for a gag gift. He was a little shocked to say the least but the video is priceless and everyone absolutely loved it! I have to admit that I opened the blister packaging (it's easy to reclose for storage btw) and played around with this before wrapping it and the silicone feels great. Seems durable enough and had a bit of suction from the side with the balls.
