review/text: I have very sensitive skin and have been using this cream for almost a year. Never been happier, no irritation at all after shaving, but my skin still feels dry. After shave lotion solves that problem. This is one of the best shaving creams I have used and you only need a small dab. I used to use the one by Art of shaving before this. I still use the art of shaving badger brush.
