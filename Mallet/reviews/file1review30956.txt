review/text: I have no idea if the pill itself is good or not but I took it for about 30 days twice a day. The pill is so big I almost choked to death twice. The second time I hacked and heaved for 10 minutes because it went down the wrong hole and finally it came flying back out. I took the rest of the bottle and threw it away. Not worth choking to death on horse pills.
