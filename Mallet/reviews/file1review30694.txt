review/text: Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In GermanyFrom Kimbo's husband: The Fig Newton. This is one fine razor! My previous razor was the Trak II Gillette which is now quite difficult to find replacement cartridges, and when I do, they are so costly. So, I began my research on the Internet and discovered the Merkur Classic Safety Razor. I found one in an upscale shaving boutique store in one of Atlanta's more prestigious malls in Buckhead. There I managed to handle one and look it over. Pleased with what I saw, I placed the order through Amazon saving a good 25% of the cost, even with shipping. When it arrived at my home, I immediately began to use it. Wow, what an amazing difference! Precision engineered and beautifully crafted in Germany, this razor shines! I love it.
