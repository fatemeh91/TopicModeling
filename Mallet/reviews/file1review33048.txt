review/text: Good product in my opinion. No side effects or interactions but be careful with dosage. I followed the instructions and had no problems, but my sister tried these and had a slight rash on her skin. It's difficult to attribute it to use of Formula, since she was taking some other over the counter meds to treat her flu condition.http://www.sourcenaturals.com/articles/4683/
