review/text: Brite Eyes III | 2 vials (5 ml each)Spent $300 on Brite Eyes, Can-C, and Swiss drops. They gave hope, but did not work. After two years, I became 65, got medicare,and two 10K surgeries changed me from unable to drive half blind in whiteout...to seeing beautiful colors and being able to enjoy life again. (Colin)
