review/text: These pads work great! I'm a first-time working mom and I need reliable protection. They're completely absorbent and easy to wash because you just throw them in the laundry bag and wash with the rest of your clothes. You can even wash them with your baby's laundry since they're only dirty with breast milk. I've tried other reusables such as nuuk's and they would leak after 2 hours. I pump during lunch which are taken after 3-4 hours. These pads absorb up to 6 hours. I also use disposables while out such as medelan and advento which are great but add up over time as you buy more and more over the year. It's a good idea to buy 2 or 3 sets if you're breast feeding for a year or more. It saves so much money.
