review/text: It just is too hard to get accurate skinfolds if you are very fat. You will probably do better with a good measuring tape and accurate scale for monitoring fat loss. There are web calculators that you can plug in weight and some tape measurements to get close for a bodyfat percentage.Plus, for a woman, the triceps site is tricky to do, unless you have a measuring partner.I'm keeping the calipers for now, in hopes that someday I'll be thinner and able to use them with better results than currently.Now, the MYOTAPE it comes with, THAT, I LIKE! A great idea and very convenient to use for taking body girth measurements. So my recommendation is to buy the Myotape separately and don't bother with the calipers.So I'm giving it a three stars, because of the included Myotape. Otherwise, I'd probably give it one or two stars if it was just the calipers.
