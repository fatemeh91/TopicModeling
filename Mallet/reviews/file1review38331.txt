review/text: This is my very first epilator and I love it! I think its great for someone, like myself, who has never used one before. It is not painful, the feeling is more like the "pins and needles" you get if you sleep on your arm wrong at night. And its easy to use and removes most hair quickly and efficiently. Its extremely easy to clean, and comes with a fun little carrying case. My only complaint is that it does not remove short hairs, so if you've shaved recently it may not get all the hairs out. I've had to use it for a few days in a row to get 100% smooth. But its well worth it!!
