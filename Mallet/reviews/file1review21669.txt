review/text: My son outgrew his infant tub so I tried to bath him in a regular tub - wasn't having it! So I needed something fast that could act as a transition tub. This fit the bill. I would recommend buying a hand pump to fill it (just be very careful). I tried to blow it myself and nearly passed out! I used the pump from my exercise ball and it was inflated and ready to go in minutes. Just place the plug in the hole and fill! I am not sure why people have complained about it being slipper - my son stands up just fan when I have to wash his bottom. He loves it! My only complaint is that the bottom leaves...um...rear end stains so make sure you keep it clean or at least pre-clean your babies bottom before putting them in. I always do so I don't know how it stains but it does!
