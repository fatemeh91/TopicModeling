review/text: There are lots of fancy dish brushes on the market: brushes that squirt this and that, brushes with sponges, etc. We prefer this one and go out of our way to buy it whenever we can. It does a good-all around job on a wide range of things. This includes pots and pans, so long as food isn't burned or baked on. One of the things we like most is that it's just a plain brush. No sponge to get full of dirty, smelly bacteria. When it gets grubby, we just pop it in the dishwasher with everything else!
