review/text: This is my preferred razor. I have tried others and have never been as satisfied as I am with this one. When I could no longer buy it locally I started buying it on-line, that is how well I like this razor. It holds at the right angle in my hand. It doean't pinch or leave a lot of razor burn in the swim suit areas. My only dissatifaction with it is that you can not buy refill blades.
