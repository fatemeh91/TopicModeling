review/text: This is my third Wahl Shaver, I stay with Wahl because it's the only one I have found with a screen with holes that are big enough to do the job right for me. I use the super close screen, the other Wahl screens and the several other brands shavers I have tried and returned, have smaller holes and I have to shave twice as long and still don't get as good a shave.Maybe this is unique to me but I doubt it. I would think the other brands would do a little research and development and come out with more screen choices also.
