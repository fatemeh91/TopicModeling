review/text: I am a skeptic by nature. As someone with a degree in business I expect marketers to stretch the truth, at a minimum. I purchased this product thinking if it didn't work it was only few dollars. The guys at work were as skeptical as I was until the first coffee spill. This little pen even removed a coffee stain that was 4 hours old. We were all absolutely amazed!I have used this product on the following stains and it removed them completely:1. fresh coffee stain2. 4 hour old coffee stain3. balsamic vinegar4. make up (foundation)5. marinara sauce6. olive oil7. soy sauceIf you or your significant other are spill prone, pick one of these up right away. I have one in desk and another one in my purse. I knew Tide had a winner when the guys at work began purchasing their own Tide to go pens after using mine.I can not recommend this product highly enough. It is actually one of those products that does everything that it claims.
