review/text: Im so glad I found these bars. The double chocolate brownie tastes like an actual brownie. You wouldnt know you are eating a protein bar. Also its not so thick and dry like some others. This is the best tasting bar ive ever tried. Its a little smaller then some others which I like because you dont have to cram in a huge bar to get your protein. This is better vs. the chocolate craze.. they are both basically the same but the brownie one has a nice drizzle on top. Smores is also great. HIGHLY recommended.
