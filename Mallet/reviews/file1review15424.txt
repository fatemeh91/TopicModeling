review/text: Look, if you want your repellent to smell good, this one isn't for you. It does, in fact, smell a slight bit like vomit. That aside, it is herbal and you aren't rubbing chemicals all over you or your kids skin. We used this on our 1 year old when we went on a camping trip in the Amazon. A true testament is that he did not come back with bug bites. The wipe ons are very convenient for children as well. Although I do admit, it smelled a little like vomit, it works, and it is herbal and natural for children. Recommend.
