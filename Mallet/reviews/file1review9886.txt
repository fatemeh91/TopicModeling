review/text: This tweezer has the finest point of any tweezer I've ever used... It really does a good job when it's time to get really thorough in your grooming and need to pick at really fine hairs... However there are a few issues that keep me from loving it...1 - the point of this tweezers are fine and slender... in fact at times they are TOO fine... sometimes I end up cutting/breaking a hair instead of pulling it out which defeats its purpose and its frustrating...2 - These are REALLY sharp; the little plastic cap this comes with is not good enough to protect you if somehow you push it on too hard...And 3 - the tips are very easily bent, if you drop it and it happens to hit something it's pretty much unusable after that... I'm not sure if you can send them back to Tweezerman to be fixed?All in all these are a good buy but I would definitely advise buying more than one at a time so you always have a back-up...Happy plucking
