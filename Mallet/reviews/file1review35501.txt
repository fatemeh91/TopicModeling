review/text: I have Fibromyalgia and get aches and pains all over. I found the Blue Relief at a Walmart, (which no longer carries it) and when I get pains anywhere I just rub a little on and it works very quickly. I now grab the Blue Relief first instead of an OTC pain med. It also doesn't stain or have an odor. I can't say it will work for everyone, but it works for me so maybe you can give it a try. I highly recommend it.
