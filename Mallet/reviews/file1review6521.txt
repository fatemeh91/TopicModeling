review/text: Have you ever found yourself leaning onto a blunt object, such as a corner of the wall, in the attempt to work out a knot in your shoulder/back? Have you ever asked someone to push their knuckle on that same spot as hard as they can? If so, this item is a MUST! The original thero-cane is great, but this S shaped trigger point releiver gives you a few more options. The smaller curve has a round knob on the end, whereas the larger curve has a little more pointer knob for a different pressure point experience. The great thing about having this available is that you control how the amount of pressure you apply to your trouble spot and the size allows you to reach any area in need of attention. You won't have to beg a friend/family member to lean on your back and insisting they can lean harder...with this, you have control and can keep the pressure for as long as you feel necessary. Don't hesitate, just buy it, it's worth the money...your back will thank you! The only negative for this is if you travel a lot (and travel light), it's oddly shaped so fitting it into your carry-on would probably be impossible...but it would fit in a regular sized suitcase.
