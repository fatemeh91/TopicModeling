review/text: This is a different brand than we normally get for the herbal "stinging nettles" antihistamine-type product for my spouse's allergies. It is a little weaker (even though the dose says it's stronger), but does provide some relief. The price was cheaper than the other brand, but you might break even if you have to use more to equal the strength/relief. Still somewhat helpful to treat allergic responses (e.g., "crawling" or itchy skin feeling, coughing when trying to sleep, etc.). We use it as needed, and some relief begins about 20 minutes after taking it.
