review/text: Great product. It makes washing dishes so much easier. It is especially helpful with greasy items - pots and pans, in particular. I also use it (without the soap) to wipe off plates before putting them in the dishwasher.The only downside about this product is that a lot of soap comes out. I wish that there was more control over that. But, it's really it isn't that big of a deal.
