review/text: Really nice product! And cheap! It has NINE settings, plus you can remove the "guard" and kind of freehand a trim (use a comb is what the instructions say to do). Nicely designed, it feels solid in your hand. It comes with a cleaning brush and a miniature comb to use on your beard before you trim it. I'm surprised and impressed at the quality of this trimmer, especially for the price!
