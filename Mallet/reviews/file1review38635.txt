review/text: I bought a bottle of Nature's Life Magnesium Malate a while back. I take it once in a while. I don't notice a difference if I take it or I don't take it. However magnesium malate is one of the best forms of magnesium along with magnesium taurate.Once I finish the bottle I won't buy it again but that's not because I dislike the product. It's probably very good. It's just that my body has plenty of magnesium. I'm getting plenty of magnesium from food and water sources.
