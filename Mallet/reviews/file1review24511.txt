review/text: I have Morton's Neuroma and am an active runner, considering running a half-marathon this fall. I found the more often and farther I run, the more regularly my neuroma acts up, to the point where it is a daily problem now, with pretty intense pain shooting up my toe when I walk. I went online to see what was out there for relief and stumbled across some positive reviews on several options so I bought a variety of them. I found I liked them all, including this one, the FootSmart Gel Callus Cushions, but this is my least favorite of the 3. Just personal preference. The sticky back does come back every day after washing and drying, it does stay in place, it relieved the pressure on the nerve so I don't have that shooting pain anymore so I found it to work ok but it just is not my first choice when putting on my shoes.I went to the foot doctor and found out I also have high arches and he recommended insoles (Powerstep Pinnacle) and what a huge difference they made in my overall foot comfort - most of the time all I need is the Powerstep insoles. I would suggest if you have high arches along with Morton's Neuroma I would try the Powerstep Pinnacle insoles first (be sure to remove the original insoles in your shoes). That is really what I found to be the biggest help - but shop around! Prices are all over the place.
