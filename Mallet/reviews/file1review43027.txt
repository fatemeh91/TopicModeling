review/text: I have a small frame (5'0", pre-pregnancy 115 lb, currently 27 weeks and 123 lb) and am carrying my baby low into the pelvic area. My doctor recommended this to help with sciatica and low back pain. I use the middle setting, and it helps to lift the weight of the uterus and baby off of my pelvis, and also relieves the low back pain so that I can stand up straight. My only complaint is that the section of elastic that goes across the ribs is not adjustable like the shoulder straps. It is tight and somewhat uncomfortable/itchy under the breasts, and exacerbates indigestion. I think having adjustable straps there would also make the entire thing easier to put on and remove. I am concerned that if my ribcage expands, I won't be able to use this anymore.
