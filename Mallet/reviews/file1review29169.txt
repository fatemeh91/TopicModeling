review/text: Inexpensive and of quality make. Have had my crossaction more than a year and is still going strong. The bristles move in a circular and back and forth motiopn giving the teet a really good cleaning. Works just as good as other electric tootbrushes double and triple its cost, however it is not as good as some of the more elite toothbrushes ranging 35 and up. But for less than 10 bucks I went ahead and but them as stocking stuffers last christmas for the family to enjoy. Great durable toothbrush.
