review/text: I purchased 16 of these pieces of junk (green top, no gold) about 18 months ago, and every single one can't hold a charge longer than about a week or ten days. They seem to work more or less OK if you just need batteries that work for a day or two, but it's an absolute must to leave them in the charge up until the moment they're needed. Stay away if you can.*Edit:To Duracell's credit, when I complained in their comment section of the website, they sent me coupons for replacement rechargeables, which I used to buy some of the "precharged" (low self-discharge) ones. I still say to be careful about these, but Duracell stepped up and if you get stuck with a bad batch like I did, you might have similar results.
