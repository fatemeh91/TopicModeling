review/text: I just received this last week and it will allow me to keep running longer - thank goodness! I am 26 weeks pregnant with my first baby and not too big yet, but jogging caused a lot of round ligament pain. I have been a runner for years and continued with my 4 mile runs until about 21 weeks when it became too uncomfortable because of ligament pain. Then cut it down to a 2 mile run and 2 mile walk, but at about 24 weeks the pain was back. I used the Mother-to-be support this week and no pain at all! It was amazing how supportive for being lightweight. I also used it while I did lunges and squats and it didn't impede leg movement while bending and stretching. Probably won't work for yoga and pilates, but I continued to wear it for a few hours after my workout and felt great. Initially, I was VERY skeptical that this would work. If you are having trouble continuing with an exercise program such as jogging or walking this is a great solution that may help you continue for a while longer. I definitely plan to use it when I quit running and switch to walking.
