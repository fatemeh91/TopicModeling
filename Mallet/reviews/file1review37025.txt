review/text: It worked perfectly! Strong enough to keep me dry even when I was exercising -- but gentle, so it didn't irritate my skin even though I have sensitive skin and usually it's a big problem to find a good deodorant. It dries right away; my clothes so far don't have any kind of stain. I really like it and will get it again!
