review/text: I've used double edge razors once upon a time. My dad used to have an old butterfly style adjustable Gillette that I ended up with, and subsequently lost somewhere. I used it almost with a sense of nostagia more than anything, before losing it and having to go to the typical contemporary offerings (Shick Quattro). Anyways, the sheer cost of the today's razor cartridges finally pushed me towards revisiting this great style of razor.The Merkur is like a precision tool compared to my dad's old gillette, and after 2 weeks of use, i can whip around my face as w/ a disposable style. I definitely recommend a good-quality shave cream like Proraso or Omega shave soap. The quality of the shave easily meets or exceeds that which you would get w/ one of the Quattro / Fusion styles, and with significantly less skin irritation. Note, i even use the generic drugstore double edge blades in this razor with great results! For optimum results though, I would recommend higher-quality blades in general (still way cheaper than cartridges!).I enjoy the short handle of this razor - I initially purchased a long-handle Merkur classic which ultimately went to my wife for shaving her legs (another double-edge convert!). I really don't think a long handle is necessary for facial shaving, even if you're used to it from what you've used in the past. With the shorter handle, this razor "turns on a dime", and requires less pronounced hand movements or adjustments when getting the proper angle as you shave. It does take a little getting used to, because it is such a more compact package (length-wise) than a typ. disposable, but with a bigger cutting swath. The razor will pay for itself within the first year of ownership with the money saved on blades all the while delivering a top-notch, healthy, and enjoyable shave! I'll never go back to cartridge style.
