review/text: My son is 10, and we were told by several doctors, teachers, and many other professionals, he would never learn to read, write, or even talk. I disagreed and searched for something to help him, and found this. In 8 months, the boy they all gave up hope on went from barely being able to understand the alphabet, to reading on a second grade level, working on 3rd grade now. He can even do math, problem solve, write, and speak 75% clearly from 15% clearly. This is a truly remarkable product, and I would advice any one else in our shoes to give it a try. Thank You Mind Care Jr so much for showing everyone else what a bright son I have, even when they all gave up and told me to give up too. I knew he was in there, and you helped him let it out :)
