review/text: My husband and I have been TTC for over a year, we are both 30 years old. I have PCOS and have always had very irregular periods (some 80-90 day cycles) and my husband had low count and poor morphology. We went to a fertility clinic in July. I had an HSG - no problems there, so we started several months of fertility drugs and IUI's, each time it failed, it was more crushing than the last. Over the holidays we decided we needed a break and we would start fresh in January. I read about Fertilaid on TTC websites and decided it couldn't hurt to take them while we were on our break. We had tried different combinations of supplements and vitamins before, which seemingly did nothing, so needless to say we were skeptical about fertilaid. My husband started taking the Fertilaid for Men and I started the Fertilaid for Women in the middle of November. We only took 2 capsules a day with food. Well, I don't know how much I can contribute to the Fertilaid, but it seems like a very strange coincidence that suddenly I am pregnant, just like that, the good old fashioned way! No fertility medications, no treatments, no charting my cycles and definitely eating like crap over the holidays. I am truly in shock about it, I wish I had read about Fertilaid 18 months ago when we started this journey. I would definitely recommend this product. It also helped regulate my cycles to 36-38 days, which is much more normal. I get that it is not a fix-all solution, but if you have tried everything else, I would say it absolutely can't hurt! Best of luck to everyone, I know it is a painful and difficult journey. JD
