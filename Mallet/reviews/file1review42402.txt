review/text: I am using the product to get extra swelling out from my ankle. I rolled my ankle awhile back and recovery is taking awhile. I will also be using this when I go on jogs and work out in general to prevent swelling of my ankle. I have had it for a day and it is extremely comfortable. It has silicon pads on both the inside and outside of the ankle bones and the compression is quite perfect assuming you measured your ankle right and purchased the right size support. I will write more after having used it for a bit.However, there is little in terms of support to prevent the ankle from rolling. I will not be using this for basketball or any other 'contact' sports where having to break and change speed quickly is needed. The MalleoLoc is probably better suited for that and will be tested soon.Pros: Effective, Stabilizes, Easy To Use, ComfortableCons: Provides Little Support in terms preventing ankle rolling/sprains
