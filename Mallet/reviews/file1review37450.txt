review/text: I just bought one last week from amazon.com and tried it the very same day it arrived. I tried it on my leg first. After the first stroke, it was easy. After doing both my legs, I applied moisturizing lotion and waited half an hour to see if there was any swelling or redness of skin. My skin was red the first ten minutes but went back to normal quickly. So then I tried it on my forearm. It hurt a little on my arm but it was bearable.This small machine is simply AWESOME!!!
