review/text: This rating is for the Clean Day Surface Scrub, although I bought it along with the All Purpose Cleaner.I bought the scrub product in lemon Verbena for those times when I didn't want to make my own.There is actually no difference between this one and the one I make except the scent. My soda with laundry booster actually cleans better, but this one passed the cleaning and smell test with me.I bought the all purpose cleaner as well, wish I hadn't. It did not clean any surface (beyond dust) that I used it on, and the smell was nasty. They would have done well to leave the scent at the lavender and orange which are a good combination, but they had to add some "fragrance" in there that turned it some kind of awful!That's my take on it.
