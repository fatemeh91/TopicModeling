review/text: The sleepkey was a major help when I had awful chronic insomnia a few years ago that had lasted for several years. It is really hard at first to get up when you are still so tired and to survive the day on so little sleep, but we insomniacs are used to that awfulness. The sleepkey helped to break the cycle and get me onto a normal sleep schedule. Now, as long as I stick to my nightime routine and relax before bed, I hardly ever even hear it beep. I've used it off and on for a few years, but I just love knowing how much sleep I got when I wake up. It's interesting to me how sometimes I think I'm awake but really I didn't hear it beep so I was asleep!
