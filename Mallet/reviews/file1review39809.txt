review/text: I have had a Deluxe Gopher for years -- don't remember how or when I got it but I have had none of the problems some reviewers relate. I never fold mine so maybe that's part of my success, and have had no problems with the suction cups.This tool is now used exclusively for picking stinkbugs off of the ceiling, windows, walls, etc., and transporting them to their final resting place: the nearest toilet.For really heavy visitations, our handheld Oreck vacuum cleaner is more efficient, but otherwise the Gopher gets the bug.
