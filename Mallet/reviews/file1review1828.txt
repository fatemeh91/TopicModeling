review/text: I was suffering from a severe fungal infection on my arms and legs, and prescriptions from the doctor were having no effect at all. My sores would ooze a honey-like liquid, fooling us into thinking it was a bacterial infection. I started searching for natural things that may be able to help.If you read what the ingredients are for Fungasoap you won't be able to believe that it will work for a fungal infection, but it really does! I would rub it on the infected spots and leave it on for about 10 minutes before getting in the shower, but if I forgot, I poured some on a wet cloth and washed with that, and it seemed to work almost as well. When the infection was particularly severe I would wash a couple more times during the day with Fungasoap, and get relief. I could see the difference the first few times I used it, but as it healed the effects weren't as noticeable.I did use other things in conjuction with Fungasoap. As we live near the ocean, I found that going in the ocean and letting the salt water dry on my skin, worked well to clean the ooze and help it to dry. The second thing I used was GSE, putting that on after a shower and a couple more times during the day. Make sure you dilute it. Then at night if the infected areas became itchy and irritated, I used Vetericyn gel, which is really for animals, but it's the same formulation as the Puracyn made for humans, yet is half the price. I squirted a substantial amount onto an area, then covered it with toilet tissue, (strange I know!) and then covered it all with either a large band aid, or an ace bandage to hold the tissue onto the area. This seemed to help it to dry up much quicker.
