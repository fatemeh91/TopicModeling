review/text: Puts pressure where I need it! I love that I can do my own trigger point therapy! Who knows my sore spots better than me? I have upper back pain right underneath my shoulder blades due to cubicle work. This gets it every time. And unlike chiropractic visit, there is no time limit. I call the shots! It's awesome. I purchased this tool based on my co-worker's recommendation who recommended this tool to him. If you have back pain due to sore muscles, I would definitely recommend this!
