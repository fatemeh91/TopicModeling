review/text: I've got pretty sensitive skin and get razor burn very easily (thus my decision to stop shaving with blades), but the Braun Activator 8585 has been great to my skin. My old Remington Microscreen would routinely cause razor burn on my upper lip, neck, and chin, even when I used a shaving powder. The Braun Activator 8585 has yet to do so. Even when my skin is inflamed for another reason (sunburn, winter dryness), shaving with the Braun is nowhere near as painful as it was with the Remington.In addition, it provides a closer shave than the Remingtons I have owned in the past (not as close as you would get with a blade, however).One tip--I run the cleaning cycle after every use, but I make sure to clean out most of the gunk in the shaver by popping the shaver screen and running it for a short time, as per the procedure in the manual. As a result, most of the time the shaver uses the "eco" cleaning mode, which makes the cleaning cartridge last longer (I'm still on my first one after a month and a half, and it still reads "full").I've only had the Braun since Christmas, so I can't speak to its long-term durability. Overall, I'm quite happy with it.
