review/text: the condoms look really small, but, once you put on are really confortable. Maybe if you're a horse (more than 8" or 9")it's not going to work for you but if you're in the range 6"-8" it's ok. The feeling improove in about a 15% and you can feel it!. I totally recomended. 4 stars beacause any condom it's perfect.
