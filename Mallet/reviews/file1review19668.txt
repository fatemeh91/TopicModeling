review/text: I really don't want to rate this product, but rather just leave this comment about how the Bjorn potty seat fits on Toto toilets. BUT in order to leave a comment, Amazon is forcing me to give this product a rating. I did not use the product so the rating is not fair. Plus, I really wanted it to work on my Toto toilets.It absolutely does not work with Toto toilet seats: Both round and elongated. Another reviewer said the same thing and a third person commented and said it worked fine for her. I'm not sure if the third person had replaced her Toto toilet seat or if her Toto came with a non-standard Toto seat or if the BabyBjorn potty seat was made differently when she bought it. My Toto toilets were new in 2010 (in case that matters). To be fair, if I got a different potty seat (and I probably will) and it doesn't fit, I would write a similar comment so others would know.Hope this is helpful. Good Luck! :)Update: I found a seat that fits the elongated (but not the round) Toto toilet seat:Prince Lionheart weePOD Toilet Trainer, Blue
