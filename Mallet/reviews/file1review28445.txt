review/text: I'm not a body builder or even a habitual exerciser. I actually bought this product after reading an article about how whey protein can help you lose weight. I've been dieting for about two months now in an attempt to lose 20 pounds, and only managed to lose 5. But things have gotten a lot better since I've started using this product. It's definitely been helping me control my appetite. I mix it into my oatmeal in the morning and have a small snack before lunch, and find myself only eating a portion of my lunch and leaving the rest behind. I also drink a shake about an hour before dinner and, again, I'm leaving most of my dinner on the plate. This is a huge improvement for me. Normally, I'm hungry all the time and never feel full. But now, I hardly ever feel the hunger that I used to. I'm simply eating to fuel my body now. And I've lost 12 pounds in 2 weeks! Nice!Oh, and I bought the vanilla flavor so that I could mix it into a lot of different things. The flavor is ok when mixed with skim milk as a shake, but horrible if it's just mixed with water. Decent in oatmeal. Haven't tried mixing it with anything else yet. I'm going to buy another flavor now just so that I can create a little variety.
