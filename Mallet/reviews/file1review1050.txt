review/text: The watch speaks the time clearly, and it is easy to set. What I didn't like was that the watch is not water resistant.The company that actually sells the watch (Maxiaids) is outstanding. I had a problem after receiving the watch, and they exchanged it with absolutely no hassles. They even paid for the return postage.
