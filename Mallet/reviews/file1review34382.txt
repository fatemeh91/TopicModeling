review/text: I usually take Trimedica MSM capsules, but I've found these to be just as effective.My hair, skin & nails have vastly improved. So have my joints, especially my knees.I am very pleased with the product and although these are "tabs" (as opposed to capsules) I would probably reorder.I take 2 a day.Edit:For the sake of people who read this review, I do want to bring to your attention that this product does not contain vitamin C. However, my Trimedica capsules do. I'm only mentioning this because I read somewhere that MSM is more efficacious with vita C.Just an FYI ...
