review/text: My daughter loves this drink. Its nutritious and tasty. I don't worry now-a-days about my 2 yr old daughter not eating properly everyday. There are days where she gets cranky and does not eat her dinner well..then pediasure comes to my rescue. I wiuld recommend all mothers to have this drink at home.
