review/text: I only use scented deodorants when I think it necessary and I avoid heavy scented anything on my body. This spray is different since it is light to the nose, is not thick or gooey and quickly dries clear. It has a pleasant, natural pine (NOT girly) scent that is fairly light. Just a bit of a scent ; not heavy at all. It's scent lasts only for a few hours, which I like. It is also free from junky chemicals and so it allows your body's skin to function naturally. Good stuff.
