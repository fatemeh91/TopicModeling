review/text: I bought it well in advance of giving birth along with prenatal cradle (which, by the way, I think it an absolute MUST for a pregnant woman), and along with abdominal binder (which is also a must have if you want to get in shape). This product, however, I only tried to wear and wore twice. It is well made, and if you need that support, you definatly should consider buying it. In my case, I made more use of the hip brace (the V2 supporting part is detachable, which is great!), so for me, I could have simply used the regular hip brace. But even the hip brace part I used only several times. It offered good support, and was easy to adjust.So again, for those who think might need that support, it is a well made, adjustable product!
