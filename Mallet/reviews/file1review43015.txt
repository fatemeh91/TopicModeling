review/text: I have never found what it is in some laundry detergents that causes me to bust out in hives. I got one case of this local and found it on Amazon and garbed another here. Great stuff, I use way less than the cap level and everything still comes out nice and clean. The baby version of this product seems to be about the same thing to be. Works just as good. hypoallergenic
