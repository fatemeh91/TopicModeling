review/text: This kind of floss holder used to be common before the disposable types came out. When my previous one broke (I'm not sure how old it was, around 10 years or so), I searched many stores locally without success before I found these on line.There are several advantages to this type of holder compared to the disposables:- Use any kind of floss you want (waxed, unwaxed, dental-tape, whatever)- long handle allows me to get the back teeth without jamming my fingers in my mouth- around 1" of floss exposed; easy to work into difficult areas (I have very close set teeth and have to work the floss back and forth to get between some of them)- The device allows enough control that I can also use it to stimulate the gums around the teeth (OK, a disposable can do that too, but its hard to get fine control with my fingers jammed in my mouth for the back teeth)- A spool of floss lasts about a year, the handle should last many years.- The handle is easy to clean, just rinse it like a toothbrush. It doesn't come into contact with your gums; it just touches the inside of the cheek.
