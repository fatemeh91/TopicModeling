review/text: I had constant back and sciatica pain for months. It hurt in any position. I wish I had known about and purchased the Mother-to-Be Maternity support for my first pregnancy. I felt instant pain relief as soon as I put it on. I was even able to take my toddler on a long walk without pain. I highly reccommend this product even if you are in your 9th month. It's worth it.As with other reviews, I would reccoment wearing something under it for greater comfort.
