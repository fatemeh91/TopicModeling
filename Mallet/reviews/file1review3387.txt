review/text: The splitter does a great job at splitting the pill. However the cover of this super sharp cutter does not snap close securely. I work in home health and if I put my hand into my bag looking for something and the cap happens to be open, I could get a really nasty cut. Its not safe. A cap with a razor that sharp should be able to close and snap shut securely.Also the pill crusher part does not crush the pill to a fine powder. After screwing it on on all the way, its still not tight enough to really crush the pill to a consistency fine enough not to clog a Gtube. So I do not use that function. This device has potential to be improved into something much better.
