review/text: Having used this this product many times in the past I knew I would be satisfied with it - and I am. Due to physical disabilities and a very poor respiratory system I have a hard time getting into a conventional bath tub and the humidity in the shower makes breathing very difficult. Many times I supplement my cares with sponge baths and the ConvaTec Aloe Vesta BodyWash works well for this because it cleans very well and doesn't need to be rinsed. I have not tried this product as a shampoo so I cannot speak to that. I will certainly order this product again and I recommend it to anyone looking for a Body Wash. I also have very sensitive skin and the ConvaTec causes no problems.
