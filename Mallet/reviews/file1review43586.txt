review/text: I ordered this blood pressure monitor for my mother. It is simple to use, with both battery and AC connection, and gives her the peace of mind when she's not feeling just right and wonders if it might be her blood pressure. I purchased another unit years ago and it was much less reliable than this one, it's perfect!
