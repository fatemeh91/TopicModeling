review/text: I'm 5'3" and carrying way out front. typical boy apparently--everyone seems to know I'm having a boy. the small fits perfectly--on the largest "setting" but I can also do the med setting but it seems to make him uncomfortable. This product definitely helps me but nothing seems to make a big differnece. I've been wearing it since I was 4-5 months and am now inthe home stretch and am just terribly uncomofortable. But I notice a difference when I wear it vs nothing and so i keep it on all the time except when sleeping.4 stars for quality and value, not 5 b/c of the pain I still have though it may be more me than the product.
