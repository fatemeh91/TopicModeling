review/text: The day I receive this I happened to have been sick for the 4th time in 3 months with a cold. The reason why I ordered it in the first place was because of this and I thought my immune system needed a boost. I haven't really been getting the necessary vitamins and minerals I thought I needed so I thought I give this a try. I also heard that it was good for hair and nail growth which I never really had a problem with anyway so I didn't worry to much about that.I started taking the Mineral Rich right away and in about 3 days my cold was gone with just some minor coughing here and there, but I haven't been sick since which is great since I'm around so many people all the time. The flavor was good and it didn't bother my stomach at all and I didn't have any side effects like others have listed. I do take it after eating a full meal and I mix it in a glass of water.
