review/text: I use this sweeper mostly to clean up the dining room after the kids' meals. It's great for picking up the food crumbs, as long as they are not stuck to the pretty low-shag wall to wall carpet. Occasionally I would go over the living room and pick up random crumbs. It's somewhat worrying how much hair and lint this thing picks up - makes me regret having vacuumed so little in the past...This sweeper is sturdily built. The body and handle are metal and the brushes quite dense. Some people complained about the height of the handle. I'm 5'8&#34; and it's okay for me. Maybe adding another half an inch would be nice, but not a big deal.
