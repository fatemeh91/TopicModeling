review/text: Duracell still makes the best quality batteries; including this set. But there are new better technology. This NiMh is old school. Check out the benefits of the pre-charged batteries before you buy this set. Duracell also make one of the best quality low-discharged batteries out there. Honestly, except for the higher capacity (2650mAH), the low-discharged batteries has more benefits. You can also use them on your remotes or clocks and will last longer between charges. The cost difference is also not much.
