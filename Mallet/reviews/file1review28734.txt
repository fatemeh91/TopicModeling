review/text: Whether it's any better in terms of results compared to other protein is something I would never be able to discern. The stuff tastes absolutely delicious and to be frank, it's almost a bit too rich, but it mixes nicely and whether it's with water or milk it's a darn good drink. I've decided to try another ON flavor for my newest protein (double rich chocolate) which is a bit more subdued but still pretty good. I dig the products though and will buy it again when I'm low on protein.
