review/text: What a deal! I did not expect this mirror to be this nice for such a low price. The lighting is perfect. The magnification is great for tweezing. It looks great on the bathroom counter, no need to hide it away, it's so pretty you will want to leave it out. Also, you simply turn it on by tapping the bottom base, very convenient. I think I will buy one for my mother too!
