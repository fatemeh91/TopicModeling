review/text: I just bought this product this morning at my local beauty supply store, based on the recommendation of the store clerk. I have horrible calluses on my feet that crack and haven't found anything that works really well (unless I soak my feet for awhile first to soften them up). I just used this tool and it works amazingly well. I also paid $18.00 for it (it has a few replacement screens), so I was surprised to find it here for much less.
