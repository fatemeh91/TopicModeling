review/text: I use Thursday Plantation Tea Tree Oil to treat zits. One to three drops of oil into a couple inches of clean water in your sink makes a nice face wash. Its clean smell is invigorating, too. You can also apply the undiluted oil directly onto a blemish, and it will dry out in a day or two. It's great.Tea tree oil has many uses. I've treated bug bites and rashes with it. It also deters bees and wasps. Dab your neck and throat area with the oil and it keeps bees and wasps off you (and your kids).
