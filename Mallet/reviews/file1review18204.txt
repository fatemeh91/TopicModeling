review/text: This is the best sleep mask i've found so far, of the half dozen or so i've tested. It's lightweight, blocks almost all the light, and it's comfortable.The only problem with it is it's not made to last. The material comes away at the edges, showing the foam inside. At this price though, just buy a few like I do, as it's the best mask I've found.
