review/text: First of all, I am a very frequent shopper on amazon.com; however I did not purchase this product here. I logged on here to find information after my purchase.When ordering I did not see any reference at all for shellfish. I always look, as I would have a severe allergic reaction if I consumed it in any form or amount. Then the product arrived and, as always, I read the label. Down at the bottom, "CONTAINS SHELLFISH (SHRIMP, CRAB) INGREDIENTS.I went back to review the information online to double check and see if it was my oversight. Apparently not. Just since my order date of March 8, the store I bought from has discontinued the product. So have several other sites. On the few that are still carrying Optimum Nutrition Glucosamine Plus CSA Super Strength, NONE discloses there is shellfish content - including here. This is a real problem for people with allergic reaction. If I could give this product a worse rating that 1 star, I surely would.
