review/text: This is far and away the best cinnamon tea I have ever found. It's quite difficult to find a cinnamon tea without added flavors like apple. This is just cinnamon tea, and it's aroma and taste is that of fresh cinnamon. Also I drink this after dinner to curb my carb cravings, and amazingly, it does the trick.
