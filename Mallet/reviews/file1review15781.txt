review/text: This multi-function pen is wonderful especially compared to my previous experience with the PaperMate Phd Multi. The feel is solid and has the perfect balanced weight. The continuous spinning is a great feature too. The only con I have found so far about 3 months of usage is the black and red color identifiers have started to rub off on the tips -- so it can be slightly hard to tell which is selected. But other than that I would highly recommend this pen!
