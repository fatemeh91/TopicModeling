review/text: This USB lamp does a great job on giving you an extra volume of light, compared to all other lamps which only have 1 bright led, but the downside is that the light gets focused on a narrowed somewhat closed spot. If you need to use this lamp in an environment with no lightning at all, don't expect to see all your notebook keyboard but it does help better than any other USB lamps I've seen so far. As for the flexible cord (made of metal, not plastic) it does a great job of standing well in any position you put it.
