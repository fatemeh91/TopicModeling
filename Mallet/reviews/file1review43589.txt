review/text: I bought this product for my elderly mother, so that she could check her blood pressure at home. She was having a lot of trouble with her blood pressure, and her medications were being adjusted. She followed the directions very carefully. The readings that she got were extremely high and alarmed both her doctor and her. She had to make multiple trips to the office as a result of these readings. She brought the machine with her, to show the doctor how high it was reading, and each time, when he checked it with his machine it was much lower. It is obviously defective, and she contacted the manufacturer several times and got no response. I would recomend not buying this product.
