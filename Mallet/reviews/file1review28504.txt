review/text: Lots of choices and have come to this late as in very late. Wish I had known and understand the benefits from such a fine product much sooner. Had used carb solutions on occasion but how clumpy it is and has only half the protein let alone the full benefits of this product.A subscription to this product via Amazon at 10lbs is going to produce a great bang for the buck. I've used the product for just over a month with a weight training program that was restarted after the local gym had closed down. (Replaced by Ironmaster Superbench & Powerblocks!) Very, very impressive results in just a short 5 week time. Aid in recovery to allow you to rebuild your training with minimal soreness or next to none was a shock to me. Being over 40 I didn't even know this was possible. I had not worked out all winter. This product helped me to not only get back on my program it allowed me to see results in strength and body that I've never had so fast in my life. I'm an overall athlete who has had several knee operations so I am a swimmer who also bikes and this product allows you to reach goals that took so much longer previous.Wish I had known and understood this years back but there you have it. As someone who also bikes and swims for health, this product is going to be just as useful for cardio as for strength training. If I grow old and live good like Jack Lalane, I'll owe a big debt to Optimum Nutrition no doubt.I've read about other products that are very good, provide excellent taste and that is no doubt probably true. But for overall use, (it dissovles easily) and benefit with cost in mind, I don't think there is anything that will do better for more people than this product.
