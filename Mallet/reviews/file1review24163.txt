review/text: Another example of a cheap electronic product that is really quite expensive. Perhaps the most important switch, that permitting the time to be set, or reset in the case of return to standard time, failed after the clock was in use for only 4 weeks. The problem could have been anywhere, but my guess is the crappy filament switches, that cannot be replaced, underneath the front-panel plastic buttons. My advice: spend your $13 elsewhere.
