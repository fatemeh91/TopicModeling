review/text: I absolutely love this deoderant. Works so much better than other natural ones in the summer. I use other Weleda products and am always amazed by how well they work. This one finally did the job. They even have a travel size, so you can take it with you on the go. I'm very impressed. I gave it a 4 because it does smell a bit strong when you first put it on, but it is a nice floral scent to me. It smells kinda like perfume without the added chemicals and synthetic fragrances. Lasts a long time, especially compared to other natural ones that I have tried and needed to keep reapplying. I will definitely be buying a bottle of this as my deoderant from now on! I plan to try the other scents, as well.
