review/text: Been using this product for the past 9 years. I'm not trying to get huge - and i'm not huge (5'11" ~160 6%), but as someone who works out hard 3-4x a week, i'm looking to add protein to my diet where i've been deficient (breakfast was my opportunity area). This product met that need.I blend a scoop with 20oz of water, 0.5oz of 100% fruit juice, a frozen banana or two and ice cubes - yields about 50oz of smoothie - i drink it all and then pee like a horse. I always blend after workouts, but i blend on off days as well.Even though i've been perfecting the formula over these past 9 years (initially starting with the protein stirred into skim milk - some meathead told me that i shouldn't do that - so i stopped), this protein has always tasted great. I use vanilla ice cream. I have never been dissatisfied with the quality of this product.
