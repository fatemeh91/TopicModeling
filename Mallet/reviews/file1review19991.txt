review/text: I used this with kid#2. Even as a newborn, he seemed too big(born at 7.12) He would slide all over even when held and even would slide down with his back ending up on the butt gap. Then cause of the folding gap, water poured out with every movement he made, no matter how little water I put in it. Also, the water level it holds(min. or max.) was so low that his poor little parts were way above the waterline. Boys tend not to like cold down there. To be wet then above the water just didn't work. I ended up using this hammock-on-a-frame type thing I got for #1 when she was little and bathed him in a regular tub. Made it alot easier to wash his hair too since he was leaning back. I would not recommend this one to anyone. With the trouble and effort, you are better of cradling them in your arms over the tub. same amount of support/lack of water/one handedness
