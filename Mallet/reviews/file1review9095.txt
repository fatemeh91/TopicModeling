review/text: I feel better about myself when I take this product. My skin feels tighter and more resilient and hair seems shinier. I also like the fact that it's good for the body. On the other hand, it tastes like grass on it's own. To drink it, I mix it with a small glass of juice and "down" the whole thing. Taste wise, I prefer Amazing Grass Superfood but would buy either depending on which one i on sale.
