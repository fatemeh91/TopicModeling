review/text: We received the lotion, and the pump didn't work so we had to purchase another bottle with a pump. My boyfriend said that he didn't really notice a difference in his skin until he mixed the lotion with some shaving soap and incorporated that mixture into his daily shaving regimen; which is what he was already doing with Vaseline intensive care lotion. It really wasn't worth the money for him.
