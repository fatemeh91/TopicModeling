review/text: I bought this when Amazon was selling 3 for $15..a pretty good deal. I should've known better since I've never seen this in the store. I have sensitive eyes and this stuff BURNS. It feels like I just put jalapenos in my eye. No matter how long I leave it in I still need to rinse it with another saline. Opti Replenish is much better.
