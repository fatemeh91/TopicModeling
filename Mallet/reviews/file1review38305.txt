review/text: The epilator heads work well BUT there is a HUGE design flaw: the cord plugs in to the side, not the end of the device, which means you really cannot get a decent grip on it. It works OK for underarms, OK for legs and is TOO CLUMSY for anything more delicate "down there." I love the product line, wore out my former Gold Touch epilator in the course of 8 years and hoped this model would be just as good. The technology is better: the design is DREADFUL. After 4 months of struggling with it I'm looking for a replacement with a better design.
