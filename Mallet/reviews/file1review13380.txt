review/text: My wife had been looking for a bed liner to protect the mattress during that 'time of the month'. She came across this one and is pleased that it does the job! She can sleep in confidence. However, she gives it only 4-stars because it does crinke or roll-up in some area, but since it's large in size, your mattress is still protected.
