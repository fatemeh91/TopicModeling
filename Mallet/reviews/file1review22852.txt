review/text: I ordered this product and it arrived promptly (as soon as I had aggregate orders over $25 under Amazon's add-on program for inexpensive items). The pump seems as if it were specifically made for the Biotone gallon Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion that I use. The intake hose and the spout are just the right length, and the lotion came out after only a few initial pumps to prime the line. I've only used it to fill up a smaller Biotone container one time, and so I can't comment on how long this pump will last--hopefully indefinitely.The remainder of my comments do not specifically apply to this pump or even to this specific lotion, but to any thick lotion and any gallon jug. I first bought the gallon jug (without pump) and tried unsuccessfully to pour it into the 8 ounce dispensing container that I use (which happens to be the Biotone 8 ounce container of the same lotion). It didn't work--too thick, air bubbles, lotion oozing out and down the neck and sides of the small container, etc. (herein called a "Mess"). So I tried a funnel. Still a Mess. So I put the gallon jug in a tub of very hot water and hoped the lotion would thin out over the next 30-60 minutes or so from the heat. Nope. Still a Mess. So I looked up pumps on Amazon. I found several types where customers complained that the intake hose was too short, or too small in diameter for a thick lotion, or whatever. So I ordered the Biotone pump. It works fine, but it still takes practice to avoid some tendency towards a Mess.Even though the pump works fine, you still have thick, goopy, lotion going into a small bottle neck. If you don't keep the spout well down into the small bottle (or maybe no matter what you do), lotion will create an air bubble while filling and start to overflow even though the small bottle is not full. It's still a goopy process. But I think I see how to do it neatly. It's not the fault of the pump, and it will just take a little practice on what works for you.
