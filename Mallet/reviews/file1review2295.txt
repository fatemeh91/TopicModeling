review/text: I had to use one of these in one of my shoes because I was wearing a walking boot on the other foot due to an injury. It was hard to find a shoe that was even with the boot so I wouldn't be lop-sided, so they gave me this heel lift to make me even. Well what I noticed right away is that the pain I normally have after walking or standing on my feet too long was not present!! I was so shocked and relieved that I bought another one for the other shoe. :)
