review/text: My wife and daughters are ballerinas and instructors. My wife is retired from dance with athletic the remnants. The three of them use it for joint pain and swear by it. When I had trouble with my hip, I gave it a shot and it reduced my pain by 90%.When my 83 old mother had toothache level pain in her hip this weekend, I was surprised to learn that she never used or heard of arnica. I gave her a tube and her relief drove her to the phone to call her sister who suffers with chronic joint pain.Try it, you'll love it.
