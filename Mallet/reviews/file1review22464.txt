review/text: I have been taking Source of Life for decades now. It's better to get your vitamins from a liquid source, but as I'm traveling, I purchased these thru Amazon. They are giant horse tablets, but they contain a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, herbs and other nutrients. And it's true, if you take 3 at once (ideally with some food to help dissolve them), you do get a small burst of energy.
