review/text: After reading the positive reviews regarding this product, I was quite anxious to try it so I bought a tube and also one for my friend. We used the product for 7 consecutive days and neither of us experienced any pain relief. We both returned to using our generic muscle rub ointment which does give us some relief.Perhaps this product works well for people who have simple aches and pain; people whose arthritis is minor. I first met Mr. Arthritis at age 17 and have lived with him for many years. It is a relationship that I would love to see end. It is now classified as severe and it permeates my entire body. Pain relief is difficult to find because I can't tolerate pain medication nor do I want to live the rest of my life having to rely on pumping NSAIDS into my body. I was very hopeful when I read how Penetran Plus helped other people but it certainly fell short for my friend and me.The plain truth is that arthritis is an insideous disease and as of this date, there is no cure. I guess if Penetran Plus is helping you then I would stick with it. Personally, I feel it is ineffective and frankly, overpriced. However, if it did provide significant pain relief, it would be worth every cent but as for me, I will stick with my generic store bought muscle rub and keep praying that one day, a cure will be found.As the saying goes "if it sounds too good to be true....." Etc., etc., etc.
