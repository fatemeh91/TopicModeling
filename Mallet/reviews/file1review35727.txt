review/text: Similasan Dry Eye Relief Eye Drops .33 OunceI had tried several OTC drops. All burned my eyes and one blurred my vision for a month due to an allergic reaction. A nurse friend with scratched corneas told me about these, the only drops she could tolerate. I tried them and found them to work beautifully.
