review/text: Just took delivery and used for the first time this water pick flosser. I've had others, and of course we always like what we've gotten used too. Well, operationaly this one seems to fit the bill pretty well. The power is fine and I'll play around with the adjustment on that. The pulsing I'm not so sure of yet. Never had one that did that.But the main thing is, like someone else mentioned in another review. It needs a cover. We don't want to have to turn the resevoir over to use as a cover to keep the dust out. I taped a piece of flexable plastic across the back of the resevoir which covers the opening on top. It's easy enough to lift that and fill it by using a glass or cup that we all have sitting around the bathroom sink.I may come up with a better solution in the future, but for now this is working for me.OK, Now it's about a month later. Someone else before me mentioned the power behind the pulsing function. Personally I can't handle anything stronger than the lowest setting. My advice is "don't start any higher than the lowest setting". Anything higher will strip paint!Hope this helps you,Ted
