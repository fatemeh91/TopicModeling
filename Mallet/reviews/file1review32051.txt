review/text: The first time I bought one of these was at an airport after I had spilled coffee on my shorts. It was a lifesaver then and continues to be so! I've used it on coffee stains, maple syrup, jam, and wine and it has been awesome at getting them all out of my clothes. Keep one handy and stop worrying about spills!
