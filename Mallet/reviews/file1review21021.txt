review/text: The Nitro-Tech Hardcore Protein Bar Double Chocolate 12 bars are great to eat as a Meal Replacement before a workout. They are dense, but filling and need to be eaten with a large glass of water. I would recommend them to anyone who is interested in Fitness and working out. They taste great!
