review/text: Great product, works. My wart is gone and not coming back. It has been several months since my wart has disappeared. I also did 2 treatments with dry ice, but remember you MUST BE VERY CAREFUL, Otherwise your skin around the wart could be damages. In addition, I used 7 treatments with patches with medicine in them already, bought it from a Drugstore. Therefore, the combination of all 3 treatments and being consistent meaning a treatment every day works! I think it took me a few weeks. It is definitely worth it. I hope my ugly wart never comes back - it was on the inner side of my right hand.Benefits: cheap; efficacy;Disadvantages: Difficult to target a small wart so you should use bandages. Cut one in the middle, make a circle with the size of your wart. Re-use this bandage. Use a second one on top of this one after you put the medicine on top of the wart, or use an adhesive bandage that wraps around your hand or foot.
