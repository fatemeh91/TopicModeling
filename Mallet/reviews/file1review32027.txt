review/text: I feel so good from drinking this. It has reduced my appetite, helped digestion and I feel energized. Now for the taste. I do like the taste of wheat grass juice and this is just what it tastes like. I mix it in the blender with 3 cups of water. It comes out very pleasant that way. Then I drink 2 tall glass of it.!
