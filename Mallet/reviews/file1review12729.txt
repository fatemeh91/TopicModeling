review/text: I regret to say that this product by Childlife, in particular is too strong. I purchased this product for my toddler and eight year old son who couldn't stand it. I tried it out for myself, and ended up tossing it in the trash. Granted, some might actually take well to it, just like the previous reviewer. However, we weren't one of the lucky ones.
