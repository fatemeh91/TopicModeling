review/text: Excellent! I am relatively new at distance running. However, Hammer Gel provides needed energy on long runs, without any upset stomach or uncomfortable feeling of fullness. It is not overly sweet, so its easy to tolerate. I haven't tried too many Hammer Gel flavors, but I definitely like huckleberry. I'll buy this again when this bottle runs low.
