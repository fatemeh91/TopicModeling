review/text: A few years ago I almost died from intestinal bleeding, and obviioulsy ended up in the hospital.After surgery, a colonectomy and an endoscopy I was told about Pepsogest. I had been using paregoric for extreme intestinal crampings(although it begin as relief for severe menstrual cramps). Now the government no longer allows the use of paregoric, so I use Pepsogest.I take one in the morning, and one in the evening.The gastroligist also told me that the moment I begin feeling cramps or pain, take one with a full glass of water.I was skeptical, but now am a believer.It is almost, almost...as good as paregoric.
