review/text: This brush can reach it! Ever see that little spot in the bottom of a vacuum bottle? It probably won't hurt the flavor of stored liquids, but it just bugs you that it is there. Well, this brush will get it out. Squirt a little liquid dish soap in and some water, wait a few minutes, and twirl the brush to get that spot out! It works, try it.
