review/text: I recommend Calm and Calm with calcium to my patients often. Both work better than cal/mag pills for leg cramps, and make good-tasting drinks for those who don't swallow pills well. They do help one sleep, especially when sleep is interrupted by muscle pain as in Fibromyalgia. Either can loosen stool, to your help or harm, so titrate your dose accordingly and start slow!The person who down rated this product because he got the wrong thing is not very bright.
