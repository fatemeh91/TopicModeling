review/text: I have to wear heels and stand almost all day. Usually by the end of the day, my calves start to swell and hurt. Wearing the compression pantyhose definitely ease the pain and makes me last longer on heels.By the way, as a precaution, the color is a bit tanner than the picture depicted. So if you have light color skin, make sure you pick the right color.
