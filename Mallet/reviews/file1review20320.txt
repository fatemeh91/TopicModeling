review/text: I have experience with other brands of flat diaper cloths. I needed more, so I bought a pack of Gerbers and I was very disappointed. They are as thin as gauze and spit-up runs right though them. The edges are finished with some kind of cheap polyester felt that lacks any absorbency and frays easily. The Gerber cloths shrank so much that I can't possibly use them as diapers even if I tried.If these were named "utility cloths," I could understand. But calling them diapers is a joke. Gerber used to be known for quality, but these are junk.
