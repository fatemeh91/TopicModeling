review/text: I ordered this trimmer for my husband when his old trimmer bit the dust. He has a full beard and mustache and says it works very well. The shape is easy to hold and the controls are user friendly. The one he had been using was quite a bit more expensive than this one, and he says he likes this one much better.If you are looking for a great value and a good product, buy this.
