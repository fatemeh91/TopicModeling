review/text: This seat worked perfectly for my 2.5 y.o. son. He is a big guy and the other seats were just to small for his frame. Also I have the oval toilet seats throughout my home and it fits perfectly. I have the BabyBjorn potty chair and now the trainer seat has just made our family so happy!
