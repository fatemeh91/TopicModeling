review/text: I would recommend this product to everybody with a baby in the house. First, it allows you to keep the baby clean, because the bibsters are quite big. Second, they are waterproof and learning to drink out of a cup is always wet. And, third, no washing and a new, clean, spotless bib each time. Makes parenting a bit easier!
