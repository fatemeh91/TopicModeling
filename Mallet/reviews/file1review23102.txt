review/text: Love this carpet sweeper! It works so much better than our hand-held vacuum, which frequently gets clogged. This sweeper cleaned the carpet so it looked like new, then was very easy to clean with the attached brush so that the sweeper looked like new afterwards. We'll have this for years, as opposed to the hand-held vacuum. Also nice that we can clean without noise (for those who have a sleeping toddler nearby that left a trail of cheerios to sweep up!)
