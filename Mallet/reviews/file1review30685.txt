review/text: I bought this after feeling the "sting" of paying twelve dollars for 5 of the multiblade replacements for the Gillette Sensor. I've had the Merkur Classic and have been using it for a week now. This product is very solid, well-made and will no doubt last a lifetime. As some of the other reviewers have said, there is a learning curve to using it. The first shaves I had bad razor burn in a few spots. After learning to take my time and be more careful I discovered that the Merkur gave me the best shave I've ever had. I don't use a brush or shaving soap but shave wet with an almond oil-base shaving oil and it works great. The solid metal of the razor stays warm from the water while shaving creating a luxurious and relaxing shaving experience. Even better, you can find 100 "Derby Extra" brand replacement blades online for around $15. Considering I'm getting a week's use per blade this is not bad for a five years supply! I would recommend this, hands down, to anyone looking for the best shave of their life and a huge cost savings over modern multiblade razors!
