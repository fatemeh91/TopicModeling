review/text: This is by far the best Protein out there! Also some of the purest! the taste is amazing even thought that's not their main focus! the protein to carb ratio is amazing! also for the price you get a lot more serving than you do with other companies! Ive had the chocolate, vanilla, cake batter, banana, french vanilla! and they are all pretty good! I loved the cake batter, but the chocolate I could make really good shakes out of it! I also seen a lot more gains when adding this to my daily workout/cardio! Like it says on the tub you must consume you body weight/more in protein threw quality proteins spread out threw the day to gain maximum gains ha! I would definitely buy this/recommend it!
