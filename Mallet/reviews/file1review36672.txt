review/text: Irish Spring SPORT Deodorant Bath Bar welcomes you with an invigorating ""sporty"" fragrance that conjures up that same fresh and clean image you get when you shower up after a healthy athletic workout. And once you shower with it, you know that image is ""right on"" -- it provides a good long deodorant protection that lasts at least all day. The soap lathers well and leaves your skin feeling tingly fresh. A delightful showering experience!
