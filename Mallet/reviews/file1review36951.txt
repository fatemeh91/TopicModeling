review/text: I am 51 years old. I have been using these for years I cannot remember when I first started. Last year I went in for a checkup and had my teeth cleaned for the first time in close to 30 years. I asked the dental assistant who cleaned my teeth how long ago she thought that they were last cleaned and she said about a year and a half. When I told her when I had it done last she was amazed. I use these every morning and evening and during the day as a toothpick replacement. They are gentle to the gums.
