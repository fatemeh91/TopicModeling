review/text: This book-holder is the greatest for reading supine on the couch or in bed. When it's cold you can keep your arms under the blankets! The telescoping 3-piece balancing leg is quite flexible; the whole design is pretty clever. You put the flaps of the open book cover under stretchy bands that extend vertically on each side of the holder, and you slip the pages under skinny, nylon fishing-line-type cords that somehow are adequate for any number of pages. There are even horizontal "shelves" on the holder on which you set the book at the height you want. This is perfect for big readers. (I'm so glad I got this for myself.)
