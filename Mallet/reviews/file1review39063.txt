review/text: This thing is fantastic. It works every bit as well as the ones they use at the barbershop, best I can tell. It comes with a TON of attachments for every length and a few things I don't even know what they do.It's pretty durable, I've dropped mine now a few times. It has a nice hum when you turn it on. Don't really know what else to say. Very satisfied.
