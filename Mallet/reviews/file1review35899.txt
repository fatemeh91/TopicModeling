review/text: I have used this brand of Quercetin for years to control my allergies. It has always worked well. Perhaps the other reviewer didn't take enough? At times, when I am having a big attack, like when visiting a friend's house with cats, I can take 4 or 5 and within 20 minutes my symptoms subside. When I know I am going to be near allergens, I take 3-4 ahead of time, and am usually symptom free. I highly recommend it. But make sure you take enough to find the dose that works!!! Can't take too much, since it is water-soluble. So much better than OTC drugs.
