review/text: Is a good alternative to the Littmann brand stethoscope. I have used this product for just under a year and have had no problems with it and can hear things well. I also own one of their cardiac stethoscopes, have used it for over 10 years now, and also found it to be of high quality. I even returned it one time for the hose to be replaced (it was in a permanent U shape). This was done free of charge other than shipping. I recommend this brand.
