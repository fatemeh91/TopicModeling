review/text: Great product! It really helped to alleviate the pain I was having in my abs. The only problem is that at least some or all of the straps show. Especially when wearing scoop neck or v-neck shirts, but even with just regular shirts, the straps are there and its really annoying. Plus I could only find my size in white, which is even more noticeable.
