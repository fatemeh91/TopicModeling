review/text: I live in San Francisco, so I am lucky enough to have some wonderful natural foods and groceries stores in which to shop. for years, I have tried many, many natural deodorants. none of them worked, unfortunately- after about an hour, it was as if I had never applied deodorant. I used to use Aromacreme by Lush, which is a fantastic product- IF you don't develop a reaction to it, which I did. after reading the customer reviews on Amazon for this product, I decided to try it. I was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was. it has a nice, fresh scent- a bit citrus- that does not linger. nor is the formula sticky. to my delight, it keeps me nicely deodorized- all day long! after a week of use, I have developed no reaction to the product, and I have very sensitive skin. it is also concentrated, so I don't need to use as much as other natural deodorants. and the price point is very good compared to other natural deodorant products [believe me, I've spent quite a bit trying to find a good one.] I highly recommend this product, and will be purchasing it again.
