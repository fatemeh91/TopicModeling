review/text: I personally have problems with chemicals and waxing.My skin is far too sensitive and the results from those methods are nightmarish o_OThis was a last ditch effort and I'm so glad I did ^_^ it's the best!The first use may be a bit of a shock but repeated use proves to be easy with little irritation.I've even used it on my neck and face area with excellent results.Do not however think this is a cure all ... hair is very stubborn and will not disappear over night.The time I've saved is worth it, I only have to go over my problem areas once a week up to once a month.Now only the hair is gone and my skin is saved =D (no more embarrassing blotches or chemical burns)Thank You So Much!
