review/text: I enjoy working with the product and even use it myself at bedtime. It feels nice, not sticky or so oily you just want to run wash it off! It smells wonderful and I get even more relaxed while giving a massage with the lavender scent. My clients have all had positive feedback to me in regards to how it feels and smells - I have even been asked for the name so they could order some of their own.
