review/text: I've been using this lip balm since the 1990s. (It is called &#34;Karite Lips&#34; on the tube.) One winter, it was so cold that no other lip product I tried helped my chapped lips. My homeopathic doctor recommended this lip balm; it worked like a charm and I've been using it ever since. It goes on nice and smooth, not waxy. There is a slight vanilla scent, but it dissipates very quickly, so there is no annoying flavor lingering on the lips. Many lip balms have peppermint oil, which can actually irritate the lips, or other flavors, so it is hard to find a good unflavored one like Karite Lips. I use it every day, either by itself or under lipstick. I would recommend it to anyone.
