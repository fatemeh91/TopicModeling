review/text: actually i just got the shake today and mixed it right up in the blender cup. this tastes phenomenal compared to the whey drinks i've had in the past. strangely reminds me of mocha-coffee chocolate... can't figure it out, and you don't have to try. Tastes great, and that's probably gonna be enough to last me for at least the first month of two of a baby fat revolution i'm doing.
