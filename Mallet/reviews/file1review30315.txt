review/text: I couldn't find this product in local stores so purchased online. I did my homework and checked out many reviews and decided to go with this Black and Decker model. Its easy to use, clean and store. It picked up the very fine dust created by african grey parrot, as well as feathers.I also liked the feature that allows the unit to blow air. I use this to clean my air filtering units and to blow dust on fridge coils.
