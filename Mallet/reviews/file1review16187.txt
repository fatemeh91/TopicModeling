review/text: For 3 summers in a row, I worked as a camp counselor at a Girl Scout camp in East Texas. Kids would arrive each week by the busload. First, each child would be assigned to a cabin and a counselor and they would drop off their luggage and the next trip before luggage was opened or butts touched cots was to march to the Health Lodge for a lice check. We had to use a tongue-depressor while wearing rubber gloves to go through their hair, looking for nits (lice eggs).With over 300 girls arriving each week, at least every other week or so, we'd find a camper that had a nit or two - but due to the location, we could tell that it was an infestation that had already been battled and won - but just a few nits were overlooked. The tell-tale sign was tons 'o' nits - especially near the scalp at the base of the hair.About once or twice a summer we'd encounter some poor kid that had a third-world country infestation - nothing but nits... kinda like "nothing but net" - but well, so much for humor.We'd try contacting the parents, but usually they were already incognito and we had to treat the kids ourselves - always with Nix brand lice treatment and everytime, it worked. Nix kills the lice, but doesn't always kill the eggs - and the eggs are cemented onto the hair, so you have to use the nit comb to remove them. This one poor girl had hair like Louis XVI and we were up all night combing the kid's hair with the nit combs and bleaching her clothes and luggage. You've gotta use elbow grease to get out the nits - they're attached with a natural form of super glue, basically.Before they could sleep in the cabin with the other kids, they slept in the infirmary for 3 days as they were checked again - never a reinfestation, nor did any other kid (or counselor) get lice after a treatment with Nix.
