review/text: I kid you not, my cousin downs this stuff like there is no tomorrow and pretty much spends every waking hour in the gym. Results? He has spindly arms, a sunken chest, and narrow shoulders. If I had to compare his build to that of a celebrity that most matches him, I would say he is built like Don Knotts. He practically carries a bottle with the Whey protein shake everywhere he goes and when he is not at the gym, he has a dumbbell in his hand and is always pumping it. I have no idea why he is so scrawny, but I think it goes to show you that even this Whey protein isn't going to work miracles.Most of the reviews deal with whether or not this whey protein TASTES good. If that is your real concern, can I interest you in some Hershey's Milk Chocolate or Nestle Quick with that annoying rabbit?
