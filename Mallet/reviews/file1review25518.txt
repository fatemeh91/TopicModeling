review/text: I have purchased 3 of these, (1) a couple of years ago, (2) and (3) this last August, 2006.The last two were purchased because of the performance of (1). As of now, all 3 have failed because of a poor switch, which chooses to fail in the OFF position. This is all after testing with new batteries. The battery connection seems secure. All else works well when it works. The switches are the Achilles heel. $45.00 is enough of a test. I am going to try something else.
