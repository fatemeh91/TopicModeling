review/text: After having my third child I was readmitted to the hospital and was in septic shock. My heart and kidneys were very close to shutting down as I had a strep A infection in my blood. It took me 6 days in the hospital and 10 days after discharge on a regimen of three different antibiotics to clear the infection. My body was ravaged by child birth, the infection and the enormous amount of antibiotics. For 11 months after my discharge I had no energy and was unable to care for and do things with my children. It was a very depressing time for me as all I ever wanted to do was be a mom. After taking green vibrance a couple of times I felt like my old self and as I continued taking it I felt better than I have ever felt. I had energy and an enthusiasm for life!!! I still take green vibrance today and swear by it. Stop reading and order NOW!!! You won't regret it.
