review/text: I've been using this for about 2 years and I can say this works great. My arthritis is mild in my option but the pain in some joints was terrible when I started using this it has gone away virtually all together now some days when the weather changes or it's freezing outside it can still flair a little but nothing like before I started using triple flex. I recommend it without a doubt.
