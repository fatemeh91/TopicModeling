review/text: At first it seems daunting to take two capsules five times a day, but when you are fighting off a persistent bug making its rounds, you'll do anything. I forgot to schedule my time to take these vitamins, and had a day of being rundown. I'm not sure if the two are related as there were only 20 capsules in the sample and I don't have enough experience with the herbs. I did take the herbs consistently during the day of being sick, and must have just caught a bit of the bug, nothing severe, because by nighttime I was feeling better. Was it the elderberry and echinacea? iThey certainly didn't hurt the recovery.
