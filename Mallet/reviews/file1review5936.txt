review/text: I like the separate powder holder on the bottom of the shaker and the mixing ring works very well at breaking up any clumps, the removable ice packs are also a nice touch. But it is very easy to cross thread the cap and even when you get the cap on without cross threading it, the thing may leak all over you when you shake it. I bought six of these and I would say that I am disappointed with them mainly because of the leaking problem.
