review/text: Incredible close shave everytime. Contrary to these other reviews, I found the blades last a long time even with my thick daily beard. You need to understand, these blades are light and very thin, so no pressure is needed to shave. Just like driving an automatic car for the first time, you can't feel everything in the road, but no effort is needed for a smooth gentle ride. Been using this Fusion system for a few months now and my skin is clear from gentle smooth shaves. These replacement blades are a little more costly, shop around you can find deals. The Fusion razor is so worth it. Excellent razor!!!!
