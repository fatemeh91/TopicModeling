review/text: I have had a Braun shaver for more than 10 years. This current model is my 3rd and I love it. The replacement foil and cutterblock keeps me looking good with a close shave for months into the future! And the automatic cleaning keeps it sharp and lubricated for flawless operation! The best part is there is no shaving cream or endless disposable razors and blades to put into the enviroment!
