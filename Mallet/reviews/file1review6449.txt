review/text: Finally! As a therapist specializing in Sports and Deep Tissue massage, I am often asked by my clients "who works on you?" Sadly my answer has always been "no one". I haven't been able to find anyone with the skill level I insist on to perform body work on me.This tool allows me to get at the trigger points in my back, neck, shoulders and even my feet. It's still not as good as being able to just relax and have someone else do the work, but at least I can get the major knots out. I highly recommend this product for self-therapy.One word of caution though...If you're not careful, you can do more harm than good by getting over zealous. Moderation is the watchword here.
