review/text: It would be nice if this had a better battery life indicator, but for the price you can't really beat it. Just remember to charge it for an hour or so after each use and you shouldn't have to worry about it. If I recall correctly, the batteries should be discharged every 6 months to ensure longevity. Overall, great.
