review/text: First up, it's not as big as I expected and iv not had it long but it doesn't seem too durable, the slide in's are a little too short to hold an average pen and subsequently the Velcro flap doesnt close too well over the top.It may prove its worth but I think I'm going to end up getting something a little bigger and can hold a few pens trauma sheers alcowipes, pen light l, maybe a few meds etc.Bottom line: this will do the job but only just
