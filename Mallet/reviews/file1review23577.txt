review/text: This mirror is great to use for makeup although the lighting isnt bright enough. The magnification is great for plucking eyebrows! After using this mirror with the magnification, I noticed that my eyebrows were definitely nicer because I could see all the strays! The light will enhance makeup application if you have lighting that is already so-so. If you don't, you'll need an additional light source. Other than that, this is a great product.
