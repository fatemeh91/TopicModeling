review/text: I bought this particular brand and model of illuminated magnifier after researching them thoroughly. This one had good reviews and came with an extra lens (nice!)The packaging was somewhat flimsy, but the unit was undamaged.I set it up and Voila! No adjustments were necessary. There aren't any anyway.The lamp stays where it's positioned and is easy to move.This unit is well made and well finished.I haven't tried the 2nd (more powerful) lens yet, but the instructions make changing lenses seem easy.I am happy with this magnifier!
