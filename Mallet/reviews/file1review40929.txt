review/text: Unable to find EZO Denture liners, which I'd used for years, I tried these -- what a disaster! In public, hours later, I suddenly had trouble speaking because my mouth was full of sticky slime. I've tried several things since and have found a solution that works for me and is ridiculously cheap and easy. Tear off a hunk of regular kitchen waxed paper and fold it until you have a pad as thick as you need -- 4-8 thicknesses. If you use the natural width of the paper, you should get about 4 liners across. Lay your denture on the folded paper, draw around it and cut so that the front edge remains on an uncut fold. This gives it some stability. Fit it into the denture, bite down on it for a couple minutes and it fits even better than the flannel/wax EZO liners. I'm delighted with this, and see no reason why it shouldn't last as long as I do. It's not toxic, perfectly safe, and the wax molds to your mounth and denture. It's worth a try.
