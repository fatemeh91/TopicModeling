review/text: This is one super easy way to get some calcium & magnesium into a kid who can't stand those chalky creamy supplements! Does it help ADHD? Hm... Some kids maybe, but I can't say we see a huge difference with our wonder kid... I'm convinced that one can't expect much from supplements alone anyway... At least for ADHD. I'm just glad she's getting calcium & magnesium and it doesn't taste awful.
