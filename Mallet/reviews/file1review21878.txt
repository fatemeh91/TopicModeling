review/text: I ordered Quickables dry washcloths what i received was not the green bag of Quickables dry washcloths instead I received Attends dry washcloth in blue print. The package says "new name same product" so with that claim on the packaging i trusted it would be the same product and opened the package. However I am very disappointed that the product is totally not the same. The quality is so much cheaper and the washcloth are much thinner. It becomes so thin when i submerge it in water that its like using paper napkins. I ordered Quickables and the picture they have up is of quickables so I do not understand why they would send me a cheaper brand, this is totally misleading. I bought these for my newborn to use as baby wipes and expected the same quality as the Quckables washcloth as I have used previously. If they no longer have the Quickables washcloths then they should take their posting down and advertise the new brand. I guess this is their way of tricking customers into buying the cheaper brand. I am home taking care of my newborn and I don't think its fair to have to drag out my newborn in the cold to the post office for a return plus I already opened the item. The reason I ordered it online so I wouldn't have to go out with my newborn. I contacted the seller regarding this issue and see how they wanted to resolve this and they just IGNORED me!! I wanted to give them a chance before i write a negative review and they refused to take advantage of my kindness. This is really bad customer service!!! I would never buy this product or anything from them again!!
