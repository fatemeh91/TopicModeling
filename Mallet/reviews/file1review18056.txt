review/text: The only eye mask I can actually fall asleep while wearing. This mask is light as a feather, and unlike most masks it doesn't press down on your eyelids. I find it to be very comfortable, and it is very efficient at blocking out light completely. I have used this both while traveling and when sleeping in my bed, and it works great every time. It stays comfortably on my eyes throughout the night (no slipping or bunching). I can't even feel it on my face!Like all sleep masks, this one is not absolutely perfect. A tiny bit of light can sneak in through the gaps near your nose. However, this was never enough of a problem to wake me up or disturb my sleep in any way. For the excellent price, this is the best mask there is. I'll never try another one.
