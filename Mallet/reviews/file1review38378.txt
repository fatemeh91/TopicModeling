review/text: This is my second Emjoi product - bought this one b/c I thought my old one had stopped working, but it was just the cord that had worn out (I wasn't being very gentle when wrapping the cord). Definitely go with a corded model: don't have to worry about running out of juice. (I agree that this little round shape is a little harder to hold.)This is JUST LIKE getting your legs waxed in terms of prep & care for potential ingrowns but WAY cheaper! Like waxing, over the years your hair may gradually get more fine (mine did).It's particularly good for underarms - for decades I had the "nubby" look unless I had JUST shaved; now I am no longer paranoid about lifting up my arms.And even though they tell you not to in instructions, I've learned to VERY carefully use on my lower face - looks more natural to take out the long fine hairs (using at a slight angle) and leave the small, short ones (my opinion: a bald upper lip looks icky)HIGHLY recommended. Wish I knew about it when I was in my 20s.
