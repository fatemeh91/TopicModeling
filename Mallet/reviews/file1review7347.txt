review/text: My boyfriend bought me this foot spa as a present, I had read the reviews on-line and this one looked like the best choice. I have had other foot spas in the past and wanted one again. This spa does get very hot, though it takes a while to warm up so I definitely recommend starting with warm water. It is very large and will comfortably accommodate a large foot, but I have smaller feet so this really matter to me.I didn't give it a higher score because I was slightly disappointed with the jets, which are movable but are placed at the front of the spa. My past foot spas have and jets or at least some bubbles which massage the bottom of the foot. This one has plastic bumps with are only mildly helpful. If your looking for an amazing massage from a foot spa this isn't it. All in all its a good foot spa, but for the price you may find a better one out there.
