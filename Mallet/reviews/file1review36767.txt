review/text: I picked Alcon Opti-One up at a CVS Pharmacy and it is identical to CVS' own store brand "No Rub" Multi-Purpose Solution. CVS has two store brand solutions, which are split into green and blue "formulas," intended to compete side by side with two other competing brands, even though both CVS "forumlas" contain identical solution. Just marketing I guess. Interestingly, neither of the CVS brand solutions are positioned on the shelf to compete with Alcon Opti-One, but instead are put up against more expensive solutions.Alcon Opti-One contains the same solution as the two CVS branded bottles, and I believe they probably make the CVS solution. All three bottles share the same text and tables in the same places. Just the fonts, colors, and graphics are different. Ingredients, including concentrations, and the physical bottle are also the same. The only major difference is the Alcon bottle includes two trademarked names for the "Sodium Citrate" listed on all 3 bottles.The CVS brand cost 50 cents more per bottle than the Alcon Opti-One, in CVS' own store, oddly. I bought the Opti-One after comparing. Amazon did have a 3 pack of this solution that was a good value, but it seems to be unavailable now, and the price I am seeing for a single bottle is slightly higher than my local price, even before shipping.
