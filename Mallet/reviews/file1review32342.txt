review/text: I'm on my second tube of Biotene OralBlance Gel. I have used it for about 3 weeks. My problem is I have dry mouth, but only at night. For the past couple of years, I've had bad dental checkups resulting in high dental bills. My dental hygenist finally diagnosed the high cavity rate as likely caused by my nightly dry mouth problem. The Biotene OralBalance Gel works and lasts all night, but needs to be applied fairly heavy to do so. Since it only comes in a 1.5 oz tubes, a tube goes pretty fast, and it's expensive. I get about 10-12 days out of a tube. A tube costs $6 - $12 depending upon where you buy it (including shipping, tax etc.). I've read reviews about other products ONLINE and have ordered another product in an effort to get a cheaper solution to night time dry mouth. OraHealth Xylitol Time Release Dome Mints come in boxes of 60 tablets and get good reviews (like this product) ONLINE. Even if two tablets are needed per night, they turn out to be cheaper than the Biotene Oral balance Gel in 1.5 Oz tubes. I'll update this review when I see how those work.Update (08/20/09):I've now been using OraHealth Xylitol Time Release Dome Mints to control my nighttime dry mouth for about a month. I find them to be as effective as Biotene OraBalance Gel but at a savings of more than half when Biotene OralBalance is only available in 1.5 ounce tubes. This Biotene product needs to be packaged in a more economicle size.
