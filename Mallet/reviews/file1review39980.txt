review/text: I started taking this product in the middle of August 2011. At the first time that I took 1 capsule, I got really sick. My body started to get chilled, and I noticed that I was feeling dizzy and nauseac. I spent a day in a bed. I deceided that I wouldn't take it unless my symptons were very bad with my hypothyroid. Strangely enough, one day in early September, I was very chilled and depressed when I woke up. I had a feeling that this herb maght be a help to recover from the condition. I took one capsule. Then, I started to feel that my body temperature was getting higher although I usually have low temperature. 60% of my depression had gone after taking one capsule. After that, I took one or two in the morning every 2-3 days. Sometimes, I feel much more ill, and sometimes, I feel better - but never like when I was healthy before I had hypothyroid. I called Gaia for advice. I was told that this herb wouldn't work for me since I was Japanese born. According to her, Japanese already take a lot of seaweeds. I left Japan 26 years ago, and seldom have Japanese food. I cannot take this herb everyday in taking a risk of getting worse with my condition. It makes me sick in some points while I feel better in different points. It is not wholly and consistantly working. I am wondering which ingredient(s) is/are causing me sick. I miss my period this month, although it may have nothing to do with this product. I will take the rest of the capsules and will write a full review again. It is impossible and scary for me to take this capsule every day. Currently my stomach is hurting. Without stomach hurt, maca and bee pollon are firmly and steadly working for me better.
