review/text: Bottom line: If your main thing is cardio then this will help alot. This product will give you alot of energy but not the kind that keeps you jittery and your heart pounding. (well maybe the first time you take it as you have to adjust to the huge amounts of guarana and caffine) You will see a dramatic increase in your workout intensity. You will loose alot of water while on this product as it contains caffine and additional diuretics, so keep well hydrated.
