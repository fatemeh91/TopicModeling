review/text: This is the second time I've ordered this replacement head for my Braun 8585 electric razor. I had used a rotary razor in the past but it irritated my skin pretty bad not to mention razor burn from time to time. This replacement head and foil makes the 8585 work like it was new giving me a close shave in a short period of time and it's very easy to change the heads and foil. The company recomends changing them about evry 18 months and that seems to be about the time that the quality of my shave starts down-hill. Being disabled with little use of my hands this razor combination fits my needs better than anything else I've tried. I'll keep using them until the razor dies but even then I'll replace it with another foil razor.
