review/text: Product arrived within 5 days. I used this product with Fertili Tea and Pre-Seed. I have irregular cycles and a short luteal phase (8-10 days). Very late ovulation (ovulated on CD 26). We were ttc our first child for 6 months with no luck. Though it didn't regulate my cycle the very first month, it gave me my BFP!!!! I ordered a 2nd bottle but before I was even able to finish my first bottle, I had a smiley face on my HPT. Baby dust to you all.God bless...
