review/text: Unless I am misunderstanding something, the description is wrong. Each bottle that I have holds 1QT 1.8FL OZ, that is 1 quart + 1.8 ounces (or 1 liter). If a quart equals 32 FL OZ, then each bottle holds 33.8 FL OZ, not just 1.8 FL OZ. And the total for a pack of eight should be 270.4 FL OZ, not 14.4 ounces.
