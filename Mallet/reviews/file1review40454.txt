review/text: I've had this product for quite some time in my arsenal of lip balms and chapsticks. Can't quite remember where I first scored a tube. I'm always in the market for something good and effective. This lip balm does the trick and I have just placed an order for a second tube &lt;first one 75% gone>. The vanilla scent is subtle and fades a lil' while post-application. It provides great moisturizing properties to my full lips. Kissably soft for your guy ladies. KISSABLY soft (smooch)! There is a bit of sheen to it but it doesn't look or feel greasy -nor have I ever thought it to leave a waxy feel. Winter or summer, no matter, it's great for year round use. I hope my relationship with this product turns out to be lifelong. I say buy-it, try-it, you might &lt;should> like it.
