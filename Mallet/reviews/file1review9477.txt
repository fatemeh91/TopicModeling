review/text: The best one I've found ever! The only other is the shave creme from Em's place in Lincoln city , OR. Also, her minty menthol after shave can't be beat in my opinion. Also I have a badger brush that I use with the trufit creme because it whipps up nicely for multiple passes for those with coarser beards. Only an almond size dollop will due for a multi-pass badger brush wet shave.
