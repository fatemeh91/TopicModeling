review/text: I purchased these after having had my baby in an effort to avoid disposable nursing pads and reduce landfill waste--the only thing I really wasted was my money. I wore these in the day and in the night, and they didn't keep me or my clothing dry at all--and I'm not a heavy producer. They're bulky and uncomfortable under any bra. Another con is that you've got to wash them pretty much immediately to avoid that spoiled breast milk smell staining them for good.I wouldn't recommend this product.
