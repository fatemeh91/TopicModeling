I been using this product over 6 months and just now ordered 2 more bottles (yes writing review from phone).

I limp in pain my feet feel stiff my ankle joints I can hear my bone pop and yesterday after work had to crawl to bathroom. I have to go now so will be spraying more on after review.

I used two other pain relief such as mentholatum pain relief I popped pills and tried
