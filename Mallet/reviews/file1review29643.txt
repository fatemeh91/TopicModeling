review/text: I was unhappy with disposable nursing pads so I gave these a whirl. They are WAY too small, so any shifting at all renders them completely useless. I am a 38DD while nursing, so maybe these would work fine for smaller breasted women. I used them a few times at home then threw them in a drawer and haven't taken them out since. Too bad, because they absorbed pretty well the 10% of the time they stayed in place.
