review/text: I chose this product from one of three recommended by my optometrist and was using it for a month before going to see an ophthalmologist. Upon hearing that I had been using this product he said,&#34;Good choice.&#34; Hopefully further evidence that it was a good choice will come in 3 months when I go back to the ophthalmologist for a follow-up exam. It was the optometrist who diagnosed the onset of dry macular degeneration in both of my eyes, and confirmed in the follow up with the ophthalmologist.
