review/text: I tried Capisette based on the write up given by Progressive and have been using it for several years. It is very effective for me. My cardiologist and dermatologists are impressed and I have avoided edema problems. The proof came when I ran out for a week and swelling increased. When I started Capisette again, the edema swelling went down. I'm very happy with the product.Jack ChamblesTucker, GA
