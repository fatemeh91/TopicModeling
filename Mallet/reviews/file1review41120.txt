review/text: I give this gum four stars for a few reasons. First off, if the gum gets a little bit cold they are hard as rocks. Even when at room temp they are kind of hard. One is definitely too small for myself, and others that have tried them, so two is the norm now... not really a negative, just an observation And another reason is I turn the tin over to get a piece or two of gum, and most are cracked or the corners broken... not a big deal, but when the little crumbs get all over your car or desk, it's annoying.The gum itself tastes great, is sugar free, the taste will last (in my opinion) about the same as or more than Orbit... and the bonus is that it contains caffeine. I'm not trying to be too negative here, the tin is cool, the gum is made in the US by a smaller company and I will definitely buy again and I do highly recommend this product.
