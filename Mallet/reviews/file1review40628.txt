review/text: I have been using this for about a year + and never had a problem. I always rises off or soak hard stuff before putting into the dishwasher. Never had bubbles over flow, your then just using too much, never have had residue build-up, most of my plates are black so it would show up.I have a fairly new dishwasher with 3 different high pressure sprayers and heats the water very hot, even on the standard wash cycle. I also have hard water and any spots, mostly on cups is from the hard water.This stuff works, it is green, not tested on animals and septic tank safe (I have a septic system).
