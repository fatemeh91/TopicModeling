review/text: Where do I start? The three modes of speed for the two functions are a wonderful option. I've went from low to high (staying in the high zone very briefly) and was exceptionally satisfied. This is my first rabbit (but not my first vibrator by far) and had heard so much about them over the years, found this one for around $25.00. I like the girth size and length of the rotating part, the vibrating part works rather well for me. It's going on a couple of weeks, so I can vouch for that amount of time at least for durability. I love that it's waterproof, relatively quiet and easy to clean. The material it's covered with works with my sensitive skin. I think it's a great investment, buck for buck!
