review/text: I use these for general tweezer needs and find them to be excellent. I haven't yet needed them for a splinter or ingrown hair, but have no doubt that these will work just as well for their actual intended use. I can't believe I suffered along all my life with the clumsy tweezers available in drug stores: which are like using salad tongs for tweezer needs, compared to these. Just be careful re: the sharp points on these.
