review/text: After the first day i could tell a big difference in my recovery. I have been taking this while doing p90 for 2 weeks and feel like it has speed up my metabolism. The taste is great. It taste just like the powdered hot chocolate mix. I drink one in the morning with milk and one post workout with water. There are other brands i have tried and they all have a medicine taste this product does not at all. it cost a little more than other brands but the taste is well worth it.
