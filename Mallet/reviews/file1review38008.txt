review/text: I am an EMT with almost 15 years of CPR and CPR Instructor teaching experience with the American Red Cross. I am also on the advisory board for the AED Instructor Foundation [...], a national non-profit group that works with AED manufacturers to help get these devices where they otherwise have no access and to ensure proper training.The AED is a great device. However, it is only as good as the training you need to receive as a user. CPR is what is going to keep oxygen in the person's system and circulating it while someone goes to get the AED or in a worst case scenario, the rhythm is a non-shockable one. CPR is not a difficult skill but it definitely is not one to learn while you are in the middle of an emergency situation, especially on a loved one.Please, take CPR training from an accredited CPR course, one where you receive hands on training, not just a video driven course.What a wonderful holiday gift! The gift of life! Many organization's such as the American Red Cross or American Heart Association (to name a few) offer gift certificates for classes and many organizations even have courses for children. Yes, children can learn this too! Many times it is a child who saves a life!Even if you don't buy an AED it is important to know CPR because these devices can be found almost anywhere now, shopping malls, theaters, health clubs, and all federal government buildings, airports and all airplanes, and schools.Give the gift of life...learn CPR!
