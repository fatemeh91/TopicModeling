review/text: My wife used these when she was pregnant with our first son, and continues to take them postpartum. These were the only vitamins that did not upset her stomach. Her midwife had never heard of them but was impressed with the ingredients. Overall, a great product and I now but Rainbow Light vitamins for myself.
