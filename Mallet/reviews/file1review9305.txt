review/text: WHAT I LOVE: It doesn't matter what day you start your meds on - you can move these little containers around to create the week you want, with the day you want to start with. This has helped me titrate into many different medications (you know the kind...1/2 a pill the first week, 1 pill the 2nd, etc). For this reason, it's great! And if you just don't have time to take your pills in the morning or if you're going on a business trip for 1 or 2+ days, you can just take the whatever containers you need (instead of the WHOLE thing). So, that's also awesome.WHAT I FOUND DISAPPOINTING: I really hoped that the am/pm sections would open separately but they don't. One lid opens up to 2 sections: am/pm. It's workable but adding 2 separate lids would be a GREAT enhancement! Also, the containers are WAY bigger than I'd expected. If you have a ton of pills to take, this is great news but if not...try for something smaller.
