review/text: When I began taking this I was way over weight n I had a normal workout routine,i was getting frustrated a bit cause I was feeling drained n not in the mood to complete my weekly workouts,so I started looking for some kind of booster n something that would benefit my health so I came across this b product n so far I have came a long way,i have great energy during and after workouts n my body doesn't feel stressed anymore.i feel the drive to get it done,now I do take other supplements as well but this helped dramatically.I've lost 48lbs in 9 weeks and I'm continuing to strive for more, doesn't taste bad at all taking consideration that I have taken other greens in the past but this is the best.....try it, its awesome, by the way this is the first review I have ever took the time to complete...eric g texas
