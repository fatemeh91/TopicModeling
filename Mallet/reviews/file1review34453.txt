review/text: After the birth of our second child, my wife began to notice some discomfort when we would "fool around". After looking up the best of the best and reading the reviews, I decided to get this. It lasts a long time without getting sticky and it doesn't feel like there is a barrier. Also, it seems to clean up nicely after use. We are extremely happy and will continue to purchase this product as needed.
