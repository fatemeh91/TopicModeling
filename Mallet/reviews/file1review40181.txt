review/text: I've been using this toothpaste for about 5 years now. I began to use it because Consumer Reports said that it was actually the one whitening toothpaste that worked. In that case, I guess I should give it a higher rating, although I'm not sure my teeth are any whiter. With whitening pastes there is a price to pay in that they tend to be abrasive and wear down the enamal, and I believe that is my problem. I am now making the connection that since using this product, I have been to dentists (general, endontists and periodontists) more times than I can remember for broken teeth, root canals, root extracts and crown restorations. I have spent a fortune! I am going to stop using this product immediately and switch to something that is better for enamel strengthening.
