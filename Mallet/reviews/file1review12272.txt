review/text: I tried at least 3 different brands of Prenatals before settling on this one. One of the ones I tried smelled really bad, and it just did not sit well in my tummy. The second was really expensive, and the 3rd one was the same as the first one.This one does not smell bad, I haven't had any bad tummy experience with it (have been taking it for ~ a month). It is still big but all prenatals are. The price is great as well! Will order again.
