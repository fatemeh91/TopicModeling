review/text: I found that this product mixes very well with water. It dissolves very easily and it is quite tasty. Mint- Chocolate was a nice rich flavor.As for the actual quality of protein etc., I am a novice, but the results were as good as could be expected for a novice lifter. I will be purchasing this product again once I run out.
