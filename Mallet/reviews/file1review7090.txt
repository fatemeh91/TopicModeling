review/text: This is not my first Wahl Shaver and it won't be my last. I shave everyday and these shavers run and run and run. I get a close shave and my wife really does not want me using anything else. I am not about to use a more expensive shaver when I get great results with the Wahl. I highly recommend this cordless shaver.
