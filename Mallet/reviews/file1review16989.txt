review/text: But I don't. I was using a real cheapie in the past and it worked fine but I thought I needed an upgrade. You know, the holy grail. Now my goatee is uneven and I've tried every 'method' to use this thing. Also, I don't like shaving so I use it without the attachment to look halfway presentable. This also does a worse job than the cheap one. I just don't like standing in front of a mirror till I get cramps trying to make this thing work. I feel like I traded a 2012 Ford for a Yugo.It does look pretty cool but now I don't.Maybe I'll hit the flea market this weekend and find something that works. Remington will probably have a booth trying to hock their inventory of this loser.
