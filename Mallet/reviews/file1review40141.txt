I've read reviews before buying this product and I found that the smell of the product might be an issue, but I think the smell isn't bad at all. It's definitely no issue for me. Everything seems to be made with great quality. I haven't tried it out but I can already tell that it is definitely a good investment. I am happy with everything about this product. I have no bad comments.
