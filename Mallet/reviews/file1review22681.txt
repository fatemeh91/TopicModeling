review/text: The search for the item, to delivery, was smooth and pleasant. I was able to track the item as it traveled and received it on the day promised. It is of good quality but, sad to say, it would not fit on the bathtub facet where I needed to put it. So, it is of no use to me. I am not sure if a nozzle "size" was indicated on the shipped item, before purchase. At any rate, my experience with shopping at Amazon.com was easy and speedy.
