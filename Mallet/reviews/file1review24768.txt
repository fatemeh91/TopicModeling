review/text: This product is amazing, easily my favorite wet-shaving soap. I take this, rub it all over my wet face, then take a damp brush to it and let the lather explode. It has a spicy smell, very much like pepper but much better, like a peppery-scented natural plant one might happen upon in the wildest of wildernesses. The lack of a proper soap dispenser (like a deodorant stick) is a little disconcerting, but that doesn't mean anything in comparison with the soap's performance. It is $6 with prime shipping. Please make a great decision and try this natural ingredient shave soap today. There is a reason it has been around for more than fifty years.
