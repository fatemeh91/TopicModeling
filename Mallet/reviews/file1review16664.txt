review/text: This is probably the most "basic" Zippo lighter you can get...just simple chrome, no logos or designs or matte finish. But thats what I wanted. Quality seems really good thus far, and so far no complaints. Definately would recommend this if your looking for a simple lighter that will last a long time.I dont know why there are some negative reviews about the "finish". The "street chrome" is supposed to have all those tiny scratches. And also a note, they do not come pre-filled.
