review/text: These pills made me so nuseas I couldn' even eat. I thought it was my pregnancy symptoms but as soon as I stopped taking the pills I noticed a 90% difference, I was able to eat and woke up feeling better. I am usuallly good with vitamins since I have taken them even prior to being PG but I guess the iron may be too harsh on my tummy.
