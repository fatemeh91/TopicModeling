review/text: WOW! Let me give you a brief history first. I have PCOS and never had a regular cycle. I would get my period for a few months straight and then it stops again for some months; in the past 4 years it stopped all together. No period=No Ovulation=No baby. We tried clomid and IUI=Fail. Eventually we did IVF and got pregnant, then no period again. Long story short, after a few losses due to other reasons I decided to take a break and focus on getting healthy. I found Fertilaid and purchased it with the intention of just using it to get my period, after the first bottle I felt sick, left work, came home, took a test, and PREGNANT!!!! After that pregnancy, I got back on fertilaid again, it regulated my period and I just found out I am pregnant this morning. Now, we don't have male issues as fer as fertility is concerned but I order the men's fertilaid for my husband too.I had a friend that was diagnosed with PCOS also just a couple of months back and I told her to try fertilaid to regulate her cycle before going to Rx drugs she did and she also has great results.The website says it can take up to three months to work, for me and for my friend, it took just one bottle. Good luck!
