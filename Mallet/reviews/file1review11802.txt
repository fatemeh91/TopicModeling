review/text: I love this protein powder! I follow a low-carb lifestyle and the one thing I missed that was hard to replicate was a good banana milkshake. No more! I use 2 scoops of this powder, 1/4 cup each water and heavy cream, 1 teaspoon Thicken Thin Not/Starch, and 7 ice cubes and blend til smooth and creamy and dreamy. For an extra treat, add a tablespoon of organic freshly-ground peanut butter, OR cocoa powder - or both!
