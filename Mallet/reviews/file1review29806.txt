review/text: I bought this product on the recommendation of a colleague and all of the wonderful reviews, and it didn't disappoint. We used it last night for the first time with the eucalyptus pad that come with the unit. Absolutely wonderful scent but not too overpowering. I am anxious to try it with the vicks pads as well.
