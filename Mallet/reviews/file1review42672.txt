review/text: I'm using these batteries with 2400mAh batteries made by Sony. Those last longer than these. I use primarily them in my Garmin GPSmap 60Csx navigator. They last about 20 hours without backlight. With 2400mAh batteries, in same use, it last about 18 hours.I'm giving 4 stars, because I'm not sure about its life cycle.
