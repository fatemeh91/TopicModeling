review/text: I will never buy duracell NiMH again. I bought a 4-pack awhile back and only 2 of them seems to even hold a charge. I thought maybe I had a few bad batteries so I decided to buy another 8-pack duracell NiMH, and again these batteries do not seem to hold a good charge. I even have one battery reading bad when I charge it with my Ansmann Energy 16, and the other 7 was low on charge. I decided to only go with Sanyo Eneloop now, Eneloop version 2 is coming out in Japan on Nov. 19, 2009.
