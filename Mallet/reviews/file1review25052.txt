review/text: I believe this is too short to review this item, it worked well from the start, it charged from one day to the next and the battery light on the alarm went off, so it's working fine, question is how much it's going to last, its being two months now and It's working perfectly, I do expect at least five years of service my previous battery lasted for six and a half, this should last at least five then I will maintain my five star review.Regards
