review/text: I ordered these when I was starting to hope that I was pregnant and just couldn't wait to find out! I tested on the day I was due to have my period and got a positive result! 3 actually! I wanted to make sure I wasn't seeing things! This is a great product at a great price. It's pretty self-explanatory what to do in the way of directions, but my only problem with the product was that there were no directions sent with it, you had to look online to get the directions.
