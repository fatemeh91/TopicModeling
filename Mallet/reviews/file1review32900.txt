review/text: I have used this product as part of a several cleanses so far, previously only at night but this week have been using it in the morning also a few times.It says to steep 10-15 minutes. If I steep it any longer than 10 minutes I get some pretty bad cramps that wake me up a few times about 6 hours after drinking it and last about an hour (as well as make me need to visit the bathroom). In the morning it seems to take about 4 hours for it to work, probably because I'm up and moving around.It doesn't taste too bad at all and is naturally sweet. I tried the chocolate and thought that was pretty disgusting. I would definitely suggest brewing it for even shorter times the first few times you use it because if you are going to be affected by cramping is different for everybody and I remember the first time I brewed it and let it go 15 minutes I thought I was going to die!Also honestly it makes you very gassy when you go to the bathroom - maybe it's just because on my cleanse I am not eating solid food so there's not anything for it to push out except teeny bits of lemon but this is good to know if you have a thin walled bathroom and don't want your spouse or coworkers to hear what's going on.It IS very effective but really read the directions that it's not meant for long term use as it can cause a lot of problems, potassium deficiency, and your colon will get weak & have issues contracting normally when not being stimulated with senna.
