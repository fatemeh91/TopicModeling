review/text: It is extremely hard for me to put on weight I have an extremely fast metabolism, I eat in my lunch at work and about 20 minutes after I have to go. TMI, but thats how extreme It is. Anyway this stuff helps me a lot and its delicious I take two scoops at night before bed with cold milk, its the best shake ever. At first it was kinda hard getting used to the taste, but after a hard working out session this is what your muscles are starving for. Highly recommend this stuff. And it is cheaper than at GNc. It is not magic though, I work out 4 or 5 times a week and do heavy lifting and I am starting to see results, if you are a hard gainer like me this will greatly help along with a good diet and lifting sessions.
