review/text: Overall, I was okay with the Daisy Plus Razors. They give you a very smooth shave, but if you're too fast, you get very bloody. I went on one leg slow, and with the other, which I had to hurry on, I went somewhat fast and got several deep cuts. These razors are good though, if you have time and want a good shave.
