review/text: I just recieved my new Bissel Sturdy Sweeper and it works GREAT!! I don't know why there are negative reviews especially about handle separation. I inserted the 3 sections together per the enclosed instructions and, (with application of some good ol' elbow grease), banging the assembled sections on my hard kitchen floor the fit was good and TIGHT! Maybe those "limp-wristed" weaklings need a He-Man around to apply some reasonable force at this juncture of the assembly, I don't know. As far as the negative reports about it's pick-up power especially pet hair, again no problem here. I have 6 cats and so there's a goodly amount of fur about. Well, both my maid and I marveled at all the hair that had been cleaned from my CARPET when the cannister was emptied. So all you nay-sayers out there, HUSH UP!
