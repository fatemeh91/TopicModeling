review/text: Well, I have been fooled a few times by reviews on Amazon and this happened to be another. The reviews mention a good citrus scent, good cleaning and hydrating power with an economical price. Upon getting the bottle, I opened it up to try the stuff and was unpleasantly surprised. First off, the citrus smell is more a floral vomit citrus smell. I decided to push through it but five days later I found that the smell went from that to a very rancid version of it. I could not believe it, how could this go from bad to worse? Well, it did . Stay away!
