review/text: This is much better than ordinary wood, bamboo or plastic tooth picks that are too thick. These tooth brushes not only do the job of getting rid of food debris between your teeth, but they will not be pushing your teeth further apart and create more gaps for food debris to be caught. Excellent product.
