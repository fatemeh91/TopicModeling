review/text: I love this! I initially bought it because I am pregnant and wanted to be able to hear my daughters heartbeat once I got around 20ish weeks pregnant. As long as she cooperates, it works great and I get to hear her movements, kicks, and heartbeat. It works great just for a regular heartbeat as well!
