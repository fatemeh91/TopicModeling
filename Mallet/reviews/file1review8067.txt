review/text: I love all of Oxo products and this little dish scrubber does not disappoint. It is really sturdy and holds the dish soap in without it leaking. It looks much nicer than a sponge or long dish brush and holds up really well. It also fits really well in your hand and feels comfortable while you are using it. I have been using it for over 6 months now and it is still in great shape, would highly recommend!
