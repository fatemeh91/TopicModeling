review/text: I ordered this clipper from another vendor, had to send it back as it does not cut anywhere close to the listing's claims of:"blade adjusts from Size 000 (1/100 inch)" instead it will cut at a minimum of 1/25 inch and that only on vertical hairs. Any hairs that do not stand up are cut at closer to 1/8 inch.Compared to a Philips Norelco T980 the stubble is from twice as long on standing hair to four times as long on hair laying flat.Aside from not cutting close enough for my needs I found for general hair clipping the gyroscopic forces from the motor were quite strong and the cord rather stiff.
