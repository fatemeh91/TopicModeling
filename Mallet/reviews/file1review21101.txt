review/text: Purchased at the recommendation of physical therapist. Waking in the middle of the night with leg cramps and lower back pain, this product works well. Amazed that it feels like wet heat without needing to add water. I appreciate having to hold the switch to get heat and the fact, when I fall asleep, that it turns off when my hand relaxes. Definitely recommend.
