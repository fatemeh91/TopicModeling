review/text: Hey, not a lot to say about this product other than it smells like original Old Spice. A friend comments that that means "smells like your old uncle." Well, I'm the uncle of 16 kids, so I guess I qualify! Oddly enough, it is hard to get this original scent at Walgreens and similar stores. All the "old Spice" smells like something else. Go figure....
