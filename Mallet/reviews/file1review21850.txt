review/text: I absolutely can't stand swallowing any sort of pill--or at least anything larger than a Pepcid, unless it has a smooth coating, such as Advil. So you might understand that I was thrilled when I first popped one of these in my mouth and thought, "Wow! This tastes just like Starbursts!" That only lasted for about three seconds, at which point the chewy globule lost any semblance of flavor except for one reminiscent of a gag-inducing chalkiness and became so sticky, I thought it was going to pull my teeth out. So my search for a candy-like calcium supplement continues. In the meantime, I'll stick to drinking milk and reward myself with Starbursts.
