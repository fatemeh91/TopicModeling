review/text: I was originally surprised when I poured my first sample of this product; it was a thick syrup. I personally found that mixing it with a few ounces of water (3 to 1 ratio) was the best way to go. It tastes like a tart cherry juice; very palatable. I typically drink two servings a day. I find it a great replacement to Whey Protein Shakes.
