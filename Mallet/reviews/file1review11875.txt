review/text: I bought this product for a lady that had a stroke and had swallowing problems. She had a stomach tube and I used it to keep her alive and build up her health. Other products were not giving her enough calories and protein. She was even having problem with a bad sore on her ankle on her paralyzed side and her little toe was showing signs of turning black around the tips. I did feed this product through a stomach tube and sometimes thinned it just a bit with some water as it is thick. 4 cans a day started her on the road back to better health. In two weeks she showed better color, gained weight and seemed more aware of her environment. Her toe actually got better. Some dark skin sloughed off and pink skin showed up underneath. Her sore seemed to heal better. One doctor actually suggested amputating the bad leg as she was not using it anyway. But medication from the local burn center and the nutrition of two cal enabled her would to finally heal and the circulation was much better in the leg. This product can be taken by mouth but is not really that tasteful. But it sure does help put and keep weight on if a patient cannot eat regular food. It sustained my friend for almost a year until she was able to eat again. I cannot say enough about it. It is a miracle food for someone who needs it.
