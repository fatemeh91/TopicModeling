review/text: I wish I had stock in this company, I've bought so much of this deodorant. It works so very well and is one of two I'm allowed to buy my husband. Old Spice is the other. This doesn't break out his skin and cause rashes (even Dove causes rashes!) but also keeps him dry and fresh smelling all day. It's a fantastic product and well worth every penny. It lasts and lasts and is a great buy as well. Great product.
