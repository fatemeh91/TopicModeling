review/text: I used this and bought 2 of them. The first one broke right out of the box. The other one was doing well until yesterday. It kept going off all day long every minute or so. I finally had to take the batteries out to shut it up. I called the manufacturer and they will send me a refund. I threw out the shower cleaner and kept the liquid refills. I figure I can still use them by squirting it onto a sponge or something. If I were you I wouldn't waste your money on buying this thing.
