review/text: I did not see any men writing on here so i thought I would write somthing..I just recieved it for christmas asked for this product i was desprite because I have hair on my back shoulders and arms. I have thick hair but wanted to take it off with out shaving and having it grow back thicker. I could not wait to use it. This product says for women so because I have thick hair did not know if it would work I tried it and i was happy with the outcome took all hair off it hurt but its worth it. I love this product and recomend it for men also.
