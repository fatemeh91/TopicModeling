review/text: I have been using Benefiber for four years now...on the recommendation of my physician. As an older citizen, I had the need to have some help with regularity. I have never used anything else because I love this so much. My favorite is the orange, but the other flavors in the individual packets are delicious also, and very convenient to keep in your purse when you are away or traveling. This stuff works! I have my family using it, my dentist, everyone that needs this type of product I get them on it. A few have tried Metamucil, but there is no comparison. I will never stop using it! Never! And by the way. Today is my birthday! I am 74! Nancy Leonard
