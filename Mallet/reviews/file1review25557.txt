review/text: I purchased this item a couple months ago, and it works perfectly! I have yet to experience any painful pulls or nics! I would reccomend changing the battery if you ever did. The size is small enough to be able to see at the same time. The unit does not feel "hot" as other models do, even after several minutes of continued use. I would reccomend this to all of my furry friends. Wonderful product at a good price! 5/5!
