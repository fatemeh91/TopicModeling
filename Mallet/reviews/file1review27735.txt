review/text: I've been using O.N. Products for years. As for this one, I've been using after taking a break from lifting for a while. Starting this a few weeks ago, I've managed to pick my strength back up and see immediate gains in lifting. I only take 1 scoop in the morning in a shake, and that's it. Many people stack the protein throughout the day as suggested on the container, which shouldn't be done. This stuff works well, and is more efficient if you don't take it multiple times a day, reason being your kidneys can only process so much protein at once and the waste just builds up and can destroy your organs. Just be smart about using it. There aren't enough disclaimers out there about supplements.As far as this protein, the flavor is great, the size is affordable, and this stuff helps your body recover and grow mass, while still cutting you. It i definitely one of the leaner proteins out there.
