review/text: I love this vitamin.. i go to an alternative medicine doctor and when i tell you he is the best he is the best. He just looks at you and takes your pulse and can tell you what is wrong with you.. He is in his seventies.. doesn't look a day over thirty five. he travels the world studying alternative medicine from cultures all over the world. he has an M.D Phd. and about 15 other titles behind his name so i trust him more than i trust my doctor. he was the one to turn me to this particular brand of multivitamins. he says it is the highest quality ingredients that have the maximum absorbtion you can buy on the market at a reasonable price. it's an awesome product and i wouldn't buy anything else. just after about a week of regular use makes you feel more energized. i love this product.
