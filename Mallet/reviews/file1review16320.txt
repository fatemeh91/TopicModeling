review/text: Quantum Finish makes great dishwasher detergent tabs. I've been using them for a long time and while I've found other brands that work as well (e.g. Miele), Quantum Finish costs less every time. There are few differences between these orange-scented ones and the regulars. Personally, I couldn't detect an orange scent at all but I do prefer the original Quantum Finish tabs because of how they're packaged. These come in individually wrapped packets in a box. Many of them shipped to me already broken. While not the end of the world, the old packaging had two advantages: I didn't have to unwrap additional plastic just to use a tab (which is also wasteful) and the old packaging never caused any breakage (in my experience). I don't know if they're changing the packaging all-around, but I hope they go back to the old way. While individually-wrapped tabs are definitely easier to store, that small advantage isn't worth the problems the new packaging introduced.Bottom line: same great products, can't smell the orange at all, new packaging is one step forward and two steps back.
