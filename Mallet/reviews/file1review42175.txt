review/text: I ordered this because from reading it , I thought it was a didderent kind of Creatine....when it says Maximize energy plus on the picture the bottle was white, when I recieved it in the mail it was the natural blue bottle of creatine capsules......I havn't opened it yet, I think I'm gonna return it and get my money back and buy it from the store, a waste of shippling and handling
