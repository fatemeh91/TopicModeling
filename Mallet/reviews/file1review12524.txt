review/text: I've suffered from constipation for several years, even gone 3 weeks before with no bowel movement at all! and after trying pretty much everything ( Colonix, Natures Secret Super Cleanse, Fiber formulas, colon hydrotherapy, cascara, senna, aloe lax, Natural Calm etc. etc.) this is the product that is helping me the most. I don't get any more cramping or other discomfort than I did with senna or cascara, and every day I get rid of a little more than the previous b.m. My situation was caused by cassein and gluten intolerance, which I just recently discovered. Also tension is a culprit, massage can help. And my toxicity headaches went away after replacing my old silver fillings in my teeth. There is a significant amount of mercury in those. There's my experiences with this abdominal curse, hope it helps someone!
