review/text: Although I'm of the female persuasion, I do feel that this herbal remedy has done a superlative job of protecting my circulatory and glandular systems much better than the competition's (NSP) similar formula, upon which I had relied for many years. The plant-derived vegetarian capsule has more milligrams of the herbal blend per capsule, thus promoting a stronger response per dosage, and all for a lower price per unit. All in all, I'm very pleased to change my allegiance over to the 'Christopher's Original Formulas' camp.
