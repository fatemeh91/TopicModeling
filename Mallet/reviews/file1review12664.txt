review/text: I have used theChild Life Colostrum With Probiotics 50 Grams Powderand theGarden of Life Raw Probiotics, Kids, 3.4-Ounceand here is my opinion on each:Child Life:Pros - The serving size for my kid is smaller in this brand than the Garden of Life, so each bottle lasts longer before needing to be ordered again. Probably makes each serving a little cheaper.- The flavor is very mild and my child doesn't mind it at all. I mix this in with other liquid vitamins and he doesn't make any discernment between this one or the otherCon - My biggest problem with Child Life's is that it does not dissolve or mix into his drink at all. After he drinks the whole sippy there are still little globs everywhere on the inside of the cup. No amount of shaking seems to get it mixed in. I keep adding his water for the rest of the day so that eventually he gets it all.Garden Of Life:Pros - It is raw. Raw vitamins and probiotics are going to be better for you than non-raw, in my opinion.- The flavor is not offensive and my child does not mind it or discern it from the Child Life.- It dissolves and mixes in easily. The first glass of vitamin juice and it's gone.Con - The serving size is a little larger than Child Life and I think it might be a little more expensive per serving but I don't mind.Overall I prefer the Garden of Life and will be buy that one again once the Child Life runs out.
