review/text: My periodontist recommended I purchase a power toothbrush to really keep my teeth and gums clean. I purchased this one because I liked the 30 second timer feature. This is great for switching to each area of your mouth so you brush all your teeth equally well. I have been really happy with the toothbrush so far. It has removed all the plaque build up and kept it off. In the past, I have had to scrape it off with one of those dental picks almost 3 days after a dentist visit. I do have to charge it more often than I thought I would, about every week and a half, but I leave it off of the charger until the battery is empty. I heard this was recommended to keep up the battery life. I gave it 5 stars though because it was not enough to lower my opinion of the toothbrush. I highly recommend this toothbrush. It has done wonders for my teeth.
