review/text: I've just started taking my second bottle of fertilaid. I haven't noticed a change in anything yet. So I'm not sure if it's working or not. My husband and I had been ttc for a couple of months before I started taking FA. I'm going to give it 6 months total to see if anything happens. Congrats to those of you who have had luck with it, and good luck to those of you who are still trying.
