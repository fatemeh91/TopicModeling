review/text: Have been taking Eye Caps for a couple of years now. Then I was diagnosed with the early stages of Macular Degeneratioin. Every thing going fine, but, in the last six months, changes started to occur. My regular Optomologist refered me to a Retina specialist. The Retina specialist STRONGLY recommended Bausch & Lomb's PreserVision! He diagnosed me with dry Mac in my left eye and wet in my right eye. This is, indeed, a potent vitamin, designed specificially for the eyes. Have only been taking this for three weeks now, too early to see any benefits. From what I am reading, other respondents here are saying it will take at least a month, if not more, to see positive results!! Hey, I'm a patient guy, I'll wait!! LOLMust say, Amazon beats everyone on the price just about every time. In a large city, the 120 count bottle cost me $32.00 from Walmart. Here you are getting 30 more pills for appx $7 or so less than what the 120 cost me!! What a bargain!! Now if only I could figure out a way to qualify for their free shipping!! LOLHope this helps you!! Wish you and yours good health!! :)
