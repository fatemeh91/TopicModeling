review/text: I have been buying this brand of sugar-free DGL for a long time. I am extremely disappointed that they have recently changed the formula so that these tablets are now sickening sweet and leave an aftertaste similar to that of regular table sugar. To be clear, the principal ingredient, deglycyrrhizinated licorice, is the same. But they have added sorbitol, anise seed powder, and stearic acid to "other ingredients." It is sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, that adds the hypersweet taste. I'm looking for another brand and am returning this order.
