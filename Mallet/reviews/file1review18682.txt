review/text: The HandiRail Bed Assist RailAfter a 16-day stay in the hospital, my 93-year-old mother-in-law came to live with us. Our spare bedroom has a king size bed. Being so weak from her hospital stay, it was difficult to help her lay down on the bed and then move over from the edge of the bed.I searched the Internet most of that night trying to select a bedrail that I thought would work (1) to help her get into bed and to hold to move herself over in the bed (2) to keep her from falling out of the bed.Finally I narrowed it down to two. I kept going back and forth looking at the pictures. The difference I kept seeing was this bedrail had legs that extended to the floor; that would have to make it sturdier than the other one.I chose The HandiRail Bed Assist Rail and am I ever glad I did! It has been a lifesaver. A full bed rail would never have worked. The size and sturdiness of this rail is perfect.This is certainly the one to choose if you need one!
