review/text: I have used this product off and on over the years and highly recommend it. This product complements any of the Thieves toothpaste products. I do find it rather strong so I dilute it with water and find it very effective at half strength. I have used this product as a base for making a larger container of mouthwash by adding water and extra essential oils such as peppermint, lemon and clove. I used this alone with my toothbrush and baking soda and found it very effective.
