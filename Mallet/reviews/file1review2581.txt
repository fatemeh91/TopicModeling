review/text: Everyone has raved about this product however, when I inserted 3 brand new batteries in and adjusted the intensity up, it BARLEY moved at all and the rabbit ears might just as well been non-exsistent. When the product was inserted it stopped ALL together, nothing, nada, zilch!!!I am LIVID that I just threw away 50.00 on something that does not work and cannot be returned and certainely wont be replaced.What a rip off.Perhaps this certian item was a "lemon" but I wont be throwing any more money away just to find out. Buyer Beware
