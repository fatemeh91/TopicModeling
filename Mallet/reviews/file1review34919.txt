review/text: I've been using Melatonin 3Mg time released for a month now. I find it to be working great in sustaining my sleep throughout the night. I'm not waking up for at least 8 hours or more, it lasts all night & I feel rested in the morning. I suggest using it if you are having problems staying asleep throughout the night.
