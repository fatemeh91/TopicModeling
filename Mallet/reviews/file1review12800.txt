review/text: This works great for soothing the pain of sinus infections. It covers the complete sinus area from frontal to maxillary, and the the velcro strap keeps it securely in place. I agree with other reviewers who complain that the heat doesn't last long enough - but perhaps that's because sinus infections are so miserable you want the relief to last forever. DO NOT OVERHEAT - follow the manufacturers instructions about heating in the microwave. Overheating won't offer longer relief, since the pad will be too hot to place on the skin - and it may ruin the pad.
