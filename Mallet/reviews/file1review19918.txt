review/text: We first purchased one of those potty seats that has elmo on it thinking it would help motivate my son to want to sit on it. It didn't fit our toilet seat and moved around a lot so my son wanted nothing to do with it. I found this Babybjorn seat and it was a life saver. It expands to fit any size toilet and it doesn't move. After we purchased the first one we immediately went back and bought a second one for our other bathroom.
