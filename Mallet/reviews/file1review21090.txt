review/text: The heating pad is really a nice size; I have never seen such a large heating pad! The cover is very nice and is washable. The switch takes a little getting use to, one has to hold it down, and that does get tiring, so I put a rubber band around it, and when it gets too hot I release it. I would recommend a switch with different levels for heating, like my small heating pad I now own. One can set it on "1", set it on "2" for different heat levels. Had the switch been different, I would have rated it as a "5"............
