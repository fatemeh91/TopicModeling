review/text: I don't have Gillette stock or work for the company. I hate shaving. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin. A bad combination. I bought the Fusion on a whim. I didn't expect it to be signficantly better than the previous generation Mach 3 but hope springs eternal. After two weeks and 7-8 shaves with the same cartridge(!), I can wholeheartedly say that this is a very noticeable improvement over the Mach 3. The cartridges have an astounding life. The Mach 3 would give me about 3-4 shaves before the blades dulled enough to result in razor rash. The Fusion has at least doubled that and is still going strong. Amazing. The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if Gillette is using a higher quality steel in the blades for the product launch. Time will tell. Secondly, I get far less razor burn from the Fusion. Almost none actually. Lastly, it's more difficult to cut myself in the nose/lip area which was something I had to watch carefully with the Mach 3. I'd guess this has to do with a larger blade surface area. In short, the Fusion really is an improvement over the Mach 3. As long as the cartridges continue to last for 8-10 shaves each, I will be a loyal customer.
