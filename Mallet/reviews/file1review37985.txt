review/text: An AED is only a small part of the lifesaving required in an emergency situation. If you are going to spend the bucks to buy an AED for your home or office then you better be spending the few dollars more to get the training required to use it properly. It takes more than an AED to save a person's life in case of a heart attack. I have had that training and I highly recommend it for anyone who thinks they have to have this device. Without the training, this device loses much of it's usefulness because CPR is a big part of the lifesaving procedure even with the AED. Just like an air bag in a vehicle is a great thing but it loses it effectiveness when seatbelts are not used in conjunction with it. Of course you can't hurt anyone with it because it won't defib except under the right conditions but you can't help much either without the proper training. Take the training, so that you know ALL the links in the chain of survival that will save a person's life.
