review/text: I used it for about 6 weeks and saw only marginal improvement. I was treating two scars, so I wasn't about to go drop another $30 on something that wasn't working too well to begin with. I also had problems with them staying on; they made me sweat under the patches and then they'd bunch up and fall off. Not recommended.
