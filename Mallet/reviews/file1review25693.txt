review/text: Let's face it, when you get older, you get hairier. Are you sick of seeing dad with bushes growing out of his ears and nose? You bet you are. Sure, he will grimace when he opens it up, but he'll be on his way from crusty-gross nose to Queer-Eye Approved nasty-hair-free guy in seconds.It's quite easy to use, and it does its job. Feels a little bit weird the first few times, and remember you have to wipe down afterwards (otherwise little hair dust will be coming out all day!).Takes one AA battery, which lasts for a month or so or regular use, unless, of course, you grow hair at truly prodigious rates.
