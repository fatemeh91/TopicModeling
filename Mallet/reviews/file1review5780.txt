review/text: I love this for the heating pad function. It's great to put on the back of my recliner. It actually helps keep my spine straight and the heat is great for arthritis. I don't use the massage function so I can't comment on that. I have it in my chair at all times even when I'm not using it for heat because it is so comfortable to lean back on. I would recommend this to anyone who has back problems. It's wonderful! Can't believe the price.
