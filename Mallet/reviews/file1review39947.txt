review/text: We chose this brand of protein powder because Consumer Reports rated it well regarding low levels of lead, cadmium and other dangerous substances found in some other popular protein powders. It tastes fine, takes a bit of work to dissolve if just stirring into something, but has good ingredients and I'd recommend it.
