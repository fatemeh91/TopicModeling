review/text: I purchased this to replace my older Braun (don't remember the model, it was $30 at Target). I was worried that the only thing I was getting for the extra money was the digital readout, but I could not have been more wrong. The Triumph is truly an advanced toothbrush, and closely mimics the motorized brush that the dentist uses for cleaning/polishing.As for the price ($66), Amazon was ~$40 less than local retail (Target, Walmart, etc).Great product, great price.
