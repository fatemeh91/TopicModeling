review/text: I can't review the 8100 foil & cutter since, although that is what I ordered, I received the inferior 51S replacementAnd at full price, not the one advertised for the 51S. Not much point in returning it if I have to pay more toShip it back & possibly getting a restock charge. I dislike false advertising and bait & switch. And the email shownOn the packing list was totally bogus, too.
