review/text: This is the first time I have been prescribed compression stockings. I went for the open toe beige style because I wanted to be able to wear them with my sandles. They work very well for this. Worn with long pants they are hardly noticable at all. I had a difficult time finding compression stockings in this style. Jobst is seriously involved in producing compression stockings and they have a reputation to uphold, which they do.
