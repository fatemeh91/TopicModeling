review/text: I like to drink leaf tea and this allows you to sip it without using a teaball because it strains the tea as you drink it. I do have one warning though: be sure to explain that is for drinking tea because it looks a lot like a pipe and your co-working might wonder what you are REALLY doing on your break!!!
