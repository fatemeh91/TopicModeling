review/text: When I first tried this it was very strong. But with a little creativity, my husband and I now enjoy drinking our daily smoothie shake. I use Dole Pina Colada juice for a great coconut flavor, some kefir (I make myself for the probiotics) and squirt a bit of Raw Agave Nectar for sweetness, frozen fruit mix, 1 TBS of ground flax seeds, 1 TBS of DE (Diatomaceous Earth)and a level scoop of Super Green and blend. Its my breakfast drink every morning. Since starting this in May, my hair is fuller (less daily hair loss) and my husband too (he says). The flax keeps you regular, so if you have trouble with this, definitely add ground flax seeds to your drink...you'll be so glad you did! I feel so much better, in general. Since I do put several things in my super shake, I'm not sure what has helped the most, but the combination seems to be perfect for us.
