review/text: This product is the best lip balm out there, but you need to know how to use it properly. At first I didn't like it as well, because I thought it was too clumpy and heavy. The trick is though, you don't need a lot. You just swipe a small amount and rub it on your lips, gently rub your lips together, and you're good to go. I've been using this product for a couple years now, another tip I have is, don't double dip, from my experience, doing that causes the balm to clump together a lot more. If you swipe some of the balm, use that bit before you go in for more.
