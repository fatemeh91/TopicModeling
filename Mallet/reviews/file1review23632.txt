review/text: After reading the good reviews for this product I decided to order it for my children. Last night when I first used it, both of them screamed when it got to their eyes!! It is not tearless at all! Also, the scent is not good, smells of "old lady" soap. I hope at least it doesn't dry up my little ones' sensitive skin.
