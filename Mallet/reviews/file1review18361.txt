review/text: These are great, they fit the model I have, as it was stated they would, they are very sharp - my old blades lasted many many years, it was well over time for new ones. Since they are not easy to find in "real" stores now, I tried the virtual world, and lo and behold, excellent! Very pleased. Nice small package, protected well, and easy to install into the razor. Since I clean the blades frequently (extends life), I know how to take them out and put them in, just keep the blade and cover together after cleaning, they wear together . . excellent product. Glad something still exists that you can buy parts for many many years later and be up to high quality standards.Thanks Norelco.
