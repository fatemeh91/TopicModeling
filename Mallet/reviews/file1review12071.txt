review/text: I did lots and lots if research for the ideal prenatal, and this is the big winner by far! It has everything your growing baby needs! Plus they are definitely gentle on your stomach! Only prenatal a I've been able to keep down, and only ones that don't burn my stomach. Can actually take on empty stomach - though I don't do that often. I love that they are from natural sources and not lab made vitamins and minerals. I also love that they are a one pill a day potency, and are an excellent price! I would recommend this product to anyone! The whole Rainbow Light product range is amazing.
