review/text: I use these ear plugs whenever I work in my yard with gas powered equipment. They are perfect for blocking out the noise of small gas engines like found on mowers. I can usually open a pack and have it last for a few months worth before I need to replace them. I have also used them when visiting the gun range and found that they work well. I recommend these ear plugs as a good and reasonably cheap solution for noise reduction.
