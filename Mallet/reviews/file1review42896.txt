review/text: This handle is just what I needed on my bath tub wall to feel a little steadier on my feet after someone has conditioned their hair or skin in the tub before me. It must be hung at an angle on my tile, so I can't use it as a towel rack, but because the suction cups hold fast, no drilling is required through the tiles for installation. It works great when installed per the instructions and takes less than 5 minutes. You can even take it with you on vacation!
