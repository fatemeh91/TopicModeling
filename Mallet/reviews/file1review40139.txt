review/text: it is a good deal. The quality of all items is worth more than this bundle deal. The shipment was also received quickly. Amazon is awesome. You get a nice mat that usually sells for at least $12. The 2 blocks that sells for at least $5 each. Then the belt that sells for $12. The bag that is also no less that $5. You will save.
