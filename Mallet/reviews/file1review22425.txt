review/text: Heard about bee pollen from a friend when I told him I was at wits end when trying to remedy the hay fever I had for many years. Began taking it in January 2008, and my symptoms have completely disappeared. This stuff is a natural wonder product for anyone looking to rid themselves of crippling hay fever and finally enjoy the outdoors again. Stop taking Benadryl and other weird chemical concoctions when nature has the perfect solution.
