review/text: I bought 12 of these wonderful cloths from Rock Ridge Sales to use on not just glasses & sunglasses, but cell phone screens and my Archos 10" Android Tablet. I wanted to try this cloth instead of putting a screen protector on the tablet and so far the cloth is working great to clean fingerprints off the screen without a lot of wiping. I'm actually quite impressed what little effort is needed to clean the screen.No scratches:I noticed that another reviewer mentioned something about scratches.As with any lenses or screens that I clean off with this cloth (or any cloth for that matter), I always make sure there isn't any visible dirt or grit because no matter how good a cleaning cloth is, dirt and grit could still scratch if you don't blow it off or lightly brush it off before cleaning with the cloth.The remainder of the cloths will make nice little stocking-stuffers/Christmas card inserts for friends & relatives this December. I'll probably need to get some more. :o)
