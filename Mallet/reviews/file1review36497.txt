review/text: I am allergic to most main stream deodorants and antiperspirants. I use other Weleda products so thought I would give this a try.It really does eliminate odor well - although it some times has to be reapplied throughout the day, the nice thing is you can do that and it is like starting fresh at the beginning of the day.My main complaint would be that because it contains alcohol it can be a bit drying, and really stings if you have shaved within a day or so of use.I typically like rose scent, but not this. This smells like cheap, strong cologne and I will definitely choose something different the next time.
