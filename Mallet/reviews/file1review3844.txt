review/text: I use these strips yearly. I get compliments all the time on how white my teeth are. When I use these strips, I try not to swallow any of the whitening paste because I don't trust that paste is safe to swallow in small amounts. It does make you drool and I can't imagine using these outside of my house with the exception of a work commute. Definitely work if you have mild-moderate yellowing.
