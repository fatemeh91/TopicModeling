review/text: For a while now I have been searching for a good multivitamin that wasn't comprised of synthetic laboratory chemicals. Then I stumbled across this. I can't say how good it feels to have a vitamin made up of wholefoods that covers such a wide range of nutrients. It even has Spirulina in it!!!Some people say they smell, I didn't really think this was an issue as you only have to smell them for about a second and it isn't like you can taste them after. My only problem is they're HUGE and can cause discomfort if they don't go down straight... Plus if you want to take the daily dose you need to take 3.I bought these because I was starting to develop small skin rashes on one of my legs and on the back of my neck. After reading and reading I was able to find out that it was most likely due to a vitamin deficiency. I've been taking these every day, for about a week now, and my problem is slowly starting to clear up.I take about 2 per day, as I am cautiously trying to see if my body can handle 100% DV of Iron. I know some people can experience irregularity with this.. Plus this way the bottle will last for 90 days as oppose to 60 =DRegardless, a good buy. These vitamins also don't upset my stomach like conventional ones you buy at Wal Mart.
