review/text: This fabric is NOT birdseye - it's actually a flimsy gauze.Real birdseye cloth has a TIGHT weave. Gauze is very loosely woven - exactly like the cloth these so-called diapers are made of.This product is being falsely advertised, and I'm really mad.The only thing that this cloth has in common with real birdseye cloth is that they pressed the gauze to appear as though it has a diamond weave - which it does not.One other thing: You'd think that anyone with common sense who intends to use these diapers as diapers would find it reasonable to use bleach when washing them. The label on this product warns that bleach will damage the fabric. I mean, come on!!! Really????
