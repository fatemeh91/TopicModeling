review/text: I ordered these as a recommendation from my friend who used them during her pregnancy. I have tried other prenatal vitamins (Centrum, etc) and they all made me nauseas. I can take these with or without food and have not had any trouble. I also think the price is comparable to those that you can buy over the counter. They are large but I haven't had any trouble (you can always split them in half if you need to). I will definitely be using these through this pregancy and any others to come!
