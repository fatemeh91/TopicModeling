review/text: Got this product after I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I was miserable with aches and pains and muscle soreness. My aches and pains have significantly reducedafter taking this product. Felt better in 2 days. Have been taking this for 10 days now. First day, with 4 tablets - I felt my muscles twitching. I reduced the dose to 2 tabs for a couple of days, increased to 3 and then to 4 tablets again.If you feel queasy or have diarrhea try reducing # of tablets and increase gradually.Additionally I am also taking 2-4 turmeric tablets(for reducing inflammation), B-12+ CoQ10 everyday.Hope my review helps all the others who are suffering with Fibro or CFS.
