review/text: Considering cost, value AND effectiveness...Green Vibrance is the category leader in phytonutrients. I must admit though, it doesn't give me the same "spark" that GofL RAW Meal used to. I just couldn't afford the RAW Meal expense anymore. Maybe I need to give Green Vibrance a little more time, but I am pleased with it and will definitely purchase again.
