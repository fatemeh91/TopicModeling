review/text: I became interested in this product after reading Dr. Steven Lamm's book 'The Hardness Factor'. I went ahead and ordered it, despite all the reviews warning of its awful taste. Since then, I came across this article on how to make l-argenine taste better.[..]I think I will try this protocol for taking this product, except I may substitute pomegranate juice for the grape, since it is supposed to build testosterone. According to Lamm, taking 3 grams of l-argenine in concert with 80mg of psycogenol (French maritime pine bark) will enable 'steel-hard' erections like those of a 15 year old boy.One thing I can recommend doing is start with taking l-argenine pills (500mg) before you start with the powder in larger doses. This stuff is known for its side effects of nausea and diarrhea, so it is important to let your gut get acclimated to it. Start with 500 mg a day the first week, then 1g the next week, until you get to your target dosage. I take mine about an hour before heading to the gym.
