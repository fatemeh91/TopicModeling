review/text: Attaches securely to the mirror. Allows for perfect positioning. Mirror is clear and the telescoping arm makes it easy to stow it so it is out of the way. This is the ony one that I found that allows me to position the mirror right over the sink. That's important when trimming my mustache as the hairs then just fall into the sink below. All the other mirrors attach to a wall or sit on a counter. That means they are all in the wrong position for this. I am very happy with this product. Nice and light, so I can take it with me when traveling. No more getting home and discovering what I missed shaving trying to see in a handheld mirror.
