review/text: The problem with this caliper, is you get a different reading everytime you measure. Why bother to track your body fat when you don't even know for sure which reading is the accurate one, or maybe none of them are. I measured over and over again, and not once did I get the same reading. As far as I'm concerned this was a big waste of money.
