review/text: Before buying this product, I have gone through multiple whey proteins. This one trumps them all.Nutritionally, it has the least amount of cholesterol of any whey protein on the market, as well as having less than 1 gram of saturated fats(.5g).Taste-wise, ON 100% Whey Extreme Milk chocolate IS thee best tasting whey protein product on the market. Honestly, I thought it tasted just like a CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE?!?! No desert for me anymore, just ON Milk Chocolate 100% Whey.PS: Always mix Whey with milk... NOT water.
