review/text: After reading so many reviews about the handle, I was nervous. But, as clearly instructed on the package, my husband struck the handle and it has been bomb proof. Kids ages 18 months, 5 and 9 have been able to use it (roughly at times) with no problem with the handle.I have to admit, that I was trying to replace my super-old Orek sweeper that they just don't make any more...I thought. I tried the expensive ($70+ dollar) sweeper with rubber fins instead of a brush and it worked great on my carpet, but not on the hardwood or tile. So, I tried this one.It works great. I could see where you may want to go with the dual brushes if you have the space, but we don't. Also, this design is EXACTLY like my old Orek. And it is made out of...ta da...metal. The metal makes it heavy enough to pick up without applying pressure.It does take a little while for the plastic where the handle connects to the body to relax (a couple of weeks of careful use) so that it doesn't scrape wood floors, but I was vigilant for the first few uses and now it is fine.Keep that brush comb as well (maybe somewhere other than the handle of the sweeper, so it doesn't get knocked off). It really keeps the brush looking and working like new.I've had this for several months and would recommend it for someone who wants to do quick kid/pet clean up on multiple types of floors.
