review/text: Wonderful quality Zafu cushion set! The buckweat pillow props you way up and smells mild and pleasant. The only thing I might change is the 2 extra cushions are 2 different sizes, and I like to put them on either side of my legs for extra support, and they are uneven. It' would be nice if they included another little square cushion. Otherwise I'm very pleased, and the color, Clay, is fantastic looking!
