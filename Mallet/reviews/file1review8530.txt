review/text: This is great for cleaning out long cylinder like thermos that i can not reach inside with a sponge. I use it for the stanley thermos though it reaches just short of the opening so its a little hard to grip with my whole hand. Wish it had a holder of some sort so it does not just lay on the counter after using. Otherwise this brush is a great purchase.
