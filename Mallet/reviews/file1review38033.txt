review/text: It's great these are finally available for the public.This is a very easy to use piece of equipment. SO easy, that even someone who's loved one is laying on the floor can still operate it. Turn iton stick on the patchs and the machine does the rest. It lets you know tonot touch the individual.If it seems like a lot of money, without one money may become un-necessary.I like the idea of 4-6 neighbors going in on it, and keeping it in a common place.One where no one is to far from the machine. You only have a about a minute andhalf.So I guess it my come down to the old axiom:: It's your money or your life.
