review/text: I regularly take stomach enzymes. Digest Gold is a power house of a product, but it does work. I specifically took them on my trip to China. No stomach problems the entire time! The best, though is that most people, even the locals, get stomach illness when they eat the spicy food of China. This worked like a charm.It also works for the other female reasons that you would want to take the product, though you might just go with the cheaper Acidophilus if you need it for that.One thing to note. Even though the bottle says that you don't need to store in the fridge, if you're going some place particularly hot, you'll want to put these in the fridge in the hotel. Also, if you're going to some place humid for a longer period of time, you'll find that a normal vitamin case will not be adequate to store these pills. Mine did change colors after 10 days of being in the humid and hot areas of China.
