review/text: I rotate between a lot of different protein powders and meal replacement shakes, just because i get sick of the same choices and flavors...all except for this one. This is the best tasting one of all by far to me..when made with milk this tastes like dessert..no weird flavors or chalky taste. Highly recommend!
