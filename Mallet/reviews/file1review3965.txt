review/text: I've used about 25 different formulas in the last 10 years or so, and without question, Gary's "Bug Out" is at the top of the list. I feel like some formulas I've used in the past are too strong, too bitter, and left me with irritation in my bowels and inflammations. Gary's Bug Out is gentle, yet extremely effective. You can literally feel the parasites begging for mercy! My energy increased 200% after using this supplement. It's extremely beneficial.
