review/text: This tea is awesome. I had it in a restaurant once and tore off the little label and came home trying to find it on the internet. After finding it on Amazon, I looked up all the benefits of green tea, and realized that original green tea is kind of disgusting. So I ordered the Jasmine Green Tea, and with a little sugar and lemon, I drink it every day. Excellent product. Can't live without it.
