review/text: This knife is spot on for great craftsmanship, yet highly effective in harsh environments. Although one thing that kind of made me mad about this knife was the fact that is made in China. The description above says that it was made in the USA but when i received the knife i inspected it to find out that on the knife blade it clearly says made in China on it. Though the knife is made in China it is a really great knife and i encourage everybody to get it. If you are in the market for an amazing knife that has a razor sharp edge, and at an affordable price, than but this amazing knife YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!
