review/text: Pretty much in line with what everyone else thinks..great price, tastes absolutely horrible...I would imagine the taste of a rotten fish would taste pretty much the same. I find it easier to just mix it in about 3-4 oz. of juice and pound it quickly to get it over-with...just suck it up and deal with it.
