review/text: The toy might have worked fine but since they didn't package everything separate and just through everything in a paddd pak, the liquid opened up and was all over the inside of the package and all of the toys had a nice healthy lube coating. Was not ver happy about this. They did agree to send out a replacement tube of lube but I had to clean everything up myself.
