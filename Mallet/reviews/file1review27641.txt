review/text: ON products are always reliable. That said, this tastes pretty good when mixed with just water. I love mint chocolate chip ice cream so the mint taste wasn't over bearing or too minty at all. I took one star off BC it was difficult for me to mix it with other components like fruit with this flavor opposed to what I typically drink which is the extreme chocolate flavor. Also, I got used to the taste and couldn't bare any longer BC of my inability to find good mixes that are low in calorie while tasting great.
