review/text: I am extremely disappointed in the Braun Triumph 9000. I purchased it on 3/04/2006 and now the battery will not charge. I followed the care instructions and did a discharge every 6 months hoping that the battery would last a little longer, but it still will not charge correctly. I called Braun customer service and explained the problem and was told the handle is no longer good. they said they only last about 5 years. Perhaps Braun should advise the consumer that the unit is going to be disposed of in 5 years. I was offered a $10 dollar coupon or a replacement handle that would cost $60. It is very frustrating to have to purchase another handle when the whole unit costs about $100.(Sam's club) I have to really think about purchasing another Braun brush verses another similar product by another manufacturer. Perhaps I will get more than 5 years out of another company.
