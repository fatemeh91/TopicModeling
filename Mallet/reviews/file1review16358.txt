review/text: I've tried 4 or 5 of the Taylor scents of the last few years. So far this is my favorite. It's a very light and clean scent. Lathers great (like the all do). So far my least favorite is for sure the Lavender - it smells like grandma (not that grandma smelled really bad or anything, I just don't want that smell). Avacado and Eaton College are also good scents. Oh yeah, as far as the shave cream - it's really excellent and one tub lasts for months and months.
