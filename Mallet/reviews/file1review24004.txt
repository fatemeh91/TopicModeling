review/text: Great stethescope. Have used my first Pedi one for over 30 years and it has been awesome in terms of the clarity and the fit of the earpieces that block out noise.Sent it out to the company once (3M) and they cleaned everything on it for free, only chg.was shipping.Not sure if they still do this.Looking forward to having my new Littmann pedi scope for at least 15 years!!!
