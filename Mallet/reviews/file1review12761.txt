review/text: This product is very good to help build out a good med kit. I carry extra just in case I need to help others who may be injured on my long hikes and trail runs. Fantastic for splinting legs, arms... whatever. My older brother, a professional Paramedic, used one of his when he was enjoying a children's soccer game and a little girl broke her arm (rough little girls!). He pulled his out of his vehicle and had her arm immobilized by the time the Ambulance showed up. Having this item at the right time will make you popular and will get you free drinks... Highly recommend!
