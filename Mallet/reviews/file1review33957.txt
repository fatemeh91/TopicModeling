review/text: I absolutely love this massage bar! It feels amazing, smells good, and coaxes the most intriguing sounds out of my boyfriend. The best thing about it is that it lasts such a long time. I start out massages with it, and then switch to just my hands when his back is thoroughly coated with cocoa butter. That way, I can save the bar and I can actually rub it in so that his back is not dripping with it when we go to sleep.
