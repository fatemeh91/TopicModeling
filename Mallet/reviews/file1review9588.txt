review/text: Met-Rx has a great product here; and the Amazon 'subscription' price beats the heck out of the grocery store price; but we're thinking about canceling our regular monthly order with Amazon because the bars were melted - deformed into a twisted goo inside their wrappings - in the last two shipments.It is important to note that we live in Florida; but the mail man brings the box to my front door, rings the door bell, and hands me the package. Guess it gets pretty warm somewhere in the journey!
