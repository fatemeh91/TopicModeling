review/text: This safe-t-sport neoprene knee support is very good but there are some drawbacks to the support which I found out. The support does what it advertises to do and you have to measure the upper leg above the knee to get the right size. The drawback is not to wear it more than an hour or so as it will make your knee sweat. I also have poor circulation in my leg that I use the support on and in doing so after 3 hours or so my knee will swell. Not life threatening as you have to remove it to feel better.
