review/text: Oxo Soap Pump is designed to aid people that have problems with Arthritis. I have had Arthritis for years and in the past couple of years my hands have lost the power to grip and to handle small objects. Oxo had people with Arthritis in mind when they made their products. Oxo Soap Pump is so handy for scrubbing pots and pans, buy 2 or 3 and put them in your bathrooms for ease in scrubbing. Press and dispense the soap and let the bristles do the work.Thank You Oxo for all your wonderful products.
