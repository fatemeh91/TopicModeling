review/text: It may sound ridiculous, but this is the fat that you NEED. I swim 1.5Km daily, minimum, and this supplement (along with a multivitamin so that the E and D can mobilize what the Omega 3-6-9 has to offer) is just what the doctor ordered. Highly suggested. Also, for someone who doesn't eat too much fish and usually sticks to meat, this gives you the fat, like I said, that you NEED (and won't be getting from a diet void of fish).
