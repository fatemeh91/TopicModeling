review/text: Got this for the hubs for our anniversary. He used to shave his face about once a week (which blew for me--he didn't care obv.). After giving him this razor he shaves daily now. Wet or dry- its a common daily routine. Some reviews say that If you have sensitive skin to only do it wet--my husband has VERY sensitive skin and dry doesn't hurt him one bit. Excellent excellent deal.
