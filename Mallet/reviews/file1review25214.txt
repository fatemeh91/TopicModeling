review/text: My headphones seemed to be cutting in and out a lot after a while. I thought maybe I was getting interference from new electronic device. After no luck trying to isolate the problem, I thought about the batteries. The new one corrected the reception problems plus it lasts a lot longer on a charge than the old ones.
