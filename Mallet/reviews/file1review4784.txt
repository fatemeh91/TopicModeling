review/text: I'm not a serious Macro-dieter, but I was looking for something healthy and nutritious to mix with water or a smoothie in the morning for breakfast. I bought this in conjunction with some whey protien and Miracle Reds, and I have a shake mixed with 12 oz of milk every morning. The shake leaves me full until at least 1PM, I feel great, and I can tell the greens are making digestion easier... Believe it or not, I even like the taste! I'm a convert, I'll be back for more Miracle Greens for sure!
