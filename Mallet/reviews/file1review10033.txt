review/text: This product was easy to use, and easy to remember how to use. I was worried I'd have to go back to the instructions 5 times before I remembered how to do it each time but, it only took the 2nd time.I feel this is a better way to track progress over a scale. Scales that track body fat base it on water retention which is not fat. Where as this 3 spot marker makes it hard to fudge any results or just screw up taking the results.
