review/text: I just started using this toothbrush less than 2 weeks ago and already I can tell a difference! My teeth feel clean ALL THE TIME, as if I just brushed them. I was really skeptical at first, but decided to take the risk anyways. I'm so glad I gave it a try. I am also using less toothpaste, about 1/3 of what I used before. This toothbrush is the best $20 something dollar that I've ever spent!
