review/text: I have tried several electric shavers thought the years and none have given me a close shave because my facial hair grows in all different directions.I have bought brand after brand of blade and shave cream but no matter what brand I bought, I cut my face several times a month just to get that close shave.Well, the Braun 8585 WORKS! Not quite as close as a blade but 98% as close. No more cuts, no more expensive blades! The self cleaning system keeps it working smoothly from shave to shave.Sure, there are other electric shavers that are cheaper but with those, you get what you pay for; a cheap shave. The Braun was worth every penny because IT WORKS!This FORMER blade user is extremely happy and very satsfied with his purchase. You will be too.
