review/text: I've used regular Benefiber for a few years and really like it. I thought I'd try this and that was a mistake. The orange flavor is so strong that I can't even finish the glass without wanting to gag. I gave it two stars becauseit does what it's supposed to do, it just tastes gross. This is getting dumped and I'm going back to the regular one.
