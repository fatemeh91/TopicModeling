review/text: Good for body odor control. It is great for detoxing your body, since most of us do not sweat enough to keep our system clean. I have to take a Chemo treatment for RA every 5 months and the order it leaves in you is terrible. I finally found that chlorophyll is the best thing to do. It works wonderfully. Great for anyone with bad body order problems, I don't even need under arm deodorant any more and my son takes it for stinky feet - no more stinky feet problems.
