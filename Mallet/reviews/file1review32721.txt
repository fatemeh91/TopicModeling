review/text: this is a really nice stabilizer. It works as it should. The only thing that I have a bit of an issue with are the velcro straps, you have to be a weight lifter to get them pull the things apart, maybe not the best thing for someone with strength issues. But if you don't mind fighting them this is the stabilizer to get.
