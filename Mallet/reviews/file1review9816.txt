review/text: This product does extactly what it says it does. Buy this item for those ingrown hair problems you may have trouble with. This is really great if you need to "dig" those troublesome ingrown hairs that are stuck right under the surface. I thought this product would of cause me pain or make me bleed by "digging" for those hairs, but no. It looks like since the hair is right under the surface of your skin it is painless to get them out. I will warn you to be careful since the ends of the tweezerman are very sharp. So make sure you don't stab yourself, because you will. I just wish I bought this products a couple of years ago. I use to use the little scissors attachment from a small swiss army knife. It worked great but since these tweezers have pointy ends it is much faster and easier.
