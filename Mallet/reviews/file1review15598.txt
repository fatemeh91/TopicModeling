review/text: I have a rather odd problem under my arms. I get an irritation that nothing seems to help, a painful itching internal pain. Oddly enough this under arm cream changes the ph and relieves the pain.As for odor control, it works pretty well, I find myself applying a small amount every few days if I am working hard. Or right before important events I apply some as a safe guard. At some periods in my life I would only apply it once a week.Overall I would recommend trying this deodorant as their is nothing like it and I have been very happy with it.
