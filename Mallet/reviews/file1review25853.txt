review/text: The Panasonic ES8036 is a very satisfying shaver, and provides a clean, silky shave for the pickiest of people. It works much better out of water, but there is minimal difference, for me it's about a couple hours' worth of growth.It's also good on sharp, angular faces and adjusts well. The linear motor is a noticable advantage that saves valuable time.I highly reccomend this fine work of machinery, and it also comes with a convenient travel pouch!
