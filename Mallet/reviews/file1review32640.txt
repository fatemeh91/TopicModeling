review/text: I have brought these few times, the first bottle that we have received seems to mix well, also the taste was good , but the next 2 bottles were not as good as the first one. It seems to be a hit or miss if you buy this product it might come out good or bad. These powder seems to come in two different packaging one is purple and other is green, I tried both and they seems to taste bad. BTW also tried perfect acai which is costlier but the taste is much better then this one and also it state the ORAC ingredients etc upfront
