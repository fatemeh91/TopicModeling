review/text: This is the second protein shake I've tried since I started working out. My first was GNC Pro Performance 100% Whey Protein. ON Gold Standard is a lot better in my opinion because of the taste and it is absorbed faster. I used this for about 2 months and noticed more lean muscle. I recommend double rich chocolate. The next protein I'm trying is Isopure Low Carb.
