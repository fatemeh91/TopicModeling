review/text: As a medical doctor who has participated in Resuscitation Committees in Colombia, I have known this excellent device for at least 5-6 years and can tell you I am delighted to know it is available without restriction. My feeling is that for small medical offices and centers in third world countries like mine this is a MUST. The cost of full-featured defibrillators puts them out of reach, whereas this device will save lifes, be stupidly simple to use and cost a fraction of them.In fact even any place where there are groups of people meeting, large offices and the like, should have one. (We are still far from expecting regular homes to own one). I hope Philips pushes marketing Heartstart in countries like mine, I foresee a near future where non-defibrillated cardiac arrests should be a thing of the past.
