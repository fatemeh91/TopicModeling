review/text: If you are a first time buyer/user, do read a sample of reviews - it will help a lot in the decision making process. I thank everybody who have contributed their reviews, as it helped me make my decision. As for the product, this is the perfect thing to use when in between the waxing stages. If you are used to waxing, there is no pain. I have been waxing for the past 5 years and the pain was no more then what I experience while waxing. However, if you have never waxed before you will feel a bit of a prick and redness. Lower legs are definitely much easier to do than the upper legs - but hold you skin taut and you will be fine. The biggest challenge is figuring out how fast to move the epilator - initially I ended up breaking my hair rather than pulling it out. I definitely recommend waxing before using this product. This way you are only dealing with so much hair at a time.
