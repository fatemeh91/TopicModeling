review/text: This product is great! We have well water with allot of mineral deposits left in the toilets. After a month of using this product the toilet was clean, and stain free for the first time. It removed not just the scum but removed the mineral deposits that cling to everything that comes in contact with water here. It is very easy to install and refills involve opening a pack of 2 tablets and placing in an easy screw top system inside the tank. It can last up to 4 months depending on how often the toilet is flushed. It is easy to see when the tablets need to be replaced. The toilet begins to appear not quite as clean and you can unscrew the cap of the system in the tank and see if the tablets are dissolved or not. I recommend this to everyone! I do not know anyone who enjoys scrubbing toilet bowls. It also helps with odor control.
