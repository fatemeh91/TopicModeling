review/text: Streamlite makes a fine flashlight in a very narrow configuration to work where other flashlights are useless. When they first came out you could buy AAAA batteries in many stores. But no more. They are more scarce than the proverbial hen's teeth. Many on-line stores seem to know this and overcharge for AAAA batteries or charge ridiculous shipping costs. That is exactly why this Amazon package is a great deal. A fair price and a fair shipping cost for a good product.
