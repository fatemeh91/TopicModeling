review/text: When I first heard that I would be Test Driving a gel solid I was a bit worried as I had tried a gel deodorant once and didn't like it at all. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the emphasis should have been on the solid. There was none of the stickiness I expected with a gel. I find this product to be very effective and I'd recommend it to others.
