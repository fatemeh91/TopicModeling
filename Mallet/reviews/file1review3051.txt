review/text: I bought these thinking they were the thinnest and found out later there are two Japanese brands that are half the wall thickness. I was able to compare these to Sagami and Okamotos where both transferred heat and sensation much better. These condoms are better than most other popular brands for what ever that is worth. I just dont think they are at the top of class.
