review/text: Really, though, this stuff is like an amphetamine. I used to work in fast-food, and one of my co-workers was taking this. She'd share with me and we would be the most hard-working smiley girls in the store. I'd take this stuff just for recreation.I bought my own supply of it later, and I lost 30 lbs in 2 months. My only exercise was my 20 min commutes to and from work. My friend lost 40 lbs, but she was actually going to the gym.I saw a lot of negative reviews regarding nausea and insomnia, but I don't think the nausea affects everyone, and who sleeps these days anyway?
