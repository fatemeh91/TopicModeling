review/text: This was recommended to us by a friend who knew my husband was quite disturbed by memory lapses. We both started on it and I'm back today for a reorder. This is good stuff. Yes, it helps memory and yes it evens out moods. Whatever it's doing works, with no side effects and no drugged feeling at all. It just sort of quietly goes to work inside and you gradually start to feel better. I'm wondering if anyone has tried this for bi-polar problems.....
