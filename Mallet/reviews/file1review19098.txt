review/text: I used these when we were trying to get pregnant for the first time. They are nice because they are very inexpensive, and I felt like I could test daily without "wasting" a pregnancy test. However, they did not seem to be as sensitive as they say. I got a very very faint positive line twice, and ended up going to the drug store to buy an early result test just to confirm. The drug store test was much easier to read even though it was also a faint positive.
