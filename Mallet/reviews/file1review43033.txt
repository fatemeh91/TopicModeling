review/text: I LOVE this pregnancy support belt! I bought it because my belly was bigger with my second pregnancy and I had much worsened Varicose Veins in my legs and perineum. This belt helped support the weight of my belly and lift everything up a little so that my veins could flow better. It did help A LOT and it helped with supporting my back and preventing back pain, or front stretching belly pain. I started using it around 29-30 weeks gestation. I am a labor and delivery nurse and used it at work during my 12 hour shifts...and also used it at home. I feel like it was easily hidden under clothes! I did have to wear a tank top underneath it for comfort, but then it still wouldn't show under my maternity shirts (I was due in January...ie. winter). It was comfortable and easy to go the bathroom without budging it during the day. The one remark I want to say is (ATTENTION): buy one size larger than you would think! Seriously! I started my pregnancy at 120 lbs and ended it at about 144 lbs, and I had bought a SMALL size. It got WAY too tight at the end...I almost couldn't wear it anymore starting around 37 weeks. I have always been on the very last hook possibility, even since 30 weeks, and now the last hook doesn't cut it. It squeezes my belly so bad it almost causes more pain. I wish I had a medium size. I never even used the middle hooks or the tightest hooks. So trust me...buy one size larger than you normally would. Even if you are small like me, buy a medium. This belt is so great though and COMPLETELY worth the money! Wish I got it sooner. Also, buy it on Amazon versus the other direct company...I think I saved $35 dollars!
