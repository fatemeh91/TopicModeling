review/text: This is one of the better Slim Fast flavors I've ever had. Actually, before drinking this stuff I was purchasing Carnation Instant Breakfast. Reading the labels side by side Slim Fast is more nutritious, plus it has higher fiber content that helps suppress my appetite and hold me over til mid afternoon.I would highly recommend this flavor, especially if your a chocolate lover like I am. To me, Chocolate Royale is more rich and chocolately then the original Chocolate shake mix Slim Fast has out.
