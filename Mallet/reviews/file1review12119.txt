review/text: And it's WONDERFUL! Has truly made a positive impact on my skin and hair. Never felt sick or "strange" after taking a pill.Found out this weekend that I'm planning on having a baby within the next two years, I should be taking folic acid anyways to ensure a healthy development. I'm not "planning" on having a baby but if it happens, I'll be ready!
