review/text: This is a well designed wash / bath mitt featuring the popular children's television character Strawberry Shortcake. It fits well and comes with a hook for hanging as well as small loop at the top. It has a lot of nice detailing, including the strawberry ribbon at the top, which is a nice touch. It comes with a tag designating it as authentic Strawberry Shortcake merchandise. It is made of terry cloth and is very soft and comfortable.As for the idea of using this as a gift bag, that seems really more like a marketing gimmick than anything. I don't really know who would give this to their kid filled with candy or something, and then have them turn around and use it for washing.
