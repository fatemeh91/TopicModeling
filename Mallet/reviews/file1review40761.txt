review/text: I installed this grab, assist bar on the exterior brick at a stair leading to the entry of our home. Hardware which came with this bar included the (6) attachment screws and plastic anchors. I used the supplied screws, however the plastic anchors split when I tried to drive them into the hole drilled in the brick, so I used other plastic anchors which I had. The bar installed quickly, requiring drilling six holes in the brick (I also had the masonry drill bit which I used). The finished installation looks good and is much appreciated by my wife who requires assistance to negotiate stairs. I expect the stainless steel finish will hold up well on the exterior of our home. Finished installation provides a very substantial assist bar.
