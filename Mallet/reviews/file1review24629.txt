review/text: I tried these pills despite the bad reviews that I read. Big Mistake! I started these on the weekend and they made me ridiculously weak. I could not eat anything because I had no appetite whatsoever and had very intense stomach pain. Basically I spent those two days curled up on the couch because I was extremely weak. I almost passed out when I got up to go to the bathroom and my heart was pounding so hard I literally thought I was dieing. These also made me very paranoid and emotional. I lost 2 lbs from not eating but gained it back as soon as I got off the pill. Be smart and use diet, exercise and try drinking herbal teas. DO NOT buy these unless you enjoy throwing your money away.
