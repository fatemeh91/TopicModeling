review/text: Results of this product vary depending on how severe your condition is. If you are really constipated, prepared to be in pain with cramping. I took this product when I was experiencing bloating and the full feeling and the next morning I was miserable. I kept feeling like I was going to faint and I had moderate pain and cramping in my gut. It relieved the constipation, but at what price? Other times, I have taken it and only experienced runny stools, but anytime you take it, it does cause cramping. I prefer milk of magnesia instead.
