review/text: I purchased Wellesse Joint Movement Glucosamine With Chondroitin and Msm at my local Walmart as I have been suffering from hip and knee pain on my left side and I get stiff very quickly when riding in a car or riding my horse. I also have arthritis in my hands and if I hold my fingers curled for any length of time my hands ache, this usually happens at night while sleeping. I have heard that the liquid form of vitamins is utilized better by your body so decided I would give this a try even though I could have bought tablets for cheaper. Imagine my surprise when after just two doses the pain in my hands was noticeably better and I don't get as stiff in my knee and hip. Yes, the taste is not pleasant, but the longer I take it the less offensive I find it to be. Give this product a try you will be amazed!
