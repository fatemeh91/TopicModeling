review/text: I've struggled with Halitosis for most of my adult life and everything from toothpaste to mouthwash to tongue brushes helped temporarily. After a month and a half of Pro Fresh, I can honestly say that I'm amazed at how well this product works. One of the cons you'll read about this product is the taste. Sure, it has a slight chemical taste, but if you can't ~1 take a minute of swishing this wonder-potion in your mouth because of the taste, then your problem is probably not that serious. For me, the embarrassment that Pro Fresh saves me from is well worth minute or two of that peculiar taste in my mouth. I've tested my breath on my wife and she was still conscious on both occasions, so she can attest to the effectiveness of this product. All-in-all, I will continue to purchase this product because to me, it is worth it.
