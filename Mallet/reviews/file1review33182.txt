review/text: Amazon has a great price on these. I've been taking these off and on for the last couple of years and they seem to help me get over an illness quicker (could be psychological, but research shows that most of the ingredients are known to help with fighting the common cold, such as Vitamin C, etc.). Be forewarned that these are giant pills (about 3/4" to 1" long) and they are very fragrant (to me it is like an olive smell). I am a repeat customer for these.
