review/text: A friend of mine bought me a pack of these a few months ago and I loved them-- they are the perfect after-meal toothpick because the spicy cinnamon flavor makes your mouth fresh. ALso great if you're feeling hungry and can't eat for a while-- the strong flavor kind of distracts from hunger.
