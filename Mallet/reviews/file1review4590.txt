review/text: I got one in the mail and being resourceful, I gave it a try even though it appeared as though this might feel like shaving with a 2x4 the head is so big. Well it does take a little getting used to coming from a cheap Bic but the shave is amazing and that single blade works wonders under your nose. I absolutely love the thing....TILL!!!.....I went to buy replacement blades. Yeeeeoooooowwwwwwweeeeeeee $13.00 for 4 stinkin blades!!!!! Yikes!!!!!!! Sadly I forgot my glasses and clearly couldn't read the price on the shelf at the grocery store; I thought they were an excellent deal at $2.99. Well I couldn't see the 1 in front of the 2. Is it worth it??? Debatable; I'm not sure I'll spring for blades again. That was a painful eye opener.
