review/text: I bought these containers to pack my daughter's school lunches. I loved the divided compartments. However, these containers were too big to fit in her usual lunchbox, and barely fit in an old lunch box of hers. I would keep that in mind when purchasing this when the intention is for kids lunches. If it's for an adult or other reason then it's perfect as adult lunch boxes/carriers tend to be larger.
