review/text: I have tried every women's razor on the market from Venus to Daisy...and every hair removal system from Epilady to Veet to Nair. Everything was trouble. I would give up shaving until the summer months because it was too much of a hastle. Being able to shave your legs in the middle of a shower without worrying about the shaving cream being washed off before you get to that part of your leg is simply wonderful. The conditioner surrounding the blade gives your legs a silky feel. Like many women, I too was skeptical, but will use nothing else from here on out. I am hooked.
