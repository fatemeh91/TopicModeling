review/text: My dentist has been on my case about minor gum infection. ( I hadn't been in for a teeth cleaning in a year or two) My new dentist had a real sharp hygenist. At any rate I got a Oxyfresh water pic which has really helped my gum problem out. At 60 I am lucky to have all my teeth! They were pushing the Sonicare with the cleaning system. Very pricey even at amazon. After reading the reviews the Oral B Triumph seemed to have close too or equal reviews. The circular head cleaning is awesome and the 3 quadriant burst warning and the graphics on the front of the device is neat as well. It holds a charge forever and replacement brushes seem much cheaper than the Sonic FLexcare. I would highly recommend.
