review/text: I've finally found a way to manage this embarrassing problem. For quite some time I used scissors on my nose and dealt with the occasional knick, not to mention it's just a time-consuming process. Now I'm able to take care of my "problem" quickly and safely. To be honest, it's not the most comfortable experience I've ever had. There is a slight tugging sensation and it does kind of tickle. Afterward my eyes always water a little. But really it's a small price to pay to get the job done so quickly and easily.I'd read another review from someone who suggested wetting the blades before trimming to make things more comfortable, and this does help a bit. For as well as the trimmer works, at this price you really can't go wrong.
