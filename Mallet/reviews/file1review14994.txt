review/text: I have been using multiple different brands of Hair, skin and nails and I can truly say that "FutureBiotics" gave instant results. The instructions are to take 3 tabs a day but I only took two a day. In june I got a hair cut and by July I needed another hair cut. As for my nails, Awesome!! I usually wear my nails short but with FB I allowed my nails to grow and they maintained their length.I went to shop for some at "PennHerb Co." and they were sold out. I called today and they are still out of stock. They say a lot of folks love "FutureBiotics" and it does it's job. I love that it has multiple vitamins so that way I don't have to buy 2 or more bottles of bottles to go along with FB. Everyone is different but it worked for me. Nature's Bounty brand is out the door Future Biotics is in.
