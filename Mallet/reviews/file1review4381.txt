review/text: When I first heard Gillette was selling a FIVE BLADE razor I laughed, but after getting a free one in the mail I'm hooked. It gives the smoothest easiest shave I've ever had, plus the blades last for weeks, making the high cost actually well worth it.I don't go for fads or gimmicks, this is a quality product and worth the extra cost.
