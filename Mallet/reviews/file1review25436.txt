review/text: My husband had one of these trimmers for several years. After it finally died we went to several local stores looking for the exact same one, our search was futile. I finally looked on Amazon and found it. Now his regular grooming is back to normal and he is exceptionally pleased. I probably should buy a couple more so he will not be without again. Think I will wait a couple of months first.
