review/text: This stuff... sucks. At first, I was all gung-ho about trying it after reading Jillian Michael's book, Making the Cut. It's one of the supplements she recommends for women with an underactive thyroid. I don't have hypothyroidism, but my numbers are low so I figured I might as well give it a whirl. 10 lbs later, I realized I may be taking more than just "guggul". My doctor thinks there might have even been some type of steroid-like substance in it, because I gained 10 lbs in a month! I am a healthy eater, and I work out 5-6 days/week because I'm also a personal trainer. The way I see it.. don't waste your money, if you think you have a thyroid problem, go to an endocrinologist and get the real drugs, the ones where you know exactly what's in them.
