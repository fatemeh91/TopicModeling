review/text: What a great idea! A friend received these as a gift, and I got to try one. I loved the idea and the taste, so I bought my own stash! They taste great and don't leave a bad aftertaste. One slight negative is that I wish they lasted longer. They are pretty small, so they dissolve pretty fast. Which also can lead to easily over-using them. As for the caffeine content, I haven't really noticed getting jittery, even after eating 5 or 6. But overall, I'm loving these and have enough to last me for a year now! haha
