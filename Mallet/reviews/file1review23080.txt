review/text: The Bissell Swift Sweep picks up fine but the handle is a piece of junk. The parts do no interlock and no how hard you bang it, it falls apart immediately. Compared to the Rubbermaid sweeper I had for 15+ years (which finally gave up the ghost), it is a waste of money, with no hand grip to speak of.Bissell Swift Sweep Sweeper, 2201-2
