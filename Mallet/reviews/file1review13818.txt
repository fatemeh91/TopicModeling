review/text: It stays warm for maybe 10 minutes. I reheated it for maybe 3 minutes and now it stinks like a burning smell all the time. The Cherry stone neck pillow is much better, it stays hot longer and the heat is stronger as the weight of the wrap really helps the heat sink into sore neck muscles. Buy the cherry stone neck wrap instead. I use it everyday and its great.
