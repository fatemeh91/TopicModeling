review/text: I've only had experience with a couple of different protein powder brands, so my review can be taken with a grain of salt. However, I have to admit that this brand is good quality and this specific flavor, Cookies and Cream, is really delicious. When mixed with non-fat milk, it almost tastes like a milk shake. It gives it a creamy texture, and it even has tiny little cookies bits (kind of like Oreos). Even with just plain water, the taste is above average. You're not going to crave the water+powder combo, but it's most definitely drinkable and doesn't taste unnatural like some other powders.I mentioned that it's good quality because it mixes so damn well! I use a shaker that has one of those metal ball blenders, but honestly I could just leave it out and the shaking alone can mix the liquid and powder. Even with cold liquids, like milk, there are no chunks at all.I highly recommend this protein powder. It tastes great and mixes well, what more can you ask for?
