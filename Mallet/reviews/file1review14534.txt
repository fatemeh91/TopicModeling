review/text: I am an asthmatic living in the desert - the doctors (and I've been to several) tell me this combination often results in dry feet like mine - my feet can crack enough without treatment to bleed. I've tried scores of products over the decades. My first success was with a mail order product (Miracle Foot Repair, still available) until they reduced the Aloe content by a third. Then, Eucerin worked well enough until they added water to make it creamier. The last doctor prescribed (previous prescriptions hadn't worked) a $50 Gordon Labs exfoliating cream that worked similarly. BUT, this Norwegian foot cream works just as well (I hadn't put enough on at first - it must still be a little wet when you're done rubbing in on... and so, I put socks on to keep from sliding all over the floor). I was buying this product at a rate of eight tubes a year for a savings of over $300 a year compared to the prescription cream (not counting the doctor's fees).UPDATE: I'm cured! I no longer have to buy any of these products. What did it for me?!? I used Tineacide for 6 weeks. I guess I've had Athlete's foot for over 20 years (I don't feel completely stupid considering three podiatrists were unable to diagnose it). Do yourself a favor if you have very rough skin and giveTineacide Antifungal Cream, 1.25-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)a try (must use for at least a month).
