review/text: I'm not going to go into the effectiveness of Motherlove's More Milk Plus but want to warn - Careful, this particular formula has grain alcohol. I bought without knowing or realizing it. I have been using the one WITHOUT alcohol and ran out so bought this on Amazon and noted that it tasted different - it burns (like taking straight shots of vodka) and tastes bad. Upon checking ingredients it shows 42-52% grain alcohol!My preference is for the one without alcohol because it tastes sweeter (actually got so used to it I ended up liking it very much - imagine my distaste when I first put this in my mouth). Not only that, it makes me uncomfortable worrying about traces of alcohol in my b-milk.So 2 stars for this but I'd give the one w/o alcohol 5 stars because it helps with production.
