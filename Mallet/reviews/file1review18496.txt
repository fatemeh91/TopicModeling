review/text: We love this stuff! We used to get it at our local whole foods, however, their prices have sky rocketed, and it's not always available, so we decided to look for it here. As always, Amazon has the better price. I was worried about shipping, but once it arrived, it was individually wrapped (we ordered several) in bubble wrap, and packaged well to keep from breaking. And in case you're wondering what we use it for, I add it to my plain yogurt to give it some flavor. It's very nutritious, and tastes good. It is concentrated, so you either have to mix it with something, or be ready for a strong flavor.
