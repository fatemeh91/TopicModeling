review/text: I read reviews for many different brands and saw many complaints about taste. So i thought I would at least give my thoughts on this. I enjoyed the taste of this product. I sprinkle it over cereal or oatmeal and it adds a nice flavor. I have only been using it for about a week so far, so I don't have anything to say yet about the health benefits, but I will most likely post an update about that later.
