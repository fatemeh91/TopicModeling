review/text: I have used Dr Scholls Adjustible Arch Pain Relief Shoe inserts since I was diagnosed with Plantar Fascitis, and I love them. Plantar Fascitis is a ligament-like band that runs from the the heel to the ball of the foot. When this band becomes strained, the bottom of my feet hurt, inside the foot near the spot where the heel and arch meet.Dr Scholls Adjustable Arch Pain Reliief inserts works for me the best of all the different inserts I have tried. The Podiatrist shoved me some erxercise for the feet, and along with the inserts, my foot problems are virtually non excistant. I used to buy these inserts at Walmart and the Drug Store, but they do not carry these insole any more. I was really delighted when I could buy the item from Amazon.com.I can recommend this product to anybody with foot problems.Gus
