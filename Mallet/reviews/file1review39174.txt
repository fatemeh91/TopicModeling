review/text: Product obviously had a good motor with the way it violently shook my hand when I tried to use it, but the blades didn't cut my hair. It simply tugged on my hair every few seconds, causing it to take me an hour just to shave my head, including a few nicks on my neck. It is possible that it could have just been damaged during shipping, but I wouldn't try this clipper ever again.
