review/text: I live in Phoenix. The weather is extremely hot and dry. Lip Armor works. It's as simple as that. You can feel the relief immediately and it keeps on working. I originally purchased Lip Armor in California after spending the day in the sun and wind out on the water. It would also be great for skiiing. It is perfect for anyone who gets chapped lips. It's a great product and there aren't many products of any type I'd say that about. Give it a try. You won't regret it.
