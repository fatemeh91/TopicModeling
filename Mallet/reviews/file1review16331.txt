review/text: I bought these because I was tired of my cascade dish detergent (liquid) seemingly going so quickly and barely getting the job done.they seem to be cleaning my dishes just fine and I love that I know exactly how many loads I have left to be able to clean. In my house things like that matter- with a small baby often things forget to be bought and then i just run out!I also really like that these are individually sealed. I had bought a bag of individual little detergent balls and after loading the dishwasher my hands would be ever so slightly wet when i went to grab one. the moisture, even minimal started making the rest of them in the bag deteriorate, as they break down when touching water. these being individually wrapped means that I dont ruin them with damp hands when i go to grab them!also.. i dont have any spots on my glasses and they are a good price. overall happy and would recommend and or buy again
