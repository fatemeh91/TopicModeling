review/text: This is by far the best shaver I've ever owned. It's quiet, nicely designed, provides a close shave, comfortable, and works for weeks on one charge (I'm on day 15 for one charge). It has just the features I want(cleaning under the faucet, sensitivity levels)and no more. If you like Norelco, this is the one to buy.
