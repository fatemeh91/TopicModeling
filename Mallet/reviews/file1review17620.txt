review/text: I'm happy with this trimmer. Works great for both my beard and moustache, especially for the price. A single charge lasts for months of weekly use.Pro:- cheap- easy to dial the length for your beard / moustache- easy to clean- charge works great- no huge pile of accessories / heads to keep track of.Con:- Proprietary charging socket. When I lost my charger for my previous copy, I had to buy a whole new setup.- missing a nice way to make trim lines.
