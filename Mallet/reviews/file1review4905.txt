review/text: I live in a bachelor suite and I find that the smell of food gets into my closet and into my clothes. I bought the Oust air cleaner fan to get rid of the cooking smell on my clothes (in my closet). I had to turn off the unit after a few minutes because the smell was awful. I thought Oust was supposed to get rid of odor. The citrus fragrance in the solution smells too much like one those cheap bathroom deodorizers - it's too synthetic it's nauseating. I don't really know if the Oust product actually gets rid of odor or if the strong fragrance in the solution is just MASKING the odor. Now my clothes don't smell like food but my closet smells like a heavily deodorized bathroom.
