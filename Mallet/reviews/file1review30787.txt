review/text: I do karaoke and have over 500 cd-s. I use a special machine to clean them, polish out the scratches and apply an anti-statis spray to them. With these cloths they seem to small and take to long to wipe down my cd's. I'm using some flannel PJ's right now which seem to work great, quickly and no lint or scratches. Hopefully I can find some decent cloths because I clean so many CD's. The machine I use for cleaning the CD-s is professional grade and run's about $199, I can use 1200 grit sandpaper for very deep scratches, but normaly I use two different cleaning compounds and then the spray so there is a lot to clean after I run my CD-s through this machine.
