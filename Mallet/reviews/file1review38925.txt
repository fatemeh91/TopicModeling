review/text: I was very pleased with these Gillette Good News Disposable Razors. My husband also used them and prefers them over any other disposable razors. They are sturdy and provide a good, close shave. This product is a good, basic razor without any fancy handles or decorator colors. I think this is reflected in the price of the Good News razors (compared to some of the newer disposable razors on the market). My husband and I would both recommend this product.
