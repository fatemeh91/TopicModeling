review/text: I purchased these TED hose for my brother who had a stroke.TED hose was soft and easy to put on however they didn't last very long they began to unravel at the toe and the top part around edges after about a couple of weeks, but for the money I would buy them again. The TED hose my brother received in the hospital was of very good quality but they are thigh high and not very easy for me to put on my brother.
