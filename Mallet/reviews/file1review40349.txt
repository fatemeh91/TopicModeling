review/text: I used to be skeptical about herbal remedies, especially when a virus has already take root, so to speak. But my step-mom, who almost never gets sick, gave me echinacea when I had a bad cold, two tablets every 4-6 hours at the first sign of a cold, and darned if the cold was milder and shorter in duration than any previous colds before. Now I take two a day just to generally help boost the immune system. Last time I got sick I started taking these instead, as recommended, and the effect was just as good if not better. Capsules are very dark and that might turn some people off, maybe they should go clear, but these are so dark green they look almost black. But I say give it a shot.
