review/text: I bought this because of all the great reviews and I should have been putting chapstick on my wart for all the results it got me. I put this stuff on and would change the bandaid each day, after few days nothing. When I have used wart products in the past a few day in the skin is always white and eventually starts to gewp off. So either I got a dud too or those other reviews are fakes. This stuff did absolutely nothing.
