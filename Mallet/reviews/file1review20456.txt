review/text: I'm on day two of using this cushion. I cycle/spin three to four days a week and as a result, my tailbone is bruised. Because I work in a seat at a computer for 8 hours or more a day, and do a lot of air travel, I am constantly trying to find a comfortable and not so painful seated position. So I figured a cushion of some type would help. I chose the Tush Cush based on reviews I read and unfortunately, it's not really helping. Only a little, which I am greatful for. There are less expensive options out there so now I feel I like I could've paid less for just a little relief. I'll keep using it of course until my bone is healed.I do like the handle; Will make it easy carry during travel.
