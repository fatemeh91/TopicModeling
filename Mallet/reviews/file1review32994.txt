review/text: This product was recommended to me after hearing me complain about other detergents. I like it quite well. I am a Flight Attendant who lives in an apartment with standard top loading washing machine. I tend to wear the same things on each trip. In fact I unpack into the washer, and repack out of the dryer.My water is far from soft, but not hard by any means. I use one tablespoon on most loads with cold water. I sort my laundry colours, whites, uniforms, and jeans. For whites I use Persil Universal. I do not use fabric softener or dryer sheets. I pour in the Persil then fill the tank. Once the tank is full I add my clothing to be washed.My clothes come out looking, smelling, and feeling great. No feeling of residue which I found with other detergents. Even after being in my suitcase for six days clothes come out smelling great.I ordered a scoop, for free, online at Persil's website after being unable to find one in the box.
