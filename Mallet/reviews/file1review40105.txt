review/text: I had looked all through the stores trying to find a yoga kit that included blocks, straps and a mat and couldn't find anything that had all three. The price of buying them seprately was double the price of this kit. I was worried about the mat quality, but it very good, with no odor. Considering buying a second to keep in the car for going to the gym and have the original at home for videos.
