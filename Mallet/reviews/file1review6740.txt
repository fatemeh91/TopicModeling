review/text: This is a great tool for those with frozen shoulder problems as I have. I was surprised though to find that one of the protruding handles was broken off when it arrived. I have not contacted the seller about this because it still works fine for my needs. I did not want to interrupt my use of this product to ship it back and wait for a new replacement.
