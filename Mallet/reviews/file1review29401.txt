review/text: It's a Zippo. It's orange. The primary reason for getting this model was for camping and hiking. You drop it, it's easy to find. If you know what a Zippo is that you already know all about the quality and performance of this lighter. Keep it filled and it will not fail you. Period.The folks I ordered it from...not so much.I ordered from Burn Wholesale via Amazon. There was an initial delay that I inquired about that was never addressed or responded to. The second question was also ignored. It was the third request that was finally answered. Turned out that the postal service admitted to losing the package. This isn't anything I hold BURN responseble for, but it would have been nice if they would have given m some sort of heads up to so I knew what was going on. Reading other reviews leads me to believe that this was not an isolated problem with these guys.Don't ever worry about ordering a Zippo, just be warned when dealing with Burn.
