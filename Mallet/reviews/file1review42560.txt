review/text: I purchased the 5 pound tub of the Cafe Mocha flavored whey protein and it was surprisingly very good. I would drink 1 scoop in the morning with 8 ounces of 2% milk, 1 scoop immediately after working out with 6 or 7 ounces of water, then 1 scoop before bed with 8 ounces of half milk/half water. Mixing any amount of milk in it definitely makes it taste much better.This is just a solid, whey protein isolate for every day use. Highly recommended.I'm buying another tub of the same flavor right now.
