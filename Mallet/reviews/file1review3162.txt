review/text: After trying several kinds of Trojan (smelled bad) I tried using these and Durex, around the same time. These are extremely thin, very smooth, and oh so good, you know. Out of 20-ish different types, these rank in my favorite 3, along with Durex Extra sensitive and Beyond Seven studded. An excellent product.
