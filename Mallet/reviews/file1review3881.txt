review/text: I 'm on day 3 of 7 days and I can already tell a difference! It is a little inconvenient because you can't talk, eat or drink with the strips in. The strips need to be on twice a day for 30 minutes each time. I put them on during my commute to work, and then again while I'm watching the nightly news. The first couple of times putting them on was a little tricky and uncomfortable, but then you get used to it. When you take them off there is this slimy gel that remains or your teeth. I just wipe it off and it still seems to work. I am experiencing some gum sensitivity, a slight stinging sensation, but nothing unbearable.
