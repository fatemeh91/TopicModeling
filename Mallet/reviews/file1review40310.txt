review/text: Gaia's Quick Defense is phenomenal. I make sure to have it on hand at all times, and I'm now going to take it at the first sign of cold-like symptoms. It works like a charm, nipping any cold in the bud if taken fast enough. And if not taken fast enough, at least it shortens the duration quite noticeably.
