review/text: The Duracell NiMH 2650mAH rechargeable batteries are anything but. After a few charges they failed to hold a charge, even after they had been in one or more of my chargers for several hours. Big disappointment when you are on an 8-hour hike in the mountains and then discover ALL six pairs fail immediately when loaded in your camera. (Fortunately, I carried a non-rechargeable pair so the photo experience was not a total bust). If I could rate them in the minus range, I would.
