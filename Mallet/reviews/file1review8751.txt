review/text: If you have a child or a bear lover yourself you cannot help but love this bear! I bought it for my son for his constant ear infections in hopes he would like it enough to use it for the heat on his ear. Since all other hot water bottles and heating pads wouldn't pass his inspection. Well not only does he like it for that he likes to sleep with it all the time! If you take out the hot water bottle he becomes a great floppy stuffed bear that is sooo soft and when the hot water bottle is in it full it is a perfect size for using as a pillow as well.We have had it now for a couple of months and it looks as good as the day we got it! I will most likely be buying some again soon for gifts as well. Overall one GREAT item!
