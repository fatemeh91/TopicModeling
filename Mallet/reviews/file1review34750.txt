review/text: I've always been terribly sweaty, and the only deodorants that have kept the accompanying odor at bay were clinical strength brands that clog your pores and take steel wool to wash off.This stuff is fantastic, smells fresh almost all day, and sure i sweat still, but that's nothing new. It's well worth it to stay fresh and keep my pores clear at the same time.
