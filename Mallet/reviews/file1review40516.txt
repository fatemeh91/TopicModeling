review/text: After reading all of the glowing reviews of Therabreath products, I wanted to love this one. And I did ... for the one day the product worked. After that, a terribly offensive taste developed in my mouth. My taste buds were altered such that water, tea and many other foods and drinks tasted terrible. This only worsened with continued use. The product literature says something like this may happen and to try sprinkling baking soda on the toothpaste before using it. It also states that this is a temporary effect that will normally last only a couple of days. The baking soda helped a little. However, after a week of this problem continuing I had to give up. Too many foods tasted bad, and it was completely impossible to enjoy a glass of wine. The change was so profound that I was afraid it might be permanent. Happily, after two days of discontinuing use, my taste buds are almost back to normal. My halitosis wasn't bad enough to endure these side effects. Ironically, a couple of days into trying this I couldn't even tell if there was still any bad breath - all sensations were overtaken by the offensive taste. I will find another product to help.
