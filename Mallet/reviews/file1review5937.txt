review/text: Pros: Convenience of having a cup underneath for later mixing drinksat the gym or other. Doesn't appear to have a rubber seal whichother shakers have; which over time can wear and if not seatedproperly can be damaged or stretched.Cons: Size could be about six to eight ounces bigger. Doesn't appear tohave a tight seal. Are you supposed to screw the cap on a certainway? Snap it on? Other?
