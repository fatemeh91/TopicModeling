review/text: I didn't buy this for my beard, I bought this for shaving below the waist. True story.What I don't like about this is that it is a trimmer but is sized like a pair of clippers. Normally, trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades. The blades on this are way too wide to do intricate trimming, beard or otherwise.This just doesn't fit comfortably in my hands, it is just way too thick and I can't comfortably trim with it.They need to market this as actual hair clippers instead of a trimmer. It's just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer.
