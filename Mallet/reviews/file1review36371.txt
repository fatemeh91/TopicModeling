review/text: For those out there that need a little help this is the product for you. My advise with this product is not to get carried away your first time out. Start out with one spray and go from there. This stuff can make you go from rock hard to a limp biscuit if you spray too much on. If you do put to much on the romance will be gone for a couple of hours. Once you figure out how much works for you put it on 10 minutes before show time all the way up to 2 hrs before and then get ready to show your loved ones whats really on your mind. One other important thing to do before showtime is to take some water and wash off the sprayed area. That will get rid of any after taste but won't affect your play on the field. It will make you a new man!
