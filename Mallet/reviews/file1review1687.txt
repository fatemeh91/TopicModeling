review/text: Recently purchased a jar of this from a shoe store and had seen such a great difference in the softness of my heals. It's not greasy either, which is a plus! Use it twice a day (when I remember) and recommend it to anyone with those annoying cracked heals. Foot Cream Deep Healing Pedifix - 4 OZ
