review/text: I purchased this same vacuum over 30 years ago, and itstill works. It's got some wear issues, I'm going toput it in the garage and use it for really dirty workuntil it quits. This new version works great, looks andworks like the old one, but has a lot longer chord anda shoulder strap. The old one was made in the U.S.A,the new one assembled in Mexico, isn't anything madehere anymore?
