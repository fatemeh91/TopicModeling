review/text: The good:One button touch and you are done.It sprays the entire shower and keeps it clean.The not so good:Strong chemical smell.Can not be refilled with other less noxios product/requires purchase specific refills.Out first one stopped working after one month. The second one stopped working after two and a half months.Will not be buying a third one.
