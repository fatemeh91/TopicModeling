review/text: I was a devout Mychelle buyer and loved their products. I bought and returned this item recently when I noticed most of the ingrediants had been changed to cheaper ones. I still have a jar of the original stuff and have searched the internet to find some of the original but cant. Here are some of the first ingrediants in the original one: cherry puree, d-cranberry complex puree, pumpkin puree, apple puree, blueberry puree, jasmine alchohol...and so on. the new jar has the first ingrediant of water and other inexpensive ingreds. I also noticed the new one didnt smell anywhere as good as the old one, and was loaded with xantham gum! so in other words, your still paying a very high price for something that has changed significantly, and without them notifying it on the jar.p.s. talked to someone at wholefoods about it and she said much of their line has changed to cheaper componets.
