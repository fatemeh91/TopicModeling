review/text: I had been using Gillette razors for last 15 years. Every time they came up with better product until this one. The blade life is so short for fusion and that made me try to use Schick Quattro. I have been using the first blade of Quattro for last 4-5 months and blades stay healthy. Quattro is only just a little less comfortable compared to new fusion but stays fresh for much long. I am not switching back to Gillette.
