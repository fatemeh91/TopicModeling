review/text: My dad used to get me industrial cloths from a guy that works with the DOT but ever since he stopped working I wasn't able to get anymore. I found these because I wanted cloths I would be able to use for multitasking but they're not all that. They can do a good job but I was looking for something more stronger. Now I'm just using them as a replacement for swifter refills. Pour some Mr. Clean on the floor, wipe it up with the swifter and I'm good to go.
