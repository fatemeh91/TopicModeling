review/text: My gynecologist recommended a Jack Rabbit to reduce vaginal dryness during intercourse. He said the more you use it, the less dry you will be. He was right. And the product does perform up to expectations. I will however say, the Platinum Mulifuction is a bit better. This one does have as much power and function as the Platinum. Either one is 50% cheaper than going to a local store.
