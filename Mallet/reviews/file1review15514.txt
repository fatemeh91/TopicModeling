review/text: Great deal, now at 20 each.When thinking about rechargeable batteries,be aware that many (if not all) have a fullcharge voltage of 1.25V, while the alkalineshave 1.5V -- some equipment, like the flashattachment on my digital camera, will NOT workwith 4 rechargeable batteries (5V) but WILL WORKwith 4 alkalines (6V). Test before making majorpurchases...
