review/text: A friend of mine recommended this flavor to me one day and then proceeded to tell me she thought they had discontinued this particular flavor. I had tried the fruit smoothies flavors and was a fan but the cocoa and creme sounded like a dream. She emailed me the link that night to Amazon.com where she once again found the cocoa and creme. I received my order quickly and after just one I agreed with her that this was the best Tums I had ever tried and would gladly sit down and eat the whole bottle. I proceeded to order 2 more bottles in fear that I would never find them again. Now my husband who rarely gets indigestion has invaded my stash claiming heart burn that I'm pretty sure doesn't exist but at least he's getting the calcium. Thanks Tums!!! But why did you take this flavor off the market????? Please, please bring it back.
