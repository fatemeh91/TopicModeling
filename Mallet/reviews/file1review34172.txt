review/text: After reading all the positive reviews, I was hopeful this would help. Not true! I put it on before bed and it burned like crazy. It was so strong I felt my heart racing and couldn't sleep. After about an hour it still hadn't stopped stinging so I had to rinse it off. I had to useBoiron Avenoc Suppositories, 12 suppositories (Pack of 2)to soothe the area. I tried it once more the next day with the same result. Not only was it unpleasant to use, but the smell was sickening. I had to take my garbage out to the bin as it lingered all over the room. I couldn't imagine using this stuff before work! I have my doubts about some of these 5-star reviews being legitimate. Several are similar in tone and language, using plays on words and instructing people what products to use in great detail. I have been shopping on Amazon for years and they don't look real to me. Buyer beware!
