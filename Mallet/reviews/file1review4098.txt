review/text: I am very happy with the Gillette Fusion Power. Gives me the best shave I've ever had, and I shave daily. Very smooth results, and no irritation.I actually received some faulty blades from my recent order - they pulled and dragged on my face, and caused me to breakout. So after testing each blade in the pack, I called Gillette (1-800-GILLETTE, of course) and brought this to their attention. Within about 4 days, I had a coupon in my mailbox for a free replacement 8 pack. And I didn't even have to send the old ones back - they went right in the trash.So kudos on the product, and kudos on the customer service!!
