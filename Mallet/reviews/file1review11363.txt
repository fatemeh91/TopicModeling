review/text: I've only used this a few times so it may not have had time to work, but with the way my hands are IT STINGS SOOOOOOOO BAD!!! It hurts like hell!! Don't put on open open cracks or sores!!!! You WILL regret it!!By the way, this is NOT a cream. It's a dry oil. It does soak into the skin fast, but remember it is an oil not a cream!!AND IT HURTS!!!
