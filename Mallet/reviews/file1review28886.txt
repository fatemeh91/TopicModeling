review/text: Tastes great with cold milk. Only use the 4-6oz of milk per the directions and a heaping scoop of the product. Blend and drink. Very chocolaty and rich. None of that "protein shake" aftertaste. I actually consider it a treat. The low sugar and low fat per serving with the high protein count gives you the bang for your buck.
