review/text: The product is good yes, but you still need to use some elbow grease even after applying the product for days on glass doors/windowsThe previous tenants of our apartment were not very clean so the shower window and doors (glass) were stained VERY bad. After a few weeks of using this product I was able to remove most of the stains but it's just not good enough to remove everything 100%I guess it did kill all the germs but I need something stronger for those glass stains (hmmm... maybe acid? lol)
