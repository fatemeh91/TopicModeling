review/text: Was given this tub as a gift and couldn't be happier. Not sure what other reviewers are writing about this tub leaking - it's meant to use over / in the sink or bathtub. Holds a small amount of water - just enough to keep baby wet and warm while you wash. Folding mechanism never caused issue with pinching or getting stuck in the many many months we used this for our daughter. It worked well for our double sink because it rested snugly on one side and was quite secure. We used it nightly, drained the water out when we were done, and then folded it up and put it back under the sink. Perfect in apartment when we didn't have tons of space.
