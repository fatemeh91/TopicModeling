review/text: I have used this for some time now, and feel so much better doing so! I was buying the same bottle for $23.00 + at Whole Foods before finding it here. AFTER HAVING TO undergo chelation treatment for heavy metal toxicity; I through out all of my old aluminum deodorants. After not being able to find anything that worked, I gave the weleda I shot (love their other products). Loved it, and have been using it ever since. I love not worrying about any junk being absorbed into my body that could cause the return of health problems. Expensive; and worth every penny!
