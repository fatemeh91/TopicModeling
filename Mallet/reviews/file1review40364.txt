review/text: This is kind of supplement that you are supposed to take at first signs of cold or sickness. It has 20 capsules and you are supposed to take them all in within a couple of days. My husband did get better in a couple of days after taking it, but he was also drinking lots of liquids and eating foods rich in Vitamin C. I am indifferent to this. If you are desperate to get rid of symptoms and want to do everything not to get very sick - this could help. But I much prefer just lots of fresh ginger and rose hips. Be well!
