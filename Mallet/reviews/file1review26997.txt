review/text: Iv been on an ANTI-FUNGAL DIET for 1month and been waitng for this product and mroe to come.which have come!!! did my arms workout today with heavier weights,more intensity!! and of course..more love and happiness!!! knowing these products have come!!TASTE--Amazing taste.iv tasted many flavors from OPtiumum nutrition and this one is the best one so far for my taste buds,this one or chocolate mint.TEXTURE--Thickness of the shake id say 3/5 not sludgy thick but thick enough to make it creamyproduct came quick and came right in the middle of my workout with creatine!! so really gonna bulk upAlso a tip....for best bulking up results.do a bulking phase after youve gone through a low carb phase and OR removing all processed foods and milk*including whey*...this is what iv done and if you know how to time the foods and supplements right.you WILL build mass,about 1 lb a month,even more if your aroudn age of 18-26.when your testosterone is up the roof
