review/text: I had one before this one that was smaller and so much easier to work with. It dropped onto the floor and never did work right after that. I tried to find the same thing but looks like they quit making that model. This one is just not nearly as easy to use. I really liked that other one. I am the wife that gets stuck doing the trimming around the beard etc.
