review/text: Turning 52 years old this month. This vitamin has changed my life. The postmenopausal symptoms are addressed, but issues with stamina and energy and strength that I have been fighting all my life have surprisingly, to my delight, been solved with this supplement. My body just wasn't getting what I needed from the foods I was eating and the other supplements I have tried over the years. If I take all 6 of them along with extra potassium and calcium every day, I feel like a million dollars. If I miss a day I feel it, if I miss 2 days I am weak, have a hard time climbing the stairs, etc. (I am running up the stairs these days). This is a water soluble whole food vitamin, so you need to take it throughout the day so that your body can assimilate what it needs as the day goes on. If you take them all at once, your body will rid itself of what it doesn't need at the moment and then you will not have it for later if you do not take the 2nd or 3rd dose. Makes sense to me. Works for me. Not a big deal to take it 3 times a day once I realized that it made such a difference in my feeling of well being. Good stuff, worth every penney. I have it on the monthly mailing so that I don't ever run out again!
