review/text: The Black&Decker;Black & Decker HV9010P Retriever Pet-Series Cyclonic-Action Corded Dustbuster and BlowerPet-Series Dustbuster works terrific on pet hair in the dog beds. It is lightweight but sturdy, right power for hair, filter easy to access and empty, plenty long cord, and it picks up hair with one pass.Noisy enough to scare the dogs.It sells on Amazon for about $30 &I; get no commission. :-)
