review/text: Couldn't be happier with this protein! Defintaly works well. 24g of protein is a great ammout. And the added BCAAS and other stuff is a great addition to the protein, best of all it dosent taste like cardboard like most proteins! The taste is actually really good, Esp with some added Peanut butter! I defintaly highly recommend this product.
