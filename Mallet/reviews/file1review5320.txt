review/text: I originally bought GinGins when I was pregnant to help stave off boughts of nausea, and they really work! I keep them by my bed so if I wake up nauseous, I can pop one in my mouth before I sit up. However, they continued to be a go to for motion sickness and colds. They're great melted in hot tea when you're congested. Now, we always have some in the house!
