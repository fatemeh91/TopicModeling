review/text: with a chronically dry itchy back i've tried other type of lotion applicators, and none nearly as good as this.I've had several of the type with a cup for lotion that screws onto a surface with roller balls, the cups always fall off/ come unscrewed and never work, always end up just squirting lotion or cortaid on the surface, then the balls always come off after awhile.the sponge type always get yucky and gunky and the sponges have to be changed and washed (in all your spare time). This one's roller is non absorbent, sort of a soft rubber surface, and works really well. like the others made of cheap plastic so probably won't last forever but definitely the best option out there.
