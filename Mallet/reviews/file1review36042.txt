review/text: This stuff taste like ****, no matter what you dilute it with. The aftertaste you get right after taken it is indescribable. I found a way to eliminate the flavor that works for me. I mix the powder with about 8 ounces (your choice) of liquid than I immediately follow it down with a teaspoon of Rose's Lime Juice. I don't even notice the flavor anymore. The small 10Cal you get from the Lime juice is not even worth worrying about for those "calorie counters". I do notice many benefits from the product, lower blood pressure, easier erections, increased vascularity, etc. I don't feel the Pre-Work Out pumps though (may not be taking enough). I take 6g in the morning and 6g evening with 30mg Pygogenol. At this price, it wouldn't hurt to try it.
