review/text: Perfect B-Complex, next time will buy it again. I had B12 deficit and doctor recommended me to get B Complex. Well, I really feel the difference. I'm ending it now, 3 months passed and I'm full of energy, my skin, hair and nails look much more better, have no problems with blood, no headaches. Great!
