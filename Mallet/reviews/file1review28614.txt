review/text: Flavor wise this is a vanilla that goes down very nicely. Content wise I can only go off of what I have read, which is that this brand is known for using good quality/purity ingredients as opposed to some others, but I will leave that for the scientists and just stick with what I know - for the dollar/size/flavor, this one delivers.
