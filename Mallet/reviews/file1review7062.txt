review/text: HiI bought this shaver based on customer reviews,,So much for trusting anonymous reviews.. First of all it's cheaply made.....Motor is loud and slow compared to good shavers...had to glue charger together with super glue... one head on personal trimmer was broke.......poor quality shave even with the closest head it's not close.....takes 15 hours of charging for a few minutes of shaving....If this truly is the last American made shaver it's a sad commentary on what we are turning out......Try a Braun Free Control for a foil Shaver or a Norelco for rotory and forget this junk.....well the first shave wasn't too bad and it's all down hill from there.
