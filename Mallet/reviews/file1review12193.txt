review/text: I have been taking these for over a week. I am not pregnant but I need the vitamins and want to prep for when I do start having children. The pill is JUST ONE, i love that about it and i don't have to take 6 pills a day which is annoying. It is not huge, easy to swallow. A 5 months supply cost about $20 which is awesome, good deal.I will update after I have been taking it for a longer amount of time.
