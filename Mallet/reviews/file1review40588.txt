review/text: The price alone forced me to be diligent in at least giving it a fair shot. I scraped and rinsed every dish, used the "pots & pans" cycle...even tried running it twice (undoing the environmental benefit, I'm sure), to no avail. Cloudy, grimy dishes at the end. If you don't love finding what looks like bird poop adhered to the bottom of your wine glasses, buy another detergent that works.
