review/text: I have been buying these batteries for the last 4 years. I think the quality was good a couple of years ago, but the new ones don't hold the charge like the old ones used to do. My charges has been a disaster also. I have a CEF14N model and it gets HOT and turn OFF. Again, the quality was better in my same previous charger a couple of years ago.
