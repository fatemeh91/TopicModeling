review/text: This is one of three Merkur razors I have purchased - the first one was the long-handled version of this one - I purchased for my husband. We had a small fortune invested in the Mach razors - which never really worked except for the first shave. A few minor nicks the first few times he used it, but quickly got the hang of it and it gives him a very close, non-irritating shave (we also use natural goats milk soap rather than chemical "shaving cream"). Then I purchased this one (short handle) for my teenage son. He loves it, too. I also purchased the 1904 replica for myself - I figured if it worked so well for the guys, it might work great for the girls. And it does. Nice close shave without stripping my skin. Respect the razor, know the proper way to use a safety-razor and you will never want to go back to those other things again.The short-handled razors like this one are great for my small hands and my teenage son, but a man with large hands would probably prefer the long-handled razor (which is about the same length as a Mach razor). Also, the 1904 one has "open" teeth whereas this one does not. To me, both types give just as close a shave - I see no difference (neither does my husband). Perhaps those who allow their beard/hair to grow longer before they shave might find a difference.
