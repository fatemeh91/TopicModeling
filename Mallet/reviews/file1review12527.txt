review/text: I only took this for four days, three weeks ago, and I have felt great since! As a nutritionist and professional in the natural foods field, when I initially had an "issue", I turned to massive quantities of fiber in the form of natural fruits and vegetables. UGH! That really made things worse! I was so bloated and miserable! I have tried other cleansers that utilized the fiber method and also did not have much luck with those. Out of desperation, I tried this, and it really works!Granted, while you are taking it it is rather unpleasant. Maybe you can do your spouse or significant other a favor, and sleep on the couch until you are through with it. Going to work is a challenge too.
