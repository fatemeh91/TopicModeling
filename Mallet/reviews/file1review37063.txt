review/text: I purchased this to replace by gum stimulator, because I could not get replacement tips for it. I was thrilled with both the flosser and the pick. They work very well. The only problem is after about 3 months the unit stopped working. I replaced the battery - it wasn't that. Thinking I just got a bad unit I bought another one. Now after about 3 months this one is doing the same thing! Sometimes when you press the button it doesn't run. I have to tap it on the countertop or shake it to get it started. I don't want to buy a new one every three months.PS. I soak the flosser and the pick in antiseptic mouthwash overnight so I can reuse them for a week or more.
