review/text: If you ever find yourself searching drawers for batteries, then this pack is for you. I ordered this with a deal of the day and am not disappointed. I have a Wii with multiple remotes and I have yet to purchase the rechargeable battery packs for the remotes. It never fails that when the batteries run out, there are never any around the house to replace them with. This came just in time to fix that problem and there are plenty left over for emergencies (because it won't be long before the bluetooth keyboard, mouse, or TV remote batteries need replacing I'm sure...) I am definitely not brand loyal when it comes to batteries and these seem to be as good as any. Finding room for all the packaging was a headache, so I just pulled out all the batteries and put them in a ziplock bag in my "stuff" drawer.
