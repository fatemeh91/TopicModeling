review/text: After purchasing other neck wraps, I purchase this Elasto gel 6 years ago and it was the best thing I have ever bought. It has held up wonderfully. I wear it alot, especially in the winter. It is very comfortable and well made, easy to clean. The heat lasts for a long time so it is not 'a pain in the neck' always getting up to reheat. It instantly goes to the pain and soothes the soreness I get from surgery to the head/neck/shoulder area. I wear it for support also when I fly (kindly put it on the xray conveyor though or you have to be scanned and swiped for drugs it draws alot of attention from security) or long car trips. When I am at the computer for hours on end it helps with stiffness. It does help me with migranes and sinus headaches if I lay down and put it on those areas also. All other wraps for the neck felt like I was being strangled but this is very adjustable and sometimes if I am just sitting still I won't even have to put the strap on I just let it hang on my neck and shoulders.
