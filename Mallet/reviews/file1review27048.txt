review/text: The Milk Chocolate isnt that bad at all. It has a creamer in it that makes it very smooth and milkshake like. I only tried it with skim milk and a little water or almond milk and a little water. either way it tastes really good.I tried the cookies and cream and i like that much better but who doesn't like cookies and cream.Next i want to try the toffee one but that usually is the most expensive of the bunch
