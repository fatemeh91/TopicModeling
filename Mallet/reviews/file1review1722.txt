review/text: My boyfriend had the world's WORST SMELLING feet!!!!! So his socks constantly smell like death and normal laundry soap just doesn't get rid of the smell. I decided to use FungaSoap along with our normal detergent to see if it would help with the smell...boy it sure did! Using FungaSoap as an additional detergent really got rid of the smell, so I recommend this product to anyone who might have a foot odor or body odor. Just add one squeeze around the washer.
