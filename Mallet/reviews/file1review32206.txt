review/text: My sister recommended the Doc Johnson Pocket Rocket and this was the cheapest model of it at the time. I had previously bought a knockoff in a novelty shop and loved it until the motor wore out after a couple uses. Well I've used this several times and the motor is still going strong, so I guess this is one instance where branding is actually more than just packaging.The vibrations are strong for me (although I know everyone's different). It's much stronger than the little bullet I have which only runs on watch batteries, and the AA is much easier to find than a watch battery. Also, the battery seems to last a good long while, even if you leave it in between uses (which I know I'm not supposed to.) I took it in the shower a couple times and the battery didn't get wet, but I expect that the rubber seal will be the first thing to wear down. Be careful when turning it off under running water not to open it! The on/off takes a light touch.It doesn't matter to me, but you may care to know that the item I received was not plain as in the picture, but had the Doc Johnson logo on it on the thicker part of the vibe just above the controls.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an external massager.
