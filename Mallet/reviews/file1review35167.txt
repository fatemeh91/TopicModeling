review/text: If you're too sweet(i.e. diabetic) like me, then give this meal bar a try. You don't have to feel deprived anymore. All the flavors are great, especially Oatmeal Raisin(my second favorite) but I'm reviewing Chocolate Chunk because it's the one I like most.Unlike many other sugar free foods this does not have a bland,chalky or chemical taste. These bars taste good, like something you would eat even if you didn't have diabetes. You get a decent chocolatey flavor and a pleasant texture. Also, you can really substitute one of these for a meal. I eat one for breakfast every day(I hate to get up early enough to eat breakfast)Like the other reviewer wrote, check with your doctor or diabetes educator before you try one, but they shouldn't have a problem with this product.So treat yourself to a Glucerna Chocolate Chunk bar. It's tough being diabetic and you deserve a treat!
