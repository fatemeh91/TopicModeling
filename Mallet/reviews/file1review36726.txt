review/text: This is the chewable vitamin C I use the most, and this is my favorite flavor of the Natural Factors brand. It comes in convenient 500 mg. tablets. I like to keep several bottles of these on hand at all times. If I begin to get a cold or flu, taking extra vitamin C helps prevent it worsening.These are the ingredients listed on the label:"Dextrose, fructose, cellulose, peach, passionfruit & mango flavors, magnesium stearate (vegetable grade), citric acid, natural color, citrus bioflavonoids, hesperidin bioflavonoids, rosehips powder, rutin, silica. Contains no artificial color or sweeteners; no yeast."There are 10 calories per tablet, basically from the sweetener which makes the chewable C more palatable.
