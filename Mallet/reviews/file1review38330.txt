review/text: It covers a larger area so it takes half the time. Its a bit uncomfortable to use in curvy location such as underarms and bikini line. However it comes with a sensitive skin shaver attachment which is painless and removes unwanted hair quickly. Can't use this product on face (at least its not recommended.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.
