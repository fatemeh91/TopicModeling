review/text: I am a licensed physical therapist asst., who has specialized in myofascial release (gentle, sustained pressure techniques to release adhesions and realign the spine, neck, and pelvis). If you want a tool for home use or even in your practice, this product is TERRIFIC for releasing adhesions and tight areas in the body. I personally own and use this product myself, as I was in a car wreck in 2010, and have a spinal fusion from T7 TO L1 (with two Harrington rods and 10 screws).BACK BUDDY PROS:1) WELL CONSTRUCTED device, made of STURDY, THICK plastic material.2) Has BOTH smooth, rounded points, as well as angled/pointed knobs to allow for less or more intense application of pressure.3) EXCELLENT for HARD TO REACH AREAS - this product, as compared to the 'Theracane', offers more points and an additional 'curve' to target hard to reach areas on the back, thus allowing many more options for use.4) Comes with an easy to follow instructional guide which is EXTREMELY helpful, especially for those who are not familiar with how to use this type of device.5) Has points spaced out PERFECTLY to target BOTH sides of the lower back at the same time (as well as precisely place points to target both sides of the neck).6) Lessens the need to go to a physical therapist if used properly.7) REALLY WORKS to break up adhesions in the fascia for pain relief!8) Cost is reasonable.CONS OF THE BACK BUDDY:1) The product is undoubtedly STURDY, but is a bit on the HEAVY side. Be sure to read the instructions, and maybe even see a therapist so that you use this product properly - If not used properly, you will fatigue OTHER muscles during use, and that could result in adhesions in other areas. Try your best to RELAX when you use this product to get the best benefits. Let your body weight do the work for you instead of 'pulling down' with your hands to apply pressure.2) As compared to the 'Theracane', (which I have also used), again, the Back Buddy is heavier and more cumbersome. If you have good range of motion and want a lighter tool, the 'Theracane' may be a better option. Keep in mind, however, that the Back Buddy exceeds the Theracane because it has more points, and if your range of motion is limited, the Back Buddy is a better choice due to the 'extra curve' that will help to reach places easier.
