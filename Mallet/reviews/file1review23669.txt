review/text: I work in a boatyard and use them pretty much everydayThese gloves are great for dirt and grime work but don't hold up with any kind of oil, gas, diesel fuel or solvent as General cleanupThey'll just double in size and get very frail. Sometimes I just double glove for thatThe one chemical they will hold up in is acetone (fiber glass workers use them all the time and acetone is used a lot)We have some non latex gloves that hold up better in oily work but aren't as strong.
