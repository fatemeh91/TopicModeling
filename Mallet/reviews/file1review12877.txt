review/text: If you like freezing your corneas, but want to maintain that baggage around your eyes, then this product is for you. I don't know if there is a shortage of product testers where this was made, but this is clearly an awful design, and it loses it's cool in less than 10 minutes. Stick with a damp cloth.
