review/text: This is a great product for the money. I live by myself and tried cutting my own hair for the first time. It worked great after I figured out how to use a hand held mirror with the wall mounted bathroom mirror for trimming the collar line, behind the ears and back of the neck. I used the largest comb guide first with excellent results. Some previous reviews complained of being too heavy and noisy. I found no issue with these concerns. Also, I like the idea it's AC powered so one has constant power throughout the cut unlike rechargeable types which may gradually run down in a single setting.This is great if one has young, older, or retired males in the household and can save you a ton of money in the long run, not to mention one doesn't have to wait in line for a hair cut!
