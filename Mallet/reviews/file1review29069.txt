review/text: I really should know better. You never buy anything that claims it takes care of all your needs. I really was in the market for a new beard trimmer as my old Norelco had finally died. I had also planned to buy on of the more expensive self-cleaning Braun's later on. But I saw this and thought I would kill two birds with one stone. No such luck, the shaver part works great and am very happy with it (but would have rather had the self-cleaning model) The beard trimmer part does not work that well. Took several passes to trim my beard evenly, and if your going for that stubble look it does not trim close enough. Even my 6-year-old Norelco took only one pass. I will use this as my primary razor for a few months till I can afford to buy the more expensive self-cleaning model. Then use this as my travel razor as it is one unit to pack instead of 2.Save the money and buy a sole beard trimmer and a sole shaver. You will be much happier and feel less taken by marketing.
