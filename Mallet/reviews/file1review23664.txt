review/text: I have been an ASE Certified Master Mechanic since 1974 and over the years have used many different types and styles of gloves to protect my most valuable tools, my hands! I, once I tried these gloves, will probably never use any others. I am able to reuse these; I let them dry inside out, which I am seldom can with other styles. They hold up well and I suggest others to use them.
