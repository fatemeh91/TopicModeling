review/text: I've been taking this product for 3 months now and can finally conclude that this product does help in relieving dry eye. After about 2 months I was starting to give up hope because my eyes were very dry and I would be using eye drops on a daily basis. I have had no lasik surgery done, I just happen to have been diagnosed with dry eye. The bottle says that for the best results you should take the tablets beyond 4 to 8 weeks and even though I was reluctant to do so, my eyes started to feel better after the 8 week mark. Now all I do to relieve my eye problem is take 3 tablets a day along with using hot compresses to the eyes twice daily and I feel fine.Furthermore, your mouth does smell a bit like fish after you've taking the tablets but it's not intolerable at all. I would just pop in a mint right after and I'm good to go! Hope this helps.
