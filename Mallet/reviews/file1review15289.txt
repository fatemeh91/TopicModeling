review/text: I've tried A LOT of different bars over the years. Many serve a specific function like "high protein" for after resistance training or "150 calories or less" for a light snack. In the general, "meal replacement" category, I always seem to come back to Balance Bars, and Peanut Butter in particular. It's not overly sweet like many of bars that try to be more like candy bars and at 200 calories, it satisfies perfectly. I am a Peanut Butter fan and this bar tastes really good. You're not going to think you are eating a spoonful of PB, but the taste, consistency and chewiness all make you feel like you've eaten something. Sometimes bars just disappear and you wonder if you ever ate anything at all! As the name says - this is a nice nutritionally BALANCED bar that will fill in as a nice snack.
