review/text: Its always fun to own a Zippo. I am not sure though that the description "uses butane fuel" is accurate. Its not airtight enough. Flares up! Its neat, cause it burns much too quickly to cause serious injury (although it most definitely could). I'm new to these lighters, so I am not sure if what I am doing something wrong (overfilling, for instance), but after flaring up, the wick stops lighting up even though the flint creates a spark.
