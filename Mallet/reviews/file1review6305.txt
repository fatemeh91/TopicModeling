review/text: I was given a few samples and was amazed at how it relieved pain without the horrible smell usually associated with pain relieving rubs.It does not burn nor have a menthol scent.It has a lemony scent and thin cream texture. It rubs on and gives relief quickly. It is not easily available at pharmacies but found it on Amazon at a reasonable price.
