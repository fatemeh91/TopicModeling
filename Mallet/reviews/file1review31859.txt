review/text: I truly treat this stuff as a reward. I usually dread shaving each morning, but I tell myself if I finish shaving, I can use this stuff. I'm a huge fan of lemon essential oil. That leads me to the only problem I have with this aftershave, the smell doesn't linger long enough! Probably lasts about 10 minutes... maybe 20. Which is a shame because when you put it on, it's a blissful moment. Citrus smells are supposed to give your brain a euphoric kick and this sure does for me. BLAH BLAH, it smells good. Okay, how about the actual after shave element? Sets in quicker than any other after shave I've tried and soothes irritation and red bumps immediately. I often have this burning feeling with many after shaves before the relief eventually comes, not with this at all. The impact really is immediate and I will say, you only have to use the smallest of dabs to cover your entire beard zone so even with the high price, it will last a pretty long time.
