review/text: I'm a massage therapist and bought the Body Back Buddy to reach the knots I couldn't convince my husband to rub deep enough to release. It reaches and has different shaped knobs to massage and smooth knotted muscle. I debated between this product and the TheraCane and hesitated because I thought this would be more difficult to use. The dual handles make it possible to reach exactly where I need to and I hang it in my closet to store.
