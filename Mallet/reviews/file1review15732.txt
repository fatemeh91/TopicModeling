review/text: I love the three in one, in this very sexy design. I have one of these and after I got it, my wife had to have one. I don't use pencil that often because they are a pain to carry around as a second device you have to go fishing for. But you never realize how often a .05 pencil will come in handy until you have one already in your hand. Same with red ink. Ink runs out pretty fast though, so get some refills and have them handy. It came with a soft top for using as a stylus. I think that is cool, but I just use my thumb, so I've never used it. Either way, great value.
