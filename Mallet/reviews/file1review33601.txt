review/text: I hesitated before purchasing this, just because of the unsatisfied comments others have made. But let me tell you, I now understand why they all made those comments and can say with conviction, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT! I also experienced water leakage and no water pumping through. Both are simple fixes.To prevent the water leaking, PROPERLY and FIRMLY place the reservior onto the unit. Doing so creates a seal and it wont leak. If it does, it wasnt placed on properly. Try it again, you will eventually get the hang of it. I only had 'leaks' the first couple days.As for it not pumping any water when it is turned on, you just need to read the instructions. It says you need to PRIME it by removing the pic, placing the hose lower than the reservior, setting it to maximum, and turning it on until water runs through. This isnt a one time thing. You need to do this each night you use it; by doing so, it will work fine. If you dont, then water wont pump through until you PRIME it again. It only adds a few seconds to your routine, but nothing to be complaining to the company about.The unit is a little noisy, but again, not enough to complain about, unless someone is trying to sleep.It works great. I've had mine for about 6 months now, using it nightly, and other than getting oriented to a new product, I haven't had any problems with it.
