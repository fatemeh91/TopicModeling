review/text: This item works well for my father who needs the steadiness and supportive handles plus raised seat when he visits outside of assisted living. He would like the seat to be higher, but the handles give him something to brace himself with when sitting and rising. It is sturdy and stable, easy to remove from the toilet. I also appreciate that there is no gap between it and the toilet itself. Some toilet seats allow urine to get out between the seat and toilet base. It also will fit both round and oval toilets.
