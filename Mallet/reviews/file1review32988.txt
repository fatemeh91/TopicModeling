review/text: I thought anyone would have been crazy to spend almost $50 for one container of laundry detergent...and then I got my Miele washing machine (front-loading, super-efficient, great German engineering, super-high quality washer). Miele recommends Persil laundry detergents since they follow the European way of doing laundry--smaller loads using less water and less detergent and no added fabric softeners (or a speck of their approved brands). I got over the sticker shock and ordered the Megaperls Color. That one box lasted 14 months since you only use 1-2 tablespoons per load, depending on what you wash. I do 5-9 loads of laundry per week of jeans, khakis, polo shirts, sweaters, blouses, socks and underwear, and towels. Everything comes out clean and fresh WITHOUT the detergent smell overpowering everything. If I have a stubborn stain like spaghetti sauce or motor oil, I still pretreat with a dab of Era though, toss in wash and it always comes out clean. I was initally concerned that the powder would clump in a cold wash, but it has never clumped and always washed out thoroughly, not to mention never leaving that gummy-feeling on clothes that some liquid detergents do.I know it sounds crazy to suggest this "expensive" laundry detergent, but IF you have a high-effiency FRONT-loading washer, doing my max of 9 loads per week x 52 weeks year = 468 loads per year. $47 / 468 = .10 per load. A 30-load Cheer at $4.99 comes out to .17 per load, and you'd have to buy 16 bottles to do my 468 loads in a year. AND you don't have to buy it as often as the bottles, AND since you use less detergent, it's less you are washing down the drain or loading in your septic tank. After using it on my husband's and my clothes for a little over a year, and just now buying my second box, I am very happy with its ability to clean our clothes, not an overpowering smell to deal with, and its cost-effectiveness, I heartily recommend Persil.
