review/text: There are plenty of reviews of this product so I'll make this short and sweet. This trimmer works well in all areas of the body. We, my wife and I, have used it for everything from cleaning up the back of my neck/hairline to trimming my bushy eyebrows. I'd imagine you could easily use it to keep many other areas of your body trimmed as well. It has 9 adjustable settings on the length that could certainly be long or short enough for anyone. We use 4 out of 9 on my eyebrows. It seems to hold it's charge for a quite a while and cleans up quite easily. The only potential downfall to the product is that it is dry only so you can't use it in the shower. Overall, it is a very versatile trimmer that offers an even trim at whatever length you desire. I would certainly recommend this to anyone, especially considering how cheap it is!
