review/text: I have a chocolate or vanilla ON shake almost daily, usually for breakfast. It has a great calorie profile (almost all protein) and tastes good for a protein shake. The vanilla tastes good in milk or juice blended with berries and spinach (add ice or freeze the berries). Then chocolate is great in milk, blended with a banana and spinach (add ice or freeze the banana). I don't care for the taste in water.The shake goes down easily and is great as a recovery drink too. The price is competitive with other cheaper protein shakes, particularly with subscribe and save.
