review/text: I must say that this product does exactly as described. It numbs out your penis so that you can perform for much longer.That said, I recommend testing this stuff on yourself first before you really use it. It says to use at least 3 sprays for minimal effect. I have to only use one good spray on the underside of the head of my penis, the most sensitive spot for me, for it to work well. I messed around and used three as the directions said to do, then I spread it around a little all over the end, and in about 20 minutes I was so numb I could do absolutely nothing. It's a strange sensation to say the least when it's that numb.I use this sparingly. I still want to be able to feel something so I can at least get an effective erection and enjoy myself.The end result after finding the right amount to use for me? Let me put it this way. I'm 46 years old and I have always wanted to perform for longer than 5 minutes. I've never been a premature ejaculator, but I've never been able to go for more than 5 minutes.The first time I used it secretly, and I rocked my wife's world for over 20 minutes. She was asking what in the world got into me and I finally told her. At first I was a little afraid she might think it was weird, but she was totally okay with it.Another word of advice, if you think that oral sex may enter the picture, be sure that after it has taken effect to wash the remaining residue off as with anything that has Lidocaine in it, it can be quite bitter.Pros-Works quickly and effectivelyIs very affordableI believe it has changed my sex life with my wife foreverCons-Use sparingly, it works almost too wellHas a bitter taste if engaging in oral sex
