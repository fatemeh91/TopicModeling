review/text: If you really want a sour lollipop, go with one that doesn't use marketing tricks to sell their product at inflated prices. Preggie pops are essentially the exact same product as YummyEarth lollipops, which are organic and are made in sour flavors as well. The only difference is, they are sold as just lollipops (not a morning sickness cure) and thus are a fraction of the cost. In regards to effectiveness, these drops unfortunately did nothing for me. The only thing they did do was make my mouth so raw it bled, but I was still throwing up and sick all day. I would not recommend this product to anyone!
