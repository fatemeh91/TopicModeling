review/text: I've been weightlifting for several years now and hadn't really focused on body fat reduction till a couple of months ago. So I had a good 15-20 lbs of extra fat on me. I had tried going low carb before to see if it would help cut body fat, but didn't to a "cutting phase" like a lot of other body builders. Low carb (&lt;150g per day) worked a little but I got MUCH better results with CUTS in the mix.My Routine IS: Lifting 4x a week, Cardio 5x a week (30 mins after lifting)Diet: Carbs (&lt;180g), Calories: 2800Week 1 On Cuts: Lost about 2 lbs and noticed slightly better tone in body.Week 2 On Cuts: Lost total of 4 lbs with about 1 inch off my waist and little bit of fat loss on my back.Week 3 On Cuts: Lost total of 5 lbs with total 2 inches off my waist and noticeable loss of fat from back and abs.Negative Effects: Trouble sleeping for first 5-6 days. Fixed this by taking second packet at 11 AM.Positive Effects: Less tired during the day.I'm taking a week off before I start another cycle (as recommended). Overall, I really liked this product. But don't expect miracles without proper diet and exercise.
