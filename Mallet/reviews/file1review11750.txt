review/text: Prosure was recommended by the cancer center nutritionist for a patient steadily losing weight. It was not available in stores but we found it on Amazon. The patient liked the eggnog like flavor and the fact it had lots of protein and was low in sugar at 10g. (Patient has diabetes brought on by cancer.) Due to infusions, a trial drug and prosure, the patient is now gaining weight.
