review/text: They should sell these in multi packs, really! I used this one on my eye glasses so obviously I'm going to need many more of them for all the various optical products in my world. They work very well indeed and are small and easy to slip into a camera bag or purse. Alas, also very easy to lose!! Reasonably priced, especially compared to those on sale in eyeglass stores!!
