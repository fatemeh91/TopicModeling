review/text: So easy to use ... only careful about the length of the attachment you want to use. I usually get my hair cut with scissors. But once I got the "Wahl 79524 26-Piece Deluxe Hair Clipper Kit" it's even easier and smoother and looks so nice. A person who did never cut hair used this kit - of course guide them properly - and I got my hair cut so nicely.The video guide was useful but not relay elaborate or so educational. But if you watch couple of times you may get the idea.Overall I am happy, I got paid my money back with the two hair cut I had.It also helps to trim the beard
