review/text: I used it for 3 days, and the battery's charge depleted. I examined the base of the brush and the recharging stand, but both were plastic. I didn't see how plastic would conduct electricity and allow for any sort of charge to occurr. So I examined the charger, and at the bottom of it, there was an illustration.The illustration shows how to remove the base and the inner parts/battery.DO NOT DO THIS.I quickly realized that I could not put the parts back into the brush. The manual states, "removing the base DESTROYS THE APPLIANCE, and VOIDS THE WARRANTY"....So why have an illustration of this readily seen on the charger? Furthermore, this procedure is only used years in the future when the battery finally dies, and if you are inclined to dispose of the battery at a recycling center. Is it really necessary then to provide instructions for this on the charger, when it renders the appliance useless? And honestly, who reads manuals, especially for a toothbrush? How is a person supposed to know that following the illustration would destroy their toothbrush? Leave the illustration in the manual, where you have the space to include the appropriate warning.This is just another example of a clever and ambiguous attempt to exploit the ignorance of people, to make more money. Now I have to buy another. I suppose I could try my luck with another brand, but as the saying goes, it's better to go with "the devil you know".
