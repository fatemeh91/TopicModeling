review/text: I've used this product for the last 15 or so years and it is good for one primary thing: To get you going. I don't really know why they call it a &#34;diet&#34; tea, since it doesn't help you burn fat, give you energy, curb your appetite, boost your metabolism etc.That said, this is my #1 go-to item for constipation. My grandmother is 92, and when she came to live with me, she had been nervous about the move etc. Long story short, she was &#34;plugged up&#34; and hadn't gone in nearly two weeks. She has had a kidney removed, so the Dr. said to steer clear of any magnesium based products. So knowing that, I tried a more natural approach.I tried the orange fiber powder, green tea with honey, prune juice, apple juice, and after nothing had worked, laxatives for three straight days.... And still nothing!So this had been sitting in my cupboard for ages, and I remembered that when I had used this, it sent me to the bathroom.I gave her a large cup of this and by the next afternoon...well, let's just say &#34;Laci Le Beau helped her go, go go.&#34;She still has problems with regularity, so every 4 days, I give her a cup of this to keep everything in order.I'd give this five stars, but the new bags are VERY flimsy. With the old bags, I would let them steep for 15 minutes, squeeze the bag to get the strong oils out, and steep again for another 15 or so...The other day I was using the new 2012 bags and was using a hot/cold office (5 gallon bottles) dispenser. I put the teabag in the cup and the force of the water actually burst the bag open as I was filling the cup. I had tea leaf bits floating in my cup. Whatever material they are using now is so weak, I'll have to add the teabag to the water after the cup is full. I certainly won't be able to squeeze the last bits of oils out of the leaves now...Still worth 4 stars though. Oh and one more thing... I add some lemon juice and honey to this. It tastes really good that way.
