review/text: I recently bought a washing machine that requires the high efficiecy laundry detergents. I have a lot of difficulty with detergents that have dyes and perfumes added and was disappointed that the local stores had no fragrence/dye free HE products. On line I found the Method brand in fragrence/dye free and decided to try it. I love it. I use a lot less detergent and my clothes come out beautiful.
