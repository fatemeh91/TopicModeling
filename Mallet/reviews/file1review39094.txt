review/text: I've tried a couple different clippers before and they all just tend to ware out on me too quick. I dont know if its my thick course hair or not but with these clippers I didnt have that problem AT ALL! They cut nice and smooth and I love the sleak design of the clippers themselves and it came with so many pieces. Most the time I only use one lol. But it is great to have them just in case. Definetly recommend and with a great brand like Wahl you can lose anyway.
