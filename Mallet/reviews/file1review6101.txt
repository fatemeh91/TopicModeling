review/text: These paper "rags" are like heavy-duty paper towels and work like a charm for cleaning all the surfaces in your home. They stand up to strong cleaning products and really come in handy when you don't want to waste paper towels or use an actual towel. I like to always keep a box of these on my shelf.
