review/text: This toilet trainer fits my toilet ring, because it has a dial you can adjust! It's a very good idea. The trainer is well contoured, which makes it comfortable for little ones to sit on. Another good feature is the handle on it. I hang it on the wall above our toilet. Very good quality and considerate product.
