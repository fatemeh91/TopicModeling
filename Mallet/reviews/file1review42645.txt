review/text: I have gone through 2 of these things now. The first one lasted a lot longer than the second, too. This product packs a powerful punch, but goes through batteries pretty quick (takes 4 AA batteries) and the wiring is HORRIBLE. The wiring is what broke on both of them. Also, like another reviewer wrote, it does make your hand buzz and fall asleep-hard to hold as well. If I could find something as powerful, but with better wiring I would definitely quit wasting my money on these things...
