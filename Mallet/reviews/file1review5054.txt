review/text: Lets start with the positives: great energy boost and you feel like you can destroy any amount of weight that is placed in front of you which is exactly what this product is supposed to do. Average taste, not great but not terrible.Negatives: gave me an upset stomach about 45 minutes after taking. Also made me want to burb all the time and I got a headache right after I was done working out.I would recommend using Optimum Nutrition's Vassive instead. Its a much better product.
