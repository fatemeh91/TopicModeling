review/text: Wow, am I ever disappointed in this mask. It gaps all around my nose, particularly if I lay on my side. If I am on my side, it also slides around uncomfortably if I move my head even slightly - gapping even more. If I lay on my back, it gaps less, but there is a lump formed by the velcro that makes this position uncomfortable too. I don't know what is harder -- falling asleep without the mask with way too much light in the room, or falling asleep with this darn thing on and bright slivers of light still getting in. Seems like this mask works for a lot of people, but not for me. I have a narrow nose bridge -- maybe that is the problem for me.
