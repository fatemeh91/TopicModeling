review/text: After reading all the claims, I spent money on this product that was totally wasted. Oxy powder gave me intense cramping and instead of helping my digestive track, it bound me up more. I ended up going to the doctor and getting a perscrption product just so I could get back to normal.I bought this on line and tried to return it and they refused.
