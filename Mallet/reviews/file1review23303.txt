review/text: December 15, 2010 - after kicking, tripping and bending this thing, it is now all rickety and rattles, BUT STILL PICS UP BETTER AND WITH LESS EFFORT THAN ANY ELECTRIC VACUUM I'VE GOT (you still need to electric vacuum carpet for fine dust, but sweeping first keeps those larger pieces from getting stuck in the vac. STILL GONNA RAVE ON ABOUT THIS :)>>>>> UPDATED &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; APRIL 2010+++++ JUST PURCHASED AND RECEIVED MY SECOND SWEEPER ++++I JUST LOVED THE FIRST ONE SO MUCH (AND IT WAS SO INEXPENSIVE) I WANTED A SECOND ONE TO KEEP UPSTAIRS.THIS LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED THING IS UNBELIEVABLE.NO CORDS. NO BATTERIES. NO CHARGING.SO LIGHT WEIGHT, YET EFFECTIVE, I CAN NOW QUICKLY DO A FEW SWEEPS ANY TIME AND JUST LEAVE IT OUT NEAR THE CORNER OF THE ROOM FOR EASY ACCESS.GREAT FOR CRUMBS, DOG FOOD PIECES, BITS/FRAGMENTS OF THINGS TOO LARGE FOR A HAND HELD VAC, EVEN GOOD FOR LARGER PIECES OF DEBRIS (all sorts) that you would otherwise pick up first, before you tried using your full powered upright vacuum cleaner (for fear it will get stuck and make that horrible noise then break the belt on you regular electric vacuum cleaner.)Along with the bits/pieces I can see, I am amazed every single time how much DUST this little thing pick up each time I use it (even for just a minute doing a short sweep).Simple, Clean to Empty over a waste bin and ...BEST OF ALL:NO CORDS TO TANGLE;PLUG IN;UNPLUG;FIND ANOTHER UNUSED SOCKET;THEN WRAP IT ALL BACK UP EACH TIME YOU FINISH VACUUMING.Oh yeah, if you are concerned about the environment >>>> USES NO ELECTRICITY AT ALL >>>> AND USES LESS HUMAN POWER THAN AN ELECTRIC POWERED VACUUM SINCE IT IT SO INCREDIBLY LIGHT WEIGHT!GET ONE ... YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!
