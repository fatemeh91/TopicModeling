review/text: I love this jump rope so much! I'm pretty short (5'2") and I was worried about it being too long, but after use it wasn't a problem at all. It has smooth ball bearings in the handles and just the right about of weight in the rope. I get to spend more time actually jumping rather than feeling sorry for my sore arms. It's a good buy and will last you a long time!
