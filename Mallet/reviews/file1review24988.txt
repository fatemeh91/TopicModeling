review/text: For Women With Regular Cycles:So, I finally tried FertilAid for one month - after contemplating for several months whether or not I should begin taking the vitamins since I have a 100% REGULAR 28-day cycle. I have never missed a period or had any problems with it, other than the usual cramping when it comes on. But I wanted to take these vitamins for prenatal/pms/hormonal balancing benefits while TTC.I started the vitamins on Day 1 of my cycle, ovulated as normal on Day 14 (had severe ovulation cramps though compared to my normal cramping - which meant they were working and improving my hormone levels) and my period came on exactly as expected - on day 28. I did not get pregnant but I no longer have any worries that these vitamins will mess up a perfectly normal cycle as stated in some of the scary reviews I've read (which kept hindering me from trying these out).So this review is for the WOMEN with REGULAR CYCLES who are unsure whether or not they should take FertilAid. I think while you're TTC, FertilAid will give you a hormonal boost. I'm on month 2 taking FertileAid and will definitely come back and report when I get a sticky bean. P.S. I took these along with the FertileCM vitamins. Due to the amino acid in FertileCM, I also experienced enhanced hair and nail growth. I will be working on my eating plan while on FertilAid for the next several months and will hopefully conceive in the early part of 2010.Rated 4 stars since I didn't get preg (hehe)!
