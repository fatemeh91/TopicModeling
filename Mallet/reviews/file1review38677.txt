review/text: This was purchased to hopefully replace CVS' comparable product which is no longer being sold. I had mistakenly believed that this was the same stuff because the ingredients all matched up and the bottle looks similar to that from CVS.When I ultimately tried this product, I was dismayed to find that the fragrance is entirely different from the "CVS Aftershave Skin Conditioner" which I had used previously. Although acceptable, I find the Afta fragrance to be too strong and quite different from what I had hoped for.
