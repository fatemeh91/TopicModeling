review/text: Although the product seems to be well made and all the ingredients are plant-based, it made me feel horrible. I have taken myself off these prenatals and started taking a cheaper brand that dissolves easy and my morning sickness has disappeared. They smell terrible, causing myself to gag at just the smell. I've been taking them at bedtime trying to not get sick on them, doesn't always work that way.
