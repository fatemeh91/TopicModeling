review/text: I bought this yoga kit when I was first starting to take yoga. It has worked great. It provided everything I needed and comes in a convenient carrying bag that holds all the items- mat, two blocks, and a strap. I would definitely recommend this kit if you are starting out. It's very reasonably priced and is perfect to get started with yoga.
