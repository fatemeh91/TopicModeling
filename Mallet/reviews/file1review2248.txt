review/text: It came quickly in a small enough package to fit in our apartment mailbox. Cheap price, good product. They aren't packaged for the US, I think they're from another country. But they fit just fine and my picky husband likes them well enough. PLus they were much much cheaper than buying from the grocery store. Good buy for sure.
