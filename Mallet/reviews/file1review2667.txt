review/text: I originally purchased this lubricant for sex but prefer Astroglide or saliva. But I found it is an EXCELLENT massage oil as it does not absorb into the skin and therefore does not require reapplication. I can give an hour massage with one initial application of less than 1/4 ounce. It also mixes well with essential oils such as tea tree or lavender for an instant aromatherapy massage.
