review/text: Bought the "bottle" brush to clean out beer bottles and wine bottles. Alas! The end is about 1/2 an inch too wideto fit into any wine or beer bottle..since these tend to be about the same size. In OTHER words...useless for what myintentions were. Now if you are going to use this brush on another wider mouthed bottle...go for it! It seems well made.Since it seems to be a little bit misleading in the way it was portrayed. 3 stars>
