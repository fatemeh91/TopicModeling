review/text: I've tried several different reacher/grabbers, and this by far is the best out there. Easy to use and light weight. I have several of this brand. My only suggestion would be to make them a little more sturdy and that they could hold a little more. I've broken several of them over the years. Also, the ones I bought previously had extra rubber gripper pads included. These new ones do not.
