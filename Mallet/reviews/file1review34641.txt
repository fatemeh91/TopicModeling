review/text: I bought this product on a whim-- found a sugar scrub recipe and decided to try it out. I wasn't expecting as much product as I received, and I was a little disappointed at wasting money on so much. Then I made my scrub-- this oil smells awesome, and works beyond excellently as a moisturizer. I tell my husband that using my scrub and letting this oil soak into my hands (or feet, arms or legs for that matter) is like going to &#34;my happy place&#34;.I've been reading up on what else coconut oil is good for, and I'm excited to use it for cooking popcorn among other things. NOW Foods is a great brand, been getting supplements from them for years from a local food store. They're very forthcoming with what is in their products, and the price is great for the quantity and quality of the good.
