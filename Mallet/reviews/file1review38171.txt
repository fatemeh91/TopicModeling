review/text: The fresh cut grass smell of this spray is delightful. I used this at home for the longest time and decidedto bring a bottle to work (medical office) for use in the restroom. I swear sales for the company must havegone up as every patient that exited the restroom asked where they could buy the spray. Light airy scent nochemical smell. A must have! Great gift too.
