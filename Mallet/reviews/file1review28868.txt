review/text: Hands down, this is the best Protein powder a person can invest in.The Good:-Minimal calories(120 calories per scoop)-Very low carbs and sugars-High quality protein.-High amount of protein person serving(24 grams) Compare to others that only give you 20-22 grams per serving.-Best tasting protein powder i've used. Tastes just like chocolate milk when using skim milk. Not grainy, chunky, and no bad aftertaste.-Mixes easily and well.-Great price for the quantity you get.The Bad-NOTHING!This protein is recommended for people who do moderate workouts. For intense bodybuilding or mass gains, go with a different powder since this is low in calories.
