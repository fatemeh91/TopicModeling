review/text: I just bought this product 2 weeks ago for my eczema. I usually have a coconut oil back in the Philippines and we never run out of it. Well thanks to Amazon they offered and accept retailers who are selling this kind of product and i'm really happy for that!i have this eczema on my arm since i was in Okinawa, i dont know where i got this but its so itchy and annoying,, i tried cortizone and some creams but it didnt work for me.In my desperation, i googled some informations about eczema and a lot of blogs i read that VCO(virgin coconut oil) can heal eczema too.I usually just put vco on my hair and skin,its really good and makes your hair so smooth and soft,as well as your skin,,(but my dad dont like the smell,lol!)oh well i like the smell of vco and i like to use it so much for theres a lot of benefits on it. Im applying it now on my eczema , after i take a shower, then leave it overnight. Now its healing and and the itchness stops.Well I love this vco and its has the same smell of what i have in the Philippines,, I bought some vco here in amazon before, but i dont like it, i just forgot the brand,, lol!
