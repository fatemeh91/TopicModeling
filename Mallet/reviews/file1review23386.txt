review/text: If I could I'd give this product a rating of 10,000. I have been through many different hand santizers and Purrell with Aloe I have found to be the best by far. Aside from your hands feeling and being clean with 99.99% of germs killed, you will find your hands feeling exceptionally smooth and also smelling very nice.The other generic brands and competitors to Purell may be somewhat cheaper, however they don't leave your hands feeling the same and certainly not smelling the same. I have found that other brands with Aloe leave my hands smelling like alcohol, perfume that i guess is supposed to smell good but doesnt. I left out mentioning specific competitors with these properties because this is just a review, but if you are interested in the hand sanitizers to avoid feel free to contact me and I will let you know the worst of the worst.100% buy Purell. It may be somewhat more expensive, but it is far worth it.
