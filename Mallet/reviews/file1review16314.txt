review/text: I have been using these and the Quantum tablets made by the same company, and to be honest I don't notice much of a difference. These tablets here have a higher chance of an incomplete dissolving occurrence than the Quantums, but they also cost less. They always get my dishes much cleaner than traditional dish detergent. By not allowing food to cement on dishes and arranging them so the dishwasher spray can reach the surfaces, I have not had many issues of having to rewash a dish. The scent isn't overpowering, and I am glad because who would want scented dishes? They do have trouble dealing with my extremely hard water, 18gpg, but I would expect it to handle that much hardness in the water. Differentially worth trying this product to compare to your current brand, and I bet you will like these ones more. Quantum is slightly better, but also slightly more expensive.
