review/text: Used it one night on a dry skin rash where I had tried several other lotions for months with NO results. I noticed as I put it on the next night the rash was completely smooth and not bumpy as it had been before. The third night nearly all of the redness was gone. I will keep this stuff in the nightstand from here on out.
