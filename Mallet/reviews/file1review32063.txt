review/text: My scenario: I'm traveling down the road, eating a sandwich, and, suddenly, I drop a bit of mustard on my favorite "knock about" shirt. After uttering an expletive or two, I recall the television ad that I had seen about Tide's "pen." I immediately pulled into the local Wal****, zoomed to the cleaning supplies section, and found the product in question.Did it work as it had on the commercial???I'm wearing the spotless shirt as I type this recommendation!And to liberally borrow from another company, "I don't leave home without it!"
