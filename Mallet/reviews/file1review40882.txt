review/text: As a massage oil, this stuff is pretty nice. It warms nicely and lasts without feeling heavy or drying up. Also the cocoa smell is unusual and enjoyable.The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is they say it is "irresistible to the tongue,". Personally I thought it tasted pretty bad. It had a strong alcohol taste. It was kind of like tasting vanilla extract.If you want to lick chocolate off your lover, I'd go with one of the body chocolates instead. But for a sensual massage, this stuff is great.
