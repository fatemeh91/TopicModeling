review/text: Seller gave excellent service, i.e. the product arrived quickly and in brand new condition as promised.This is a great lighter, brand new yet you own a piece of history in your hands. It was/is in perfect shape, and lit up right out of the box, after putting in fuel, as they come delivered empty. I don't smoke and have no plans to start, but as I posted in a previous review, a "man" should carry a lighter. This is a bit larger than my other zippo, a slimline version, but otherwise exactly the same.These lighters take a bit more work than average. You might think of it as driving a stick shift verse a manual. On the flip side they are much cooler, and much more reliable. The price, even with shipping is way below retail.I would highly recommend this to anyone who feels the need to carry a lighter, smoker or not. They are fun to play with at the very least, and single men, ladies really do love it. Don't be a loser with a 99 cent bic! This lighter is great for women too, you're liberated and don't really need a man to light that cigarette after all, but please, if a nice guy like me offers, indulge us.
