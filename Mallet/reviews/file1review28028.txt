review/text: Put this in my coffee in the morning. Was getting tired of vanilla. I use a hand mixer to make sure it's stirred well. Tends to settle out a bit toward the bottom but a gentle shake of the thermos before decanting a cup helps to minimize that. A small price to pay over the typical chalky taste many of these products have.
