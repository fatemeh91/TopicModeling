review/text: I purchased this item based on the Amazon.com reviews. I, like most men, have hair growing in my ears and nose that tend to be a pain to groom. I have nipped my ears a number of times when trying to cut wild hairs with scissors. The same with my nose. I like to present a neat appearance and that is hard to do with stray hairs growing where they shouldn't be. Plucking is effective but can hurt quite a bit.With the Panasonic groomer, it's a breeze. No nicks and it is quick and easy to do both my ears and nose. It is easy to clean afterwards as well. Now I just spend 5 minutes with the groomer every 3 or 4 weeks and no more wild hair problems. Well worth the money.
