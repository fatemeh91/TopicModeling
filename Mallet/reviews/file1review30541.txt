review/text: We all have sensitive skin in our family, this is the first deodorant that does not cause swelling,itching or those crazy little red bumps. It smells good and feels great too! The good news is that it is a fabulous product, the bad news is that it is difficult to find locally. Thank goodness for Amazon.
