review/text: I use a protein shake a day to supplement since surgery. I think I have tried them all. Champion Pure Whey Stack is the the best tasting by far. There is no nasty aftertaste.I mix chocolate in coffee every morning for a wonderful mocha hot drink that keeps me satisfied until lunch. Mixes great. I highly recommend this product.
