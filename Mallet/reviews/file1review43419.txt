review/text: I am in my second pregnancy and the pain started very early on 12 weeks and after wearing the prenatal cradle plus, i can walk without the pain and it is 90% pain free. I am 5' 5" and I bought size M/L and it fits perfectly. I wearing it everyday. This is a must have item if you have the pain. I am very glad that I purchased it!!!! Super!!!!
