review/text: Gets hotter than any heating pad you would buy in a drug store or Wal-Mart. I highly recommend the switch that goes off when you let go of it. You could really burn yourself if you fall asleep, which is likely. Sometimes I use it when my back isn't bothering me, but I'm just having trouble falling asleep! You don't have to hold it for long, it heats up pretty fast. It's definitely worth the extra money. The switch finally went bad on my last one which I've had since 1983. That one is not the same brand as this one, but they are exactly the same. You would not be disappointed in this heating pad.
