review/text: The pen is great. The ink (Cross) is terrible on some papers. Do not use for checks! On good quality paper the ink is very black and beautiful and the pen is a joy to write with. The nib it comes with, although medium is a bit thick. The ink is not permanent. It will run if you spill something on the paper or get it slightly wet. On checks it starts to run like if it were tissue. Other inks don't do this.
