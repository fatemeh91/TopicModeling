review/text: It does not do what it claims to do, therefore I give it one star. I wish I could give it zero stars, though. The cloths actually scratch CDs and DVDs. They also leave lint residue on the CDs. As one other reviewer mentioned, the cloths really do look like fabric softener sheets that you put in the dryer. Don't waste your money on these "cleaning" cloths.
