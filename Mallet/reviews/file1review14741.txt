review/text: I purchased this for my 3.5 year old daughter who has Sensory Processing Disorder after her Occupational Therapist recommended this. She recommended the red, like the kind she uses in my daughter's therapy. I got this in and it is more of a neon red-orange color, not at all like the kind we are used to by the same maker. This inconsistency caused confusion with my daughter, and she at first refused to use it since it was not red like her OT's. I have since gotten her to use it, but she still comments that it is not red. LOL!
