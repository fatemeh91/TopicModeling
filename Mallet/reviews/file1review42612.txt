review/text: ive tried so many proteins and this one is the best...i don't drink it on it's own but i do use a few different recipes mainly frozen strawberries and a banana plus flax seed oil...i also use pb2 with a banana and ice to make it cooler and also any type of pudding flavor with a trivia packet and ice maybe some vanilla they are all delicious...but the protein makes it so much Better....thus one had digestive enzymes in it which i had been taking in a supplement until i found this protein one less pill supplement to take...thankyou Dymatize best product great price for 5lbs.
