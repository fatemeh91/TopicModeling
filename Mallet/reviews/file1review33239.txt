review/text: These are great when you come in from the cold after walking on snowy grounds. They heated my feet and kept warm for quite a long while. They cannot be used for walking around, though, in that they are weighted and don't stay on well, but they are perfect for sitting in your recliner and relaxing while you are comforted.
