review/text: My husband has been taking this product for a month now. We have notice a little change. Hoping with this new order for the 2nd month will be a big change. As of this moment I am not pregnant but I am not giving up hope. I know it takes 3 months for it to work.It is worth the money where as you will be spending more for meds that the DR prescribe you. What do you have to lose.
