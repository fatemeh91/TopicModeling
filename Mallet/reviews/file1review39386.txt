review/text: I'm a 22 yr-old male who tends to hunch over when standing or sitting. I wanted to correct this problem for my appearence and long-term health. I thought a posture strap may help. Of the many types I saw on the internet, I chose this version because it appeared the simplest/least aggressive, and it happened to be the cheapest.This is definitely a great product. You put it on as shown in the picture. The elastic band applies moderate tension that tugs your shoulders back into proper position. It tugs, not forces. Thus it's "reminding" you to keep your shoulders back and you're doing most of the work, which will help build the necessary muscles and habits to keep good posture even after taking it off. You'll still have plenty of mobility in your shoulders to reach for things or do any other motions that require moving your shoulders forward briefly.As for drawbacks, yes the underarm strap will hurt if you wear it directly on your skin. But if you wear it over your clothes, or wear an undershirt if you want to wear the strap in public, it will be comfortable. Perhaps that's why the more expensive straps wrap around your stomach... so that an underarm band isn't needed. I think this will help correct my posture long-term and I'm very pleased with it.
