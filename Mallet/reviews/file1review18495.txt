review/text: Jarrow Formulas Juice concentrate cannot in any way substitute fresh pomegranate juice. But, pomegranate are not available all year around and even if they are available, not everyone has a time to go through the process of making a juice. This juice concentrate doesn't have the exact taste of fresh pomegranate juice, but it's really good in smoothies, as a tea sweetener, in homemade frozen yogurts and sorbets and in fruit and berries sauces.
