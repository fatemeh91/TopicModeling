review/text: A good product overall, but didn't like the following things about the product:1> The charging chord is a little short than my previous Braun Epilator.2> The charger is a heavy one compared to the one from Braun.3> The charging chord connects at an uneasy place on the Epilator; this causes the handling of the epilator a little difficult especially if they are on the sensitive areas of the body. We wish the chord was connected like in other Epilators at the rear.
