review/text: These are very POOR...and do not block much sound at all. I got them for riding on a motorcycle to shield out some wind noise. These don't work...the foam ones work better-much better. I waisted $8 bucks....I don't know where others are plugging them into, but if its in there ears, these arn't working...save your money.
