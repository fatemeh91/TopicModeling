review/text: Warm is about the best way to describe this product. Like the poster above me stated, this isn't good for the ol root canal, though it can be used anywhere else. This is probably best used for greasing up before you hit the hersey highway, as well as for when Rosey Palm and her sisters come over for a visit.. Overall, I'd say that there are better things out there than this.
