review/text: I was a bit hesitant buying protein at a premium price. I was used to buying the whey protein they sell at Sam's Club and Cost-Co. After tasting the protein (Vanilla) compared to the Sam's Club protein it is uncompared. The flavor is rich and tastes really good. I can drink this leisurely after a work out and it tastes super yummy. Just follow the directions and enjoy a refreshing protein shake. Dymatize just got a life long customer, good job!
