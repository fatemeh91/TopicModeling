review/text: This is a great idea. There are two so pouches can be on either side of the wheelchair. On the positive side they are well made and the velcro does hold them very well. I am sure for many they would work fine. However they are not very big or very deep. My mother is in a nursing home and President of the resident council, so she has things to carry. I don't feel they are going to work out as I had hope. If you only wanted to carry a small book, perhaps a cell phone they would work fine, but she needs to carry a notebook and pen along with notes and they aren't going to work for that.
