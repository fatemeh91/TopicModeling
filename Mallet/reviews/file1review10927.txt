review/text: I wasn't really looking for "extended pleasure" but it so happened that i grabbed those.The essence of those condoms is to prolong your pleasure by putting in Benzocaine which numbs guys' p*n*ses thus making it less sensitive and more difficult to reach ejaculation.Why? Why would I want NOT TO want feel sex? That's all there is to it, the feel.Condoms are also thicker, which makes it quite impossible to tell even if it was IN or OUT. Felt like i was not part of the sex but a side observer.I tried to use them just for pregnancy prevention by putting them at the end, but the time between premature and normal ejaculation is exactly how much the condom needs to make you numb. I just threw them away...I do want to mention also that before i realized what those condoms do, i freaked out since i thought there was something wrong with me. I would touch it and push it left and right and wouldn't feel ANYTHING, it wasn't part of me anymore. Was ready to go to emergency if i didn't google it...Don't buy. Look for alternative. 2 stars because i don't want to be mean and after all it did prevent pregnancy...but whatever, i can do it with plastic bag...am sure it would feel better.
