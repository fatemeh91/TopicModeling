review/text: I don't know what it is with tweezers and scissors, I seem to lose them all over the place. In between ordering this Mini set from Amazon and actually receiving the package, I found one of my full-sized Tweezerman tweezers and have been using that the last few days. (I pluck stray eyebrows every morning while doing my makeup, so they don't get out of hand.) When the Mini arrived just now, I went upstairs to test it out, and unfortunately it just doesn't grip as well as the bigger pair. Several times on fine blonde hairs I had to really fight to get this one to grip it, and after about ten hairs, I went back to the full-sized and got all the stray hairs. So, this is pretty much a waste of my money; by the time I send it back to Amazon, the refund would be minimal, so I guess I'll keep it for emergencies - such as the next time the big pair gets lost!
