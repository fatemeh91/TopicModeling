review/text: We should have given more of our attention to the negative reviews on here, especially those who report that it only worked a few times and then never again. I received this unit on a Tuesday afternoon, later that evening after reading all of the instructions, I prepared to get some relief for my swollen feet. After filling with water, I plugged in the unit and pressed the power button, nothing. We tried in several outlets and no luck. We adjusted the water level too. So buyer BEWARE, some of these work only a few times and some don't work at all like ours.
