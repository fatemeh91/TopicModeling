review/text: I ordered INSTAGONE as a last resort. After finding out our RV had water leaks, and the ceiling was rust -colored from water damage, I was desperate to find something to remove the stains. I first went out and got a carpet cleaner and shampooed the fuzzy ceiling, and that helped to some degree, but the rust stains were still visible.I just received INSTAGONE yesterday, and sprayed it on all the stains in my RV, and all I can say is WOW!!! The stains are gone!! I was so excited! In fact, I was so excited, that I texted my husband and told him that this product might save the entire human race from a Zombie Apocalypse!! Okay, a little dramatic, but it honestly worked for me when nothing else did.The only problem I had with it, is, it will bleach out any fabric or fiber that it touches. I found this out because in my excitement, I sprayed a little on a carpet stain and I hadn't read the full instructions, but that was MY fault. I can't blame INSTAGONE for that!All in all, this is a terrific product, that does what it says, and I am very happy with my results!!
