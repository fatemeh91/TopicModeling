review/text: I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it.Pros- saves money on razors- good on large areas- entertaining if you're boredCons- no matter how many times you use it, the pain does not go away (you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits)- ingrown hair can be a problem (especially in the bikini area)- hair doesn't grow back that much slower than shaving (after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth)- the epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it does, it just rips it.
