review/text: This writer's ophthalmologist recommended AREDS several years ago; the effects were evident within a couple of weeks. All the white lines on the streets were suddenly looking freshly painted and night vision became "like old times" in that glare was minimized. I never miss my morning and evening dosage of one gel cap and truly hope that AREDS continues to allay macular degeneration as effectively as it has during my continued use.
