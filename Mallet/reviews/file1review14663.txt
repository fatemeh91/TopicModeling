review/text: I use this to boost mySource Naturals Huperzine A, 200mcg, 120 Tablets. The Hupe on its own is a great replacement for the expensive Exelon patch which is prescription only and $250 for a month's supply. For me, at a 100mcg/day (half pill) I'm almost good as new, instead of 72 and brain dead.But when I add the Vinpocetine into the mix, I get boosts in ways I never did before. It seems (for me anyway) to compliment the Huperzine and make me sharper, gives me mental energy and makes me way more vocal, which is good because I'm a bit introverted. I talk a lot more now, and surprisingly it's not just babble. People listen and are much more friendly to me.Hey I like this!8/14/2012 Update:I find this combination also gives me a tenacity I haven't had before. I see things through to completion much better than I have in years.2/12/2013 Update:I've increased my dosage now to a whole tablet each morning of both Huperzine and Vinpocetine.
