review/text: I started taking this after my baby started losing weight. I had nursed my other 3 children before her, the first two being twins, and not had any problems producing enough milk. I'm not sure what the problem was this time, but after using this for 2 weeks, her weight increased by nearly 2 pounds. The taste is absolutely horrid, but I found that taking it in apple juice made it much better than taking it in milk or water. And I never even took as much as I could per day- I generally used 1-2 doses instead of the 3 it suggested. I also talked to a good friend of mine who is a lactation consultant, and she said that fenugreek is more effective when taken with blessed thistle, and that it is absolutely safe to take for as long as needed.
