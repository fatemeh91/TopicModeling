review/text: This helps me when I get in an irritated or hyperactive (excited) mood, which I can do at times. In an hour or two, I calm right down to a calm and peaceful state. I understand it is a B-vitamin type substance and is safe with not side effects (but I am not a nutritionist). I have taken 6 of these tablets at one time with no negative side effects at all.Highly recommended.
