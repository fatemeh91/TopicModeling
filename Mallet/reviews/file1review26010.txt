review/text: Glad I didn't pay the full price of around $20 from the Mindfold website. I paid $12 w/free shipping on Amazon but still think that is a bit much. I Love the concept of opening your eyes in total darkness but this product is pretty cheap. I agree with one review stating that they could've went to a crafts store and made their own. Other than being overpriced, the only issue I have is that the strap is uncomfortable around the ears. Definately not for sleeping(unless you're on your back all night) but good for meditation.NOTE: Depending on the size of your nose some light may still seep through.
