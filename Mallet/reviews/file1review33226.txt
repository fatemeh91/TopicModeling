review/text: After a horrible cold/sinus infection that lasted about 3 weeks, I decided to try and be a little more proactive. I found this on Amazon, and have been taking it every day since. My doctor says that most people get about 4 colds a year, and since taking this, i haven't gotten one. I'm not sure if it's coincidence, or if this really helps - but i'm not about to stop taking it and take chances.
