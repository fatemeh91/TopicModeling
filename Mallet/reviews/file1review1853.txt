review/text: I had purchased this first for my husband to use when he used to go camping with our son when they were involved in Scouting. I had been purchased at one of the local medical stores on the recommendation by a sales person when I explained I was looking for something to solve heat,yeast and other skin issues. It had solved the rashes they both got from the heat and then the other boys started to use it since they also started to get the heat rash and chafing. I started to use it as well since it solved my problem with getting the same problems since I drive a bus that has no A/C and cut down on my problems as well. Some people may or may not like the scent, I have no issues with it and the family likes the cool feeling get get from using the soap and the smell from the soap is great for guys and for me does not have all that perfume to it. I've even used it on my Westie who has yeast skin flare ups from time to time without any problems, I just make sure I rinse him well and it keeps him smelling fresh for a longer period of time. Over all I have been very pleased with the Pedifix FungaSoap. It is not over drying and is fantastic especially in the summer time. I have taken advantage of the auto ship for the product since I have been very pleased with the product in the past and find using this wash on any skin issue I may have helps clear it up faster than using any powder or cream for the same problem.
