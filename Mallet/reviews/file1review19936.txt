review/text: The hubs and I don't really buy a lot of special baby/kid goods. Our two year old son drinks out of normal glasses, he eats with adult silverware, he never used a pacifier, etc etc. So we didn't want to buy him a separate little potty chair, either. Might as well start him on the real thing so we don't have to switch him over later, right? We bought this so that he could sit comfortably on a normal toilet.This is a lovely, sturdy device, which is very easy to clean and has a convenient hook for hanging on the wall. What a nice bathroom decoration. The guests. just. love. it. &#34;You have a toilet seat on your wall! Wow! That's great!&#34; said nobody ever. But whatever, it's an easy way to store it. The front lip is a little difficult for my son to get over when he's sitting down, but it seems like somewhat of a safety feature, so I'm good with it.I don't really know what to say. It's well made, but come on, it's a potty seat. Your kid sits on it to pee. It's not super hard to get that wrong. Anyway, my son is still not really interested in the potty, but that speaks more to his love of pooping in his diaper in whatever hidden corner he can find than the quality of the chair. I'd recommend this product to others.
