review/text: I've always purchased the Oral B Hummingbird refills on Amazon.com for under $5 for 15 refills and the Oral B website shows them for $3.95, but not available on line. No stores seem to carry them, so I've tried ordering them on line from a variety of sites and they are now over $50 for one pack of 15. Is everyone out of their mind? Is anyone out there purchasing these at this outrageous price? Even the Hummingbird device itself is selling for $34.95. RIP OFF!
