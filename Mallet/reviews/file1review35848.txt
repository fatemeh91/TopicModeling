review/text: I have had plantar fasciitis off and on, but mostly on, for years. This is the fourth style of night splint I have tried, and it is the ONLY one I have been able to keep on all night. Even after just the first night, I could feel an improvement in my pain the next day. I am hopeful that this is going to be the answer for me to a very painful problem. Thanks for a great product at a reasonable price!
