review/text: Why all the stores stopped carrying this product is a mystery to me!I have searched, called and emailed letters...apparently the "Cocoa and Creme" can only be ordered online now, where I live. I don't get heartburn very often but when I do, this is a nice mellow way to soothe it. I could never use the mint or berry flavors, which would seem to make the heartburn worse but for some reason that is what they are stocking the store shelves with these days.I will continue to order online since this is the only flavor I can handle and sometimes it's just nice for a quick choco-fix with calcium, yum.
