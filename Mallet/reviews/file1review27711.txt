review/text: I used to use Nitro-Tech but the Double Rich Chocolate by Optimum Nutrition tastes great and seems to work just as well as the pricer Nitro-Tech stuff. Just make sure you don't over do it with the milk and you should be fine! I made the mistake of mixing 2 scoops with 4 cups of milk and that left me with horrible stomach problems days later.
