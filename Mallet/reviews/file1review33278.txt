review/text: The wrap is partially-filled and the baffling is poor, meaning that you can shake down the seeds to one side and have empty fabric for OVER HALF of the length of the wrap. Since the seeds carry the heat/cold, I end up having to constantly readjust and fold it over. I am sewing the ends and the neckline to try and keep the seeds together. If I had been able to see it first, I would not have purchased it.
