review/text: I bought the Optima several years ago at Sharper Image when it was still a store. Since then I have purchased several epilators looking for the "newest" and the "best" thing as most claim. I have tried Epilady and Braun but I still keep coming back to the Optima.One thing that I love about the Emjoi epilators is that their tweezers are metal. Some other epilator companies do have models that use metal tweezers, but their higher end ones actually have one metal tweezer flap and the other side is plastic. I find that those epilators don't seem to grab my hairs as well as the ones with metal tweezers. With the Optima, I'm able to pick up the most annoying hairs, all except for the extremely fine ones.Another thing I really like about the Optima is that the rounded edges are exposed more on this epilator than my other ones. This helps me get into tight curved corners without much problem. I use this epilator everywhere I need hair removed and it gets the job done wonderfully. My only wish is that I could find a company that incorporates the best of many brands. I like the wet/dry option of some epilators and the cordless ability, but the Optima has the best curves to get into tight places.
