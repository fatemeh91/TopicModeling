review/text: There are a lot of great reviews on this product already so read other ones. I'm simply posting to say Rich chocolate(mixed with milk) simply tastes like CHOCOLATE MILK to me.I was a little nervous ordering 5 pounds after reading reviews saying it tastes bad but using the recommended amount of milk(6-8oz) per scoop it tastes good.
