review/text: I purchased this pill timer hoping for a little functionality, there is none. Nothing is automatic, and the instructions are intentionally vague. I am slowly figuring it out, and I hate the way it works (or doesn't work). It is unusable as a daily use device and I am returning it. Someone is trying to sell you junk on this one. There is a nice compartment to store your pills, but no easy way to reset the timer when you take a pill. It is too large to put in your pocket, except by itself. Seems like the pills would spill on the floor if you weren't careful when opening the device. It truly is a "Royal emergency", flush that is. :-(
