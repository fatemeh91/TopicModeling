review/text: Initially, seen some increase in movement, which led me to believe, was more a laxative than burner. I was regularly exercising and did lose six lbs., but with a change in work schedule and exercising slowing down, there was no more change. I stayed away from crabs and sugars but, without the regular work out, any more loss.
