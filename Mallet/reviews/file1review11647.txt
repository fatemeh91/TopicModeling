review/text: I needed an Omega 3 product that would have the most benefit for my children without giving them extra sugar.. i found this product and love it! They get way more Omega fatty acids compared to the gummy versions you can buy. My children have taken this supplement for 5+ years.I do use a syring to give it to them. They won't drink it out of a small medicine cup.. too oily!! lol
