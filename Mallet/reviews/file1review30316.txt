review/text: My first impression of this little vacuum is that it is cheaply made. The brush attachment is not properly assembled. It came in pieces and even when I figured out how the pieces fit, the two main compartments holding the "brush" assembly weren't flush. (I'll take a photo of that and put it up here as evidence) It thus makes that "special brush with rubber bristles" useless. The little hose part reminds me of a plastic ring from a milk carton; I don't expect it to last long.The rest of the little sucker, however, works well. I can use this thing around tight spots in my cluttered office, vacuum around the desk, in dark crevices, and pick up most things. It comes apart fast and easily for cleaning and emptying.It does turn off if overheated, and that usually means the small dust holder needs emptying.This is great for small or hard-to-reach areas like window sills and around computer equipment. It's a little less effective as a car vacuum because the vacuum hose's opening is so small and the dust catcher isn't big, either. It tends to clog up easily because of this. It's also not the most powerful vacuum out there for common household debris like kitty litter or dried mud, stuff that your pet may drag around. Just don't expect much from the brush attachment as it's 100% Chinese workmanship.This is a great supplementary vacuum device. For a main vacuum I'd say this is so-so.
