review/text: I am willing to try anything to stop my 24/7 "morning" sickness, so I gave these Preggie Pops a try. I was disappointed that they are so high in sugar, but I figured one a day wouldn't hurt me. I have no idea what makes these different from any other sucker. The ingredients mysteriously list "essential oils," but I'm not sure what they are or if they are actually supposed to do anything for morning sickness. I have gone through all of the pops now and sort of enjoyed some of the flavors, especially the sours. The mints are rather mild and I couldn't taste much of anything with Spearmint. Lavender was disgusting. Just thinking about the taste the next day sent me running to throw up. I will not be eating that one again! Ginger is supposed to be great for morning sickness, but that taste also makes me sick. So, really I only liked three flavors and could deal with the other two, which doesn't justify buying another bag. If I want a sour flavor, I'll just find a cheaper sucker that is lower in sugar and it will do the exact some thing--which is nothing but taste good.
