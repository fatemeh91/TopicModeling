review/text: This kind of grooming item is not used very often. When I went to use it the third time, it would not work. I tried changing the battery, but the problem is with the unit itself. It's never been dropped -- it just stopped working. I am attempting to get Amazon to intervene and replace the unit. I'll let you know what happens...
