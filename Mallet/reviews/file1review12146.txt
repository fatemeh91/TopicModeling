review/text: I was given some sample prescription pre-natal vitamins by my doctor, and those wrecked havoc on my stomach for a solid 2 weeks. I had to switch. These pills are gentle, vegan, and do not overdose on the Vitamin A, which a lot of over the counter pre-natal vitamins tend to do despite the potential birth risks. Plus, while the taste of these pills is never pleasant, at least the taste of these is decent and doesn't linger like other pills do.
