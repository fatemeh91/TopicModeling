review/text: I can't say enough good things about this skin treatment. I have suffered from psoriasis for twenty years and tried just about everything from herbal remedies to steroid creams. Every time I tried something new, it would work for a little while and then the psoriasis would come back with a vengeance. This cream truly is a miracle. I have been using it for about a month now for moderate psoriasis covering different areas of the body and my skin is almost entirely clear! The cream is light, smells nice, and works very quickly. If you aren't having any luck with other treatments, give this one a shot!
