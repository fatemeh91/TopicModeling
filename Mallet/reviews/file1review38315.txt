review/text: I purchased my emjoi optima from sharper image for $100. At first it was a little intimidating - It's scarier just getting started than it is painful. The first day I used it it hurt a little, but I got used to it within the first few minutes. It felt as if I was receiving small shocks at first with every hair being pulled, but once I convinced myself that it was hair being tweezed and not shocks I felt a lot less pain! My skin feels so soft and smooth. I opted for using it a day or so after shaving so it was pulling less hair out at a first. I then used it every day for the first week, getting those hairs that were slower growing. I will never go back to shaving again. The underarm area had me scared because so many people said it was so much more painful than the legs, but I found it felt no worse than razor burn when using it at first. Unlike razor burn, though, the discomfort didn't last after I was done removing the hair from that area.
