review/text: I do love this mask for help with FALLING ASLEEP when my husband is up later and needs the light on. It is VERY comfortable, especially for the styles that have the eye pockets that do not touch even your lashes so you can blink. It has excellent light blockage once you get it adjusted right, as you have to get it just so to prevent leakage around the nose.The DOWNSIDE to this mask is that it won't stay in place after you fall asleep. Every use, it inevitably winds up on my forehead. I don't move around in my sleep at all, so I suspect this issue has more to do with the elastic straps being set "high" so that the pressure is on your forehead instead of on your eyes. (Tightening the elastic made the problem worse.) Great for no-pressure on your eyes... Not-so-great if you need it to stay in place for a long period of time.So...for falling asleep -- excellent, 5 stars!for staying asleep and staying in place -- inadequate, 2 stars.I would recommend it overall, though!
