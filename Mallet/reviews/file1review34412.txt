review/text: So I ordered this because my husband and my fires had somewhat diffused. I've always been a bit more risque than him so I wanted to bring him into my realm which is much more active an enjoyable. This stuff is SOOOOo great. We have a little one so we haven't had a chance to put it to use for what its meant to do, but just putting a dab between two fingers is enough to rate this stuff. I must have sat there rubbing my two fingers around for a good hour. No stickiness. No weird smell. I let my husband get a drop and he immediately said "OH, Wow!" We are soooo looking forward to getting to give it a real whirl this weekend. I paired it with a vibrating ring, which noted that some lube was needed to get on. I'll come back later and let you know how it went. This stuff makes KY look like crazy glue. Sorry! No video reviews on this one! ;-)
