review/text: My biggest complaint about was that the flavor was awful. It was almost like a rotten cherry-mint flavor. I just about choked the first time I used it. After repeated use, the flavor became more tolerable -- however, another flavor would be a plus. I didn't notice any whitening effect. But to be fair, more than a week's use is probably required. Other than the above comments, this was average toothpaste.
