review/text: The charger and/or batteries are obviously defective on the unit I received.The green "charged" light comes on even when there is no charge in thebatteries. Leaving the batteries in the charger for as long as a week seemsto make no difference - the batteries will charge up enough for about 3 shotsin my digital camera, and then - nothing. This seems to be a very hit-or-miss product, based on other reviews.
