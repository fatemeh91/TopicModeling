review/text: I have been shaving with this for a few weeks now. I would NEVER go back to cartridge razors. With how expensive cartridges are I would try to make them last about 3 months. I actually got used to shaving better with a dull blade. The replacement blades for these are so inexpensive I change them every Sunday.If I didn't shave one day with my cartridge razor it would clog up the next. Not with this one. This will give a nice smooth pass every time.
