review/text: I am visually impaired and this mask has been a godsend. The construction is simple (foam with a glued on plastic) but when I am having trouble with light sensitivity I can place the mask on and still get things done around the house. I have blind center training as a fully blind person and so I can function reasonably well with no sight.This is a bit uncomfortable for sleeping in, but still worth the money.
