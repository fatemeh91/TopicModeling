review/text: I would not recommend this pillow at all! I just received mine in the mail yesterday and I have already thrown it away. First, the pillow was dirty. I ordered the celadon pillow and when I opened it there were all these dark gray splotches on the top of the pillow. I took the removable cover off and realized the discoloration was caused by the filling. The lining between the pillow cover and the filling is a really flimsy white fabric, which led to the discoloration. I decided that I would wash the cover when I got a chance, so I put the pillow and the cover back in the box with the other stuff I ordered. When I went back through the box a few hours later, the gritty stuff, whatever it is, that makes up the filling got all over everything in the box. I brushed it all off with my hands, which was a mistake. I don't know what that filling is made of, but it felt like fiberglass. I would pick something else up and there would be little stings on my hands from the filling I touched. Even after scrubbing my hands, some of the filling remained. Additionally, the combination of the scent satchel in the pillow pocket and the gritty filling caused a sneezing attack.
