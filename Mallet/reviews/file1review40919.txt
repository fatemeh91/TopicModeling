review/text: Over the years I have purchased several electric shavers looking for the best one for a close shave. The Shave pro cordless shaver was given to me as a gift. I had it for a month or so before trying it. Every one of my prior electric shavers were priced between $75.00 and $125.00 range. This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It gives a close shave just like a single blade razor. I would recommend this electric shaver for the price to anyone wanting a nice close shave. I liked it so much that I ordered 3 more to have on hand.
