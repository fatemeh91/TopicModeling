review/text: Having a Zeiss lens in front of my Sony Camera body.....I am quite picky about what touches my lens glass (obsessively so....). Having Bought Kodak lens cleaning tissues, I was incredibly dismayed at the smearing/scratching by this product....My review of this product is posted on the net. Bad news.....Don't go there.....In contrast, the Carl Zeiss lense cleaning tissues are insanely superb with respect to gentleness and cleanabilty. After gently cleaning the lense, the solvent evaporates leaving absolutely no residual residue...it is as if I had just pulled the lenses from its original packing material....I cannot speak to the condition of the previous reviewers glasses...probably needs his eyeglass prescriptions adjusted......Any Photographer looking for premium lense cleansing tissues....look no further.....this is the best I've found ever.....My next dime is going to the Zeiss Vario Tessar 18 - 80mm lense at a whopping dime....the only thing touching this lense is the Zeiss whipes...Hope it helps and happy foto shooting.....
