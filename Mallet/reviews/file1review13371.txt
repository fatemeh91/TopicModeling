review/text: I bought 4 of these waterproof sheet protectors because my 5 year old wasn't potty trained at night yet. I wanted extras in case of constant wetting or flu, etc to protect the bed sheets. I also have a 3 year old that will be getting trained when she is ready. They worked like a charm! My 5 year old wet the bed a couple of different times during the training process. I just had to change the pad and her pants in the middle of the night and she was good to go back to sleep. She has now been dry for 7 nights in a row now! No more pull-ups! I would recommend this to anyone!
