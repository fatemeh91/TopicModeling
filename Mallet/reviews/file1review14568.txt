review/text: I received my sabona lady executive dress gold duet magnetic bracelet and was so excited. It is really a very pretty bracelet. I put it on immediately and within ten minutes, it fell off my wrist. It is a good thing I was still in my home because I would have lost it had I been outside.When I examined it closely, one of the pins that hold the links together was missing. I had to call the company and they advised me to mail it to them and they would replace it. I had to wrap it up, go to the post office and pay for priority mailing to send it back to them. It took over two weeks for me to get the bracelet back. They told me it should take only one week. I think this company should have reimbursed me my mailing cost because the bracelet was apparantly defective and cost me $3.85 to mail it back to them. And what about my disappointment and the inconvenience of going to the post office. I now have it for two days and so far it has not broken. I have to say though, I feel like I am constantly checking to make sure it is on my wrist. Hopefully, it won't break again.
