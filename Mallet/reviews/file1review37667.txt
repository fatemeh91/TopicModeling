review/text: This product worked really well. It's still waxing, which isn't a fun job, but this product does make it easier. The fact that when I'm done I can just rinse the residue away makes a huge difference. It also has the benefit of being really quick. There's virtually no wait to warm the product. Just hold the tube under warm, running water and go. The lotion for afterwards is really nice and I felt really smooth for many days!!
