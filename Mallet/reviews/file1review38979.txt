review/text: Schick Personal Touch Razors are no where to be found in the retail market. I was recently able to replace the razor (and one blade) at a discount store recently after forcing my blades onto a generic razor. Finally I can have it all - I've tried everything on the market and NOTHING compares to the Personal Touch. I have been using them since the 8th grade and now am 37 years old. Thanks Amazon!
