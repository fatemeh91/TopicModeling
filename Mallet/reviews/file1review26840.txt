review/text: Good flavor, even with water. Needs thorough mixing, I use a whisk ball shaker. Good protein to calorie ratio and priced comparatively to other online retailers. The scoop got buried in the powder during shipping and is a pain to dig out (use kitchen tongs). Why not just attach it to the lid? And why is a serving labeled one rounded scoop? Is it that hard to make your scoop a little bigger? It is easy to spill powder off a rounded scoop when transferring to a bottle. Anyways, a few stupid packaging flaws, but the powder itself is great and is visibly making a difference!
