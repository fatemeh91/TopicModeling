review/text: I have had this for more than a year and am still using the batteries that came with it and using it to charge other brand batteries also. The only problem is that it never would charge 4 batteries. The 2 battery slots on the right side did not work since new, so I can only charge 2 batteries at one time. You can charge AA or AAA bateries. The charging indicator is good and lets you know when the batteries are charging and have charged.
