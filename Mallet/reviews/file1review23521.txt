review/text: I was diagnosed with IBS two months ago after roughly six months of having *no idea* what the HECK was wrong with me -- Horrible constipation and gas for months on end. I was at the end of my rope. My doctor gave me a print-out about IBS that was last edited in 1994. Not much help. I found Heather's site and purchased the acacia fiber. It was about a week before I saw any results, but when I did, WOW! I feel 1000x better then I have in almost a year. My constipation is about 80% gone; I still have some bad days but overall I feel great. It lessoned my gas dramatically, but hasn't completely eliminated it as of yet -- I'm thinking of trying the fennel tea next. If anyone is reading this and wondering "Can it help me?" YES! You should give it a try. I felt myself slipping into depression over my inability to control my body. It was really awful. I feel as if this fiber saved my sanity. I never had pain, but I had plenty of embarrassment and no matter how much time I spent in the gym my stomach was always bloated and distended. I was too young to feel so old (39) I feel as if I have my life back under control. I cannot say enough about Heather's website or her products.
