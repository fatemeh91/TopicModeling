review/text: I work construction, bike, hike, and lots of physical activities. My problem was muscle cramps. Sports drinks helped but at night I would get leg cramps. I started taking this supplement and within a few days all my cramps were gone. My life has changed since taking Cal,Mag, potassium. Hope it helps you as much it has helped me.
