review/text: This replacement cutter head and foil pack installs with absolutely no fuss in only a few seconds and the result is you'll be shaving like your razor was brand new.I was able to get a good year out of my razor on the first set of foil/cutter head, and this is now my third replacement. I have a rather stiff, heavy beard and often shave twice a day, depending on whether or not I have something going on in the evening.This last fall I shaved my head bald and have used the Braun Actovator to keep my head shaved daily. This has caused quicker wear on the cutter head and foil and the last foil actually developed a small tear between a couple of the holes in about the 7th or 8th month of use. Once that happened it was impossible to use the razor without getting scratched and looking like I had been in a fight with a small housecat.Still, once the foil and cutter were replaced again, this is the closest shave I have ever had using a power shaver or razor. Only thing that comes closer is a real blade... and I've used several other reciprocating type razors and rotary shavers, too. I'm very pleased with this product and dread the day that Braun discontinues this replacement set... if they ever do.
