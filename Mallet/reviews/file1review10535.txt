review/text: I agree with Pam, Joe, Rita and Kerry. However, I think Ali Julia got it the most right. The cane is wobbly and off-set, but if you make the effort to learn how to use it it will probably be just fine. I am 68 yrs. old and 4'11" and weigh 125 lbs. I can't imagine a much larger person feeling safe with it. I called Customer Service at DMI for some information since the cane did not come with any instructions and was rather quickly disconnected while trying to explain my reason for calling. I did not call back and Customer Service did not return my call. As usual, Amazon did a great job getting my purchase to me.
