review/text: I'd never had these vitamins before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. These vitamins taste really delicious. They are nice and tangy and the berry flavor is a much-needed change from predictable orange. (I mean, aside from dietary needs, the taste is the only reason why one would buy a chewable vitamin, right?) The superior taste has been confirmed by two of my roommates, one of whom is one of those people who only eats about four different kinds of food, thereby proving this vitamin's exceptional quality.
