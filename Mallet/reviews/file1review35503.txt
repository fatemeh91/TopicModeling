review/text: I recently went to the department store I always got Blue Relief from, and could not find it. I left really upset because this is the only balm that actually relieves, and in some cases ends for good, my muscles spasms. It does require me to sit still for about 20 minutes, which is hard for my personality, but the relief is worth it. Even my chronic neck pain finds relief when I apply Blue Relief before bed. I was going to the chiropractor up to three times a week it had gotten so painful. If I remember to apply the gel morning and night, the spasms are reduced and the pain does not build up. I just need to rest for a while and let it work. I give it to anyone I love that is suffering body pains. I hope it works for you too.
