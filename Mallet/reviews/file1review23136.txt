review/text: I got this to clean up the salt and sand tracked in from outside. It's good for picking up crumbs and small items, too. Yes, it takes longer than an electric vacuum, but it's much more quiet, and can be used in the middle of the night.It was easy to put together - Just read the instructions. Those who complained that the handle fell apart, probably did not read that you're supposed to bang it upright on a carpeted floor (use a magazine if you have bare floors) to set the pieces together before attaching it to the base.
