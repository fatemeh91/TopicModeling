review/text: The item seemed to do a very nice job for the short time in which it was operational; it left my mouth feeling very fresh. However, the motor conked out after 5 days. In some ways, that's almost a good thing--it's twice as easy to return mere days after purchase than if it hung on for a couple of months before dying.
