review/text: I am so grateful to Amazon for handling the Glucerna bars. I had to go through several kind to find the one that I liked. Then you could never find them at WalMart or the Drug store.That was very frustrating , because they are a good product for a diabetic.So needless to say I will be regularly be ordering these from you.Many thanks, Bev.
