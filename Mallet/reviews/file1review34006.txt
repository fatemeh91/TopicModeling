review/text: Last winter I tried a sample of this cream. They were giving it away at my local health food store. I few pouches saved me from itching the whole season. Now, even though it is just October, I decided to get ready and buy it in advance because every other cream I tried failed. I did not try anything that is chemically based though so, I would not speak of those creams. But as far as all natural ingredients - this cream worked the best.
