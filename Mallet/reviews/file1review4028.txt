review/text: Excellent directly through amazon.com! No different than at the stores, except for the price. Make sure you order them ONLY directly through Amazon or be VERY careful ordering them through other sites. We had a bad experience with ordering them from someone else other than amazon.com. We ordered them somewhere else because of price. They had good reviews when we ordered, but they ended up being counterfeit. They broke and literally pulled the hair out of your skin instead of shaving it off. We then went to order through amazon and went back to that site to see MANY complaints. They looked like the real thing and the packaging was exact, but they were fakes.
