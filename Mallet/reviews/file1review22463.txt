review/text: I had been taking Megafood supplements for a while and the price of those is outrageous (can be twice the price of these, depending where you get them). These multis do not cause stomach upset or burping of any kind and they are just packed with nutrients and vitamins. Best of all, because these are whole food supplements, they are more readily absorbed and used by the body and you can also take them on an empty stomach--again--with no upset.I also love that these have spirulina and bee pollen in them!
