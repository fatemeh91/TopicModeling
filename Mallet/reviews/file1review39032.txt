review/text: i love this product...i have very short hair...guide # 3. I give myself a haircut every 4 or 5 days in less than 3 minutes with this clipper. Right out of the box my 4 yr old son demanded his haircut, apron on and all!...without even reading instructions, i used a # 5 guide and it was easy. The dvd is helpful for longer haircuts, sideburn trimming, etc...made of rugged heavy steel...even the included scizzors are not cheap....for the $27 it is a great investment...over time will probably save me hundreds of $.
