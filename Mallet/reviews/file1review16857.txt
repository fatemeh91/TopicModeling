review/text: I received this product as a birthday present after adding it to my Amazon wish list. It isn't quite what I expected -- the product description is correct, but I made incorrect assumptions based on other Homedics products I had tried. It is ONLY a vibrating pillow; there isn't any additional "massage" (rolling or kneading) action. And I found the vibration to be fairly weak, even on the "high" setting. It makes a pretty loud humming noise and is pretty bulky, so I can't imagine using it at work as other reviewers have suggested.I frequently get tension headaches and stiffness in my shoulders, which is why I was interested in this product. When I tried it for the first time, I was skeptical it would work, because as I mentioned there was really no "massage" action. However, when I took it off after about 10 minutes, the muscles in my neck and shoulders did feel more relaxed. The effects lasted for a couple hours too, unlike other massagers I've used. And unlike other "squishy" pillows I've seen in stores, it is a good, comfortable size that would probably work well on an airplane or long car trip (although I haven't tried that yet). I tried using the vibration on my lower back as well, but didn't have as much luck -- because of the curvature of my back, it was hard to find a good position.Bottom line: it's a good product for the price, but don't expect anything more than a simple vibrating pillow.
