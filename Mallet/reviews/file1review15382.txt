review/text: My husband has severe degenerative arthritis. Has had both knees replaced, and a new shoulder put in due to all theyears of hard and heavy produce work at the market. His body has taken its toll while working, especially pronouncedduring his retirement years. Was lucky enough to research this out online; and has been taking it for over 5 years now.This has been helping him. Continually takes this, because surgeon recommends to have the other shoulder replaced too.Very happy with product, and will continue to take since it helps him.
