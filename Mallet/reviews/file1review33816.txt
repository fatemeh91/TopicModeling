review/text: I purchased this stethoscope as a &#34;bargain&#34; scope to leave at my grandmothers so I could listen to her and check her BP, and I didn't always have my Stethoscope handy, I was pleased with the quality of this scope it had a great weight to it, the tubing was very strong, it had great sounds too it, if you need just a basic stethoscope for basic assessments this is a great tool, and you could skip the expensive brand.
