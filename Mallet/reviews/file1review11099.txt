review/text: I love Emergen-C, Super Orange flavor! It is a very mild orange flavor- not fake tasting and not too sweet. I originally bought this for combating what I thought was a cold, but religiously drink this every day (up to 2X as the label suggests), simply because I like the taste! I find myself reaching for a glass of this when I'm craving something like juice....and most juices have splenda/other artificial sweeteners and many many empty calories, so this is a much better trade off! I was reluctant at first to try this, because I grew up with a mother who religiously drank Metamucil in the morning- just the thought of her mixing it up makes me gag. But this has a lovely smell and completely dissolves in water. Not grainy and no Metamucil flashbacks :)
