review/text: I just got back from a 20 day trip to the infamous Mosquito Capital of the world, the Philippines. The other people in my group were getting bit like crazy, 1 girl was even using Off! But thanks to this stuff I escaped the Philippines with only 1 or 2 mosquito bites!Trust me Amazon Women & Men, this stuff works!!! The spray itself has a pleasant Lemon Oil Smell, goes on pretty smooth,& lasts around 6-10 hrs.Overall, Bug Band provides the Best Protection against Mosquitoes & safe for the Environment!!!!p.s. Don't forget to spray down your beddings at night to give u full protection.
