review/text: When it says DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE it REALLY means DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE...It tastes REALLY good...you just gotta add suggar and its amazing...And 10 pounds really gets your head away from worry about protein for a while...I would buy 3 more of those and 2 o 3 miscellar casein supplements to forget about protein intake for a year or more!Just 3 or 4 foods (easy to take) and 2 or 3 "supplement foods"...
