review/text: This is the perfect trimmer, something that I always wished and never could find. Before buying this trimmer, I had a very uncomfortable trimmer (I hide the name), with all these accessories, and different pieces with different sizes, and you go to the bathroom and is like if you were going for vacations, you have a complete bag with many things, they fall,..etc. You have here everything in only one piece!!, and is safe, you don't have to worry about scratches in your face or something.
