review/text: This is a good product. The conditioner left my hair smooth and silky. I have some uncontrollable gray hair that this product seemed to help control. My hair was shiny and had no tangles. I didn't, but would like to try the shampoo along with the conditioner. I'd recommend this product to my friends. The only thing I didn't like about it was its lack of smell -- I personally like a shampoo and conditioner with smell. That wouldn't keep me from using this product however.
