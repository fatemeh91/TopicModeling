review/text: I've had my Sennheiser wireless headphones for quite a while. The original battery was good for about the promised 4 hours of use. When it eventually got to the point that it was down to an hour or so, I got two replacements from a local battery specialty store. They weren't Sennheiser brand and were only good for a around 2-3 hours, but since I had two, I swapped and charged them as needed (I normally use them for less than an hour at a time while I exercise). When those two dropped down to an hour or so, I bought these shown here. They came in Sennheiser packaging and I'm back to getting the full 4 hours of playtime from each of them like the original. So I'm a happy camper. Wish Sennheiser would come out with higher capacity batteries, but can't have everything.
