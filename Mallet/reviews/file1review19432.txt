review/text: I was very much interested in getting some of these 'ultrasonic' bug repellers so I took a chance on this one. These things are worse than useless! I have no idea if it works on bugs, but it would sure as heck drive me out of the house if I didn't un-plug it immediately. Seriously, I tried two separate units in different outlets around the house, these things emit a horrific sound that was maddening.
