review/text: I ordered this Oxo grout brush to go with the Eureka Environ steam floor cleaner, but the brush came first, the steam cleaner took a month to arrive and still hasn't been used. I have been using the brush on grout and dirt on my tile floors (living, dining, kitchen and hall). The tile is rough textured and was hard on my nails when I tried scraping stuff off, but this little brush is doing a great job!I have an Amazon parrot and her droppings were very hard to get up off the rough tile and grout. I am so glad I bought this brush! It's great and so far isn'tshowing any sign of wear. My nails and paring knives thank Oxo for making the brush and Amazon for suggesting it when I was ordering the steam cleaner.Update 1/2/13 - This brush gets frequent, tough use - and it's still holding up its end of the purchase. If you have "rough" ceramic tile with improperly sealed grout that discolors easily, you'll be really happy you have this handy gadget. The steam cleaner sucked on the floors so it wasgiven away, but I kept the brush!
