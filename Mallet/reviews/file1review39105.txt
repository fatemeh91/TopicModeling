review/text: These clippers are professional and very easy to use. It includes complete instructions and every possible attachment that you can imagine. We used to spend over $100 per month in haircuts for the men in our family and have saved thousands of dollars with this inexpensive, easy to use clipper kit. I have no haircutting experience and was amazed at how easy it was to cut the boys' hair myself. Try it, you'll love this!
