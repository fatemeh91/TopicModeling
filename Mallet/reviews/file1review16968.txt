review/text: Excellent product. I use my beard rather short, and for that this trimmer does a superb job. I charged it the first time, have used it every other day since then, it's been two weeks and there is no sign I need to recharge it again yet. Trims smoothly and cleaning it is as easy as brushing it lighly. I'm delighted that I don't have to use any oil to clean it. Great choice.
