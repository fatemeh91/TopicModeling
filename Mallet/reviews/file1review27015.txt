review/text: Over 20 grams of protein in one tiny scoop with practically no sugar and fat, what else could you ask for? I lift about 2-3 times a week and had just switched over from an ON weight gainer powder to this pure Whey and I feel dramatically different, stronger, and healthier. It mixes very very easy with just a few seconds of shaking in water or milk. I've tried also with a blender but it's really not necessary. Taste wise it's great like a milk shake (I ordered Double Chocolate flavor). Side note, I had been adding too much water or milk the first few trys and it tasted "watered down." I then tried again with less milk this time, maybe about 4 or 5 oz, it tasted great and I felt even better. Happy training!
