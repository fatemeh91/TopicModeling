review/text: I put a ton of this on at about 8 pm right after a shower. It smelled nice and didn't irritate my pits, which is good. However, by 10 am the next morning I had a nice funk going on and I'm not a particularly smelly person, nor did I do anything strenuous that night, if you know what I mean. I can see detecting a slight, "Oh I better reapply" kinda smell the next morning but it was full on "I need to shower" b.o. I went ahead and reapplied because I wasn't quite ready for a shower and an hour or two later I was smelling again. Needless to say, didn't work for me. I'm 28, maybe I'm still too hormonal, who knows.
