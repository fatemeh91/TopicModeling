review/text: The usefullness of this brace depends, I suppose, on what exactly is going on in your arm that is causing the pain. I am about 5'10" and nearly 200 lbs. Very active, but not a tennis player. I was cleaning my lawn with an electric leaf blower. It gets tiring, so I was switching between arms. The next day I decided to clean my hanger out with the wonderful blower. So imagine you are holding a heavy leaf blower in your left hand, and rotating it towards the left...the muscles, tendons and ligaments involved in that motion became the problem.These muscles were again recently damaged in an accident. They really never get time to heal, as it can take many months. And I was always banging my elbow in to things...So this brace, which is very robust and larger than the ace models, not only provides security for the muscles connections, but also keeps you from banging your elbow...which if you are reading this, know how it hurts.Within two days, I was able to regain the ability to make a clenched fist, and slowly reach for the shoulder belt without great pain. Scratching your back with a damaged elbow is tough, but I can now almost do it. I did a great deal of moving over the last few days (picking up rubber maid containers) and the pain is only moderate and occasional, vs continuous all day long.The pain was diagnosed by a local neurologist as referred pain caused by chronic compression of the C5-6 vertebra, which would probably need to be fused...hmmm.So, I am pleased to wear this brace rather than face spinal surgery. The human body is wired quite mysteriously, and one persons pain solution does not uniformly work for another...but this is the highest return for money spent on any gizmo in my entire life.
