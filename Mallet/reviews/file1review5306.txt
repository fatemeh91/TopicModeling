review/text: These are soooo good, warm and refreshing. Originally my friend sent them as a gift and I can't resist them and bought more. The packages are about the size of a bag of cough drops, but so much better. The delivery was a few days faster than anticipated so I was very happy. I keep going back. If I could find them in a store I would, but I don't mind, it's a good price and I can't drive so I like the delivery and very prompt.
