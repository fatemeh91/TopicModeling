review/text: These gloves are much thicker than expected. In spite of abiding by the measuring guidelines, they did not fit me well (although I have large hands, the guide said I did not need an extra large). I considered going to a larger size but felt they would simply no do what I needed them to.Two very irritating features:1. The gloves simply don't breathe - consequently I had to peel them off about once an hour. Because they don't breathe they also don't dry very quickly2. The fingers extend literally to the base of your fingertips - essentially leaving just the ball of your fingers exposed.From other reviews, these gloves have helped some; however, they are just not for me.
