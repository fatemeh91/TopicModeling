review/text: I would say that this product seems fairly good. I got the product about a month ago now. I haven't used it long enough to feel that it is very accurate or not. I was testing it for a while and every time that I use it with alcohol in my system, it blew out numbers around .1 to .15.A plus is that it is a complete hit if you are entertaining guests. Everyone who is drinking wants to try it.One negative is that it is less accurate when you have had a drink right before you use it. Overall, I think that this product was worth having but in no way would I trust this product to let me know if I can drive or not.
