review/text: Zantrex is a good and powerful weight loss and energy supplement, with proper use, diet and excersize you WILL lose weight and have extra energy. My suggestion however is to start slowly, this product contains a lot of caffine and is a dieretic: translation you will pee and sweat more then when not using this product, you need to replace this fluid loss! All of the side effects listed in the one star reviews can be eliminated and or avioded by drinking an extra liter or two of water; except perhaps the sleeplessness that can be avioded by not taken the product after about 6pm. My only real complaint is it is not quite as good without the ephedrine; that was banned because pepole refused to use the previously mentioned common sense and cautions. :-(
