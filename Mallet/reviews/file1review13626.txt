review/text: I bought one of these via goodmans direct (It was cheaper that way, $4.92 incuding shipping).Im used to using something similar but not power. This one just doesnt do any better and may be worse.I also dont like that you have to keep your thumb on the ON button, there is no permanent ON.The best thing about it, and the others that I use is that if you keep them handy you are more likely to use them.
