review/text: I'm using Yeast-Cleanse in conjunction with a low sugar, low(er) carb veggie diet to help rid my body of candida. I had headaches for the first few days, and some crankiness in the afternoon (when I'd usually have my tea and cookies) but no ill effects otherwise. After a week of using YC, my energy has returned and my skin issues (tinea corpus, snow squall dandruff) have subsided.One reviewer had legitimate concerns about the inclusion of tea tree oil in YC -- it isn't recommended that you ingest tea tree oil, but I think the amount in YC is fairly low. I've been using tea tree oil topically and in toothpastes / mouthwashes for over a dozen years, so my body is accustomed and reacts favourably to it.Also, I'm still nursing my toddler, and she's shown no ill effects getting YC "second hand" from me -- in fact, her persistent diaper rash cleared up within days.
