review/text: I was looking for a a pen and a pencil rolled into one, and i like my pens to be sleek and non-plasticky... i bought a tech3 some 3 weeks ago and have been using it every day since - and i tend to write about a couple of pages of notes a day.Tech3 as a writing instrument and the Tech3 as a Cross are 2 different animals. The combination of black & red and the pencil offer great coverage of what i need in my note taking - but the twist action is could be better, doesn't feel "solid" enough for a Cross, the instrument feels a little light in the hand. But it writes well and covers what i needIf it were not a Cross i would have given it a 4.
