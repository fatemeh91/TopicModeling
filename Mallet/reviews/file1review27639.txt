review/text: In my opinion this is the best protein out there because this is cheapest protein if you buy in bulk and its high quality whey protein. That is why I only buy the 10 pound bags because you're going to eventually run out and you save $ in the long run. Also, i put on like 10 pounds of muscle in the first 6 weeks i started taking this protein.
