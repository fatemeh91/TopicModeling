review/text: This is a great facial cleanser. It really helped control my oil and acne this summer! It is a little harsh for my skin this winter, but I still feel like it cleans really well without stripping my skin of its' moisture. For the winter, I have been using this and alternating it with Cetaphil bar soap.
