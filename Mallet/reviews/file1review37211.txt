review/text: I love these gloves especailly that they have longer fingers than most gloves. I have nodules on the knuckles just below my finger nails and most open fingered gloves don't have fingers long enough to cover those painful knuckles especially on my thumb. Often the end of the thumb on the glove comes right across the middle of that very sensitive knuckle. My only issue is the material. I work in an office and use they key board all day. The sound and rough feel of the nobby material is a nuisance. If the nobbiness could be smoothed out and maybe a variety of colors available it would be a perfect glove for me.
