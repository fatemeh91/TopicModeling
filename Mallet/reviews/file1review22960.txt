review/text: We are a group of 5 night shift nurses that love this sweeper. It did a great job cleaning up our nurses station. We used this product in many ways testing it to see how well it really did work. It picked up not only popcorn, but the kernels too.It also picks up paper hole punch messes, and scraps of paper in no time. it is light weight enough for anyone to use and stores well.We had an older sweeper that took alot of time to use and still left a mess behind. Now it is nice to pull the sweeper out and be done without a lot of bending over to pick up the pieces the sweeper missed. Its great and we recomend it to others, in fact most of us have bought it for our own homes.
