review/text: I have been using the liquid Zim's Crack Creme for years and have found nothing better for healing dry cracks in your heels and feet. I have tried the creamy formula upon occasion, but it does not work nearly as well on deep cracks. A regular regimen of a good emery type pedicure file while your feet are moist in the shower, Zim's liquid and a moisurizing lotion will keep your feet looking beautiful.
