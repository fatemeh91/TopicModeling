review/text: This lubricant was recommended by my doctor due to allergies to many other lubes available. It was really thick and sticky, much different than other lubricants available in regular stores. Once you get used to the different texture, it works great for my purposes. I decided to order via the internet rather than search in medical supply stores. Seemed easy enough, right?Amazon is always my first choice to purchase things because of my good luck with the company and its suppliers. I ordered 2 tubes of this lube from Medical Department Stores and was sent a completely different brand of lubricant and only one tube instead of the two for which I originally paid.I contacted the company directly and instead of a response from them regarding their error, a refund, or an exchange, Amazon emailed me regarding a full refund. The problem is, neither company addressed sending me the correct product. I am very disappointed that a simple order was wrong and getting the correct product to me has been disregarded.
