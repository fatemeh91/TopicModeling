review/text: While I was searching for toys of this nature I had many options, after reading other reviews I thought this would be the route to go. After clicking on the item I noticed that the different colors were different prices and that the purple that I bought was pictured with several other items that I thought would be perfect and thought that is why it was a higher price. When the package arrived I realized that the purple item was bigger in size I think than the other two colors but there were no other items in the box. I know that it was still a great deal for this item but the main reason I bought it was for the other items too. Just want to let everyone know about this in case they want to order it thinking the same thing I did.
