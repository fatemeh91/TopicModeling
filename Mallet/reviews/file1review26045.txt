review/text: I have purchased this same product several times and have found it reliable and helpful. The only failure I have experienced was when I sent it through the laundry with my jeans, otherwise it has worked flawlessly for years. I did discern one new feature with the latest purchase, it has a silence mode! If the button at 2 o'clock is held down, the watch reverts to a silent mode. If you hold the button down a second mode, it will resume talking. I've enjoyed the watch and if I send it through the laundry again, I will buy another.Arthur Gusner
