review/summary: Great taste and texture review/text: I bought a smaller size to try this before buying a larger package. I regretted the decision to not get the larger pack right away.The flavour is fantastic and the texture is great. I have been able to get my (difficult to eat anything in the morning) son to have a protein shake for breakfast - and doesn't normally like mint.
