review/text: I'd been using an older model, the MB-30, for about half a dozen years, and it had gotten to the point where the battery wouldn't hold much more than the charge for 1 trim, so I decided to look elsewhere. I thought it was completely shot, as the blades had slowed and it pulled terribly. However, after I gave the blades a thorough cleaning, it worked better. I saw that the MB-200 occasionally dropped under fifteen bucks, so I bided my time and picked one up for the right price.I am so pleased with the Remington MB-200 cordless titanium beard and mustache trimmer! Here are the pros and cons, as I see them:Pros:Blades move faster than the older model.No pulling on beard or mustache while trimming hair.Quieter than the older model.More ergonomically comfortable to hold than the older model.The height adjustment wheel really locks in the height, so you don't find yourself suddenly trimming at a shorter length because you pressed too hard.As the "comb" (guide?) is attached, there are less parts to lose.The AC adapter is much smaller than the older model and I can plug other things next to it, though it is a squeeze.Less expensive than most other models out now, without sacrificing quality.Cons: The very edge of the "comb" is a bit pointy. I wish they rounded the corner just a little more.Bottom line is that I'm really glad that I purchased this trimmer. It has the best bang for the buck and would be worth it, even for ten bucks more than what I paid.Edit: 10/10/12: I bought this unit in August, 2011 and have been using it weekly for over a year now. I stand by my 5-star rating. I have had no issues with the battery showing signs of failing. The motor runs just as strong as it did a year ago. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of this unit.
