review/text: Very supportive on my office chair. It has one strap in the middle so the cushion moves slightly. It was not a problem, but I am particular so I removed the strap and sewed one on the top and one for the bottom so it does not move at all.I weigh 125lbs, so the cushion is supportive. If you are a pretty heavy person, it might not be enough support. My coworker used my chair one day and I saw that the cushion flattened out behind her. She weighs about 180 - 190lbs.When I bought the cushion, I did not realize it was massaging. Since I only need support for my back, I have not yet used this feature.Overall, it is very much worth the $16 I paid for it.
