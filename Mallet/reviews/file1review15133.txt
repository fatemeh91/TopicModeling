review/text: My children seemed to really like them. They have a slightly different taste than what I expected. They're almost like a Fig Newton chewy. They were very filling and helped us feel that we were no longer hungry. They helped us feel more energetic. My family tried the product and the children seemed to be the most impressed, although the adults also thought that they felt more ""alive"".
