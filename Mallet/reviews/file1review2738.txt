review/text: I usually get my Beanpod Eucalyptus Lavender at a local flower/gift shop, but they don't carry this scent lately, so I ordered through Amazon via Soy Basics. It turned out to be great. It was the newer style jars and the scent was the same as ever. I'm back to buy one or two more. I like to burn this scent after dinner, to get the food smells out of the house for bedtime. Burns clean. I've seen other types of candles leave a film on cabinets or counter tops, these don't. It is smokey when I blow it out, I just set on the stove top and turn on the vent if I feel like messing with getting the smoke out. So glad I found my brand and fragrance.
