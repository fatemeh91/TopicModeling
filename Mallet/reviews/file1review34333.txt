review/text: The holes on this filter are absolutely huge compared to the lint coming out of my washer and clogging the utility sink. A Nylon stocking with zip-tie works best, but needs to be changed at least once per month or else it gets too clogged and then gets pushed off. I tried a Nylon stocking inside of this, but it just made the water shoot everywhere.
