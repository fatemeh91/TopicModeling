review/text: Having evaluated several electric toothbrushes recently, I find that the actual cleaning action of this toothbrush ranks at the very bottom.It's noisier than other electrics, the round bottom is an awful "innovation" since that means that it has to lay flat on a counter or in a cabinet, taking up much more space than necessary and risking getting knocked on the floor when the countertop gets crowded. But that's not why I wouldn't recommend this brush.Fundamentally, I simply didn't feel that it cleaned my teeth very well. I had to use more force than I should have to clean around my gums and the second row of bristles with the up-down motion proved nearly useless. Only the rotating top portion was effective.The one thing that the Oral B has going for it is that it has a better motor than most of the electrics that I've tried. For example, the plastic junctions in a Colgate electric toothbrush skip as soon as I apply any pressure to the bristles and it actually stops from the friction while I'm cleaning my back teeth. The Oral B neither skips nor stops while I'm brushing. It simply doesn't clean very well.I think that you're better off with a an old fashioned medium-bristle manual toothbrush than this electric. If you must buy an electric, look for one with two revolving heads. The cross-action is not very effective.
