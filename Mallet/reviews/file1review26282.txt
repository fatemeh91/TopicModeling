review/text: Oh, man, these tasty little bars (and they are little at just a titch over one ounce each) are splendid. They taste like a little tropical fruit bomb just went off in your mouth. They're an odd texture if what you're used to is the mealier bars (like those from Odwalla) or those super moist bars (Clif's Bars). These are drier, like a dense cake almost, but very flavorful (and not super sweet). You'd never know they're gluten free; the soy powder gives them enough texture for you to think you're eating something that was made with regular flour. You'll be able to taste the mango in these, but that flavor is not overwhelming. Neither is the coconut. It's balanced nicely by the pineapple, and the raisins aren't overpowering.The strawberry version is delicious but a bit sweeter and moister than this one.At 140 calories each, these little bars can get you through a hunger attack without overdoing it.
