review/text: Optimum Nutrition is one of my favorite brands of supplements. These pills aren't overly large and you could cut them with a pill cutter or just break them in half with your fingers.I like the value/price of Optimum Nutrition. Visit their website and you can get a ton of information. Sure their labels look a littler generic, but I actually like that...they show you what the product is, tell you what's in it without a bunch of flashy neon colors and fancy names no one can pronounce like a lot fo the other supplement companies.
