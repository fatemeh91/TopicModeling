review/text: It didn't seem to be picking up anything on the tile floor, so I swept and then tried using it to pick up what I had swept - it took SEVERAL Minutes just to get most of what I had already swept to get picked up. Then I went to empty it, and the handle came off and most of what it had finally picked up got dumped back all over the floor, to be swept up again.It is worse on carpet; hard to get it to pick up anything at all.
