review/text: This large pad covers my discomfort places well. It has a switch that must be held in order for the pad to heat. If I fall asleep, my hand lets go and the pad stops heating, preventing burns or becoming too hot. It is a heavy duty pad and should last a long time. The cover generates its own moisture, keeping my skin from becoming too dry because of the heat.
