review/text: I like this tub because it folds up and is stored more easily than the larger tubs. However, when my son is sitting in the tub in our sink, sometimes the ends of the tub that are meant to fold will snap (and start to fold up) and the loud noise will startle him. It seems that the locks that hold the tub in the open position are not strong enough (if your baby is over 10 pounds, this is when this started for me).This tub also doesn't hold a lot of water, which starts to become a problem as your baby gets bigger.
