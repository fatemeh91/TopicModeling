review/text: I can still remember the first time I tried an unscented Finish powerball tablet. To determine how well it really works, I put a day to two-day old really dirty pots, pans, dishes, silverwares, and glasswares to the dishwater unrinsed. When I took them out, I inspected every single item, and they were all very clean, free of any food residue. The "orange" scent in this product does not really smell "orange-y" but it does give the product a very mild hint of a "detergent" smell. Aside from that, the product works just as well as the unscented tablets, and you can see the power of these tablets in the fine results they produce!!
