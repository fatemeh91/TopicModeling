review/text: This Colgate Fluoride Toothpaste has everything you could ever need in a toothpaste. It has a great minty taste that left my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh. There was even a subtle difference in the whiteness of my teeth even after just one week of use. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste.
