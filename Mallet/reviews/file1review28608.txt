review/text: I've tried so many different protein powders, different brands, different flavors and each time I had to force myself to drink it. It was ok if I had a blender around but a lot of time I had to use a shaker at the gym and most powders dont taste good or mix well in a shaker. When I read the reviews about this protein, I saw things like mixes easily, no blender needed, tastes good... so I decided to give it a try. WOW! The double chocolate tastes just like chocolate milk, its not as sweet as muscle milk or as thick. It mixes really easily in a shaker which is perfect for me when I have to mix it at the Gym. I'm so impressed I ordered the bananna cream so i can add it to some of my fruit smoothies in the morning! I highly recommend this product.
