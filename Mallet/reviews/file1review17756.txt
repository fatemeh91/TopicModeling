review/text: I bought this after reading all the rave reviews, and having quite satisfactorily previously owned a Remington beard trimmer years and years ago. It was the biggest mistake I could make.This trimmer will *damage* longer beards. My beard is just over the length of the 8 setting on this, and while the trimmer was powerful and comfortable, a day after using it, my entire beard was completely and irreparably damaged. Where the Remington cuts the hairs is fine - the cuts are clean and straight, not resulting in any split ends. But if your beard hairs are even remotely stiff/brittle and thick, it will "break" them in multiple spots. It appears that the blades are "messy," they will do half-cuts in more than one place along a hair. I'm not talking about one or two hairs here - a week after my "trim," I've had to manually cull thousands of hairs and am still finding more that have been completely ruined. The only fix at this point is a clean shave and two months regrowth.Don't get this if you don't feel like going clean shaven for a week in order to regrow your hair after this abomination of a trimmer damages it.It works fine if you're using it to shave rather than trim, or if you're using it on sparse hair (mustaches vs beards).
