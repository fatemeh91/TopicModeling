review/text: I really like the long pieces that are already cut and ready to use. I love the two different side options also. The floss moves in and out of my teeth so smoothly. The only thing I didn't like was how the floss came out of the box. The first time was hard, but after that it was a snap. I highly recommend this product to my friends and especially those who have kids with braces.
