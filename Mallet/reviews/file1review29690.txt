review/text: These pads would be great is they weren't so thick and if they were larger. They're so bulky that you can see them through clothing very easily. Because they are so small and don't stay in place well, they always seem to be just off to the side of the nipple whenever my milk lets down, so I end up leaking. I have a few pairs of nursing pads that seem to be just a couple layers of flannel and they work great. They're thinner and cover more area. I would try to find flannel ones instead of these.
