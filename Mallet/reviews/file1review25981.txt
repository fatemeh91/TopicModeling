review/text: I don't know about the negative reviewers, but without these I am lost when in travel. I am a free-lance musician who travels a lot, & sleep deprivation is no small thing when you are out for weeks covering the globe... I cannot speak good enough of these things. As matter of fact I'm on my way to get my third ones--so much I have use & abused them through the years! They are absolutely phenomenal! THESE ARE A BLESSING TO ME!
