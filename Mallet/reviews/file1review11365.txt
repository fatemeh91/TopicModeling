review/text: For a lesser price, I would have given this product more stars, but at more than $20 an ounce I had really high expectations for "Handy Manum" and was mostly disappointed.PROS:- The best thing I can say about this product is that it WORKS FAST to stop itching. I have Dyshidrotic Eczema, which sometimes causes intense itching near callused parts of my hands. Typical hydrocortizone cream doesn't sink into calluses, but this hydrocortizone in a serum immediately seeped into cracks and callouses to stop itching.CONS:- Price. This is a "good" treatment for my dry and cracked hands, but for the price per ounce I expected greatness.- You have to let it soak in before you touch anything or put clothing over the area or it will discolor clothing/sheets/etc.- I expected it to do wonders for dry, calloused hands but I didn't notice any significant softening of my skin even with continued use.Overall, it's not a bad product, just not a good product at this price. After trying this for awhile a friend recommended Corona Ointment, which you can also buy from Amazon. It's made to be a horse hoof moisturizer (!) but for $1/oz accomplished everything (soft, healed, unchapped hands) that I hoped this $20+/oz serum would.
