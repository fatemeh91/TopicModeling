review/text: This is my fourth pregnancy and this time I'm having twins. I had severe back pain to the point of nearly not being able to walk with the previous three, and I doubted that a support belt would work for me, so I never tried one. Needless to say, being pregnant with twins, I gave in this time and decided to give one a try. I can't express enough how satisfied I am with this product. I still do experience slight pressure from time to time only. But overall, as soon as my back starts aching and I put it on, the pain goes away. It's been a great help for me. I wish I had used one before.
