review/text: These vitamins are by far the best! I do not have a taste for animal products. I was never a big meat eater as a child and it increased into adult hood with everything except a tad of honey in my tea. I can count on my hand the number of times a month I eat animal products in small amounts. Although I eat what most people would consider exceptionally healthy, I still have nutritional gaps.These vitamins have made me feel great and I picked them not only for the nutritional profile but, the reviews have stated its easy on the tummy. Be it, if I take it with or without food, my stomach has always been fine and trust me I have tried my share of multivitamins and all except this one has caused problems if I did not take it with a huge meal! Its nice to be able to take it in the morning!As far as the size goes, they are a bit large, but by no means are a "horse pill". If large pills are a problem, I recommendRainbow Light Prenatal Petite Mini tablets. You do have to take three of those a day though.The taste may not be fun to some who are use to the chocolate-chews and gummy bear vitamins, but remember Rainbow Light vitamins are all natural with no added "gunk", so they are a lot better for you in all ways! Safe for vegans and meat eaters alike! I heart these!
