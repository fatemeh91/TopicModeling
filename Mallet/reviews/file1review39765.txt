review/text: Wonderful floss - this is the best I've ever used. It started off with a 'free' sample and now I'm a regular user. Unlike other floss I have used, this one truly glides easily in/out of the tight spaces between my teeth, doesn't fray like other floss, and the 'wax' doesn't start scraping off in the beginning. Worth the extra few cents!
