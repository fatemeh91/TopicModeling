review/text: My 77 year old father lives with me and he recently had a hip replacement. This elevated toilet seat worked perfect for my dad after his surgery. My dad is 6ft and 220lbs so I was concern it would be to tight, but, it is wide and my father fits comfortably on the seat. The legs on the seat are not that long; the height is perfect on a 15" round seat toilet. However, I have another toilet that is 17" and has a oval seat and the legs do not go to the floor, which can make the seat a little shaky. But it still gets the job done. I feel more comfortable trusting him in the bathroom by himself with the elevated seat with the hand bars there.
