review/text: The ad picture clearly shows a Stanback package with the "ORIGINAL FORMULA" logo. Do not be fooled by this ad. Stanback has dropped its most expensive and essential ingredient from its formula and calls it "improved". Sorry folks, it is not improved. Take a grinder and grind up a coup[le of cheap asprins and you'll get the same effect. Stanback is now, nothing more than powdered asprin with a little caffein thrown in a speed up the asprin. They had an excellent product but have cheapened it for the bottom line. BC did the same thing. Only the consumer is holding the bag. Let the buyer beware.
