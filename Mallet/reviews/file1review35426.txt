review/text: I was so excited to use this product on our stainless steel dishwasher. It is only a couple of years old but has begun to smell like mold inside. I used this product as directed and I am not amazed with the results. The smell is the same and My dishwasher does look shiney but it never looked filmy in the first place and that was not my intended purpose for this product..
