review/text: strange....i just dont think this works. i take vitex/ dong quai instead. let's see how that turns out.i do see that it helps regulate but has anyone had any success in getting pregnant??? and if so, how long did it take with the use of fertilaid?i am inclined to just trying one more bottle but since i have pcos, maybe it just isnt for me...
