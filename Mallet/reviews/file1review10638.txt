review/text: I have previously had the exact image that is pictured here, however this is not what I received. I received two rolls wrapped in foil without the plastic dispenser or the paper insert shown in the picture. In fact there wasn't anything besides the two rolls wrapped in foil. I am happy that I received two rolls rather than one, but I wonder if this product may be old. The color of the paper is a little slow to change color and I found this to be true with the previous roll that I had as the roll aged.
