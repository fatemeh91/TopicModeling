review/text: I have tried several toilet seats and none seemed to work. This Babybjorn worked well. The raised area in the front could be a little taller but it is much better than the padded and unpadded seats we tried before. Overall this is a great seat with no areas for urine to hide and it's easy to clean and came with a toilet hanger so it's not in the way when he's not using it. My little boy is 2 and can up it on by himself.
