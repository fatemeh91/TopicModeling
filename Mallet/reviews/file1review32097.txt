review/text: I first used a Tide pen (aka Tide to Go) when I spilt soda pop on my white (of course!) shirt. My best friend gave me her pen to use, several hours later, and the stains disappeared.I just used it on bbq sauce on my shirt, no sauce left!BEST YET: I used it on a well set-in, multi-laundered stain on a sweater. The stain is barely noticeable.This is on my VERY short list of products I cannot live without!
