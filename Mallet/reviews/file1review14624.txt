review/text: Xylitol is the best sweetener I've ever used . . . period. Jarrow's price for the 16-ounce jug here at Amazon isn't too bad, either. I've also used the powder mixed with Lactoferrin and alcohol-free Witch Hazel as a wound dressing to stop bacteria from colonizing, which produce toxins that create infections and slowdown wound healing. I first learned of this a couple of years ago after reading about such being used in wound care centers. I will definitely continue to buy the product, as I use it everyday as a sweetener. Highly recommended.
