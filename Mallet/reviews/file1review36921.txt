review/text: This product also works when you are not wearing contacts. I've used this product to moisturize and refresh my eyes when writing lots of reviews. Also look for Allergan Refresh Contacts Comfort Drops.I wear contacts on occasion and would be terrified not to have a bottle of lubricating and rewetting drops with me.If I have to compare RENU with Allergan - I'd say Allergan is more "rewetting" while RENU seems to clear out your eyes and allows you to see more clearly.You can use both with soft contacts.~The Rebecca Review
