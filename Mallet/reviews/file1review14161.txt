review/text: Sure, it's very convenient to have the lotion right inside the razor, but it can get expensive to constantly have to buy more of these packs. I use regular shaving gel with my Cool Skin shaver and have never had a problem in the two years I have used it. I still use the packs when traveling, just for the space savings.
