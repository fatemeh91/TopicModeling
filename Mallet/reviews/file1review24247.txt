review/text: I have been an insert buying crazy gal trying to alleviate foot pain due to my fallen high arches. I almost didn't buy these because I didn't want to spend another $20 on something that wasn't going to work. I am so glad I got them, and have been walking painlessly ever since I've gotten and used them. A return to my old life of hiking, taking walks and sightseeing has been the happy result.I do know that if you don't have high arches, they will be very uncomfortable as my husband tried them and he has flat feet.
