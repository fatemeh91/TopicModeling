review/text: From opening the box, the smell took over my room! He smells fruity, but with an odd chemical-y smell if he's at your face. "Hidden" in an open tin, I actually like the smell it makes my room-- it's a naughty air freshener. ;)My only problem is the chemical-y smell, which makes me hold my breath when I'm "lubricating" him. When he's down there though, he's wonderful.Having been a couple weeks, I don't expect the smell to go away. I hope it fades, but that's just me hoping.He is pretty thick, very filling.. I'm shopping around for a smaller friend for a more daily use. To be honest, it's more for the escape of the smell than the size- he doesn't make me sore (because of his perfect softness), and I'm a beginner..
