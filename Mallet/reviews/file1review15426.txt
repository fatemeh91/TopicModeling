review/text: This incense is not as fresh or aromatic as I would like and occasionally some sticks would not burn. Overall the scent was a little weak for my taste. The sticks do have a nice slow burn and generally, the scent is a pleasant cut above most cheap store bought incense. Most sticks were acceptable. This incense is acceptable in small quantities to get you through a tight spot. Buying large amounts of this incense is not recommended.
