review/text: My belt was shipped Fed Ex for free and received very quickly. I loved my belt so much I sent one to my pregnant sister. She loves hers too. It has given us both some mobility we didn't have before. I am on my fifth child and she is on her fourth. We both had a lot of pain early on and needed this. I just wish I had it for my other pregnancies.
