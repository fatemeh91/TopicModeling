review/text: it's one of the best tools that i've put in my hand in a long time. solid feel. not slippery. nice contours. easy cleaning w/ included brush. manual states life time lubrication on the blades. have used 8 or 9 times w/o charging it. even cut w/ plenty of power. better than my previous norelco w/ vacuum. this doesn't vacuum, but the norelco missed a lot of the hairs anyway. all that i'm looking for in a trimmer.
