review/text: as i age i find myself being able to see less and less detail on small items. this tool solves that problem. with the interchangable lenses i can see detail on any small item. and when it comes to pulling out a sliver i can't tell you how easy it is using illuminated magnification. this is one of the most useful tools i've ever purchased.
