review/text: I recently purchased these bars for my mother who has been diagnosed with Diabetes. After trying a couple of them, she was turned off because she just didn't care for the taste. Out of sheer curiosity and expecting the worse, I tried one of them, then two, then. They weren't that bad. In fact, I thought they were delicious. These bars were designed for people with Diabetes but I've grown rather fond of them. For the price I don't eat them often but I do look forward to each bar. The Chocolate Chunk bars are amazing.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.
