review/text: I can finally place my prescription tablets and my supplements together in this well-constructed organizer due to its four large compartments for each day. I can take the day's supply in my purse and be confident the pills will be secure since the lid stays tightly shut. The different color for each day helps me know what day to grab on those mornings when I am not quite awake!
