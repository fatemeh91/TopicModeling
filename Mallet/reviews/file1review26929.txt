review/text: Other, more knowledgeable, reviewers have already expounded on the health/training merits of this product and alternatives so I'll leave it at this: It tastes great. The chocolate, my preference, tastes as good or better than a glass of chocolate milk made with Nestea or Hershey's syrup.
