review/text: It was really hard for me to get over the cost of these refills, but then I found them a lot cheaper at the warehouse club. Now I love this razor and have no plans to give it up. Shaves very close. Super fast and easy. No worries about shave gel getting washed off in the shower before you've had a chance to shave. As other reviewers have mentioned, the moisturizer bar wears down unevenly, but I found that holding the razor at a slightly more upright angle (vs more parallel to the leg) helps the front not wear down so fast. I have fine hair and shave 1-2 times a week. I go about a month between refills.
