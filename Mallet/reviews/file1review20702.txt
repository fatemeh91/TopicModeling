review/text: The manufacturer recommends replacing the foil screen and cutter block every 18 months for maximum performance. I wholeheartedly agree. This cutting system seems to last a little longer than older models but it certainly doesn't last forever. While it might not be exactly at 18 months, you can readily tell that the blades are getting dull when it takes longer to shave and/or you begin experiencing skin irritation. The set is pretty expensive but Amazon.com seems to have a very competitive price (a lot cheaper than I've seen in any brick & mortar store). Having said that, it really is like getting a brand new razor each time you make the change so it's very worthwhile doing it. Not sure if you can even buy them separately, but changing both parts at the same time ensures a closer shave with less skin irritation because they work together as an integrated system.
