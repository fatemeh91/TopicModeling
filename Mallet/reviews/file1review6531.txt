review/text: I have killer chronic back pain because of a car accident years ago and a bulging disc. I can't get to a massage therapist as often as I need to, so having a way to hit pressure points on my own back is really nice. The little knobbies that are supposed to do your neck don't really work for me, but for getting under my shoulder blades and even running up and down the sides of my spine, the pointy end really works. It has more bumps than I use, but once I got used to how it works, it really works.
