review/text: I would recommend this to anyone whose eyesight is starting to be &#34;ravaged by time.&#34; At almost 60, it is frustrating to have my vision get increasingly blurry, with little in the way of advice from the opthamologist, besides stronger glasses. OcuDyne has definitely helped to make my vision clearer.
