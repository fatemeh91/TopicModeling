review/text: Used this sleep mask on a long trip to Europe and it helped me fall asleep in even a fully-lit room. It is truly lightweight, and doesn't have an uncomfortable roll across the lower half like some masks do. If you roll over, it doesn't dig into your face. One of those items that does what it claims to.
