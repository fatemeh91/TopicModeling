review/text: I use this to crop the hair on my head every three weeks. They offer a smaller but similar tool somewhere, and I would suggest that for most people. This thing is built like a tank and unless you are chopping through some real thick stuff you probably dont need all that power and heft. I've never heard it slow even a little bit. A smaller tool would be easier to hold.Its a fine product but might be more than you need.
