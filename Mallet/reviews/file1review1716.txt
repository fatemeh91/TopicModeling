review/text: I have treated a variety of symptoms with this wash! Our family keeps it regularly in the showers. We have bathed away many irritants from dermatatis to athletes' foot. It is gentle, smells fresh and we use it daily with wonderful results. Combined with keeping the shower floor cleaned up with some Clorox spray, this keeps our athletes' foot away.
