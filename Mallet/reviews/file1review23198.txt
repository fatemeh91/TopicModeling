review/text: This Bissell Swift Sweeper model 2201-2 was too small to be useful. It actually seemed to be a toy. Only good use would be for a kid to help & follow Mom as she uses a full sized Bissell or a regular vacuum cleaner. I got stung with shipping costs to return it back to Amazon. Didn't make me happy since I bought two.
