review/text: I bought this toothbrush a few months ago and was not looking forward to paying the full toothbrush price again for brushes. Amazon prime is awesome, it came in 2 days, and I saved 10 dollars from the local drugstore. I did subscribe to make the price go down even lower - great! The toothbrush itself and the brushes are good for a low-cost sonic toothbrush.
