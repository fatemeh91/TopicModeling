review/text: Purchased this as a gift for my Mother, but she is raving about it! Her last epilator was a different brand, and this performs much better than that one. It grabs more hairs the first time you pass over them and pulls them out more effectively. It also has a bigger surface area, so its much quicker than her old one! She also had an original single barreled emjoy in the past, and this double barreled one is much better.
