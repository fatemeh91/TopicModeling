review/text: I idiotically purchased these Tweezerman tweezers because two I already have are useless at removing my very fine eyebrow hairs along with splinters from the plants in my front yard that are native to the Southwest deserts.From my experience with these tweezers, they are not designed for anyone with fine hair that is too fine, for removing splinters from plants that are so unusual as to be rare (lantana, cactus, etc.) and/or for those whose skin is unlike anyone else's on the face of the earth.So in addition to all the run-of-the-mill less expensive tweezers that can be found at drugstores, I now own three types of too sharp Tweezerman tweezers (recommended by various beauty experts as being the best) that will rip up my skin without removing facial hair -- especially stray eyebrow hairs -- or splinters.I relied on reviews from various sites, including Amazon, when deciding whether to buy these, as I did with the other Tweezerman products. I've learned my lesson.I have no clue what to recommend to anyone with very fine hair on their face, especially excess eyebrow hair, looking for tweezers. I've tried creams and lotions, which burn my skin without removing the hair; waxing, which inflames my skin without removing the hair; electric shavers, which don't remove all the hair; manual razors, sugaring and so on. I can't afford electrolysis so I'm clueless.
