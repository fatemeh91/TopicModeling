review/text: I bought this after reading the rave reviews. The product felt sturdy, but unfortunately I didn't fit my TOTO elongated toilet. It was not able to grip onto the toilet seat because TOTO's seat has a downward curved opening (sorta hard to describe). Don't buy this unless your toilet seat is completely flat. I'm going to return it this week. I hope there will be no trouble with Amazon accepting this unused product.
