review/text: I am just placing my order for my fourth Thermophore. Beware....I almost ordered the one with the automatic switch. This site is confusing. The one to order is the Red Box one made by Battle Creek, the manufacturer of the Thermophores. This is also a Amazon Prime item.I would never order one with an automatic switch. I want the switch that is automatically off in case of emergencies. While the Thermophores are wonderful, if they stay on too long, they may burn you.My wife and I have been using these for years. My other two are smaller (My first back surgery was in 1964. I have had two back surgeries and rotator cuff surgery and my wife has an authritic back) We need two of them at times. We don't share well!I can't speak to the repair problems, as we have never have had a repair issue. The one we are replacing, we had put away and when we found it in the attic, there was a discoloration problem. To play safe, we ordered a new one.
