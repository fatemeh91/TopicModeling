review/text: Been using these for the past 6 mos. My gums have always bled cause I only flossed before going to the dentist (about every 6 mos or so), regular floss never really worked me, my teeth were too close together. The last visit my dentist said my gums were getting inflamed and was getting the periodontal thing. I researched alternatives to the floss and found these, also researched the proper way to brush teeth and started using the total care mouthwash. My gums stopped bleeding after about a month of using these and I would use the regular floss about twice a month just to get a little more thorough removal of junk in there. These could be a little more sturdy on the brush end of them as I have had a few bend and had to throw out but that's a few out of 250 which isn't bad. My next dentist appt is in a month so i'll see what they say. Hopefully they'll say , wow!
