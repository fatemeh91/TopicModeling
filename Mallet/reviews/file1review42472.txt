review/text: Well, let me begin with saying that I'm just going to talk about the flavor, since this is supposed to be a good source of isolated whey protein and is supposed to work.I tried this flavor with water and tastes very good. Maybe not as good as a mocha frappuchino, but considering it's protein, the flavor is very good. Probably if you tak it with milk it will taste a lot better. And if you add a lot of ice I think it will be much much better.The amount of protein/calories ratio is very good, and another good thing I like about the Dymatize whey proteins is that the cholesterol is very low, so you don't have to be counting miligrams... :)I recommend this product, I bet you won't have complaints about the flavor.
