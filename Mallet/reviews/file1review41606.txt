review/text: I never knew what I was missing out on. The first time I used it, I immediately noticed a difference in how clean my teeth felt. The bottom line is, it just works better than doing it manually. The only turnoff was all the little extras that I figured would be in some way helpful. For instance, the LCD screen; you can't read it while you are brushing and the only worthwhile information presented is the time you've brushed for. Most electric toothbrushes will let you know when you reach 30 second intervals anyway, so I don't really see the point. The different brush modes are nice, but not necessary (and I wonder if they actually do anything more than the standard "clean" mode). All in all, the purchase was well worth it and highly recommended. For anyone on the fence, save some money and buy a cheaper model with less extras.
