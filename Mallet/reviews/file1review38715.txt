review/text: I bought this product from a store and I thought it smelled really good, it was much more spicy than any other fragrance that I have ever had. Everybody in my family liked it really well except the 2 people that opinions mattered the most. These 2 women are the ones I trust to pick out clothes for me when I go shopping...they know what looks good on me and what does not. One of these ladies is my fiance and the other is my sister.Some people will really like the fragrance but my biggest problem is that it is a little too oily for me. It is not oily right after I put it on but about 2 hours after applying the product, it feels like someone has rubbed vegetable oil all over my face (well not quite that bad, it is just more oily than I like it too be). I don't think I am using too much because I use just enough wipe all over my face and neck.Overall, it is pretty good stuff with a hearty scent.
