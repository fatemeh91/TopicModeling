review/text: I bought this cane for my mother. She would use a standard cane or a walker. Clearly she needed something in between that would help with balance and support without taking up space, like the walker.Now she can walk to the communion rail with dignity. When balance gets off, she leans on this stable cane just enough to steady herself. I used to say, "You get tippy with a cane and I'm worried you will fall." Now, I worry a bit less. She uses it at home in addition to her handy walker for those short walks to the t.v. or phone.When designing this cane, the stride of the user dictates that 2 of the supports extend further out than the others. This allows for walking without stumbling over base legs. When correctly attached, the angle of the handle facilitates use. Unfortunately, it creates a struggle when the right handed user needs to switch it to the left side. These longer legs stick out, the handle is backwards, and it is not as safe for the user.Now, if only I could design a cane like this with a "reverse" switch!
