review/text: I have not used Dip It, and I'm sure it works great, but I used regular powdered dishwasher soap and it worked amazingly well. I have a Farberware 12-cup stainless steel percolator that the inside was all stained after 10 years of use. Could not get the stains out no matter how hard I scrubbed. And the stem, basket, basket lid, and top lid were badly stained as well.I ran it through 2 perk cycles using 2 tablespoons (each time) of dishwash in the basket. The first time I filled it up to the 12 cup line with water and ran it with all the parts in place (stem, basket, basket lid, top lid). When it was done the water was literally black from the stains it had removed, and all the parts were spotless and the inside of the urn was spotless up to the 12 cup water line. The few inches above that were still slightly stained so I ran it a second time with the 2 tablespoons of dishwash, this time filling the pot up completely with water, to the very top of the urn, with all the parts installed. In other words, completely submerge the basket.Note: When you perk it with it completely filled to the top with water, a little bit of water will seep out of the top of the handle. There's a screw that holds the top of the handle on and it comes through the hole where the screw is. So I just placed a wadded up kitchen towel in the handle to catch the drips.When you are done just rinse everything with warm water and dry. You can shine up the outside with Windex.The final result? The inside of the urn was spotless up to the very top, as were the stem, basket, basket lid, and top lid. How clean? Like brand-new-out-of-the-box clean! It was really amazing.Give it a try. You will love the results. And it's a lot cheaper than using Dip It.
