review/text: The good: the trimmer works great!The bad:1) no charging stand.2) it has the short life NiCad batteries instead of the more modern NiMh.3) the recycle law has been met by the letter rather than the spirit of the law. The batteries which will last not much more than 2 years are soldered in. Thus when the batteries go south, you can cut them out but likely most people will not be able to solder in replacements. Thus a product that could last 10 years is likely in the trash at three years.
