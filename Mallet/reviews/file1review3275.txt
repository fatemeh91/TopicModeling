review/text: I have owned this tweezer in the pink color for about two years now. Imagine my surprise when I caught my husband sneaking into my makeup bag a few nights ago to borrow my pink tweezerman tweezers. The nerve! So this week I purchased him his own set in silver.I LOVE that they come in their own protective tube. They stay super sharp, even after a few years of regular use. They are small so if your hands are large or you have problems manipulating small things, you may want the standard size model. That said, my husband seems to like them just fine. Amazon's price is better than that at the beauty store. Prime shipping makes them a deal.
