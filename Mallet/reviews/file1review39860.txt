review/text: I have had one of these for 5 years. I find it handy to reach things from high shelves or behind furniture, etc. It is amazingly nimble in picking up small items and oddly shaped items.I help pick up trash on a stretch of road for my work's "Adopt A Highway" program. After I put my back out for 2 days bending over 200 times in a morning, I got one of these. It worked great the next 3 times we went out. It can pick up tiny scraps or full bottles.I had the same problem others did with the suction cups coming off or breaking. I am going to try to glue the plastic center of the suction cup, but if that doesn't work, I'll just go buy another one. For $10-12 bucks, it's worth it to me to replace it. I won't be without one.
