review/text: I ordered this to help release trigger points on my muscles to relieve fybromyalgia symptoms. It works wonderfully, and there is no place I cannot reach with one knob or another. The two ends of the "S" are different. One is a ball, the other shaped more like an elbow. The two perpendicular pieces are the same way. This tool will allow me to hit any trigger point I want to with as much depth or pressure as I need. Until I am rich enough to afford my own massage therapist, this is the next best thing.
