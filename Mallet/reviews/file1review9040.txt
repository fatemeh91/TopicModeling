review/text: Pros:I quit taking my multivitamin because this covers basically everything it had. I quit taking my probiotic supplements because this covers everything they had, and then some! And, I quit taking my high dose vitamin D supplement, as well as various other supplements, because this covers them too.It definitely gives you energy, both short-term (immediately after swallowing it) and long-term (I don't get as tired). It helps with regular bowel movements and is good for constipation. It doesn't taste as bad as I thought, it's actually more bearable than my protein shakes, and tastes just fine in orange juice.All in all, this will actually save me a lot of money, and I know it's covering way more bases than I was before even with a bunch of my individual supplements. Can't go wrong with that 4 page nutrition ingredient list! :)Cons:Allergies. Speaking of that 4 page ingredient list... I had a slight allergic reaction the first few times I took it. I'm rarely allergic to anything, but it's not that surprising that I did have slight flushing and itchiness considering the amount of unique ingredients in it, many of which I'm sure I've never ingested before. I slightly lowered my dosage and it doesn't do that anymore.Probiotics: The amounts of probiotics listed are "at date of manufacture" which does NOT necessarily mean "at date of ingestion". Refrigerate this product immediately to prevent any further loss of included probiotic cultures.Anticoagulant effects: You need to be aware of the many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients in this product, as well as the one big coagulant. I remember reading one review of a man who got dangerously low blood pressure after taking this. He was taking Warfarin, a blood-thinning medication. I would NOT use this product if you take Warfarin. There are too many anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant ingredients that would enhance Warfarin, and possibly make your blood pressure dangerously low, AND there is 150% DV of Vitamin K in a normal dose, which very seriously conflicts with Warfarin as well as most all blood-thinners. If you aren't taking medication for blood pressure I wouldn't worry about it too much, though.Interactions: Below is a list of ingredients in this product which actually conflict which each other (I entered all ingredients at [...] to get this list). I'm only posting the "significant interactions" because there are just too many that aren't a big deal.13 Significant Interactions Found:Alfalfa (sprout powder 440mg, juice powder 570mg) + Ginger (root powder 20 mg): Significant - Monitor Closely. Alfalfa and Ginger both increase anticoagulation.Alfalfa (sprout powder 440mg, juice powder 570mg) + Ginkgo Biloba (extract 20mg): Significant - Monitor Closely.
