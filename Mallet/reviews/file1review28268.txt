review/text: PROSGreat FlavorMixes very easily (no lumps)CONSNoneI am a big fan of Optimum Nutrition Products. I have used many of their protein products over the years as a form of recovery. This is the best I have had as far as taste and mix-ability is concerned. The product is delicious and mixes very well. For the price, there is no better protein for me. I have used the Platinum before, which is very similar, but slightly sweeter.
