review/text: i highly recommend this to anyone who feels like they need a little help or lift carrying around their belly. It is really super comfortable. I barely know i am wearing it, but it provides enough of a lift to give my whole pelvis/hip area more space to function better. Only consideration, is that the sizing runs big. i was borderline between med and Large as shown in the size chart. I purchased the large and had to return it for the medium, and it is sincerely the only medium garment that i have been able to fit into for most of my pregnancy. So if you aren't sure, pick the smaller size.
