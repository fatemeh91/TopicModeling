review/text: Ever the optimist, I decided to try an electric razor once again. Blades do an excellent job but, being lazy, I just don't like the time it takes to shave that way. And yes, I used it as directed for the 30 days recommended.I am betting that those who say that this Panasonic razor shaves "as close as a blade" are either very young with still-soft hair or those who hate using a blade so much that they are willing to make do with much less.Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad razor as far as electrics go. It feels good in the hand and cuts about as well as any other. But you can get the same shaving performance from cheaper models.The problem is, as with all electrics, the razor just doesn't give a close shave. The "five o'clock shadow" shows up by 2-3 o'clock. If you have a formal afternoon meeting, late date, etc. you'll have to shave one, maybe two, more times before the day is done. Anything longer than a day or two of growth requires several full passes to get the job done. Obviously, a one-pass blade is faster in this situation.Of course, with the Panasonic there are no bleeding cuts due to early morning carelessness. If you just need a fast shave that's good enough if not great, it's faster than using a blade. This Panasonic is also quieter than many other electrics.If you really truly want an electric razor, my recommendation is to look at cheaper models first. Fancy features such as the high speed linear motors and wet/dry capability don't add to the final quality of the shave.
