review/text: I have been using the Ambi Fade Cream for about a month now. I apply it in the morning and again at night before bed.. So far I have not seen any change in the age spots I have on my face.. Maybe if I use it longer but not any changes at this time......I was hoping it would lighten my dark age spots that are on my face. So far have not found any product that has lighten these spots..
