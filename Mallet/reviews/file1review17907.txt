review/text: Personally, I receive no benefit through the use of these strips. I am a deep sleeper, and can breath through my nose without them. However, I do snore, and my girlfriend swears these strips reduce the noise to a much more manageable level. Because they help her sleep, I shell out the cash to buy them. I rate them at 4 stars mostly because given the material costs of each strip, they are ridiculously expensive, but I have not found a generic alternative.
