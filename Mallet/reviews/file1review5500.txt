review/text: This mask worked very well in Professional Rescuer CPR and DOT First Responder training. It's easy to get a very good seal on a patient's face, and it's compatible with most bag-valve mask and O2 systems.The neck strap tends to get in the way. I suppose it's a nice touch, but I wouldn't depend on it to keep a tight seal on a patient's face without hand pressure.
