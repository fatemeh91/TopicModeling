review/text: I have neuropathy in my feet so they constantly feel cold. There are only two negative things I can say about this item. One is that it's heavy when FULL (because the water level is deep, a plus) so I have my son carry it to the sink to drain. The other is that it recommends you not use oils or salts in the water or the jets could get clogged. I do, however, use non-foaming salts and rinse well when I drain it. So far, no problem.It warms nicely and then maintains a very warm temp for 30 minutes. If you want more, simply hit the heat button again. I've seen several people comment about the drain plug breaking off and I can see how that might happen if it's forced too tight. There is a rubber gasket so it doesn't take that much force to tighten it...easy does it.
