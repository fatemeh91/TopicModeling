review/text: I'm on my third set of these tweezers in five months (one yellow, two stainless steel). First, I am so impressed by these tweezers and their ability to pull hair close to the skin - hair so short that I have to be using a 15x magnification mirror to really know they are there. However, there are problems with having tweezers with such fine tips. The first is that the ends are easily damaged and warped. With my first pair (the yellow), one of the tips was damaged and the tips could not grip correctly. I did not throw them or drop them. I think they probably reached me slightly crooked and I didn't notice until the product couldn't grip. After the bad experience, I swore off of Tweezerman because I had only had the yellow tweezers that warped for six weeks. I searched and searched and could not find any tweezers that were as good at plucking fine hairs. I spent a lot of money on products that were junk. All the other tweezers broke the hair and/or left me with ugly red marks. So, I bought another pair of Splintertweeze. The second pair was great. I plucked and plucked and everything came out cleanly until the day they didn't. After two months, the tips were dull and each and every hair that I pulled broke at the skin. I ordered the third pair and they pull wonderfully. So here is the thing, these are fabulous for getting thin and short hairs but they will entail investment. Tweezerman supposedly provides free sharpening and once my third pair becomes dull (I give them four more weeks), I will send the three off as a set. Again, for fine hairs, these tweezers cannot be beat. It is just incredibly annoying to have to keep purchasing new pairs.This product is made in India.
