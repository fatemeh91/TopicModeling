review/text: These batteries are very durable in my experience, and I highly endorse them for any job. This 36 pack is a great bargain if you can get it. Amazon is normally very reliable, but I have had trouble getting this item, as it seems to go out of stock frequently. If it's available, go for it: they are great batteries at a great price!
