review/text: We have a 4-year-old Bosch dishwasher. After a while the dishwasher arms started to get clogged and the dishes were coming out dirty. I had to unclog the arms again and again.Eventually, the dishwasher stopped working completely. The repair guy said that the motor housing had become clogged with food, and we needed a new motor. That cost us a few hundred bucks.Several months later, the problem started again. A different repair guy came this time, and he said that the problem was not calcium buildup inside the unit, not food, and that a dishwasher cleaner would solve the problem.None of the stores seemed to have what I needed, so I searched online and found Dishwasher Magic. One use, and the dishwasher was running like new. Now, I use it once every three months, and the unit comes out sparkling clean. There have been no problems since.
