review/text: I had a much cheaper foot-bath prior to buying this one which worked well, I justdidn't like the water cooling down (it did not heat the water). This is whyI bought this product. This foot-bath keeps the water heated! The only consI have with it is (1) it is very large/bulky than what is necessary and (2)not being able to add foot salts/sea salt to the water.Otherwise, good product!
