review/text: I'd just like to dispell another reviewers comment on carbs. I'm a type one diabetic and i've been thru enough nutritional classes tought by medical professionals to know that not all carbs are the same. Net carbs and net carbs only affect blood glucose levels. If you want to see it for yourself go out and buy a blood glucose monitor, test your blood before eating an atkins bar, eat an atkins bar and test your blood 15-20 minutes after eating the bar. You should notice very little difference in your BG level. The next day try the same experimant with a snickers bar or something loaded with carbs/sugar. Im sure you'll see that not all carbs are equal. ;-)
