review/text: This is my first ever electric shaving system, and i am totally hooked to it. I have been using it for just over a couple of weeks and trust me, this thing is as good as your gillette minus the nicks and cuts and dry skin.Couple of things though. It takes atleast 5 or 6 shaves before the hair, kind of, gets used to the shaver. The first time I shaved, I thought that I'd wasted money on it. Not true, this is the best. Another thing about the noise that it makes when cleaning, and people seem to complain about it. It is not too much, completely bearable. Buy it, you wont regret it.
