review/text: This is the best soap dispensing brush out there-I've tried them all. The others often fall apart or the rubber top is too thin to be able to press it effectively. Just don't put it in the dishwasher. I put the brush part in and it wouldn't stay attached after so I found replacement brushes on here. Oxo products, in general, are far superior. They may be more expensive but not by much and the price on the smaller items (this brush, carrot scraper, etc.) is maybe a dollar more so go wild and spend that extra buck-you won't have to replace the item for years.
