review/text: I bought this toothbrush at the recommendation of my periodontist. I was having a few trouble spots in the hard-to-reach places and because I have had radiation treatments to my lower jaw and neck I have to be especially careful as periodontal surgery is not an option. After two weeks of using this toothbrush twice a day, my trouble spots were gone and my overall periodontal health had improved. Hard to believe that it was just the brush but it did seem to make a difference. I travel regularly for work and the battery holds its charge for at least 10 days and that is with my using it twice a day for 3-4 minutes per brushing. I am very pleased with this product.
