review/text: I usually use Designer Whey Protein but decided to give the vanilla Met-Rx a try. After reading other reviews I was a little worried about the taste but when I opened it the powder smelled good and very vanilla. The morning after an intense heavy weight lifting workout I was so sore I could barely move and lol even had to help myself to some tylenol. That night right before bed I made a 16 ounce shake with two scoops and Vanilla Silk (instead of water or milk or juice) the taste was okay even though it did seem to have that slight similarity to a diet soda lol. The Vanilla Silk worked well and when i got up the next day I was barely even sore anymore. You don't build muscle in the gym, you build it while you sleep :) Another 8 ounce shake in the morning and by the following day I was able to workout again and within 4 days put on 2lbs :) I think I'll start using this for my post workout shake within 20 minutes of finishing my workout and see how much progress it makes. I'd say for anyone who has problems with the taste you could try it with Silk instead and see how you like it.(Edit: After several weeks of using this product for weight training it caused a problem and I would caution anyone who doesn't drink a TON of water and Fiber to avoid it or use it sparingly) Otherwise I'd say if your going to be using this for 3 protein shakes a day morning, post workout and before bed to purchase miralax along with it lol.
