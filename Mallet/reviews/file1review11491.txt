review/text: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I owned the previous model (T-760) and after about a year it became unchargeable. Looks like it's charging, but doesn't actually charge. Figured it was a fluke and bought another one a year ago and wallah! Same problem. However, this time, it doesn't look like it's charging. The light never comes on. I guess for 17 bucks, that's what we should expect.
