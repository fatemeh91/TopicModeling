review/text: This has been my "C" choice for several years. I prefer the chewable - and these flavors - as I take non-chewables for the other "night vitamins". Two a day covers the "C" base for me and gives me a small, tasty treat after all the swallow versions. Consistent, not too hard - not too soft. Love these!
