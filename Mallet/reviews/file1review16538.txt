review/text: I started taking this yesterday and am surprised by how well it works. For the first time in months I was able to sit down and really study. Maybe its placebo, but I don't think so. It's pricey, but worth it if you have a lot of exams to take. Doesn't leave you jittery like no-dose or other products with a lot of caffeine.
