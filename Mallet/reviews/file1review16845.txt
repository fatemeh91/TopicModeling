review/text: Perhaps, I got a neck pillow that was a lemon and the rest are all wonderful - but this isn't about the batteries or the vibrating it's about the fact that the neck opening is not big enough to keep the pillow on my neck. I know my head sprouts directly out of my shoulders, but I can't imagine that it's supposed to be that small. Anyhow, if your neck is not of the slender swan-like variety, this pillow is not for you. It is nice and squishy, though.
