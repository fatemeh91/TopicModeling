review/text: After suffering with the slow healing plantar fasciitis for 9 months, these lynco orthotics eliminated the pain for me instantly.The custom made ($500+) orthotics from a podiatrist made things a little better, but my feet were still in pain at the end of a day of walking in the city. (I walk about 3 to 6 miles daily in New York.)I decided to try these after a quick sizing up at a local shoe store, put them in shoes (tip: I put them on top of the existing insert on a shoe 1/2 size larger than my usual size) .. the pain went away.In talking to the very knowledgeable foot consultant at the walking company he summed it up for me: Custom orthotics are hard/stiff and made to manage plantar fasciitis when standing, these Lynco inserts are made for walking.Note that the walking company has an upgraded version with even more cushioning with a model number L1200 which I prefer even more.Please try these before going the expensive route with a podiatrist.P.S. (Does anyone want to buy about $2500 worth of custom orthotics for 10 cents on the dollar?)
