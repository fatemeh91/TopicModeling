review/text: I try not to use anything if I don't have to. That being said, I have a 2 1/2 year old and when they have a stuffy head and it's draining and they are not getting any sleep because they are coughing, this stuff is excellent!For his age, two drops in each side and I kid you not, about 10/20 minutes later he is not coughing any more and is sound asleep! This allows him to get the much needed rest that is so helpful to getting better faster.I usually use this with a warm air humidifier.In general, I just love all the Little Noses products.
