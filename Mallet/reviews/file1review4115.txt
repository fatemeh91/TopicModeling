review/text: My trainer recommended that I use L-Carnitine to help with my workouts and weight loss. The product does work. I have increased energy and can really push myself on my workouts harder. My only problem with this product is that they advertise it as 500 mg but they don't tell you you need to take 2 pills for that amount. In essence what you have is a 250 mg product so instead of 90 servings you have half that amount. So the cost of this product is not as economical as I first thought.
