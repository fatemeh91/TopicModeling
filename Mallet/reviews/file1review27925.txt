review/text: I tried protein shakes from a few different companies and this is by far the best tasting. None of that typical protein smell/flavor. This taste is mild chocolate with backings of coffee, since I am not a big chocolate fan I like that the chocolate is not very strong. Its a great way to start my day and keep me full for a while.
