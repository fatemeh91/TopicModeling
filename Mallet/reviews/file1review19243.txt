review/text: This stuff just works. When you're miserable with the flu or a cold/allergies, this dayquil really does the job. I'm so glad that I found these in the pill form because the liquid tastes so unbelievably horrible, I couldn't stand it! I'm just glad these gelcaps exist because the stuff really works but I had trouble choking down the liquid. I buy these all the time for my household both colds and allergies and everyone is glad that I do!
