review/text: I've read some reviews questioning if these are genuine Gillette Fusion razors, and I have to admit I am also leary. The packaging looks legitimate, and was sealed. The razors themselves looked cheaply made, and the blades were not very well aligned. Some protrude further from others, and this was definitely noticeable when shaving with them. I've also read reports from anonymous Gillette factory employees hinting that the refill razors are of lower quality than the blades included in the complete razor package. I guess the goal it to impress you with the starter pack with a comfortable shave and blades that last weeks, then make the money off you with the pricey refills of lower quality that require more frequent replacement. I don't know whether this is evidence of that theory, or if these blades are not authentic.Either way, I was not impressed with these blades. The pull the hair out of my face and leave painful irritation and red bumps. Up until this point I have been picking up the $4 Pro Glide razors with 2 blades included. I had no problems getting a comfortable shave with the Pro Glide package, but haven't tried the Pro Glide refills either.My suggestion is to avoid these alltogether, and perhaps try the Pro Glide refills. Or skip all the chance, and continue stocking up on $4 Pro Glide razors when they go on sale here at Amazon every couple months.
