review/text: I was very satisfied with this product. I needed something that was functional as well as durable. I have used the holders they carry at the drug store before. But the holding capacity is smaller and when I carried them in my purse, the pills would end up all over the place. The 4 compartments allow me to put my medicine as well as vitamins in my purse for a complete day. With one glance, I can double check to make sure I took the last dosage. It is well worth the money.
