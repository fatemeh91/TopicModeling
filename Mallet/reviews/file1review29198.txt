review/text: my gums started to bleed after I started to use Pulsonic. So I got this instead. Much cheaper, even with an AA duracell battery included. soft head. cleans well. The battery lasts a long time. wonderful product. don't be fooled by the prices! those more expensive ones are not necessarily better (yes, I've used them).
