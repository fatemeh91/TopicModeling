review/text: I can definitely say this is worth the money. Waterproof is a fantastic feature. My husband enjoys using this on me, and it's not so complicated that I can't use it by myself. It is a little big, thick, so if you have a skinny guy, or skinny toys, this would take some getting used to, but it wasn't a problem for me, I like the size very much. The bunny ears are a little inflexible, but still work great. I wish it was a little longer, as far as insertable length, but as it is, it takes me only a minute or two before..... you know. Great toy if you need the extra girth, and it seems to have held up pretty well so far. It is also very quiet, which is a plus. Very discreet. I like the clear color, if it is lying out, your eye doesn't immediatly jump to the "bright pink vibrator on the bed"! Yummm!Updated March 2010: After enjoying this toy for 2 years, we turned it on the other day and discovered the vibration feature didn't' work anymore. It still rotates, but without the vibration it just feels like a big plastic-y thing spinning circles in there and actually hurt. I will be purchasing another one, as we used it often, and the batteries seemed to hold fairly well. We only had to change them once I believe. Still highly recommended!
