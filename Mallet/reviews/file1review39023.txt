review/text: Cut my hair about 3 times so far, work great every time. I haven't really used all the varying sized guards, as I keep my hair really short. Cuts hair in one pass. I used to use some crappy $10 clippers, thought I was "saving money" but what I was really doing was giving myself a crappy hair cut. It's definately worth the small price difference between the crappy budget clippers. If you like your head, invest in these very decent clippers.
