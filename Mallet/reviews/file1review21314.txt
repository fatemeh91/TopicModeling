review/text: You buy something that works well and want to continue to use it, but there are always new and improved replacements coming on to the market, so, what is one to do? Tired of going to brick and morter stores only to be disappointed I went online to Amazon and found what I had been looking for, purchased it online, and received it as fast as I would have wanted. And what do you know? The product is genuine and actually works as ever I remember. Thanks.
