review/text: My Dr suggested wearing one of these, this specific kind to-that crosses across your chest when I complained in my 22 week appointment that I was have tons of lower back pain that never improved, and by the end of the day my stomach area felt tight and painful. Because of my weight, I have some extra baggage below my belly so I shared his feeling that I needed some extra support.I got this size, and it's wonderful. I wish they came with instructions because the best way I can figure to put it on is to put it over my head then pull it down. I'm not sure how effective this will be as I progress through my pregnancy. And I'm not sure about washing, but I guess I'll just launder the same way I would delicates.The straps have no adjustments, no closures, and are actualy quite confortable. I've worn it under my bra to control the shoulder straps (bra straps holding the cradle's straps in place) so I could wear lower cut shirts and over bra as well for higher collar/neckline shirts and both work fine.Mort importantly my back doesn't hurt and my stomach feels so much better. I noticed that I'm generally holding myself in a more relaxed muscular state too so I'm sure that I was mentally compensating for the need for some support and that this will be much better for myself and my baby.
