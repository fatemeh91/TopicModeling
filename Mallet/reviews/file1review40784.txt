review/text: I thought this was a dream come true and initially I was convinced. After the first cartridge ran out though I experienced an overwhelming amount of problems:1) The soap part around the razor will totally come off ruining its initial purpose and making you need shaving cream. Expect this to happen if you use it in the shower after only a few uses. Oh and you CAN'T use this outside of the shower because it leaves a filthy grime all over your legs.2) It doesn't give a close shave because the soap part sits above the razors. Also this is a 2 blade not 3 blade razor so expect to go over the same area a few time if you want a good shave.3) The head bobbles back and forth creating an exorbitant amount of nicks, scratches and razor burn. AND the cartridge will fall off numerous amounts of times unless you duct tape it.Again my first cartridge didn't have problems 1 or 3 so I thought it would be a good back up razor if I was in a rush. But after experiencing ALL these problems with 4 other cartridges I gave up. Save your money and time trying to make this product work.
