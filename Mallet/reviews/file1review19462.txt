review/text: I ordered this potty seat for my 22 month old daughter because she was using the baby bjorn potty chair for a while but refused to use a public bathroom. I had got one of the little character seats from wal-mart figuring it was the same thing but no go, it never seemed to fit on toilets right and wobbled scaring my daughter. I finally broke down and spent the extra money on this seat and it was worth every penny. I just put the entire seat in my bag and she has never refused to use a bathroom since. We have used it in more public bathrooms then i can count and since it is adjustable I have never had a problem getting it to fit on a toilet seat. This seat took away all my stress of taking our daughter out for long trips and made toilet training a breeze. I ordered the matching pink step stool and she loves using the set at home too.
