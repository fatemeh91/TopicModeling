review/text: This is my first electrical shaver so i might be bias as there is nothing i can compare it with.I got this device last week but get to test it just now! It looks good, the construction is solid, and it is really waterproof. After i unwrapped it, i immediately turned it on, to my surprise it worked, i started shaving, in a few seconds the device turned off, i thought that something was wrong but after plugging it into the currency it turned on! At first i thought that it is as good as wet shaving when i realized that it is not giving me smooth and deep shave. The problem became bigger when i got to my neck, as my chicks and goat part was ok. I could not shave my neck completely, the shaver left a lot of hair there. I even managed to cut myself little bit, previously because of the lack of experience with the electrical shavers i thought that you can not get cuts with electrical shavers. At the end i had to finish shaving with my wet shaver.I gave 4 stars as i can not compare this devise with other ones as i have never used one and i like the trimmer part which you do not get with your wet shavers. The price is quite affordable, and you are getting 3-in-one package.I still can not decide whether to keep it or not!Your skin gets irritated, you can get cuts, and the time you spend is comparable with the wet shaving!
