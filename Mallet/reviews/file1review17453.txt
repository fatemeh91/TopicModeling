review/text: I bought this trimmer in November as my beard was getting fairly long and I wanted it to get trimmed. I put it on the longest hair setting (9) and it starts taking off large swathes of hair. What gives, Remington? Playing around with the settings didn't help, it just got progressively shorter. But I wanted to keep my beard, not look like I had five o'clock shadow! So disappointed in this product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
