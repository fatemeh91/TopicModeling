review/text: This detergent is gentle on the environment, but tough on stains. I've been pleasantly surprised and impressed with its cleaning power and how the it leaves the relaxing scent of lavendar on my clothes. I see no reason to ever buy another detergent other than Seventh Generation. My detergent arrived unopened. None were leaking. It was very convenient to have it delivered right to my doorstep.
