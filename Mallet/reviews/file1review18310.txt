review/text: I ordered this and it was shipped to my house in about a week. It came pre-filled and with VERY detailed refill instructions as a supplement to the manufacturer's instructions. They do recommend (the vendor, not the manufacturer) that you use premium triple refined butane to extend the life of the lighter, and it does have a huge flame! I can't say how its durability is, as I have just received it. Initially however, I am very pleased and impressed with it's performance as well as the speedy delivery. Now excuse me while I go have a cigar!
