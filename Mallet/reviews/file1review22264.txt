review/text: The last order of "assorted flavor" pops I received (2 bags!) were actually two bags of all cinnamon pops, that had been re-barcoded with an assorted sticker over the correct 'cinnamon' sticker. At $30 a bag, it'd be nice to get what you order. It was a gift tho, so I didn't go to the trouble of returning. I'd have been less bummed if it was a favorite flavor!Love the product & have been using them on and off for several years. Best flavors IMHO, Pink Lemonade, Pina Colada, Mountain Berry... nummy. They do speed up your metabolism (and that sometimes includes... let me be delicate... your intestines). They do help as a snack replacement & as long as you just suck them, they last forever, so they push you through the craving fit and leave you feeling satisfied.
