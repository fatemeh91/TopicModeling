review/text: [Good]I was really worried about this smelling like urine as a highly rated reviewer described, but it smells fine. On a side note, I didn't think it smelled like oranges either, nor did it smell like tang. It just smelled like dish washer detergent.You know exactly how many dishwasher cleanings you have left with these tablets unlike a liquid cleaner or box of powdered cleaner where you have to guess as the bottle or box gets lighter and lighter.Strong cleaner: On my dishwasher, it does a great job at getting rid of food particles. I typically do not scrub most dishes before I place them into the dishwasher. Of course there are times after a dish wash session where I've found that I needed to pre-scrub, but these occasions are few. I believe your mileage will vary depending on your dishwasher model. Our dishwasher is a mid-range Kitchen Aid model.Individually wrapped unlike another product from finish, making it impossible to break tablets that you're not going to use. Some finish products have water soluble wrapping the powder tablets. On many occasions I have broken this wrapping. When you think about it, your hands are going to be wet after loading a dishwasher so it's most likely a common problem except for people who remember to put the water soluble tablet inside the dishwasher before doing anything else. This particular product doesn't have this problem.[Bad]Individually wrapped unlike another product from finish, making annoying to open at times when your hands are wet from loading the dishwasher. The wrapping is slipper and they didn't make it easy enough to open with wet fingers.Strong cleaner: some of our stainless steel cookware look worn out after a wash. It may also be due to the quality of the cookware. Not all of our cookware is of good quality, though even the better quality cookware's instruction manuals have warnings about washing them with harsh powdered dishwasher detergents.
