review/text: I'm really glad this product exists. It's a very effective blend of several potent natural anti-fungals. The tea tree oil in the capsules shouldn't be harmful; it's not enough to be dangerous to you, but it is effective in fighting against the fungus growing inside you.This product was extremely helpful in resolving my candida problem. (It's so potent that the health food store manager always says that people should only take about 1 or 2 capsules per day, then slowly increase it from there to avoid killing the yeast/candida too quickly. He says that most people may not even need to take all 6 caps a day.) I was able to reverse my candida overgrowth in a short period of time (a little over 2 months, with anti-candida diet + anti-fungal supplements + good-quality probiotics).Don't be afraid of trying it due to the tea tree oil (unless you're allergic to something in it). The likely reason you could feel bad after taking these is if you experience temporary die-off symptoms (they can last from 1 to 7 days, usually 2 to 3 days into the treatment if you're also following the candida diet), and that's a sign that you're killing the candida/yeast/fungus! Hope this helps!
