review/text: It's embarrassing to say that I had hemorrhoids, and I've tried every methods to ease the pain. I was at the point that when I sneeze, I felt the pain. I tried hot water bath, and constant cleaning after using restroom, they worked but not fast enough. After reading the reviews and comments, I decided to give it a try. It worked like a miracle. I got the value pack which comes in 3 tubes, I'm going to give my dad one tube for him to try it out.At first, the smell is a bit strong (not odor though) but after getting use to it it actually smells quite good. After applying it before bed and before going to work, the situation got so much better in 3 days. I'm not kidding, in 3 days. If you have mild to severe hemorrhoids and did not have the time to go to the doctors, you can try this. I definitely recommend this.
