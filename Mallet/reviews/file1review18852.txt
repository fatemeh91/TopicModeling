review/text: I've been drinking this brand of Oolong tea for a full month and have lost 8 pounds, despite going on vacation to Mexico for a week. The tea definitely reduces my appetite. I drink 2 cups a day, brewed from one teabag, and the effects last all day. I am an oolong believer! Tastes like a less strong Chinese restaurant tea, I like it plain, hot or as iced tea. My brother-in-law lost 35 pounds drinking it, I'm very pleased that it also seems to be working for me. Have switched from coffee!
