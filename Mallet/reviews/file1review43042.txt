review/text: My Doctor suggested I get this cradle for my third pregnancy. I have a small frame and had pre-term labor with my last pregnancy. When I started contracting early with my third pregnancy my Doctor suggested I try this to help support my uterus. I love it! After having it on for only 5 minutes (I was still adjusting the shoulder straps) I could already feel relief in my pelvis, specifically my SI joints and lower abs. This is the first time in weeks my belly hasn't felt like a 40 pound weight just hanging out.My only complaint, which honestly goes with pretty much any garment, is that I have a short torso (hence all my problems) and the straps are made for someone a little bit more in proportion or larger in general. It took a while to get the should straps adjusted right and that is pretty much all the way. Its also summer now and while it is cool wearing, the shoulder straps do show under a tank top. I just wear a white tank under though and they are barely noticeable. I think I would rather have straps showing than be uncomfortable.I haven't tried one of the belly only supports and that may work for my body type too seeing as the straps don't seem to do muchI am about 5'6" and carrying all belly out in front, and I am able to adjust the belly support all the way in (there are 3 setting) right now at 28 weeks. It's only one baby so if you are carrying more, you may need to get the next size up so that the belly support will fit all the way through your pregnancy. I'd say the fitting guide at their web site is dead on for pre-pregnancy weight and size. If your Doctor or midwife has recommended this, I highly recommend the purchase. Its worth it!
