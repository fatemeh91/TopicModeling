review/text: The scent is mild and agreeable, which is very rare for a pre-electric lotion. Many others use tea tree oil and worse. Why??The problem with this lotion is that it does *not* lubricate in any way at all. In fact, I get the impression that after using this lotion, the razor sticks more than without using anything!
