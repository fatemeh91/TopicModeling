review/text: Glade aerosol cans are very easy to spray (unlike Air Wick). Very little pressure is needed to depress the spray button.I prefer the Clean Linen scent. It's less "sweet". It actually smells like clean linen. It removes odors rather than covers them up. The best spray Glade makes is the odor eliminator spray for smokers. It comes in a brownish can. It removes every trace of cigarette and cigar smoke in a room. It does the same for any nasty odor you may encounter, but the scent is almost impossible to find. Maybe they don't make it anymore? The Fresh Linen is the next best thing.There is a big difference between regular spray and odor eliminator spray. Regular sprays just cover the odor. Odor eliminators remove the odors.What's up with the high prices on Amazon though? I buy these cans for $1 in any dollar store and Walmart.
