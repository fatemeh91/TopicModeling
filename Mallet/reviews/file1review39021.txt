review/text: I'm very pleased with the performance of this clipper. It's large and powerful which is exactly what you want with this type of clipper. The comb accessories make even haircuts inevatible. Again the quality is second to none.I've already given 6 haircuts...so the product has paid for itself twice already.The only problem I'm having is with the thumb adjustment lever on the side. It's very easy to accidentally move it with your thumb when using the clipper. I would have liked to see some sort of loch for this feature. It's not a huge problem and but it's one that you need to keep an eye on.
