review/text: I just received my BBB and I couldn't be more pleased. It is very durable and after discovering only a fraction of the many uses for this product, I am convinced that this is the only tool that would ever let you reach those difficult spots (including those sneaky ones that you feel, yet nobody else can seem to find) without having a masseuse. Also, there are so many resources online to research trigger-point therapy and reflexology. It's great to have such a simple pleasurable product that also sparked the curiosity in me to learn something I wouldn't otherwise know about.The only con I can think of (which might not even apply) is that where some other massage tools rely on the motion of the tool (like the kneading action of a massage chair, or pulsing of a hand-held massager) This one works much better as a trigger-point tool. Digging deep into a troubling knot and holding for a few seconds, then experiencing the rush of relief as you let go. This is not to say that you can't get some decent kneading going. Last night I spent almost a half hour discovering different spots in my neck, and I could feel the tension slipping away and tingling throughout my entire body.My guess is if you think you might want the Body Back Buddy, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT!!!
