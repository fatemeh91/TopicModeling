review/text: I take this along withCosamin DS Joint Health Supplement, Capsules, 210-Count BottleandSource Naturals Hyaluronic Joint Complex, 120 Tabletsevery day. There is no question in my mind that it has helped with my joints. I just added this to the mix after taking the CosaminDS and MSM for years. My joints are not sore in the morning. I have a torn miniscus that is getting better, or at least less pain. I like it. Bog pills though. Be ready. I dont have an issue with big pills, but if you do these are big.
