review/text: I loved the Peanut Butter Crunch so much that I assumed these would be just as good. No. These were too chewy, bland and not a great flavor. The box is so big I'm worried we won't eat them. They have that "protein bar taste" and I'm now wishing I'd bought one locally before an entire case. We go through a lot of power-type bars so if they're good we gobble them up for snacks, school-time pick-me-ups, workout re-energizers, etc. I'll stick with the PB Crunch..those are delicious. These...not so much. :(
