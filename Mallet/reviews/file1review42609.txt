review/text: Tastes especially good with soy milk, and water it is better than average compared to others. The best thing is that I experienced was no bloating, gas, or burping after taking it. This was not the case with the Optimum Nutrition brand I tried previously. I've been taking it twice a day for 3 weeks and feel like it's beneficial, good tasting, and easy to assimilate with no unpleasant after-effects.
