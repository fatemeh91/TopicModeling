review/text: Using this brush made my teeth very sensitive. I figure it erodes the enamel. As you know tooth enamel once lost does not rebuild. I stopped using the toothbrush around a year back, but my teeth are still sensitive. I regret ever buying this brush. In fact I am not going to buy a electric toothbrush ever. Manual brushes are the best.
