review/text: My son just turned 2. He is 36 pounds and 35 inches tall. I wanted to get a stand alone potty that could be used anywhere in the house, but I couldn't find any seats that he fit on...by far. If you have a large toddler beware that many of the stand alone potties are tiny!I had no choice but to look for an insert for the regualr adult toilet. The character soft seats were cute, but just one look at them in person and you can tell that the pee would go everywhere but in the toilet. I didn't want to spend the extra money but the Baby Bjorn is very well constructed, especially for boys. The splash guard is built in and tall enough so no pee can escape. When my son used it the pee did hit the guard but then went down into the toilet. A quick rinse and wipe and it was all clean. Other inserts have a clip on splash guard that would be much messier to clean up. It also has a nice handle that is easy to hang on a hook next to the toilet.
