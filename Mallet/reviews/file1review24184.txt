review/text: I really like this product for over 40 acne and wrinkles. If you live in a dry area, you'll need to limit your usage. I took it with me to Arizona for a week and my skin became very dried out using it every day, but in a more humid climate I use it daily. It is expensive, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.
