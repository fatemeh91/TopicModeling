review/text: Love this essential oil! It's delish smelling and helps to settle my kiddos into their bath. We use it solely at bath time and it is very calming and has them coming out of the tub smelling glorious! Highly recommend it for bath time for kids. We use about 5 to 8 drops in a tub of water. It's calming and helps them sleep.
