review/text: I have suffered with chronic Plantar fasciitis for the past year. I was unable to find relief as I work as a Full-time waitress in a very busy restaurant, so my foot wouldn't heal. My doctor had recommended steroid shots in the arch of my foot, but I am a sissy when it comes to shots - especially in the arch of my foot. I Heard of the night splints, checked Amazon, and found this night splint - while hesitant to make the purchase, I took the risk and am glad I did. The very first night, I noticed remarkable relief form the pain. With each day, my foot pain diminishes more and more. I can tell my foot is healing and have purchased another splint - with the healing of my left foot came the realization that my right foot is also afflicted. This night splint is affordable, comfortable and effective - a real good buy!
