review/text: This product would be the answer to our wishes if only the suction cups didn't dry out and fall off after a few months!I wouldn't buy another Gopher if they were 50 cents each! It is disappointing to find such a well designed tool, only to have this most important part fail to hold up! Perhaps the rubber is not of good quality or the screws are not the best way to fasten to the prongs...to keep gluing cups back on is not an option for older people.
