review/text: Weight loss supplements only work if you have a decent to great diet on key. With that being said Animal cuts is by far the best cutting supplement i have taken. The caffeine is not so much that I am jittery all day but enough that i don't need coffee in the mornings.Pros:It works noticeable difference with than withoutMuscle looks harder and feels tighterNot to jitteryCons:Alot of pillsDo not take on empty stomach ( you will most likely feel sick)Water intake daily must be no less than a 3/4 of a gallon or you will feel sick and dehydratedFinal Thoughts:Product is hands down one of the best, Take 6-7 hour apart and consume as much water as you can over a gallon is recommended. Do not take on empty stomach or risk puking. Body temp seems to be slightly elevated which makes me believe my liver is processing so i would not consume alcohol while taking it. Watch for drug interactions especially with any &#34;uppers&#34; like ADD medication. Strong enough to replace my morning coffee
