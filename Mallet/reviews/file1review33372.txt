review/text: These blades give a really close, smooth shave. If you're new to shaving with a double edge razor it may take a little time to hone your technique, but stick with it. Shaving will become something that feels like an indulgence, not a chore. After six months with Merkur razors I tried Feather brand razors, but found them too sharp. Where Merkur leaves my skin smooth and nick-free, even with the lightest of touches, Feather left my face bleeding from razor burn. Maybe that's just me. I know Feather razors have lots of fans. But - for me - Merkur is the best.)
