review/text: WHY can I NOT find this in the stores anymore? After searching more than 2 months at many discount, pharmacy, variety stores; I finally found Hummingbirds again on Amazon. My hygeneist always comments on my excellent oral health--and that is partly due to Hummingbird. The little bit of vibration helps the floss slip between close contacts. The handle lets me floss with one hand and not get my fingers all sloppy in the process. Perhaps, if enough people start buying this marvelous little devise, we can get Oral-B to produce and put them in regular stores again. BUy a few.
