review/text: ever since I know and use this product I am winning more and more people over to use it, too...says enough? Well, fact is that for any muscle or joint pains (pulled, strained or similar) I apply it 3 times a day ..10-15 minutes after applying it, the pain is dramatically reduced if not gone ...yes, the pain will usually come back throughout the day - though much less pronounced - as Arnica gel is mainly a pain reliever but applying it for 3-5 days it is gone for good (seems to me that Arnica GEL helps healing quicker) - until I pull a muscle again ( being very active with young kids and at the gym ) .. NOTE that I am reviewing the Arnica GEL here..I had tried BOIRON Arnica CREAM, too but that didn't have the same good effects ( Gel is better and faster absorbed )
