review/text: Title and image say "More Milk Plus"; this is "More Milk". Difference is that MMP has fenugreek in it and this doesn't. I found out the issue when I received it; fortunately it works out for me as my baby may be allergic to fenugreek (we're still tracking the source of the reaction down.) Not sure how it works yet, but I'm a bit miffed at getting something that wasn't what I thought I ordered.Doesn't taste particularly nice, but tinctures generally don't; just squirt it down the back of your tongue or add it to 1-2oz of water or juice and it helps.
