review/text: I developed varicose veins in my second pregnancy and was able to control them quite well in my legs with compression stockings. When I started to get these veins further "north" I didn't know what to do. Going to the bathroom, taking a shower, even standing could be almost unbearable. That is why I was willing to shell out the big bucks for this product. I could not wait for it to arrive in the mail and relieve my discomfort.Unfortunately, when it did arrive I was very disappointed. It was easy enough to put on but all I felt was more discomfort. It did not relieve the pressure at all and the velcro was so stiff that I felt like I couldn't walk comfortably. There are two velcro straps that also cut right across the butt cheeks which not only pressed on one of my veins but the sharp velcro dug in and was painful. Since the whole thing is basically just a bunch of velcro is also makes noise when you move. I have also had problems with my hips and SI joint but this thing was too uncomfortable to wear to find out if the hip brace works or not.I thought I would do anything to get rid of the discomfort of my varicose veins but it turns out the one thing I will not do is wear this terrible contraption. I returned it. I don't know if there are other products that work better but this thing is likely not going to be comfortable for any pregnant woman... and frankly I just don't think it really works.
