review/text: I've used several bottles of this and I think it works just fine. Usually, I go through a bottle between Thanksgiving and New Year's to keep all that holiday goodness moving on down the line, so to speak. I've only gone through the recommended "cleanse" once or twice but and it seems to work pretty good there as well. My only complaint would be the large number of pills you have to take for an effective dose (I'm up to 6-8!) and it never has worked on deflating the pooch around my gut. I can feel clean inside, but there still is a sensation of bloatedness at the same time. Weird. In any event, I will definitely use it again and would recommend it to others. As far as the comments on it just giving you the runs...READ THE LABEL! It says right on there that your stool will be loose and explains why.
