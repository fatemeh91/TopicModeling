review/text: I feel a lot better after adding this to my routine. I got this stuff in October and don't drink it everyday but have yet to get sick this season and I typically have a terrible immune system...I mix it with 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and half a scoop of metrx protein powder along with another half a cup of water. The protein powder and greens mix well and taste delicious!
