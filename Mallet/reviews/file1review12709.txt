review/text: I love this echinacea product, it is a great way to get your kids to take echinacea because it is orange flavored so you can just skip it into their orange juice. My kids will take it just in their mouth as well that's how good it tastes. It's sweet almost syrupy I'm so happy I found this product it is a little expensive but for its benefits I think it's money well spent.
