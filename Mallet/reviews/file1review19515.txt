review/text: Just getting close to the potty training time...I have two bathrooms, with a round and elongated seat, both slow close and slightly inward angled seats. This Baby Bjorn seat would not fit either of my slow close seats. However, it might still come in handy for travel. Seemed to be good quality and build, just would not secure down correctly due to the the angle of the seat. Guess I will hold on to mine just in case-for travel. In the mean time, I am going to try the Bemis 583SLOW Next Step Potty Built in seat.
