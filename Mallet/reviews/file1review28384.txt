review/text: This protein is the best I have ever tried. It mixes well with water and a few shakes. The Double Rich Chocolate has a great taste (and I hate chocolate). I've seen some impressive gains using this. I'm sure there might be other proteins that are great but my search is over as I have founds my favorite.
