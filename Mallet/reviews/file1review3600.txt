review/text: This lube is very slippery which is awesome in most cases, however it does make it a little unweildy at times. Just a wash with soap water cleans it right up.Also, this lube is better than others because it's not sticky. When it dries up it just goes away. I actually heard that some people use it as a moisturizer because it helps to trap water in your skin.
