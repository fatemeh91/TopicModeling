review/text: In addition to the weak design that makes this unit more noisey than it should be in terms of caring for babies, and in addition to the weak design that causes water to collect inside the unit, ours' has heated to the point that the plastic on the lid has warped and the unit will no longer close - after only one week of use. I am calling the company and demanding that they take it back and refund my money.
