review/text: Good product from Optimum, but caused a little too much bloating in me. First of all, I don't think double rich chocolate is the best flavor when mixing with water. But when taken with milk, the flavor was a lot better, even enjoyable.I have now switched to Cookies and Cream. And though I've heard many complain that it's much too sweet, it tends to agree more with my stomach. The flavor is great, even when taken with water and bloating for me is greatly reduced. I don't know why this is the case. But I think it might have to do with the differences in flavoring ingredients.My recommendation is don't do what I did. 10lbs is too much to commit to without really knowing how this product will play with your body. Buy the smaller container and try different flavors to find out what works best for you.
