review/text: The only reason I give this item 4 stars is because it is not as easy as it states. However, I am so happy I bought this product. I regret spending over $200 going to an electrolysis for the past few months when this item does the exact same thing the electrolysis does but at a fraction of the price. Yeah you do have to do it yourself but if you are a money conscious person like myself, that will not matter. This was the best $40 I've ever spent but I do suggest to go to a pro first so you'll know what to expect when doing this at home.
