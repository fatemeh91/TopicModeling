review/text: I have tried many supplements over the years, and now that I'm a bit more educated about how the body assimilates vitamins, I no longer take vitamins per-se because I believe them to be worthless and a waste of money, possibly even harmful.Green Vibrance has an all natural easily absorbed full spectrum of vitamins and minerals that are all in good amounts and proportions. It even has herbs, phytonutrients, and trace minerals.I add green vibrance to my power shake in the morning, and after a several week break from it, I could tell a HUGE difference when I started taking it again. I felt less tired and run down, and my brain seemed to work much better.The taste is not great, a bit grassy, but adding it to a shake with some stevia does the trick. It's also great as a post-workout recharger. It has low carbs, about 5.9 grams, and so there's no sugar glut involved.I found it MUCH cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else, and certainly at least a 30% savings than I would have paid at Wild Oats.If a product claims you go through a 'healing crisis' and so expect to feel terrible or possibly have some kind of rash, irritability, nausea, headaches etc... BEWARE! Those symptoms can be allergic reactions or heavy metal poisoning.A product should make you FEEL BETTER, or it is not helpful.I have experienced no problems with Green Vibrance, and would recommend it wholeheartedly.
