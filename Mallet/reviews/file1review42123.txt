review/text: I bought this thinking I would get an easy close shave. That's not the case.Pros:-Nice Design.-Nice Idea.-No redness or unsightly red bumps after use.Cons:-The charger is poorly designed-The battery life indicator is never accurate. It'll go from orange to red in 2 seconds after charging to full, but run on the red setting for a long time.-Too much work and a learning curve to actually shave.-Only gives you a close shave half of the time.-Pop-up bikini trimmer doesn't work.So in short save your money and buy a better electric shaver.
