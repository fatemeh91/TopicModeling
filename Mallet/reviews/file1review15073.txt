review/text: [...]After having had one cataract removed, and that was over four years ago, I attribute the lack of a secondary "residual" growth of the cataract, and the absence of anything in the other eye, to a combination of daily use of the N acetyl Carnosine eyedrops with other supplements and good diet. The Life Extension Brite Eyes III product seems to be consistent, well dated, and the bottle is now well enough designed (follow the instructions carefully) so that the drops are dispensed accurately. Interesting that the idiotic FDA regs force the manufacturers to label the most important ingredient as among the "inactive" ingredients!
