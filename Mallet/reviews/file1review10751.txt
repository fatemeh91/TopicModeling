review/text: I have been using the 7 Day 4 Compartment Pill organizer for a year now. I love it. It is easy for traveling. I fill it once a week and then put one day at a time in my purse. The one inch deep compartment is perfect for those horse pills I have to take. VERY CONVENIENT!! No compalints, exactly what I wanted for a pill organizer. I will buy more of these.
