review/text: I bought this to help with the dark circles under my eyes. I know, vain, but my brother's wedding is coming up and I haven't been sleeping well for a while. I've been putting the mask in my freezer every morning and pulling it out at bed time. I do my bed time routine and by the time I'm ready for bed it feels great on my eyes. I've put it on right out of the freezer and it's a little intense. It helped with the puffiness and dark circles for sure. I have allergies so in the summer this is going to be a HUGE relief for my swollen and sore eyes.
