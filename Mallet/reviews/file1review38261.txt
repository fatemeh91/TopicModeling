review/text: I have a problem with rough heels and have looked for a product that really does the job. The Dr. Scholl's pedicure cream does that job. The peach scent is wonderful and a plus to the product. The grainy texture takes some getting used to, but it's a plus to the product and helps achieve results. The product is easy to use and very effective. I'll probably purchase this product in the future.
