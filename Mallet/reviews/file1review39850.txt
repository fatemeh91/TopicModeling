review/text: I have two reachers - the Gopher which folds and another off-brand which doesn't fold. Neither one has an especially firm enough grip so it's a struggle to pick up very small or slightly heavier objects with either one. But, I use the off-brand 10 times more than the Gopher. The off-brand hooks slimly over a door frame casing or over a cupboard, etc., so it's always handy in the open where I can quickly reach it. The Gopher when folded is not easy to find a place for it and sits inside a top cupboard, therefore hardly getting used. It's not that it is an inferior product, it's just not slim enough to keep out in easy reach and it takes extra time to unfold and click the joint just right before its ready to use and then unclick it to fold up and store again after use.
