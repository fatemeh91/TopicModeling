review/text: I bought this based on previous reviews when I was searching easy to clean and remove bed protection. It did do a good job of protecting the bed from wetness during our child's bedwetting phase when positioned correctly, but it was annoying in that it did stay put very well and needed frequent repositioning, whether used over or below the fitted sheet. When below the fitted sheet, it would bunch up and ripple and the edges were very noticeable because it is somewhat stiff. Fortunately, my daughter did not seem to mind. Washing and drying was much easier than a full fitted waterproof mattress pad so it served its purpose for us.
