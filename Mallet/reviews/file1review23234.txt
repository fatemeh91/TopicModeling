review/text: I bought this to use in my cubicle so I didn't have to be annoying and use an electric vacuum. The rug is very flat and not shaggy at all, & I think I'd be better off with a broom and dustpan to pick up anything on it than this sweeper. You have to really push the thing and go over things many times in order for anything to get picked up - even something as simple as a bit of paper from a spiral-bound notebook's torn edge. Also, the design placing the roller brush in the very center of the head is unfortunate and makes it so that you can't get it to do anything near walls/edges unless you can move the sweeper with its sides up against them (I would expect the roller to be in the frontal part, not the center).Anyway - doesn't work for me. I'll probably toss it.
