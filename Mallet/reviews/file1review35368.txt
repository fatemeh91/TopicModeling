review/text: I gave it four stars instead of five because I'm sure that it could be improved somewhat--but I don't know how. I tried it out and thought it was great. My husband, the one who is 100% disabled, was confused at first by it. I think he'll get the 'hang' of it (no pun intended!) eventually, and I love the idea of it. For what I have seen out there, this is probably the best and easiest to use.
