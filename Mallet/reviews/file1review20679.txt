review/text: Pretty simple.I ordered parts for my razor. They came, I installed them.WHy didn't you ask for a review when I bought a book, through you,from an associated seller and never received it? I asked about it and you emailed me telling me it wasn't your problem, because someone else was selling the book. Never got the book or my money back.Bob Bisaillon
