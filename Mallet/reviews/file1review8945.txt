review/text: I bought this for my husband and he says he has lots more energy. The taste is a little hard to take but orange juice helps. If it was not for the taste, I would give it 5 stars. I am on chemo, and with so many things interfering with chemo, my doctor asked me not to take anything until after my treatments. As soon as they are over in July, I will be using this product also.
