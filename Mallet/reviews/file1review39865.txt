review/text: I had back surgery recently and I felt this was a must. For the next 6 months I can not bend or twist so the JUNKPHER was going to be my helper. In 8 weeks I have gone through 3 of them for $20 a pop. The plastic is cheap and breaks easily! The screws come out of the suction cup on the ends, have they not heard of lock tight. Either way if you have a choice DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!
