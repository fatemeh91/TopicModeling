review/text: I purchased these diapers based on the previous reviews; I only bought two just in case I didn't like them. They have ended up being wonderful diapers! I love the extra soaker pad that snaps into them, and they hold for quite a while before needing to be changed. I have not had an issue with either of the diapers leaking.The reason I only gave four stars is because the velcro wont stay down when put in the washer and dryer. I have also had an issue with the entire velcro pad staying down when my son wears one of the diapers. I am sure over time it will be used less because of this issue, but they are still great. It could also just be an issue with the diaper I received, because it is only one of them that has the problem.
