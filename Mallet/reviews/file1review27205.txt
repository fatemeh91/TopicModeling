review/text: Well, i have previously rated this protein in a different, worse flavor and gave it 5 stars, but after having tried the BSN Syntha-6 products, the most i can give it is 4/5, but that is in the flavor department. I can not put them at the sasme level. That would be unfair to Syntha-6 and anyone reading reviews to try to make a decision on a purchase.In terms of quality of the protein I think everybody knows this is a very high quality product. If you are training and are not supplementing with protein you are probably not at your 100% because the requirements of protein for a good balanced diet are way above the FDA suggested ranges. This product is very good for people trying to lose weight because it gives you a lot of protein and practically none carbs and fats. Mixed with one cup of skim milk tthe shake has barely 200 calories giving you a total of about 30grams of protein (24g the protein powder and 6-8 the milk).As i said, this is a very tasteful produt, but if you are trying to get something to make the protein comsumption delightful you need to look to Syntha6. You will have to pay a much higher price per dose though. That is why this product must be consider excvellent too: it is one of the cheapest protein that you can buy, making it very good bang gfor your buck.
