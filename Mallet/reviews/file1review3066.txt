review/text: I've ordered the 12 pack and the 100, both from chubby dick emporium with no problems. The 12 pack came in a bubble mailer with them Beaty laid out inside and the 100 pack came in a small box with four plastic sleeves full of condoms. I haven't noticed any holes or rips in the individual condom wrappers yet.The condom itself is for average-thin sized guys. Would probably fit any length but it won't fit a thicker guy. They're light pink and we haven't noticed a latex-y smell yet. I would definitely but these again.
