review/text: I love the back buddy. I have shoulder, hip, neck and low back pain issues almost everyday due to laborious job for 10 yrs now. This tool is very handy, I use it a few times a week at minimum. Can be used in the hot tub too. Very affordable for what money I save by not needing to rush to the chiropractor or for massage, helps my body last longer between doc. visits. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
