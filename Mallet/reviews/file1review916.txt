review/text: Although this product did not meet MY needs, it certainly would meet the needs for someone who needs functional joint support in their thumb, wrist, and index finger. It provides just the right amount of compression to make your hand actually FEEL better.Unfortunately for me, I need support for all of my fingers- which is why I didn't purchase this product.The only cons to this product are that it isn't sold in pairs, and the Velcro is so sticky that it was a struggle to get it off.You should try on the product at a store before buying it, so that you can be sure that the size it right. (Not too tight, and not too loose). When wearing it, you should only feel the same amount of compression that you would when sticking your hand into a deep bucket of water.Being a slightly petite teenager, the Small one fit me perfectly.
