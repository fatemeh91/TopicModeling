review/text: 5 stars for quality, but 0 stars for flavor. I decided try this flavor instead of my normal Chocolate Malt. This tastes nothing like Cookies and Cream... tastes just like coffee. The drink also gets very foamy when mixed in my BlenderBottle with water. I like Optimum Nutrition protein, just not this flavor. I'm going back to Malt after I get through these 27 servings.
