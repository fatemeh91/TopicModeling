review/text: It takes a dozen passes of a spot for it to create a uniform length.You can't use it while it's charging.You can't use it with water.The available lengths for it are too far apart - the 0 leaves you with almost no hair, and the 1 leaves you with a week's worth of beard.However, on the bright side, it is fairly cheap (though I assure you, you get what you pay for)
