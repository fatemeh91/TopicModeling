review/text: The triumph toothbrush is very high quality. The triumph cleans all areas of your teeth, i have a very small mouth and the brush heads fit very easily in my mouth without any problems. The triumph is very powerful and will blast all plaque off your teeth after only a couple of uses when using the power floss head. The lcd screen is very nice to have showing how much battery power is left. Very nice travel case also. You will be very pleased with this product, i highly recommend!
