review/text: I've had a Braun Syncro for almost 4 years (as well as a Norelco), and I decided to try the Activator when Amazon offered a $50 credit for buying Braun products over $130.The Activator improves on the Syncro in 3 ways. First, it doesn't irritate my face (the Syncro did). Second, the cleaning base is more compact, easier to operate, and (apparently) more efficient in its use of cleaning cartridges. Third, the travel case is much smaller (it now follows the form of the shaver).I don't see any reason to pay extra for the 8595. Whatever information is on the LCD is unnecessary -- save yourself $30 and get the 8585.The cartridges and replacement blades/screens are still expensive, but the Activator gives me a much closer shave than my Norelco, and it no longer irritates my face like the Syncro did. As far as I can tell, this is the best electric razor on the market. Keep up the research, Braun, and pray that Apple doesn't come out with an iShave!
