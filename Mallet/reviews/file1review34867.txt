review/text: This is a great razor although the color of the handle I received was white not black. So who is watching me shave? I was sick of paying Gillette and Schick for their garbage, so I went back to the trusty straight razor. Be carefull. Learn what you are doing first, get a strop and a styptic pencil, because you will need them. A hone(I own knifes so I have several) is good to have also, but this blade unlike others comes very sharp and is hollow ground. A good straight razor shave can last you two days before you feel stubble, if done right. I have had professional barbers look at this and awe at it. It works great, but be careful and watch out for the jugular, one slip there and times up. Highly Recommended.The Time Keeper
