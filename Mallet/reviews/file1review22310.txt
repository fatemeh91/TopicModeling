review/text: I was skeptical of the reviews that said that this was going to leave streaks on your stainless steel appliances. Not anymore. I think I bought this product because it was a little cheaper than what I normally buy. I buy the magic wipes. The magic wipes don't leave streaks (you have to read that you wipe with the grain of the steel), but these cerama wipes definitely do leave major streaks. I know another reviewer said wipe it with a dry paper towel in the end and I will try this. However I don't want to continually do this, because I would be wasting time trying to make it perfect. My hands also feel gross afterwards. Yeah I know I was going to wash them anyway, but it is the purpose of the review to let people know what you think. Anyway, I won't be buying these again, because I have found the product that I like better. I will be finishing them off, but won't be suggesting this to anyone else.
