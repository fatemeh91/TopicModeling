review/text: Look, I got a couple of these batteries used which came with an xbox 360 controller I bought somewhere.They work much better than the energizer batteries I got, and those I got new.Be sure though to buy the exact kind of battery with this green and black or the newest kind that come with the 15 minute charger.Duracell has worked far far better than energizer. For example, with these used duracell batteries I got, I recharged them and placed them in a portable DV camera. The camera sat there for 3 o 4 months with the batteries inside.When I finally got to use it again, I thought the batteries would give out soon enough before I could record any significant audio or video footage.To my surprise, and it was a surprise as I didn't even remember having them until I open the camera's battery compartment, they recorded a full more than an hour long audio conversation, and several videos. They have not given out yet.The rechargeable Energizer ones, I placed FULLY CHARGED in my rock band drums set, played for a couple of hours a video game, then after three days of the drums sitting there doing nothing, the thing would not even turn on. Faulty equipment? No, faulty batteries which still get going draining themselves long after you've finished using them; oh, let me add draining themselves at a significantly high rate these Energizer things.:)Go with duracell, guys. In my experience, these specific ones or the new kind which come with the 15 minture charger work great!
