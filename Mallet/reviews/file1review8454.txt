review/text: I bought this brush to clean our travel mugs and stainless steel water bottles. It reaches where it needs to reach but there doesn't appear to be enough bristles and the white stick part of the brush is too flimsy for my liking. I would have preferred a hard plastic stick. As it is, the brush bends when you apply the slightest pressure so you can't really scrub well with it. I understand that this is a bottle brush but sometimes you get gunk on the bottom that you want to clean out which would be difficult with this brush because of the way it gives. It works well with my travel mugs that just have coffee in them and are cleaned daily. I might find something else for the water bottles that have a biggest bottom surface area that is harder to reach and clean with this brush. For baby bottles, this would work well.
