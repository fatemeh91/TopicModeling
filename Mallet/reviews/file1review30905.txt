review/text: I was experiencing some symptoms tied to B-12 deficiency so I decided to try this as the price was low enough and it also contained several different sources of B-12. I found the taste fine, a little vitamin-y, not as pleasant as some of the sublinguals out there but not bad and I really liked that is contained B-12 sourced from Methylcobalimin. It's not always easy to find that source in B-12. I will continue to use it in strong doses and then taper off when I see more results, would like to come back and report, but so far so good.
