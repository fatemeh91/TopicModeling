review/text: We bought this when expecting our first child. It is awful in everyway. First, it is poorly built and is made from very cheap materials. The most important point is that it does not work. All that can be heard is feedback from movement of the receiver. It is impossible to hear any heartbeat. Don't waste your money on this device.
