review/text: Some of the people writing reviews on here really do not know what they are talking about... 10mg of tea tree oil (dosage per capsule) will not kill you or put you in a coma. Hell, even 10mg of pure CYANIDE will not kill you. Just because you read somewhere on the Internet that people swallowing tablespoons after tablespoons of tea tree oil experience stomach discomfort (I wonder why) does not mean this supplement is the same thing.When you first get a capsule, open one up and mix it with a teaspoon of water. Rub the mixture on the back of your hand or somewhere else to see if there is an allergic reaction. If after an hour there are no hives, rashes, or swelling at the site, you are most likely not allergic to tea tree oil (note that your stomach lining may still be allergic while your epidermis is not, but this is unlikely).After that, start out SLOWLY. The people who swallow 6 capsules of a new supplement they just bought, and then experience discomfort, are not very bright. Try just one capsule after dinner, a few hours before sleep, at first, and then slowly move the dosage up to a comfortable level.I started with just one capsule a day. I thought nothing was happening, but the die-off symptoms started on the 3rd day, and were manageable - just a runny nose and some throat itching. After 4-5 days of this, making sure I could handle the die-off, I moved up to 2 capsules a day, then 3, then 4, over the span of a month. After a month my candida rash and lethargy were completely gone - I never needed to take 6 capsules a day, I keep taking 4 and everything is fine. Also make sure you take it easy if you are on other medications/supplements or are doing whichever crazy candida diet/cleanse is in fashion at the moment.After a year of persistent candida problems, this supplement cleared me up - but you need to use it with caution and common sense.
