review/text: Would have loved to use this potty seat. Our 2yr old son has been very successful and is completely potty trained, but is still very small compared to the potty. We've had 2 other seats both of foam / foam plastic and they make me nuts that no matter how much or how long I clean them I can't ever get the "SMELL" out from what seeps inside the foam. This seat is a great idea (all easy to clean plastic) no openings, made for a boy, and most importantly not made of any foam. Problem...it DOESN'T FIT! No potty at our house or my parents. We have a new home and standard toilet seats, my parents are quite older, but still standard and of course we can use the gross seats everywhere. Very disappointed.
