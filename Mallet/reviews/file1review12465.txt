review/text: Really has worked wonders. I've been wearing it everynight for about 3 weeks now. I'm finally able to start running again. I was living with the pain everyday and wasn't running for about two months. After wearing it for two weeks, I was able to run the Army 10-miler. Even now after a hard run, I still hobble a bit the morning after - but it's not nearly as bad as it once was. I would buy this in conjunction with the foot rocker. You have stretch out the muscle quite a bit, but this splint helps much more than I ever expected.
