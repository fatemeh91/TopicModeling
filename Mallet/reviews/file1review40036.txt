review/text: For a protein bar, these taste great. Not as good as a real "payday" but much better than a chalky, dry, vitamin tasting run-of-the-mill chocolate protein bar that is on the market. They are low in carbs, but have more fat grams than most bars (due to the peanuts) - which I do not have a problem with, personally.
