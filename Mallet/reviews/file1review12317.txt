review/text: I love this cream. It feels so light but so moisturizing. The scent is so refreshing and soothing. After using this product for just a couple days, my skin had more of a natural glow. A scar I've had since I was 2 is less noticeable. I normally go from one cream to the next, but this one I actually stay with.
