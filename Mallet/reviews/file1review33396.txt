review/text: For the price, there are better blades. They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I'm pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn. However, they do offer a close shave. I feel that there are much better options for the price; Persona (imported and domestic varieties), Derby, Feather, etc. I can use all of these interchangeably. Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone's face is different.
