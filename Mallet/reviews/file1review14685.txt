review/text: I bumped into this stuff by accident while reading about people with low thyroid. I get the "brain fog" that so many experience because of low thyroid. I decided to try it and I got immediate results. Within an hour or so after taking it, I can think very clearly and very focused. I have been taking it nearly every day (just one 10mg tablet) for over a month now with no side effects. I started a new job and this really helps me to focus on what I'm doing and not get sleepy. I did alot of reading about vinpocetine and I'm aware of the pros and cons. However, I am seeing results with no adverse effects. Everyone is different so it may not work for someone else as it does for me. I'm going to continue taking it!
