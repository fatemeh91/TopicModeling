review/text: I am not a huge body builder and I only use this stuff for post-workout, NOT meal replacement! I mix it with milk and it is freaking delicious. With water, it is not the best at all, but it is "swallow-able". I have found good muscle build with this, I go for definition and tone, not mass bulk. This is the second time I bought this product and I am not disappointed with it, it has good flavor.
