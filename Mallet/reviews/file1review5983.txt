review/text: As with all Omron products, this item is well made and easy to use. Its accuracy compares favorably to a lab unit and is well suited for use by those who want to monitor their BP and heart rate while exercising. The requirement to be seated and to hold your arm with the monitor attached to it next to your heart is something of a pain but it does give more accurate results when used as directed. It does however give good results in almost any configuration. Highly recommended.
