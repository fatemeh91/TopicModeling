review/text: I enjoyed taking this product, as I experienced a subtle, but noticeable, improvement in my feeling of well being, although it is not something I can quantify. Significantly, it was also marginally easier to ignore the office candy dish while I was using this product. Thinking it was mostly the greatly touted apple cider vinegar giving me the results, I tried taking only vinegar, but did not have the same breadth of results. My conclusion is that the tonic is a nice addition to my regimen when I can afford it.
