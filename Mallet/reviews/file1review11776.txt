review/text: I'm 9 weeks out from having weightloss surgery "vertical/gastric sleeve". After surgery protein is crucial for not only weightloss but your healing process. Up until this point I've been really bad about drinking the protein because everyone I've gotten tastes so horrible. I've already purchased about 10 different protein powders, just a waste of money. Then this past weekend a friend who had gastric bypass about 4-5 years ago recomended Champion Protein Powder, I figured I'll give it a try. I went on Amazon and purchased the Cocoa Mochaccino flavor after reading good reviews, it arrived in 3 days (fast). This moring I tried it and can't believe now only how delicious it is but how easy it blends with no clumps, and no weird aftertaste. I put a scoop in a mug and added a little water to form a smoothe paste, then I added cold/lukewarm coffee (hot will make it clump)and mixed it up and re heated it in the microwave. It honestly tastes just like a Mocha Latte from the popular coffee shop Star*****. I will have no problem getting my protein in from now on, I'm beyond happy!
