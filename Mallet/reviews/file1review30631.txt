review/text: I started using this Razor in July with a wet shave and loved it. It was my first "real" razor (non-cartridge) and the hype matched the results. The razor provides an irritation free shave and has only caused two minor cuts... to be fair, I caused the cuts by speed shaving. Neither of the cuts were serious, about equivalent to a paper cut.The inspiration for this review was the fact that I have a gillete razor at work for emergency shaving. Well, I had an important meeting earlier and had forgotten to shave this morning so I pulled out my shaving cream/razor and went to shave in the bathroom. It felt like the brand new blade was pulling the hairs, not cutting them. My face is still itching and I regret trading a quick cosmetic improvement for my face's comfort.Give a real razor a shot and you will never go back. I promise.-------Pros1. Short handle but good heft.2. Easy to transport.3. Quality materials and well crafted.Cons1. No included accessories (carrying case, stand, etc.)
