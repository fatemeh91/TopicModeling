review/text: Hey guys,I originally bought a Fusion power when it came out and used it for a week - I decided I didn't like it as much as my M3 Power and put it aside. The blades felt like they were scraping too closely against my skin and I found it to be an overall fairly uncomfortable shaving experience, without getting noticeably closer than the M3 Power.A year or so later, my M3 Power stopped working, so I ran out to the store and picked up some normal Fusion replacement cartridges (not Fusion Power!) instead of buying a new razor altogether. The experience was completely different from what I remembered! The razor just glided over my skin, I never felt like I had to go back over areas, it was incredibly comfortable, and, most importantly, an extremely close shave!Surprised, I wondered what it could be, and realized that it might be the blades making the difference. I picked up some Fusion Power replacements and tried them side by side and it confirmed for me - the Fusion Power blades are markedly worse than the regular Fusion blades.Don't believe me? Give it a shot yourself, I think you'll find that the best combo is to buy a Fusion Power razor and regular Fusion blades.Good luck!
