review/text: I have taken Barefoot Coral Calcium capsules in the past, but for a couple years have not been able to purchase the product in retail stores(ie: GNC). So I decided to try to purchase the capsules on-line. I chose to purchase through Amazon because I felt it would be safer (which it was); but, when I received the product I was very disappointed to see that I did not have capsules at all but "Big yellow "CAPLETS" which are very hard for me to swallow! Since I'm on a fixed income, I figured it would be cheaper for me to just keep the pills rather than try to return the item. The Bob's Best Coral Calcium 2000mg caplets is:"NOT WHAT I ORDERED"!!
