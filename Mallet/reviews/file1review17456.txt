review/text: Honestly, I don't write a lot of reviews unless the product I get is absolutely terrible. Unfortunately, that's why I'm writing this.First impression was good. Seemed like it was exactly what i needed. A wireless reliable beard trimmer. I noticed the battery charge didn't last too long after the first use. Also i didn't like the fact that the teeth without the head attachment were pretty large and not fine like you want out of a trimmer especially when it comes to bare skin trimming. First time i used this trimmer i noticed that immediately so i began to use the cheap Wahl to shape the edges of my beard because it's real fine and smooth on the skin. This is certainly NOT like that and honestly I don't think too much of the Wahl, which is why i bought this trimmer to begin with. But the trimming head is obviously cheap and will cause irritation on bare skin.The beard trimmer died after about 5 months. I bought it around July 25th, 2011. By Christmas 2011 it had completely died. It doesn't charge any longer - the LED indicator light does not light up even when plugged in. If I leave it "charging" it will turn on for about 5 seconds before it dies out.I think the head adjustment piece is fine. I prefer it over the Wahl trimmer heads. Honestly, i wish i just spent the extra money on maybe a 30 dollar trimmer instead. Now i'll end up paying more anyway.** Also i hate the fact that you can't use it when it's plugged in. It doesn't charge. My wahl cost me the same $$ but atleast if that battery is dead i can plug it in and use it at full capacity-- not so with this.
