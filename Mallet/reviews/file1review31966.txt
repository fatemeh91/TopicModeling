review/text: Read the label carefully and consult with your medical doctor.When I took this product I had the worst cystic acne of my life. Turns out that these ingredients: Kamut Grass, Wheat Grass, Barley Grass, Oat Grass, Alfalfa Grass, Spirulina, Chlorella, Oats, Barley, Rye, Millet, Buckwheat, wreaked havoc with my body.So, if you have the slightest sensitivity to certain foods, carefully read the label. It took years of agony to realize that the Perfect food wasn't helping me, it was harming me.
