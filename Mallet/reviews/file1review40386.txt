review/text: Gaia Herbs is a quality product - I used their Black Cohosh around a year and a half ago, just before my daughter's birth (not a use you'll find on the bottle, but my midwife was monitoring it and it worked for me). Because they're quality, you'll pay a pretty penny for it - but their record-keeping and dedication to informing the consumer is extremely admirable, as well as their transparency.My husband took these, instead of me, because they strongly warn against using them while lactating (I think it would probably be fine - the only ingredient I was unfamiliar with was the andrographis, which seems to be commonly used with children - but I didn't want to take a chance). He said it was pretty impossible to tell the efficacy in an individual's use, because he didn't get sick while taking them (though he had felt something coming on before), and couldn't certainly chalk it up to the capsules or not. In that way, they're comparable to our normal assortment of immune boosters - Echinacea syrup, Vitamin C, and Shaklee's Defend and Resist chewables.I loved the "meet your herbs" feature - the website includes information about testing for impurities on your batch of capsules, more information about each component, and the source where each was grown. Following the link to "Gaia Farm" on one herb's info summary, I found their site even profiled their workers (the actual guys doing the hands-on stuff, not guys in lab coats).Overall, it's a great product - here, high price and high quality do go hand in hand.
