review/text: These diapers are terrible! Most of my cloth diapers were hand me downs- they are thick and soft. These Gerber ones are NOT! I bought these at Wal-Mart and when my 9 month old wears them, he has to be changed every 30 minutes. If I don't change him quickly, the diaper can become so soggy that it will literally drip. It's not worth it. Spend your money on thicker diapers.
