review/text: My mom and I just got done laughing until we almost peed our pants. This thing is pathetic. She even laughed and she's the one that bought it for me. We have a wipe warner of the same brand loaded it up with diapers and stuff and it's so sad just droops and everything is about to fall out. We thought maybe we were missing a piece or two but no. We were thinking maybe it was missing cardboard in the walls, nope, all there, just a sad sad little piece of crap organizer. For those that got this thing and actually like it I would LOVE to know what you did to make it work. Me and my mom and husband just laughed loaded it with diapers but I think a $4 clothes hamper would actually do a much better job.
