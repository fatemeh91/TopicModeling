review/text: We bought a cheap toilet seat that didn't quite fit our toilet, but my daughter was using just fine. We decided to splurge for this one once she seemed ready for more serious toilet training. She's 2 and from the first time we put her on this, she said it hurt her legs. The splash guard is wide and digs into her legs and she absolutely refuses to sit on it. Fits the toilet really well, but that's all I can say positive about this potty seat. Disappointed!
