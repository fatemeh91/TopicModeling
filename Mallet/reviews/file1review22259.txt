review/text: I bought the 30 pack off of eBay recently. I was pleasantly surprised by the yummy taste of the various flavors (with exception of "root beer float" flavor.) I got them to help me quit smoking (oral fix.) I am finding out they are effective in losing weight as well. They defiantly curve my appetite. I find they give me a nice subtle increase in energy too, without that "nervous feel". I am telling my friends about this product. Who would have ever thought "one can eat candy AND lose weight"!?
