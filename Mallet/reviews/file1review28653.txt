review/text: I had tried many flavors before. To give you an idea about my taste, for me vanilla was the worst, chocolate was ok, strawberry, banana (or their mixture) was good. However, none of these flavors were good with water and I had to mix with milk even though I am trying to avoid milk. This time I tried white chocolate flavor. It is very good even with water! And when you mix it with milk, it turns to something like a milk shake, super delicios, the only problem (?) being lots of bubbles it makes.Regarding the seller, everything was great and I received it super fast, even though I didn't pay for any shipping (it was standard shipping but got it in 3 days).
