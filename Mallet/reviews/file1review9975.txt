review/text: I was debating between this product and the hand held electronic device, and I chose this because I felt it would be more accurate. I have owned it for 3 weeks now, and I have yet to get a reproducible reading that was accurate. I have watched videos, read the instructions and even called their support number. Generally it tells me I am 1.4% when I should be around 12%. The Myotape is great, but I would have been better off with the hand held devise and the measuring tape.
