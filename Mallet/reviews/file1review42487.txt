review/text: Dymatize claim that they have enzymes that make this product easy to digest for people with lactose intolerance. Unfortunately, I did not find this to be the case. I might as well have drank an entire regular milkshake, that's how sick it made me. If you're lactose intolerant, I would recommend you try NATURE'S BEST, ISOPURE CHOC (LOW CARB) 3LB instead. I've been drinking it every day and it gives me absolutely no stomach issues. Not sure if all of the Isopure products are lactose free, but the low carb chocolate one definitely is.
