review/text: I was tired of using conventional deodorant's which always caused a severe rash. I tried a few organic/natural deodorants in the past and was unhappy with all of them. A friend told me to try this deodorant. I've been using it now for over a year an am very happy. I highly recommend. It does have a strong pine scent though with some people may not like. If you can get past that, then I'm sure you will be happy with it.
