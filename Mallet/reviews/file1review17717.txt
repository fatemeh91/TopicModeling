review/text: I really enjoyed this trimmer while it lasted. I had to keep it plugged in, but it *really* cut through hair fast and efficiently. I'm only not using it now because the click knob to change hair length broke and the guide would no longer move up or down appropriately. One problem with the trimmer is it never was good at giving the 2 day stub look. Before I grew out a full beard I found this lack of a feature bothersome. As your beard get's closer to a size 3.5 this trimmer totally loses effectiveness -- I find the hairs near the chin to be substantially longer than the hairs on the cheek.For $7.00 more I'm going to order the HC-5550 this time around.
