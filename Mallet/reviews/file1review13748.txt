review/text: The herbal scent was seeping from the outer box when it arrived.... The pleasant aroma filled my office in no time. I ordered 4 of these, one for my daughter who has horrid menstral cramps, although it is for your back she places it on her tummy while watching tv and it offers her hours of relief! One for my mother, she's 60 years old and drives a truck for a living, she is in and out of a truck all night long, and the bumping and bouncing around is horrible for her back and shoulders... she heats up the pack and chills out when she gets home and she has not stopped thanking me! One for my boyfriend - he has digenerative disc disease and is in tremendous amounts of pain, he has to switch on and off heat and cold and this pack is amazing.. the aroma helps to ease his tension which almost always causes him more pain.. with this pack he is calm cool and collective... and the final one was for myself... I sit at a desk and pound away at a keyboard all day long... sometimes my back aches so bad I find it hard to walk... I just heat up the pad and drift off into a relaxed state of mind... my head is clear and I can think about what I am doing.. no more stress induced mistakes for me!!!I highly recommend this product for anyone that has any kind of aches or pains....as you can see it's not JUST for the back!!!!
