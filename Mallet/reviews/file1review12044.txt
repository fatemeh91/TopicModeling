review/text: these are one of the top food based vitamins doctors and natural doctors recommend. i chose to take these instead of any other brand because of the price. and i LOVED them! i can take them on empty stomach and be just fine. i had a very terrible morning (better to say "all day") sickness, coudn't keep down any food and even water some times of about 4 months. ii could still take these vitamiins right before i went to bed and they never made me sick. i also started getting compliments about my nails and hair. i gave birth 4 months ago and i still keep taking these vitamins and feel GREAT!
