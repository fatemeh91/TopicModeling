review/text: be sure to buy the 10.3 version which is the newest product versus their 10.1 version- read the label- I called the comapny and they told me this is the newest formula- they did not say it was better but they didn't say it wasn't ! The Amazon price is a huge savings vs the on-line or health food store price-- does 1/2 the price mean anything?
