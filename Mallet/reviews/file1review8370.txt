review/text: I researched this brush before buying as I have done on all my purchases. This particular brush has softer brittles and therefore flexible into getting in the tight surfaces. This is great for wine glasses, mugs, and in general surfaces like bowls. I had a previousw brush similar to this, but not flexible... You will not be sorry. Hope this helps.
