review/text: This is by far the best green cleaner around. I'm a fairly sensitive person, even when it comes to natural products, but the light, fresh scent of this cleaner doesn't bother me, nor does it linger. It's perfect for damp cloth dusting, mopping the floor, or getting those tough pet stains out of the carpet. Plus, you don't have to rinse, just wipe and go. It's so concentrated the gallon lasts for what seems like forever. GREAT PRODUCT.
