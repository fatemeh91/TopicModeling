review/text: This tub is great if you're concerned with space. I can let it dry, fold it up and put it under the bassinet in my room so it's close at hand for the next bath.On the other hand, the water does spill over where the notches are to fold the tub if you fill it a bit too much. You can't add very much water because of that. Otherwise my son seems to like it and I haven't had any safety problems what-so-ever. As far as putting it in the sink, I wouldn't do that with any tub. It doesn't seem safe. Therefore I place the tub on the bathroom counter next to the sink.
