review/text: My wife and I just had our second baby and wanted to try and save come money by using washable nursing pads. The firs kind we tried were simply 5 layers of organic cotton, they soaked through and just were not very absorbent. We got these to try an found them to be satisfactory. Granted we are comparing them against disposables which are very absorbent, but these work well enough for daily use. The are more absorbent than the 5 layer cotton &#34;TL care&#34;, my wife says she would recommend them, and i am getting ready to order a couple more packs of them myself.
