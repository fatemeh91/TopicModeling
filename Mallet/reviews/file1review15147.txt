review/text: I avoided protein bars for years after a few unpleasant tries. This is the bar for people who don't like protein bars. It is truly tasty and satisfies my hunger for hours. I can substitute one of these for a meal when I'm on the go, and not even think about food until I get home. Great to keep in the car for emergencies, for backpacking, for a high protein snack anytime. Find a flavor you like and try them.
