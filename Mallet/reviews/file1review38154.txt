review/text: I began using Always products five years ago, and they drastically raised the bar on what I came to expect from sanitary napkins. The Overnight Protection pads have better absorbancy than the overnight pads of other brands. And they stay in one place. Have I mentioned they absorb *really* well?Please excuse me for raving about this product - Always pads changed my life.
