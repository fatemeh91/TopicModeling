review/text: Our family loves these pens, so wish they still made them and you didn't have to pay crazy prices for the left over ones. Husband keeps his in his pocket and always has a pen handy. Teen age son keeps his on his key ring. I keep mine in my purse in a pocket so it's easy to retrieve. Over time (2 years or more) the rubber grip between the pen tip and the top starts breaking down from use. Rubber gets soft and grimy. I've washed it, which helps, but it still is just a matter of time and use and breakdown, so we end up buying new ones, and they get pricier each year...$30, then $50... Sometimes the ink doesn't work well (probably because these pens were manufactured a few years ago and the ink is old.) Just bought ink cartridges that are not ion brand, (so they are new ink cartridges) and they work great.
