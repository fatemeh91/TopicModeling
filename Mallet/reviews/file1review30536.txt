review/text: As we all know, or should know, aluminum is a very real suspected culprit in Alzeimer's Disease and Anti-perspirants are loaded with it. I purchased this aluminum-free deodorant and it just doesn't do the job. I could smell the stuff on myself, so I surmised others could too. Also, it doesn't work, failed after a few hours. Don't waste your money on this. I loved my Secret Anti-perspirant, but alas, it has aluminum in it. I am going to try Arm & Hammer Essential next, which I ordered off the internet and cannot find in the stores (aluminum free) and hope to god it works. Hopefully I will find the right deodorant (can't use anti-perspirants as they ALL have aluminum in them)that will work, and this ain't it folks. By the way, those that think I don't know what I'm talking about. ME's have found excess aluminium in the brains of dead cadavers who died from Alzheimers (I always wondered what the common denominator was) and I, for one, would rather not risk it, therefore, I don't cook with aluminum pans and will not use any anti-perspirants or deodorant with aluminum in them.
