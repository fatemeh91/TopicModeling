review/text: I have been wearing prescribed orthodics for plantar fasciitis for a number of years, but after hard running still have had flare ups of PF. After wearing the Freedom Dorsal nightly for about 3 weeks I have seen marked improvements in the dreaded heel pain. While I purchased a large for a 9 1/2 foot, I believe the large is just a lttle big, may have been better off w/a Medium.
