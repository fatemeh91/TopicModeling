review/text: This stuff WORKS! The stubborn wart on my thumb (frozen off by a dermatologist TWICE) is gonW My daughter's plantar wart, for which the derm perscribed and $800 dollar RX that didn't work, (luckily I had a copay card!)is almost gone!TIP FOR GETTING IT ON JUST THE RIGHT SPOT:This stuff is strong, and it's in a chapstick type roll-up tube, so getting it on just the wart can be tough. If you get it on healthy skin it will disolve it too. I use a tooth pick edge to scrape a bit off the top of the stick and use that to spread it on just the wart. then cover with a bandaid, or a Dr. Scholl's palntar wart cushion for a plantar wart. YAY!
