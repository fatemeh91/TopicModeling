review/text: I'd like to say that Colgate Baking Soda & Peroxide Tartar Control Fluoride Toothpaste, Fresh Mint worked very well on my teeth. I've used this product since it arrived and plan to continue using it. It's very soft on the teeth but cleans them well. I've just had a lot of dental work done and my dentist has even recommended this product to me.
