review/text: I started taking Source Naturals CoQ10 sub-lingual tablets, due to the quick absorption by the body and then switched to the soft-gels when they discontinued the sub-lingual tablets. If you don't take any other supplement, consider taking this one; CoQ10 is found in every cell in your body, scientists speculate it may be a cell building block and the high quality of Source Naturals is also important.
