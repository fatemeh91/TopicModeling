review/text: So, I've had this wonderful razor for about a year and a half it it was time to switch out the foil and cutterblock. When I first switched out to the replacement parts, I could immediately tell the difference, both good and bad. I could tell that the cutter block was really sharp and cut through my thick beard. The bad part was the fact that the foil kept grabbing my longer hairs and pulling them. Tip for everyone! If you have this same problem, try turning the foil around. The part fits both frontways and backways. Ever since doing this, no problems!
