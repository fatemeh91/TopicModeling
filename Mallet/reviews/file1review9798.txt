review/text: After several rounds of painfully mashing away at my face with Drug store tweezers and a sewing needle trying to get out tiny ingrown beard hairs, I got a pair of these. Each ingrown hair I've attacked with these tweezers is out in under 30 seconds- it's sooo much easier to isolate the right hair now- and I'm not ripping out the surrounding hairs by mistake anymore.
