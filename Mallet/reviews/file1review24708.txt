review/text: This sprinkler lasted under 1 year. I probably used it 60-90 days in that time. When it wasn't being used, I stored in in a garage (so it wasn't in the sun). The problems are:1) One of the nozzles stopped working fairly quickly. This wasn't a big deal, but did seem odd. It was just plugged up I guess.2) The oscillation became uneven. When I set the sprinkler on full range, it would go a lot farther in one direction than the other. I'd say that the short side was 40 degrees less than the long side. If I tried to correct this by setting it more on the side that wasn't getting full coverage, I would lose coverage on the other side.3) A 'sticky spot' developed where sometimes the sprinkler would get caught for a second then jump across 10-15 degrees. This happened in the same spot, so it might have been a piece of debris or something on the cardioid track.4) It began to leak pretty badly at the hose connector.I probably could have fixed problems 1 and 3, but the totality of the problems made it not worthwhile.
