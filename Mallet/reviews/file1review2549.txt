review/text: This little machine is one my favorite new appliances. I haven't bothered with a razor in months and I'm completely happy with the results. I've used it on my legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, and my face. Although it hurts like crazy on my face, I still like that I don't have to mess with wax or strips. I've even discovered that I don't have to worry about getting every little hair on my legs, the hair that's grown back is less noticable. The amount of money I've saved not buying new cartridges for my razors has more than made up for the initial expense, which really isn't much.I love this little guy & highly recommend it!
