review/text: It seemed like a good deal... at the time. The main reason I got this was because the DA-307's trimmer tends to break where the pins are, allowing the trimmer to pop out of the unit. I have two older units with the same problem, so thought a relatively inexpensive replacement would be a good try. However, after six months of use the battery pack went dead. I was able to swap the battery pack from a much older unit and my version of &#34;reconditioning&#34; now works great. One has to ask: what reconditioning was done at the factory if the battery pack died in just SIX months? Avoid this product and just buy a new one... or live with your old one as is.
