review/text: Purchased when I got a new prescription strength from the eye doc. Needed something that would withstand travel, being in my pocket or laptop case, being thrown around in an overhead aircraft bin, and for walking around industrial plants. These work great, look nice, have a very comfortable fit on my wide head.
