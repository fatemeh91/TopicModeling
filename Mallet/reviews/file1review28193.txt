review/text: I love this brand and this product. What I think sets this product apart from most protein powders I've tried, is that it actually tastes good! It's got everything you want and need in a protein powder whether you're training or trying to lose weight. It's great before and/or after a workout and as a meal replacement when you're on the go and don't have time to eat right. But the best part of this product is that because it tastes good, you will use it. Most protein powders I have tried just taste terrible. And I just won't use them if I cannot stomach getting them down. This stuff is good. I like the tropical punch mixed with water so it tastes like fruit punch. It looks like Pepto Bismol, but don't let that deter you...it tastes great. The vanilla ice cream flavor makes a great smoothie with fresh fruit and skim milk. I cannot say enough good things about this product, it's quality and taste. If you've tried protein powders before but just can't tolerate their nasty taste, I would highly recommend you try this product.
