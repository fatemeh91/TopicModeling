review/text: We put this on our 4yr old son's bed and it has been a mattress saver! He has wet the bed once and it was quite wet and this cover kept it from getting to the mattress. One time when he was sick and vomited in bed it also worked. The cover would get wet on the top side but never soaking through. The back side is completely water proof. Would highly recommend this product. We got an extra one as a spare.It does get a bit warm in the summer months especially when the room is hot but he has been able to sleep through it.
