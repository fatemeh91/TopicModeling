review/text: Bought eight of these, they are all crap. They are the black and green, made in Japan. I use one of them in a wall clock, and the clock dies after a week. My husband uses six of them in a label maker, and every time he goes to use the label maker, it's dead. These were all junk to begin with, and have NEVER held a charge. Going to call Duracell and ask for a coupon for some replacements. I will be using that coupon to buy 2400mAH batteries, not the 2650's. We have 2400's and they work fine, even after a couple of years.
