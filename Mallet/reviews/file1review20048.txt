review/text: I bought this syringe for a medical kit i was putting together for surface cleaning of wounds. It arrived very quickly and i had to use it last week when i took a chunk out of my leg in the middle of the woods with an axe... Upon opening it i found that it was still securely packaged sterile and that's after about 3 years of storage. Overall i would trust this product over and over again because of its reliability when i needed it... (By the way, 9 Stitches later and the leg is doing great)
