review/text: Purchased 3 packs of these. Mine are labeled made in Japan. Read somewhere some are marked make in China?These are the worst batteries I have ever purchased. I tried 2 different charges. Just purchased a La Crosse Technology BC-700 from here thinking that would help. It can't charge them past 1,000 mAH. It is not the charger.Update.. wanted to post that I told the charger to discharge the cells first, than charge. When that failed, I told it to condition it, i.e. discharge, charge, until some change, 3 days of this. This didn't work. Will not hold a charge, will not take the full charge.
