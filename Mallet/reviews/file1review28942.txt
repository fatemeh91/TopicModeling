review/text: I have gotten the strawberry banana flavor before, and it was awesome. The price is good too. However, they sent me chocolate mint instead. I would of sent it back, but I was lazy and curious about the flavor. It's not terrible, but I wish I had gotten what I ordered. Strawberry banana is much better.
