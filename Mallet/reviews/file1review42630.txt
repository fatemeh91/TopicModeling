review/text: For the last couple years I have been primarily sticking to ON brand proteins. That is the basis for my comparison when I say this tastes very gritty in a shaker cup, and is only slightly better when mixed with a hand blender. Now for the fact that this particular flavor (cafe mocha) really tastes like garbage. I'm actually kind of impressed that they captured the essence of garbage so well that I kind of want to raid the cats litter box to get the taste out of my mouth.I did do my research before I purchased this product. I looked here as well as many other websites, and saw mostly favorable reviews for this. If you look at bodybuilding.com they actually have people rate the taste of products on a 1-10 scale and this was receiving mostly 9s and 10s. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will never buy this particular product again.
