review/text: There's no question that ON makes quality protein powders, and most actually taste fantastic. But for anyone who is contemplating taking a chance and trying this flavor for variety sake, I advise against it. It comes off as a little too strong, and tastes like nothing resembling cookies n' cream in my opinion. Stick with good old chocolate or vanilla type flavors.Aside from the taste, the protein quality was the usual high quality blend, and the consistency of the drink when blended was great.
