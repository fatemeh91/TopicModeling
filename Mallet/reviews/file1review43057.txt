review/text: Just got it in the mail today, and put it on right away. I'm 26 weeks with #3, and I have big babies, so I was very hopeful. It does seem to help a little, but no more than just the belt, at least at this point. Word of advice: DON'T order on the big end - the hooks on the bottom band are several inches apart, so you can never make it fit just right. I don't know where people are finding a sizing chart for this product - I see no options for how to figure out what size I am! I've just been wearing large maternity clothes at this point, so I went with large. Well I'm 191 lb right now and the one I have says it's for 180-250 lb, but if I hook the closest hooks on the bottom to make it as small as I can, it's still a bit too loose. Plus it makes the side straps come to the front too much, making it very uncomfortable. The top straps are also easily visible in the front if you're wearing a shirt that comes any lower than your throat. I'm wearing a pretty conservative v-neck t-shirt and the straps are showing on both sides, plus some skin yet between the strap and the neck of the shirt - that's how bad it is. The only way it wouldn't show is if I pushed the straps off the shoulder - and what would the point of the contraption be then? I wish I had saved myself the money and just got the belt. I tried that last pregnancy, and thought this would provide a bit more support with the shoulder straps, but it really doesn't.
