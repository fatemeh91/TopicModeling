review/text: I had to stop taking these vitamins because I would run to the bathroom in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains. It also caused pretty bad constipation. It may the level or form of iron but I had to switch because I could not tolerate them. I tried splitting the pill and taking it twice a day but I was still miserable. I switched to New Chapter Prenatal Vitamins and they are far better. I have more energy and no digestive issues with the New Chapter brand.
