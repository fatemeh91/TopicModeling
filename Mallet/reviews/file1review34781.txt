review/text: I don't like strong scents and this was very noticable to me all day. I suppose that means it should work well, but by the end of the day it smelled faintly of flowery mixed with sweat. I don't expect anything to work 100%, but I really don't want that much fragrance. The roll on works fine and is a thin liquid that dries clear. It did not have any irritation the few times I tried it. I am trying other options for aluminum free deodorant, hopefully they'll work out better.
