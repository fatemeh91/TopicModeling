review/text: I love this toothbrush, but it is a little bit noisier than past Oral B models I've had. I love that there's a little smiley face when you've brushed your full 2 minutes, and it definitely makes my teeth feel super-duper shiny and clean. Another great perk is that the base holds four brush heads in a convenient and stylish closable case. The grippy handle is also a great improvement from past models.
