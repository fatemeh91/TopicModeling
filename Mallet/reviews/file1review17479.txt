review/text: It worked great and did a good job trimming my goatee while it worked. Not having a stand was no big deal but I would have liked it if you could use it plugged in while it charged and while the battery was dead. The battery died out on it a few weeks ago and no longer holds a charge after 1 year and 10 months of use. I only paid $15 for (now its $25)but I thought I would get more than almost 2 years of use. If Remington hoped I'd just buy another one, well they are right, but it won't be a Remington, I'll try another brand out, especially since its $10 more now.
