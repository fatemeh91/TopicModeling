review/text: I bought this product because I was looking for a good soluble fiber supplement to help with my digestion, but I started finding the tablets never dissolved in my digestive tract. So then I ran an experiment, I poured boiling water over it and put a tablet in a cup to see if it would disolve, nope it did not dissolve - It DIDN'T DISSOLVE AT ALL!If you are looking for a good soluble fiber supplement do not buy this cr@p, you should try Heather's acacia fiber.
