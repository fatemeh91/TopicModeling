review/text: Seriously, this is a total rip-off. Go to youtube and search about this product. Watch the "doctor's" presentations...so tacky and an obvious scheme. Do yourself a favor, steer clear. I sent mine back..all it does is give you nasty diarrhea. I tried it for 4 days and then researched the product. Total scam. The seller was fast and reliable, however the product is garbage...and overpriced.
