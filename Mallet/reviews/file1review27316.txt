review/text: I have always been a fan of Optimum nutrition's protein powder, but I wanted something more natural. So I mistakenly bought hemp protein powder, it may have been "healthier" but it tasted like I was on fear factor every time I drunk someI just bought vanilla ice cream because it was $10 cheaper than plain vanillaI am very pleased with the vanilla ice cream. I thought it might taste like fake vanilla flavoring, but instead it tastes like a well polished vanilla with hints of vanilla bean
