review/text: I've tried numerous shaving cream products and was unsuccessful in finding one that didn't have my skin turning red and breaking out until I bought this. I had purchased the sensitive shaving cream product by The Art Of Shaving which was about $30 since it had such rave reviews in regards to people with very sensitive skin. The first time I used it I broke out after being about 75% complete. I wanted to make sure it was the product so I gave it a few more gos which I now regret lol. After discovering this product and it being extremely cheap(I paid $3!), I decided to give it a shot. Best shaving-related decision of my life! Not only does it have a great light scent, it almost felt like it was rejuvenating my skin. I haven't had any issues with this and would highly recommend this product to individuals with sensitive skin. I Hope this can be of some help to other people who suffer from eczema/atopic dermatitis like myself.
