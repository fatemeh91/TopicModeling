review/text: The Schick Intuition shaves well, but the unscented is stinky!I am sensitive to fragrance, so I was thrilled to see "unscented" on the package. But soon I realized that the perfume wafting all over my bathroom was coming from my razor. Now I have to keep my razor outside, which is, well, inconvenient.Scent is not necessary in a razor, folks! Let's make it truly unscented!
