review/text: I use this tape to stabilize my shoulders during lap swimming. It stays on my body well for 1 mile which is quite impressive considering how much we have to rotate our shoulders during a swim. It did start to peel off for my 2nd mile, but that's simply too much to ask for. (Note: it stays on my skin well, but it does not stay on another layer of tape in the water. So be award while layering the tape)
