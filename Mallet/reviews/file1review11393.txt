review/text: I've tried all the sizes available for these SleepRight night guards and it really came down to the bite pads being too thick. Don't get me wrong, the design and materials used seem of high quality, but even after a month - I was not used to this product in all the different sizes. I would wake up with cuts in my mouth (the bite pads have a harder plastic pivot) and a sore jaw from keeping it open at a certain angle (unanimous with all sizes). I think the design can use a little more refinement and it may be very good one day. I switched over to the Dentek "copies" and they actually work better for me. They come in packs of 2 for the price of 1 of these as well (just make sure you get the ones that have the blue bite pads). You can give it a try and may have success with this one.. but not for me.Update 3/5/2011I had to use my old pair as backup because my current night guard needed replacing. I've found these to actually be more comfortable if you adjust the bite pads to the narrowest setting holes. Perhaps this is partly due to how your jaw pivots towards the back. Wedging these bite pads into your molars forces your mouth to be opened more. Having them closer to the front allowed my mouth to be more closed during the night. With this adjustment, I'd give the product 3.5 stars if it were possible. I'd easily give it closer to 4 or 4.5 if the bite pads were more comfortable. Just thought I'd share this update.
