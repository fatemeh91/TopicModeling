The rubber stem flexes so it doesn't stress the glass when it's scrubbed. It's also softer so it doesn't clank on the glass while you use it.These are way better than the hard stemmed bottle brushes. I'm glad they're available again, for a while OXO tried to replace them w/ some stainless steel version which was much worse (& broke repeatedly). They probably realized their old rubber design was still best after all the complaints/returns of the "new improved" version.
