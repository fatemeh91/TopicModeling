review/text: As you can see in my pictures these are very small (1 and 3/8 inches by 1 inch) but they work as well as any other dishwasher detergent I have used. One huge benefit is that they don't impart a chemically smell when the dishes come out of the washer. While it is supposed to be "orange scented" they don't really smell orange, just clean. I picked up some "fresh scent" ones and will review them at a later date. I have noticed a reduction of water spots on glass and plastic (although the dishwasher adds additional Jet Dry). Another benefit is that each tablet is individually packaged so you don't need to lift a large box of detergent, and if you rip the package down the middle you can pop it into the washer without touching it.I have an older dishwasher and although it has two cups, one for a pre-wash and one for the main wash, you only add one of these into the main wash cup. I sometimes add a little left over powdered detergent to the prewash cups when I have heavily soiled dishes but it probably isn't even necessary.These things really work!
