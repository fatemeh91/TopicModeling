review/text: I had been using the same $5 walmart battery operated beard trimmer for more than 6 years. I never really thought about the quality of it because it was so cheap but when it finally went out to pasture in my recent move I needed a replacement. I actually did alot of research and didn't want to spend alot of money which brought me to this product. What sold me on it initially was the fact that it didn't have a bunch of extra pieces that I would have to keep track of. The adjustable head seemed perfect. Once I got it and used it I have to say its the best trimmer I had ever used. It worked better than even the $50+ hair clippers my brother owns. I would definately recommend this product to anyone looking for great quality for a great price. I can't imagine what would be better if you spent more money on a "higher quality" trimmer.
