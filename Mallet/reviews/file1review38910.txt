review/text: I liked the big handle. It was easy to grip and didn't slip out of my hand. I felt that the razor gave a nice, clean shave with few or no nicks. The blade had a nice strip on it that seemed to smooth the way. The razor stayed sharp for a good five uses before it needed replacing. I liked this razor much more than a disposable, and would purchase replacement blades for it.
