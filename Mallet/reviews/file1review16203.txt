review/text: This product is great for floor workouts and cardio, however I find that is slips a lot while I am running, using the elliptical, or any other exercise where you do a lot of knee-bending. Because of this, I often experience greater knee pain with it on than I would without it since it is slipping down over my knee cap. It is a good fit, but for some reason it doesn't stay in place during those exercises. In addition, it is quite bulky so it's presence is very much apparent under workout gear, work slacks, and jeans.
