review/text: Research on this product indicated it would help lower cortisol levels. High cortisol levels can result in anxiety, elevated heart rate. I didn't experience these results. In fact, I noticed an increase in heart rate and a "pounding" heart beat when taking the product. This resulted in sleep disturbances and headaches. These symptoms stopped when the product was discontinued.
