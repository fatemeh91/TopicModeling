review/text: Country Life - Power-Dophilus (Milk Free), 4 bill, 100 veggie capsI have used milk-free acidophilus for many years because of my allergy to dairy products and a desire to maintain a healthy gastro-intestinal tract. I always refrigerate this supplement. Generally speaking I prefer freeze-dried versions rather than capsules. This particular version is quite good, although they begin to lose their potency towards the bottom of the bottle.
