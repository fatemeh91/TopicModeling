review/text: Bought this a little early. We have plans for cleaning bottles, but since the baby was just born and my wife plans on breastfeeding for at least 4-6 months, it has found its way into a drawer for now.My wife thinks it looks like a toilet brush and doesn't want to use it on bottles.The extended bristles on the end are well designed to reach the flat bottom and edges on the inside of a bottle.Good design; good brush.
