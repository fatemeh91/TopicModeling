review/text: I am a true fan of all Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products. I have tried and currently stock everything except the dryer sheets....that is next on my list! I can honestly say that this stuff works so well, you will be amazed...and best part is: IT SMELLS SO DELIGHTFUL!!! It is fragrant and natural, not at all the "perfume-masked chemical smell" like all the average chemical based products in the stores. I can let my kids help me with the cleaning around the house and not freak out that it is touching their skin...because it is completely safe and au-natural....the way cleaning products were intended!! While and even hours after cleaning (say, just one bathroom in the house) my entire home smells naturally delicious for hours afterwards.My ultimate favorite is the Geranium All-Purpose cleaner....it works wonders on just about everything, and I even use it in my steam cleaner, in place of the usual chemical -induced recommended product, and it actually works like a charm and is so effective & safe for all....even my over-worked steamer!!I look forward to the happy day when products like these are the mainstream choice, not icky Lysol pine cleaner & Mr Clean(which has the strangest unnatural looking color varieties ever!) not to mention all the products that are laced with bleach. Yukk!Did I mention it is quite a deal to purchase the packs of 6 here at Amazon, especially with the free shipping. I paid approx. $6 for individual bottles when I first discovered Mrs. Meyers at a local natural food store. Stock up and Save!!!
