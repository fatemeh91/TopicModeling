review/text: Purchased this product because it was relatively low on calories compared to other products and overall it had good ratings. After trying it, it actually tastes really good when mixed with milk (or almond milk). I generally take it immediately after working out and before dinner. Seems to help with both weight loss and muscle gain. 5 pounds will easily last me two months having it once a day. For the price, I really can't complain. I plan on continuing to buy it.
