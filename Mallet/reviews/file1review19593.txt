review/text: I like the curvature of this seat. And the dial to custom the fit to toilet seat is also wonderful. It doesn't slip or move around no matter how much wiggling goes on.The only negative is the lack of shield in the front. It is MUCH better then most but maybe needs a bit more for boys.Overall, I love this product and would recommend it. Just make sure they're sitting where it's pointed south!
