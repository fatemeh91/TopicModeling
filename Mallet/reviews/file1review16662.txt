review/text: This lighter is a great lighter made by the best company for lighters everyone who says it has scratches and stuff on it and its bad quality and it did not come with fuel dont know anything about lighter dont listen to them This lighter is called street chrome its suppose to be scratched looking its helps keep of fingerprints and for the people complying about no fuel in it if they ship it with fuel in they will be in big trouble because its fumes are flammable and you cant have fumes coming out of while shipping because that would be bad and the people complaining about quality since its made by Zippo they have a free repair policy for anything that is wrong with their products and will repair or replace your lighter for free so if there is a problem send it in instead of making it look like this great companies lighters are bad if they were not good lighters they would not still be in business since the 30's.
