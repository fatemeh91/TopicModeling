review/text: I was recommended this kind of support by a professional massage therapist. I sit at a desk for at least 8 hrs a day and go to school at night so my neck and shoulders are in moderate to severe discomfort, especially towards the end of the work week.I definitely feel the Underworks posture perfect band working when I wear it. The first time I wore it for more then the initial minute (to figure out the hook placement in the back), it was uncomfortable. My shoulders and my back were fine; the area is the irritated was under your arms. I looked at other posture support bands (shouldersback particularily) but they were significantly more money plus I did not want to get burnt spending that much dough (shouldersback was $50 without shipping) so I tried the cheaper alternative. To overcome the irritation under my arms, I found an old suit jacket that had shoulder pads exposed (the jacket was not lined). I cut the shoulder pads off of that jacket and used safety pins to adhere the shoulder pads around the band. This will work best b/c I can remove the shoulder pads to wash weekly. For the price, definitely worth it. Definitely look into finding shoulder pads before buying this product. I managed to wear the band (without my shoulder pad contraption) for 4 hours over a short sleeve t-shirt that had cap sleeves but would ultimately like to wear under my clothing for the entire work day. The band is discrete and not bulky and even with the shoulder pads I will be able to do so.Not bad for the price.Good Luck
