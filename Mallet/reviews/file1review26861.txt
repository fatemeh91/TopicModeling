review/text: My amazon shipment arrived recently and I am happy with the purchase. The vanilla ice-cream flavor tastes good and the powder mixes out very well. No lumps or cakes while drinking or in the bottom of glass. Cant speak to effect on my body yet as its early days still but happy with the buy. Beware though the 5lb bottle is humongous! It's 11 inches tall and 8 inches wide, takes up the space of a whole appliance on my counter! No regrets still.
