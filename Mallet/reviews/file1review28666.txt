review/text: I've been lifting for approximately 20 years and have tried numerous supplements and protein powders. This is by far the best protein powder I have ever used and I have been using it for the past 4 years. These are the main reasons why I like this protien over the numerous others I have tried in the past:1) High protein vs. carb/fat ratio: 24g/1g/3g2) Will disolve in water3) Tastes great for not having a lot of sugar4) Good price5) Low level of metals typically found in other protein drinks
