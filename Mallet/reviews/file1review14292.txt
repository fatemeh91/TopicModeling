review/text: The problem with our bathroom is mildew/mold, all blacken on the edge of the shower tub. I tried this automatic shower cleaner for more than a month, but there is no effect on removing the mildew. It cleans a little bit of stains on the wall, shower door and floor of the tub, but the effect is not obvious. And it can't reach the back shower wall! Also, the smell of the chemical cleaner is really BAD, especially in my house which the bathroom has no window for air flow. I sometimes feel difficulty breathing smelling the chemical (I used to suffered from asthma).The only advantage is that it's very easy to use, just press the button everyday. But it is just too good to be true.Not recommend to buy this...better try with Tilex and scrubbing!!
