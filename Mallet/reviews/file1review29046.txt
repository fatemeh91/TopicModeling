review/text: I got the Braun 3-in-1 shaver on the 18th of April as promised, it is very easy to use and works pretty good so far (as may 14, 07). the power plug connects to wall power source is too big and heavy, will not stay, should be redesigned to a lighter or smaller size, or having a 90 degree angle. This is my personal opinion.robert, Santa Ana, CA.
