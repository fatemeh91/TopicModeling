review/text: First off, this is the best protein drink out there. Cookies and Creme, Chocolate and Vanilla are the best for me. I still have Chocolate Mint (new for me) left to try in the pantry. I will say strawberry ended up being given away to a friend. Not that it was aweful, just not my taste nor close enough to strawberry for me. With that out of the way here's MIXING 101.The simple way to stir this stuff without LUMPS is as follows:1. Pour the milk (LOL).2. Get your spoon.3. Get your scoop of powder in one hand and spoon in the other hand4. Start stirring the milk vigorously (get that funnel/tornado look going in the milk!) and add powder in a continuous poor. NEVER stop stirring until scoop is empty. This is extremely important for LUMP FREE drinks :)I realize this is a "pat the top of your head and rub your stomach" at the same time sort of deal but it's quite simple in practice. Also do not PACK the powder in the scoop so it will easily flow from it. I can add 2 scoops to a single 8-10oz glass of milk without ANY lumps! No joke. No blender. Just a quick stirring of milk and a steady pouring of powder. Hope this helps someone. NO MORE LUMPS! Works with other powders.Aaron
