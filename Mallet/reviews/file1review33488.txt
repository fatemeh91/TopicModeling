review/text: I went to amazon to order another Waterpik system(foolish me)and I just thought I'd check the customer reviews. Virtually EVERYONE has had the same experience as me. You get it home, it works for a week or two (if your lucky) and then it fails. I actually didn't get more than a couple of uses out of it. I just assumed that I got the odd lemon but obviously this company is marketing something that IS NOT RIGHT and yet it's amazing if you read the reviews how many people still come back to give them another chance. Beside the product being a LEMON we must be LEMMINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!Don't jump, go elsewhere....someone mentioned that Panasonic has it's own oral irrigator.........Good Luck.
