review/text: I don't suffer from IBS, but I do eat a lot of spicy food that sometimes upsets my stomach. This product is great for alleviating that. Just drink some dissolved in juice afterward or before you go to bed. No more worrying about whether or not my stomach will start burning. I have gone through 2 cans so far. With the first can, for some reason, the powder wasn't dissolving well, but it still worked. The second can was much more soluble. Either way, it works!
