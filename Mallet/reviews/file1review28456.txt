review/text: ON's Extreme Chocolate protein has been a nice change to my protein protocol. Though ON is not the best quality and best tasting protein I have ever had it is definitely a good supplement to take and the price cannot be beat. The Extreme Chocolate by itself (with milk or water) is definitely very chalky. If I add a fruit and some natural peanut butter, the taste is superb.Overall, I am happy with this product.
