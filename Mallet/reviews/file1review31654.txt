review/text: I picked this up at GNC (paid too much for it, it's about $10 cheaper on Amazon). I love Red Bull or Monster before my workout, but that was when I could do a morning routine and now with a change of schedule, I can only work out after 6pm. I needed a non caffeine boost and this stuff is great, It tastes great as well. I may never drink a jittery energy drink again, highly recommended!
