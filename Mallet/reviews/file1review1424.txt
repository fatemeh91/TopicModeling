review/text: This is exactly what we wanted after tiring of other scales. It arrived in perfect shape, was easy to calibrate, and my 3yo digs the height rod. BTW the unit without the height rod (337?) costs about the same (actually a little bit more when I bought my 339). As an added bonus, it is USA made, and the unit came with well-thought-out documentation and signed inspection papers. In English.
