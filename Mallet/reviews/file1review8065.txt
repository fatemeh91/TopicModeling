review/text: Bought this and initially loved it despite the fact that occasionally the top would loosen and dishsoap would leak out. Then I felt the bristles were a bit soft for tough scrubbing jobs (baked on brownie/burned casserole/lasagna pan/etc). DON'T make the mistake I did of using on hot pan which then melted the bristles to laying flat instead of vertical. After that the thing was useless... they need to make one with HEATPROOF bristles so you can scrub away while pot is hot. Will probably not replace with the same item.
