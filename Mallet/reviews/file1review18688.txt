review/text: This assist rail is great. I had hip replacement surgery and the in and out to bed by far is the worst. The TFI Handdirail bed assist rail made what I felt an impossible task easier to overcome. You just have to figure out the best placement for the best results....order early and get used to it and you'll be as pleased as I am. I try to buy almost everything from Amazon, it is so much easier looking for items and then reading the reviews. Amazon you've made my life better since I can shop with you and not have to deal with driving, parking, shopping in store and then a check out line.
