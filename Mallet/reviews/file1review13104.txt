review/text: I received one of these neck warmers, and my Mom has used it for arthritis in her neck. You put the neck wrap in the microwave for 45 seconds to heat it up. She loves it. We were on vacation and when she got back, she called me and told me she had forgotten it. She wanted to know where to get another. I told her I would check and went straight to amazon.com. I found it in seconds with several other products that were by the same company, I was thrilled, I ordered it and it arrived 2 days later. She had fortunately had found the other, but we decided to keep this one and keep it in the freezer so that she could have both heat and cold. Amazon never seems to fail when I need to find something. Thanks
