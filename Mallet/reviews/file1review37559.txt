review/text: I bought this deodorant having seen all the great reviews. It was also a great value for cost per ounce. The smell is unique that is for sure. I can see why some people would love it. The problem I have is that it does not last. By lunch time I am smelling pretty ripe. Another problem with that musk smell is that it is not a perfumy smell so it does not cover up BO all that well. If anything it only enhances the BO. If you dont have problems with BO or perspiration then I can see this working for you. Otherwise, avoid.
