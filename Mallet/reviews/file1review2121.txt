review/text: Dip-It crystals is the best product I have used for getting coffee and tea stains from my coffee mug and thermos. I drink about a pot of coffee per day. After a month, both my mug and my thermos have a nasty brown film covering the inside. I have tried the Mr. Coffee cleaning products, as well as some other knock-off brands, and they all work "so-so". My technique with Dip-It is to use about a teaspoon of the crystals per 16oz of beverage volume. Boil some water on the stove. Add the Dip-it directly to the stained container. Pour in enough boiling water to completely fill the container. Let stand for about 20-30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly and dry.
