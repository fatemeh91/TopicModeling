review/text: I paid about 100 dollars for it. I am angry at this toothbrush now, because handle didn't work at all after charging a battery at the beginning after then one month later handle itself ran without an operation until the battery was completely discharged. I couldn't stop it. I also tried to remove the battery by the presented instruction. Anyway, I don't want to buy this product any more, even though it is currently a good reputation.
