review/text: I give this product 100 stars for its healing qualities. In one week, my severe flare up was 100% gone; this has never happened with any other product i've tried.However, I found the smell highly offensive; to the point of upsetting my stomach from the smell. It is described as having a "pleasant musk aroma". Well... Skunk smell is also a musk! Perhaps in chinese medicine (its made in China) it's considered a good smell, but WOW - I find it awful. And.... the smell is strong enough that you wont be the only one that smells it; it's quite powerful and the smell will linger in the room after you leave (I got some funny looks standing in the checkout line at the grocery store...)The other issue I have with the product is that it does stain whatever clothing it touches. It's a clear grease/oil type stain that will not wash out of anything so choose undergarments that you're willing to throw away afterwards. I put a bit more on at night before bed, since I wasn't concerned about anyone else smelling it, and it went through my clothes and even stained my bed linens.I still give it a very high rating because of how well it works; I just wish it smelled less skunk like and didn't stain!
