review/text: I've found this OXO Scrub Brush to be a great and easy to use tool for cleaning plates, bowls, pots and pans. It is gentle enough to use on nonstick surfaces but tough enough to remove stuck-on food.I haven't had the durability or easy-of-use problems other users have complained about. The sponge/scrubber does wear out after about 3 months of heavy usage. Fortunately, you can get refill sponges at a low cost--and the utility of this scrubber is definitely well worth it.I recommend using a 50/50 mix of dishwashing soap and water for optimal performance: you still get the dishes clean and you don't waste your suds. This may also help the soap penetrate the sponge (others have complained that this is a problem), although I haven't had problems even at full concentration.I highly recommend this and other Good Grips products -- OXO is one of only a handful of companies that that recognize that both style and functionality are important.
