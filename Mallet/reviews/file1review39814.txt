review/text: These are good and handy pick up tools but they are deliberately designed so the plastic that holds the screw that holds the rubber cup will crack, and the cup will come off and you'll go out and buy another pickup tool. Be prepared to drill through the little cup and use your own little screw and nut to hold the cup in place, or just don't buy it.
