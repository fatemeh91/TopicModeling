review/text: I have been struggling with fatigue for 6 years now. I have researched everything trying to find an answer. I read "The Maker's Diet" which is written by the man who created this product and cured himself of Chron's. I have tried all sorts of supplements (and still take a wide range of vitamins and antioxidants). I've been taking this for over a month now and am not dragging like I usually am. I can actually get things done. I have also been able to sleep through the night without sleeping pills.Be sure to only start out with 1 a day and work your way up to 3 as the label indicates to do. Those with worse conditions may need more. Works best on an empty stomach.
