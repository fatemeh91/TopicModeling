review/text: Considering how cheap they were, I would get them again.Pros: Powerful, plenty of attachments, complete kitCons: Scissors came dull, gets a little warm after useMostly, I was shocked that Amazon shipped me a used item...there were smudges on the clipper and little hairs still caught in the clipper portion. It's okay though, I enjoy examining my new products for fingerprints to see if they are actually new or not...it's a like an easter egg hunt. Bravo, Amazon.Fortunately the clippers work well though, so I'll keep them.
