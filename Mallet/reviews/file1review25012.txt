review/text: This product uses Sorbitol and Asparthame to add sweetness, instead of typical sugar. The Nutritional Fact sheet on the back of the package said '35 Calories per 4 mints serving'. The packaging also said '40% fewer calories than regular Pep-O-Mint Hard Candy'. There are about 24 individually wrapped in a single bag. Personally, I think it leaves better after taste than other 'sugar-free' candies.
