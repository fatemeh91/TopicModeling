review/text: I have tried a lot of protein powders, but this is my favorite by far. The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is good on it's own in milk or soy milk. That said, I have loved it mixed into lowfat pudding, greek yogurt, frozen fruit & milk smoothies, and I have even mixed it in with my coffee creamer & added it to decaf coffee if I need to jump start my protein total for the day. It is never gritty or chalky - it just disappears into whatever you mix it into. I've even successfully stirred it into homemade lo carb dark chocolate gelato (just before freezing it). I've never had a more versatile form of protein, and before this I only used soy protein since it had a better taste/texture than whey.
