review/text: It didn't work. I was and still am so desperate to get rid of my underarm b.o. that I tried about everything that promises to eliminate odor. So far, none has worked. These soft gels actually made my stomach hurt a little, even though I take them as directed. They also turns the feces green, but didn't eliminate the smell or anything. I found no improvement at all =(. I just want to get rid of my b.o. I've had it since 15 and now I am 21 and have no life because of it. I guess I will continue to search.
