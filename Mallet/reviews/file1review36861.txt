review/text: While I thought this tool looked really weird, i was tired of not being able to put on my sock or having to ask for help. I got this prior to hip replacement surgery and have continued to use it during the recouperative process. The terry outside keeps the sock in place when prepping to put it on. The inside material slides easily off the foot and the straps are plenty long. I have used it on ankle socks, long calf socks, and many more types of socks. I highly recommend.
