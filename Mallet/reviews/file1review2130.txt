review/text: This is a review of the powder version of Dip-It. This product is designed to remove the stains from all parts of the coffee maker which are in contact with the coffee. It is highly alkaline and will completely remove the brown stains from the filter basket and the carafe. I ran this cleaner through a neglected coffee maker at work. The results were simply amazing. The wash solution looked like coffee and the thermos carafe came out looking like new. For those of you wondering, the liquid version of Dip-It is not a replacement for this product. It is an acid liquid and is designed to remove mineral scale from parts of a coffee maker which are in contact with water. Most coffee makers used in the home have water reservoirs which are subject to water scale buildup. This is what the liquid is designed to remove. It will do nothing to remove brown coffee stains.
