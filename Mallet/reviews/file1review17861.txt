review/text: WOW!!! If you are a white chocolate fan, you have got to try these, and with the carmel....FANTASTIC!!! I cannot say enough good things about these. I tried one, and I immediately signed up for subscribe & save, this flavor is my favorite!! The bars are small, but because of the fiber and protein they really fill you up. (Well for a snack, anyway:) And at 100 calories, you can indulge anytime with no guilt!!
