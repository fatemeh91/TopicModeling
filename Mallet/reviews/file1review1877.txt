review/text: I ordered this attempting to replace a clomitrazole and betamethasone diproportionate cream I use by prescription for a rash on my leg. While enjoyable to use, it was ineffective at preventing my rash.Following this, I triedClotrimazole Anti Fungal Creamand have seen good results. It seems the betamethasone isn't necessary to keep my rash under control.
