review/text: My mother gave me a Fusion for Christmas last year. I used it for the first time just a couple of months ago. This is, no doubt, the best razor I've ever used! I can shave my legs and underarms quickly without the fear of nicks. This razor glides across your skin so smoothly; I couldn't believe how close the shave was. My underarms and legs were absolutely hairless and stubble free!I didn't realize the razor used replacement blades until I looked on Amazon in search for another razor. Once I saw my razor on there with replacement cartriges,I bought the 8 replacement cartriges (BTW, the blades last forever so 8 will probably last up to 6 months).I will use only this razor from now on.
