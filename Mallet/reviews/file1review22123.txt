review/text: I recently had to use the thermometer when my little one got sick and it was easier than trying to take her temp under her arm. Since she needed soothing anyway, it was easy to keep in her mouth. Also, the pacifier that came with this set is the ONLY pacifier she'll take! I wish they sold that separately so I can have more than one. Every mom of a baby should have this thermometer. You also don't have to worry about adding one degree to the final reading like you do with the underarm thermometers (not that it's hard or anything...). Highly recommend this!!
