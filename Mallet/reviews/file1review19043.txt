review/text: This is by far the best product on the market. No more laxatives, softeners, chunky or thick junk to help you along...this is the magic bullet. This stuff is pleasant tasting and more like drinking Tang or orange kool aid than some kind of fiber or laxative. It's safe for using when you're pregnant and nursing and it does the trick. I wish I'd have known about it sooner. I would reccomend it to anyone who needs a little help keeping their body on track...just had a baby, surgery, and I'm nursing and I wouldn't change products or try anything else even if it was free.
