review/text: PROS:1. Good quality razors, for my wife, daughter, and myself.2. Price is reasonable, if you are on subscribe & save plan.CONS:1. Pricey if not using Amazons "Subscribe & Save".2. Can find cheap at your local discount stores.I used Amazons Subscribe and Save for the easy of use since my family uses razors at a regular interval. I hate shopping at the brick & mortar discount stores.
