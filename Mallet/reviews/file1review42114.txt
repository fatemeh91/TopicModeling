review/text: Oh how I wish I had known about this a month ago! This is my new favorite pregnancy item - I just got it at 38 weeks after having pain from a torn abdominal muscle, about three inches across just to my right of center, due to the weight of my bundle-of-joy-to-be, and I now have much less pain from the muscle pulling. It's awesome and surprisingly comfortable! I wonder if I had started using it earlier if I could have prevented the problem in the first place, but I'll try that out next time. I'm quite small and only gained about 25lbs, but the force from how concentrated the weight gain has been put a lot of strain on those muscles. The belts might work just as well if back pain is your issue, but for me, I wanted the straps to give added "upward" support.A couple of things that keep this from being 5 stars despite the comfort and benefits - the elastic material is quite itchy and the whole apparatus needs to be worn over a layer of clothing (and then, of course, under another). The straps are especially itchy and would benefit from a softer backing. But, once over a tank, it's relatively comfortable.The second issue is that it would be nice if the straps were adjustable or detachable. It shows under a lot of shirts because the cross in the front makes the straps come close to my neck. It would be nice to be able to pull those over to the outside - old man suspender style - so that I could make a choice based on my clothing but still keep the support. Or, the belt might be enough early on, so it could work to have them be detachable. Maybe after this one is born, I'll make some adjustments with my sewing machine to make that an option : )But, all in all, this is a great product I would highly recommend.
