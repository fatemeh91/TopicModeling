review/text: I love having bibsters - they're great for going out, and going to the grandparents house....just make sure you get the right size. I usually buy them in the store, but this time I bought them online. I didn't realize that there were two sizes, and I bought the small size (I thought the "small" meant a smaller box). Not a huge deal - they still fit, but the larger bibsters would have been better for my 20-month old....they are awesome, though!
