review/text: I purchased this slide viewer for my dad so he could review his many many slides and decide which one to forward to an old friend who is writing a history of the area where a lot of the slides were taken. My dad is elderly and has sight issues but he could see each slide clearly and determine where is was taken. The item was described accurately and the delivery was prompt.
