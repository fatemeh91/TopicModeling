review/text: My husband came home from the hospital two days after knee replacement surgery. He was able to walk with a walker, and the pain was tolerable. THEN...he had to go to the bathroom. It hurt him SO BADLY to sit down that it took him 30 minutes to muster the strength to stand up. I immediately ran to my computer and started researching elevated toilet seats. Ray is a large man so he had some specific requests. He wanted something that had side handles and preferred handles that had legs down to the ground. He NEEDED an extra wide space in which to sit. This Tall-Ette seat was just the key. He had installed a 2" taller toilet just 4 months earlier...so, we did have to place some pieces of wood underneath the legs on the floor to ensure stability since they did not quite reach the ground without them. The actual opening could be a little bit larger for him as he still has difficulty urinating with this seat while sitting, but this has been a lifesaver for him. He's now 5 weeks past surgery--but will be having the OTHER knee replaced in another 4 weeks...so, we will be using this seat for another two to three months at least. Finally, I must add that being an Amazon Prime customer is FANTASTIC. I could not find this seat (or anything comparable) in any stores locally, and I only had to pay $3.99 for NEXT DAY shipping with Amazon Prime. I ordered it at 3 pm (pacific time) on Wednesday....and we had it before noon on Thursday. THANK YOU AMAZON!!
