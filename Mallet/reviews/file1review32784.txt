review/text: After giving in to the suggestion to try Slim Fast for weight loss, I bought this item on Amazon, because the price was far and away the best I could find, and I figured I'd be using it for a while. I was not impressed. I tried to stick to the plan as suggested on the can, but I found myself starving most of the day, and ravenous by dinner time, even with snacks. I tried modifying it a couple of ways, and ended up actually gaining weight. I was not over-eating. When I stopped using the Slim Fast and just went to an adjusted calorie diet with more protein in the morning (a Weight Watchers style program), I started losing weight again. I think that these shakes contain far too many carbs, and not nearly enough protein, and they are too sweet, and kind of weird tasting. Unfortunately I put myself on the automatic shipment plan and didn't cancel before the second shipment came out. What a pain. I am sure there are people Slim Fast works for. I am not one of them. I just like real food too much.My suggestion is that you go to the local store, if you have one, and buy a can of this stuff to try before you purchase it online. It's a lot easier to return that way. If you just like the taste, this is a great deal.
