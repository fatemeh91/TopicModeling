review/text: For months I have been bothered with excess gas in the abdominal region to the extent that I would not eat as much as I should. I tried everything for an anti-acid person - Maalox, Mylanta, Gas X, all the different varieties of yogurt, probiotics, acidophilus, etc. THEN I read in a Health and Nutrition article that "THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE SAME FOR A PERSON THAT HAS TOO MUCH ACID IN THEIR SYSTEM AS A PERSON THAT HAS TOO LITTLE ACID. The article suggested taking Betaine HCL with Pepsin for too little acid in the stomach. I did that and the rest is history.I found that I could not find the Betaine HCL pills anywhere locally - Walgreens, Walmart, etc. So I went on the internet and purchased them at a great price from AMAZON. After cautiously taking one pill after two different meals, I started passing gas. Now I don't mean just a regular ol' fart, I passed gas like I was letting gas out of a balloon. Before the next meal I already had an increase in appetite. I could go on, but in summary I have found that I need about 70 grains (seven 600mg) of Betaine HCL each day, taking it during each meal (2,2,3). I never (well almost never) belch but sure do a lot of good f--ting. My appetite is now great.
