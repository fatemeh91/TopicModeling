review/text: So secure~truly fits any toilet so snug with its unique adjustable "arms" undearneath. You would never have to worry about your child falling in or it coming off like so many others once you fit it to your seat which takes about 2 seconds and is soo simple. Love it!!! Thanks for a great product!
