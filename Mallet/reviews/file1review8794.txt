review/text: I AM TRYING GREEN VIBRANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. I WILL SAY RIGHT NOW THAT THE TEXTURE AND TASTE OF THE POWDER IS PRETTY GOOD. I USUALLY SHAKE IT UP GOOD AND DRINK IT RIGHT AWAY IN A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE. I HAVE NOT USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO TELL ANY DIFFERANCE IN THE WAY I FEEL. I AM SURE IT JUST TAKES TIME FOR THE BODY TO GET USED TO IT. I WAS PLEASED WITH THE NUMBER AND COMBINATIONS OF NUTRIENTS LISTED ON THE LABEL. I WILL PROBABLY STAY ON IT AT LEAST 2 MORE MONTHS BEFORE I MAKE ANY REAL HEALTH CLAIMS BUT I WILL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH WRITTEN REVIEWS.
