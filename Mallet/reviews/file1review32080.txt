review/text: I don't know what these nay-sayers are talking about, but the tide to go pen has saved my life on numerous occasions. I LOVE this product. I don't think I've ever felt the need to write a review on anything, but this? OBSESSED. I've always been a fan of Tide and they haven't let me down with this little pen of magic. I've gotten out 4 day old coffee stains, pizza sauce stains, and many more. I have no idea what's in this cute little easy to use pen, but I hope they never stop making it!
