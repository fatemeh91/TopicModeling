review/text: Yes, I am writing a review for a sheet protector. I got one of these for my 3 year old who is potty-trained but can't yet make it through the night. I liked it so much I got a second one so when I have to change the sheets in the middle of the night I have one ready to go. I tried the disposable ones but they are noisy and too small. This one is soft and basically feels like a blanket, and yet somehow its super-absorbent.In response to an earlier review: There is a sticker on the package that says its not intended for young children. I think this is because there is a waterproof barrier in the material. So, if your kid wrapped it around his head I could see that it could become a suffocation hazard. However, if you have it layered underneath the bed's fitted sheet, your kid can't get see it or get to it so its not a problem. And if your kid is pulling off his fitted sheet and wrapping a pee-soaked protector sheet around his head, well, you probably have a different problem altogether.
