review/text: I've been taking these pills for a while now. The price is good and I have noticed that it reduces my hunger quite a bit, however one rather large setback is the fact that after I've taken 2 capsules at lunch time, I cannot sleep at all until about 5am. I just lay in bed, wide awake. its not good.
