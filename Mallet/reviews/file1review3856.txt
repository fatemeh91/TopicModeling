review/text: Crest White Strips Premium do do a good job of whitening, but they also made my teeth ultra sensitive. I could not complete them in the instructed 7 days, and instead took over a month to use the strips as my teeth were SO painful! I had to take off days in between use. Hot or cold foods were AGONY on my teeth. I live in Upstate NY & it is winter and the cold air felt very painful. If I use these again it will be in the summertime!
