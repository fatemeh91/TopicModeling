review/text: I really like this trimmer. It seems strong (we'll see how it goes given the batter is new). The charge holds for a long time. I think I haven't charged it in at month or more. Itasn't failed me yet and I use weekly (not a heavy user). I like the ergonomic design -- the shape is rather interesting (apparently for male use :-)). The size of the head is just right for trimming my mustache and gotee.It seems like a solid device. At a good price, I think it's a great value. Would absolutely buy again if I had to do it all over. Would absolutely recommend.
