review/text: I bought this to replace a Conair clipper. I shave my head once every other week, and just need a basic clipper that does the job.My problem is this: when I use the slider to adjust the trimmer height to the closest cut the blades bind and do not move freely anymore. This means that I cant get a close cut. I oil the blades after each use so this is not the problem.Additionally, after having this clipper for only about 6 months I find that it bogs down on some patches of hair. considering that this is only a week or two of growth this is not acceptable.
