review/text: Tweezerman is the only brand of tweezers I will ever use. I have tried many others and they just don't work! These tweezers are very precise for even the smallest hair. I have always used the mini version to save money-I don't feel the need to get the full size. Buy these and don't waste your money on another brand!
