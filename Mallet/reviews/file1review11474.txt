review/text: I got this trimmer to replace another Norelco trimmer which had broken. I have been pleased with both of them. They do a good job for me, and I am pretty particular about the way my beard looks. My first one had a vaccuum feature which caught most of the whiskers, and I liked that better than this one, which has no vaccuum. Overall, i'm happy with this one, though.
