review/text: With so many products on the market to choose from, its trial and error to find a quality product protein powder that actually tastes good. I found this and it does taste fantastic!!. Chocolate Mint mixed with some cold 2% milk...mmm...mmm...good. It tastes just like an ice cream milkshake, but healthy.
