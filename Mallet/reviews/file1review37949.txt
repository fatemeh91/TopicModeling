review/text: I'm a nurse and since I started wearing these during my 12hr shifts its been remarkable how much better I feel! No more insane fatigue and aching in my legs. I don't have varicose veins that I can see, but my job and genetics both spell disaster for me on the vein front. Its made a huge difference for me energy wise at work and once I get home after a long day at work. The pressure 30-40mmHg sounds like a lot, but it is quite comfortable. Just make sure to put these on FIRST thing in the morning or else you might have a hard time getting them on. :) Anyway, buy these, your legs will thank you. I will definitely be buying this product again!
