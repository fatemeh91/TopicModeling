review/text: This product has saved my sanity. I have 3 children who all tend to have accidents at night. One has several per night on average. We've been using these pads for about 2 years and they show no signs of wear. I have washed them almost every night, but usually hang them to dry. I am so happy with the quality of these pads. I highly reccomend them.
