review/text: I woke up with an earache the day after these arrived so I popped in two and by noon, I was no longer symptomatic. The pills themselves went down smoothly and didn't feel like they were just sitting in my esophagus and there were no weird aftertaste belching. I took them for a week just to be safe and I never experienced any other symptoms of illness and no side effects. I like these better than Airborne because they are easier and actually worked for me.
