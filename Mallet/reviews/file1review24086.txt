review/text: I love calgon as much as the next person but there is no way that this little bottle of Calgon is worth $38!!!!This Merchant must be insane... or think the rest of us are insane. This is jacked up at least 5 times higher than what it is worth.I had wanted some because my store was no longer carrying it... but for this kind of highway robbery, I'll drive a couple extra blocks to stop off at Krogers and buy it there. There is no excuse for this kind of fleecing and it should be investigated by Amazon.
