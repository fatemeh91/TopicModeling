review/text: These plates are great. They looked very nice at our reception. We were looking for something cheaper than glass, but nicer than cardboard. We didn't want to chance leaks with rigatoni and salad. These plates were beautiful, they were not at all flimsy and they did not melt with hot rigatoni and chicken alfredo. They were a perfect compliment to the clear plastic tumblers and silverware. :)
