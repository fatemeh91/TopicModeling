review/text: i bought this item as a shower grooming table for my corgi. even though i have a hand held shower head, i needed extra height to shower the underside of my dog. i place the bench length wise in the bathtub and i can easily adjust each leg if necessary. i was unable to find anything remotely useful from dog grooming suppliers. this bench is affordable & perfect for my need.
