review/text: I wanted to review since I saw another reviewer indicated this didn't work for IBS. The tricky thing with IBS is what works for one person doesn't work for another. I've tried a lot of probiotics and prebiotics. The majority of them did not do a thing for me. Of the few that did, this one has worked the best for me hands down. I wish they still made the powder, but the powder in capsule form works too. I've found this product to be especially good in reducing bloating. If you haven't had luck with other probiotics, I would highly recommend this one.
