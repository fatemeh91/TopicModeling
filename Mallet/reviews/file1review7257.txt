review/text: The spa works as advertised and does relax my feet when I use it. The heater works very well. I have size 11 feet and the spa is a little cramp for me. I have about 2 inches of forward and backwards movement so I can't really use the rollers to massage the bottom of my feet. The manual also does not recommend using baths salts because they may clog the jets.
