review/text: My little bear has always been big for his age. I have had a time trying to train him on potty chairs that are way too small(in terms of him splashing and even being bigger than the chair. When I found this and read another review of someone with a big little boy I immediately ordered it. It has been great. He can put the seat off/on the toilet seat himself and is very secure and balanced while going to the potty. He puts the seat up himself on a hook next to the toilet when he is done. I have a little stool he uses to help himself off/on the seat. He is doing great with the potty seat. If you have a little boy who is big for his age, I DEFINATELY reccomend this to youBabyBjorn Toilet Trainer - White/Red
