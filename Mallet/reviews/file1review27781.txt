review/text: I love this product - I add a scoop to my morning smoothie and voila! I have protein in my breakfast for only 120 calories. It has a mild favor (can't taste it much over the fruit) and dissolves well. I'm very happy with this purchase. Its a huge container, so I've shared with friends for the same purpose and they seem to really like it also.
