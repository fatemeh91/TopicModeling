review/text: I have been using this waterproof pad for my son who is potty training for about a year. Was looking for a product to protect his bed at night from accidental bed wetting. After trying several different &#34;waterproof&#34; pads that didn't actually turn out to be waterproor, were too small or that quickly wore out with repeated washings I found this excellent pad. It is a great size for a twin bed - covers the whole area that could possible get wet even with a toddler who wiggles around in his sleep. Pad is very absorbant. Never have had a leak with it. Washes very nicely in the washing machine and dryer. Bought a second one to have available when the first is being washed.
