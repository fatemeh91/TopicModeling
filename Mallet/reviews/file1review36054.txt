review/text: but I'm going to assume that this stuff is doing what it's intended to do. This packaging is a good value since it is 2.2 pounds and is less expensive than its competition. So all in all I'm pretty happy with my purchase.Now, the real secret is how to properly consume this stuff. There seems to be quite a few suggestions floating around as to what liquids work best to mask this gosh awful taste. Here's what I've tried with 2 teaspoons of the mix:-17 ounces water w/ 1 packet orange Hawaiian Punch mix with fake sugar-17 ounces water w/ 1 and 1/2 packet orange Hawaiian Punch mix with fake sugar-I started doing the 1 and 1/2 with various mixtures of the Hawaiian Punch mix...none of these work very well-I've also tried straight water, that was a definite no goHowever, I did find today that 1 teaspoon of the Arginine powder is about 8 ounces of strong orange juice worked very well. Most of the taste of the powder was hidden. The only down side to this is that you have to do this twice a day since the dosage is 2 teaspoon daily. But the way I figure it, any really strong, acidic juice will disguise the Arginine's horrendously intrusive taste well enough to get it down quickly. In fact the OJ with the 1 teaspoon of mix sort of tasted like the beginnings to an Orange Julius, except for the lingering after taste.Anyway, let me know if any of you guys find a better way to down this stuff. I'm interested in trying anything out that would help. Thanks.****UPDATE - So I think I figured out the easiest and most efficient way to take this stuff. A small glass with two teaspoons powder mix, about 2 ounces of water (just enough to take one quick swallow). Then have a second glass with about 3 to 4 ounces orange juice as a chaser. Swig the mix quick then slowly drink the small amount of OJ. Make it quick like a band-aid.
