review/text: This device is not as suggestively shaped and colored as most vibrators, but it seems much more solidly built than the long slim ones. The vibration is firm but not overwhelming, and the twelve little nubbies on the end really get the job done on her. It also uses a standard AA battery, a definite plus. She gives it an A+ !
