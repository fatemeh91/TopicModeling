review/text: This is an amazing shaver. It provides me the closest shave I have ever had from an electric shaver. I have had all the over-priced Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic shavers. I haven't been happy with their performance. This Wahl is the best: it is fast; it shaves close; and it is reasonably priced. However, I would have liked it better if it were a little less louder than it is. But I can live with it. I haven't yet tried the trimmer; so I can't comment on it.If you are in the market for an electric shaver, just get it. You won't be disappointed.
