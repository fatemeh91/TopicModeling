review/text: I have been lifting for about 3 years now (benching about 95lbs when I started) and about a year ago I hit a wall where I could not seem to increase my max anymore. So then about 6 months ago I started using muscle milk, glutamine powder, BCAA pills, and this Creatine Fuel. When Before I started this regimen I was maxing out on the bench at about 185 and just last week I did 245 for the first time and I have increased in pretty much every other area as well. I have also noticed that my arms look and feel much fuller, they are up to 16 inches now and I hope to continue my journey and maybe someday in the next year hit the 300 mark on bench and make good gains in other areas as well.
