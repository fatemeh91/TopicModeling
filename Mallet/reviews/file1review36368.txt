review/text: This stuff works pretty well. Use as they say, it should delay your climax. I've also found that Lanacane (maximum strength) cream also works really well. It's sold in drug stores as an anti-itch cream and it costs less than six dollars for a tube, which is cheaper than this spray. But if you use them together, it works really well and you will definitely be able to last longer than without anything. Put a condom on in addition and you may NEVER get off.
