review/text: This was a good value and the capsules were small enough for me to swallow. I had a lap band installed and I have to be careful about the size of pills, as anything larger than an aspirin can become stuck in my stoma. The vitamins were not expired and had plenty of use time left on them. In the past, I have encountered purchasing vitamins online, only to find I was receiving items that were years over their recommended shelf life. Not so in this case. I was very happy with the product and the value and the fact that they came to me and I didn't have to use gas going out to get them!
