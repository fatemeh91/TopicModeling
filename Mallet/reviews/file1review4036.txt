review/text: I used to get lots of nicks and burns with other razors because of my tough beard. Rotary blades were never able to do a close enough shave. Power Fusion gives me a very smooth shave each and every time I use it. It lasts over 20 shaves without any issue. I just make sure that the blades are dry after each shave. Great buy!
