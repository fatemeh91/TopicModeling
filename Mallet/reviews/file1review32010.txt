review/text: After taking this product, I had to see my cardiologist. It triggered heart palpitations. I'm still getting over them. Look at the ingredients and make sure (if you can) you're not allergic to something in it. There are sooooo many ingredients, I have no idea of which one caused this. Ugh!!! I pray I get back to normal.
