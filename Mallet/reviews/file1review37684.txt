review/text: After trying this solid for a week, I can say that it's truly unscented, unlike other products that claim to be. It kept me fresh all day, but I wouldn't go as far as skipping a day like it says on the packaging. I found the protective dome inside the lid difficult to remove, the knob at the bottom hard to turn, and the stick doesn't glide on either (I had to really work at it). If you have strong hands, it'd be a great choice.
