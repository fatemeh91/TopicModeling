review/text: This product did not work on my skin. I have fair skin with dark spots in some areas. I applied it twice a day (morning and night). After a few weeks I began to notice that this cream was actually making the spots darker. I don't understand why. I am not using any other creams for it to react with and I applied exactly how the directions said. Needless to say, I discontinued use and am highly disappointed. I wish I could get my money back.
