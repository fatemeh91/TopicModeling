review/text: First of all, I'm not a dermatologist, I'm just a heterosexual guy with sensitive skin who has tried many products and done a lot of research in the search of the right products. I offer reviews of Clinique, zirh, menscience, art of shaving and baxter of California, hope my reviews are helpful.The art of shaving has to be my least favorite skincare product line. Their products are over prized, no samples or option of returning products if client is not satisfied is given.I prefer gels, this balm was too irritating and thick. the shave cream is great, so you really don't need it anyways
