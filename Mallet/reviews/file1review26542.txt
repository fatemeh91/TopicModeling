review/text: I bought this in advance of a long car trip. My lower back can get sore after extended drives, even though my car has decent lumbar support and I sit up straight with the seat almost as straight as it will go.The main problem with this as a back support for driving is that it is too large to use and remain sitting straight. Underinflation is an option, but it is not very stable in this configuration, even when driving straight. So my back is more mobile and this actually adds more back strain than it helps (especially when cornering).I will try this in an office chair but I am not optimistic that it will be useful.The valve is the standard one used in cheap water wings and other toys. It works okay but makes inflation/deflation harder than it would be with a good valve (like you'd find on a Thermarest).
