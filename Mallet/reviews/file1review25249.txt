review/text: The battery is good but only lasts about 4 hours but I guess you can't expect more from it. I'm an audio editor and wear these headsets all day and it is only every 4 hours but it seems like I'm always swapping out this battery for a fresh charged one. It would be nice if there was a quick charger for this battery because if you only have 2 then the second one isn't fully charged when you need to change it.
