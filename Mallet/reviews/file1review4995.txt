review/text: Great price on large quantity. I use them on multiple surfaces. Just think through the expected usage you will have. Any such pad will eventually dry out, even sealed in the individual packets. Will surely remain perfect for at least a year. So much cheaper than in smaller packages most often found in drug stores!
