review/text: With baby #1 I had some washable nursing pads that ALWAYS leaked. So I decided to buy some with higher ratings to try it out this time as I'd prefer washable over disposable and since I'm now a stay at home mom it doesn't matter so much if I leak through. So I bought these. Baby #2 isn't even a week old and I'm impressed enough that I'm back to buy more. There are only three sets in each package which I figured wouldn't last me a whole day. But as long as my nipple is behind the pad (and not slipped out) I haven't had a bit of leaking on my shirts. None. And that's with over full (engorged) breasts and LOTS of leaking. Even at NIGHT time I haven't had a problem. And I've been changing them because it's been a lot of time and not because they can't hold more.These keep my nipples dry. They keep my shirts dry. And they certainly aren't dry themselves.I'm back to buy more. And some for a friend too.
