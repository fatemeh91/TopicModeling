review/text: I had a Fusion handle and blade sent to me by the Gillette company to try. I have to say that I am thankful I didn't pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I've ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for "precision" is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can't be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What's next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle? Perhaps reshape your jaw bone to give you that "Executive Look" ?
