review/text: On the product's website, this sells for $36. The book alone is $12.99 on AMZN, so you see why this is a steal! It's has about everything someone would need to travel, even locally. I'm taking it on my trip to France as just the blister supplies (feet) will make it worth bringing.I'm sure these will sell out fast, so get 1 or 2 now.
