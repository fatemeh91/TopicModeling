review/text: I've been going out of my mind trying different deodorants as I'm trying to give up antiperspirants. This is the best I've found so far and I keep coming back to it. I really like the scent, it's a nice rose, not too old lady. However, this does not keep you from sweating, none of them do, so you need to reapply throughout the day. I probably reapply 2-3 times in winter and twice that much in summer. I'm a sweater though, keep that in mind. It's not sticky or tacky nor does it smell like hippy. Oh, also, this will not work with bare underarms, ie with dropped long sleeves/dolman cut or tank tops that are low. If your underarms are just bare with no other material, you'll be sweating & stinking pretty quick & this will not help that much. I've resigned to just use regular deodorant/antiperspirants on those days. You can't win them all.
