review/text: This product came in a plastic zip lock bag. No box and worse no directions. I didn't have a clue, so I called the Accu-Check help line. Had a little hard time convincing them I didn't have THEIR meter, but finally got down to the MultiClix. Well, you can forget alternate site testing. I can stick my forearm all day with this thing and won't draw a drop. I'll go back to my Freestyle and get all the blood I need. Don't buy unless you like sticking your fingers. The lancet cartridges plastered with "Not for Retail Sale" warnings. What's with that?
