review/text: I recently ordered Rainbow Light's Womens Nutritional System multivitamin to see if it was any better than their previous products I used over the years and I am pleased to report that it is working very well. Yes, it requires you to take six tablets a day, but I think it is well worth the effort and I have noticed increased energy, mental clarity and alertness. Not a bad deal for a one month trial run. I will be ordering more soon and am also pleased with the price.Rainbow Light makes superior products from plant based sources and have another winner in this "system". Keep up the good work!Kathy Boyd
