review/text: I actually purchased replacement heads on Amazon after having bought this brush at Target. But I love the product so much that I wanted to add my review here. First of all, the dentist loves my teeth. Apparently I am one of the top patients in the office for oral hygiene (and this was with an OLD FASHIONED toothbrush). I have no cavaties but I do have "staining" in the grooves in the tops of my molars. The dentist explained that it's hard for a toothbrush to get those grooves clean. I then asked him for a toothbrush recommendation and he said Oral B with the "circular" motion. I tried Sonicare in the past but the design was such that water and toothpaste got in a lot of the "parts" and I really had to make sure it was cleaned out after each use (plus... this did not use the motion my dentist recommended). Apparently power toothbrushes have come a long way because this model is a breeze to keep clean and there aren't a bunch of nooks and crannies to rinse out. After about a month, I was inspecting my teeth and noticed..."wait a minute, it's gotten rid of probably 90% of the stains in my molars!" I am completely shocked and impressed. I have not yet been back to the dentist but I can't wait to show him! This is a great product!P.S. I found I actually prefer the smaller head that comes with the toothbrush rather than the larger one. You have much more control with the smaller heads.
