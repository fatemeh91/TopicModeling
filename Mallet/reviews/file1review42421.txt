review/text: I was skeptical when my chiropractor recommended it for minor arthritis pain & swelling. I had tried other remedies that didn't work even after 90 days of diligently dosing. But for $5 it was worth a try. I was amazed when it worked in less than 1 day. I stopped taking it after a few months, and the symptoms returned within a weak. After re-starting the dose, I again experienced relief in less than 1 day.I have found that I can keep the symptoms suppressed by taking only 2 per day instead of the recommended 15 (5 each, 3 times per day). I highly recommend this for anyone suffering minor arthritis pain & swelling.
