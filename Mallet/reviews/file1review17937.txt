review/text: At first I was delighted with FiberChoice . Recently, not at all. I don't know if its the inulin or the magnesium stearate, but FIBERCHOICE seems to produce what I have called a GOOD FEVER (agitated) , even tough it boosts your immune system you might be over the balance line. I have taken 2 a day, and find my self with not to good sleep.I WILL lower my dose and see how it works. Maybe 2 a week. And I'll try some of the other fiber, cause I think fiber is good.I RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE IT ESPORADICALLY.
