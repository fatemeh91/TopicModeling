review/text: Don't get me wrong, these condoms make it feel as if you're not wearing anything if there's enough lubricant. The problem is, the second you start getting a little rough and start deep thrusting, these things break easily. I've had them break on me three times. They are also a little tight. I threw mine away. I'll be sticking with Trojan.
