review/text: I play the piano a lot and these gloves help quite a bit. I am able to play much longer periods of time without my hands hurting. Works good for typing and driving also. Pretty durable. I only hand wash, but I have had no loose threads or wearing as of yet. If your hands get cold due to low circulation, then these will work great for you.
