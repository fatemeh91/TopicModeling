review/text: My mom had heard from her best friend who is a good family friend about this dishwasher cleaner and how when she and her husband bought their new dish washer recently they were given this to use. She gave a little bit of it to my mom to try on our dish washer and it worked incredibly well! In fact my mom liked it so much that she had me order some for her! OUr good family friend also reccommended we try a washing machine cleaner too! Both products are really great and clean the machiens nicely!
