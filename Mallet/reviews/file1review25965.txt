review/text: This stuff is pretty damn good. I started out on Barbasol and eventually traded up to Edge gel. This stuff is really miles better. Somehow it makes shaving easier, similar to the feeling you get when you pop in a new blade. It actually isn't as expensive as it seems, because you don't use as much per shave.
