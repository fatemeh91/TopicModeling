review/text: We had a cheapo toilet-top seat before this -- it was messy, pee shield too low, had a rough edge which hurt my son. This cost two-three times as much, but MAN is it better! It's awesome -- easy to clean, pee shield tall but safe, comfy for him to sit on... and we're finally making potty training progress! I HIGHLY recommend this seat.
