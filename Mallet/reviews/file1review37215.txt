review/text: These are excellent support gloves. They cover all of my finger joints. Be sure to measure your size on the chart next to the picture for best fit. Mine fit perfect, but I can not wear them all day because of chaffing in bewteen index finger and middle finger where the finger webbing comes together. Other than the irritation, it is a great glove to keep swelling down. It is also ok to type with. I would recommend this to a friend. I have hand washed mine and dripped died it and it fit the same, plus it smelled beter. Another draw back is when you first get the gloves, over a few days they will start to smell a little,I have kept mine clean and dryed, and contrubuited the funny smell to the newness of the glove. I have washed the gloves since then and I have not experienced any problems. When I put my gloves on I can immediatley fell the joint swell. The gloves will bring the swelling down because when I remove the gloves I could feel the joints going swelling back. So at first the gloves push the swelling back and keeps the sweliing down until the gloves comes off. I use mine to keep the multiple gangloin cyst that riddle my joints from swelling. I would also like to mention the glove does a good job in supporting the wrist joints-My 2 cents-Drema
