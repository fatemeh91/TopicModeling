review/text: We have a mountain cabin and fight an ongoing battle with jellow jackets, wood borer bees, jap hornets, and red wasps. The raid wasp spray is the only one which kills instantly, literally knocking them out of the air. The other brands have air and foam which blows in the wind, and does not kill. The raid shoots a stream of liquid and kills instantly. Seems to have more in the can than the foamy ones.
