review/text: This toothbrush head does all of the work. Good for people who scrub too hard with the traditional toothbrush, therefore damaging your teeth (that is what my dentist told me the problem I had), eletric toothbrushes like this one prevent you from brushing too hard, and more efficient. Teeth feel really clean after using this toothbrush heads.Price wise, it is much cheaper than the price in local drug store, plus you don't need to pay sales tax here, big saving.
