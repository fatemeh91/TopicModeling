review/text: I eat breakfast at work and was looking for a way to take my morning meds & vitamins to work (about 5 pills). At first I thought I would be stuck with one of those large 7 day pill caddys, but then I saw this little gem. Being able to take only the pills I need for that day is so convenient and it's shape is great for slipping into a pocket or a bag without being bulky or uncomfortable.
