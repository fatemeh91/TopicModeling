review/text: It works great for the first 6 months, but than it begins to become more weak. I found I had trouble with it holding a charge or the speed of the blade. The plastic pivot points used to open the head for cleaning are weak, mine broke earlier this week after 9 months of sporadic use. Was actually going to buy another one until I saw the price is now 25$. I'll hold off or buy a different kind.
