review/text: I am always looking for nutrition snack bars that will help me refuel after workouts, curb between meal hunger pangs, and hopefully, taste great, too! I was encourged by the nutritional profile of the Zone Perfect bar, and I decided to give the Fudge Graham variety a try. This bar comes in at 210 calories, with 7 grams of fat (4 saturated, 0 trans), 21 grams carbs, 1 gram fiber, and an excellent 16 grams protein. The Fudge Gramam flavor has a nice texture--sort of like a Rice Crispie treat--and is covered in a fudge coating, but this had a bit of an artificial taste to me. In addition, I didn't detect any graham flavor, which I found disappointing. The bar did taste good, but I've also had better (the Pria Complete Peanut Butter Crunch are really delicious!), and I would've liked to see more fiber as well. Overall, this is not a bad choice, but keep in mind that there may be better options available.
