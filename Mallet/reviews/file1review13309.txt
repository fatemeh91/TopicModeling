review/text: My 3.5 yr old daughter has graduated to big-girl underwear and to a big-girl bed but like all good little toddlers every once in a while she has an ooops! and it's a real pain to change sheets and full size underpad at 3:30 with a wet screaming kid standing next to you.I looked around and saw the very expensive radio controlled pads that alert you in your bed when your child has wet her bed.....save the money, I can 100% assure you that if your kids wets their bed, you will 100% know about it within 10 to 15 minutes (there will be wimpering, wailing, screaming, or you'll get a visit to your bedside demanding the problem be fixed).I decided against the disposable padsChampion Blue Disposable Underpads (Chux), Large Size 23 x 36, Pk/25because they weren't big enough and my toddler tosses around like a fish out of water and wanted something with more substance, that would be more durable, and that would feel more like a sleeping material vs a paper pad.I decided against a digital device likeWet Call Bed-Side Bed wetting Alarm with Padbecause it's too expensive, too small, and just has an alarm (My 3year old is a great alarm, trust me!)So I saved the money and bought 2 of these pads for half what it would cost me to buy some digital pad that is difficult to wash.PROS TO THIS- 34 x 52 makes them big (they fit perfectly across my daughter's full size bed)- 34 x 52 makes them also fit lenghtwise perfectly on a twin size bed- bleachable (now that's smart - given the use for these)- machine washable and machine dryable- soft cotton feel to the pad, you can tell that you can wash these multiple times- nice storage bag with metal button latchesCONS- none that I can see
