review/text: I have suffered from constipation for most of my life.in my lifestyle i include excersise, extra water, fruits, veggies but it doesnt cut it. kefir helped for a while, and so did pearls(acidophilus, but it gets expensive. my boyfriend got me this tea, and i can say it works, but for me it still causes cramps and discomfort, not as bad as exlax, ducolax, etc. For me it takes between 12-16 hrs to take effect, on a full 10-15 minute steep. the taste is not bad, mildly sweet. I like that its natural. i will finish the pack, mostly for when i feel bloated and need the extra help but i think ima stick to my other tea, rose petals, or in spanish, TE DE CASTILLA. that is what my mother would give me when i was a baby, and it helps keep me regular as long as i take it daily.
