review/text: I take emergen-C as soon as I get some symptoms that are precursors to flu, cold, cough etc. Based on anecdotal evidence in my family, I feel emergen-C is indeed very effective in putting a stop to flu and cold in the early stage. However, you do need to take other reasonable measures at the same time to make effective use of it, like rest well, drink enough water etc. I keep a couple of boxes of this at home at all time. It's well worth the money.
