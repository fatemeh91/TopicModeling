review/text: I really like this fade cream. I am african american with acne scars all over my face. I am brown skin so the scars stand out. I have been using this product for several months and have seen good results. Since I don't want my skin that isn't scarred whiten I use the end of a q-tip with the cotton taken off to only apply the cream on the scars. I do this morning and night and apply a sunscreen. You must have patience and do it regularly but it works. My scars are fading.
