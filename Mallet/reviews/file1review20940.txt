review/text: With the included remedies costing about $2 each, you can't go wrong. As far as the case, I didn't mind inserting my own remedies, alphabatizing them, etc. But it has all those single-dose slots that reduce the amount of real remedies it can hold, and all in all, it just doesn't quite do the trick.Don't get me wrong-- I have this on a subscription order and order these for friends and family all the time. By far the most economical way to start a homeopathic collection.Just wish I knew a great way to store remedies....
