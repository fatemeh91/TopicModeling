review/text: We bought the 90 tablet pill version (these are solid pills) from a GNC and they worked well. They do smell a bit and where somewhat hard to swallow, but we started using them at any sign of a cold. We never had any side effects. Recently, we bought the 240 capsule size (these are made with a soft gell capsule) via AMAZON as the savings vs the pills was almost 50%.My wife and I both experienced abdominal pains after taking these capsules. We tested this several times and each time we had the same low grade abdominal pain. It was almost as if your inards where inflammed. It wouldnt last very long, but it was obviously from the gell capsules. We bought the 90 tablet pills again from GNC and did not have any problems with the product.I am not sure why we would have pains from the capsule vs the pills for the same product, but these are my recommendations.1) Make sure the reseller is an authorized reseller for Source Naturals. They list the vendors on their web site [...] This will prevent any, potentially dangerous, knock offs getting in your hands.2) Before you buy, ask for the shelf life of the product you receive. We bought the 240 capsules and the shelf life was only a few months. If you buy the pills from a store, you can see the expiry date is much longer.3)Buy the pills vs the capsules. They may smell and may be harder to swallow, but I believe they are better for you. The counter argument may be they dont break down as fast, but capsules can spoil faster than solid pills and could also be more easily tampered with.4) If you encounter any pains. STOP taking this product and see your doctor. Dont forget to take the tablets with you for your check up. Wellness Products should not cause any pains or discomfort.Be well.Sincerely,Andreas
