review/text: I've used another very nice shower gel for years, and I'm still a fan. However, I saw this while browsing around the Alba section and figured I'd give it a try. What great stuff! It has a wonderful lavender scent--perfect for a shower before bedtime--and it cleans well without drying out my sensitive skin. I'll be a repeat customer!
