review/text: I love this product! I have always had trouble with tweezers, because my hands shake and hair tend to slip out of the grip of the cheap tweezers I would get at the drug store. With these, I get a hair in one try! It cuts down my grooming time quite a bit, and is also a really convenient size for carrying in a purse or bag.
