review/text: As a long-time, humble sufferer of psoriasis, I hesitate to make any sweeping claims, but this stuff took away the scales. It isn't greasy, and apparently it just takes a small dab. After about ten days of application the itching and redness were gone. I feel great. I've been beaten down lots of times over the years, so I know the outbreaks can return. To you fellow sufferers out there though, I'd say this stuff is worth a try. In my area it wasn't available through the outlet pharmacies (Walgreens, CVS, and the like) so ordering through Amazon seems a good solution.
