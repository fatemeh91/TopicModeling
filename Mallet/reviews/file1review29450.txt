review/text: Just what I was looking for. This pillow has a buckwheat-like filling (it sounds and feels like). The fragance packet- I was skeptical of. I hate synthetic fragrances, but I believe this is a natural scent with herbs. It's really nice and it is removable. It's just a satchel slipped into a little pocket. What's good about the filling is that you can kind of move it around to get it where you need it to be comfortable. Great product, great price, free shipping. I definitely would recommend buying this product!
