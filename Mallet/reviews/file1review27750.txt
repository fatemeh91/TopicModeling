review/text: I used to spend lots of money buying meat and other items high in protein at the grocery store in order to get the necessary amount of protein for weight lifting. The problem with doing that is that for one you are spending a lot of money, and the second problem is that there is a lot of fat in meat. I have been using a 2 lb of this product for 1 month and I am already loving it and seeing results. I have blown away my old max in bench press! I love this stuff because it tastes good and has no fat! Also, if you're interested it seems like Optimum Nutrition thoroughly researches all of their products and tests them for quality assurance. That is something I can really respect about a supplement company.
