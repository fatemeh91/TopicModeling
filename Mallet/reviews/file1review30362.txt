review/text: Around here, there's only one larger condom brand commonly available - the Trojan Magnum (which smells strongly, gets somehow both gloppy lubey and overly dry, etc etc etc). And to mail order just one condom of each type, with no idea as to what types to order, seems a little foolish. This condom sampler worked out really well, and with three of each kind in there, really lets you get a feel for what you might want. Plus, sampling stuff is just fun!Also, customer service from them was great.
