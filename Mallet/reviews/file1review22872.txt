review/text: I have to do this...I have had this sweeper since April; and I am still IN LOVE with it! I ordered it just for the `helluvit' because I could not find a good, cheap vacuum for my nasty pseudo hardwood floors and outdoor rug. I figured for $24.00 I couldn't go too far wrong. The handle was a challenge...(I never did see any directions) but I finally just `hammered' it into the sweeper...and believe me, it is in there for good. This little sweeper has paid for itself to times over..I can't believe how well it picks up ON THE RUG ; it's very true that it does not do well at all on the hard floors, or lino. but, again, for $24 it's worth it...I go over the indoor/outdoor rug every 2-3 days, and I am amazed at the cat hair it picks up, cat hair I don't see at all. (dark patterned rug, gray cat) and my little area rugs as well. I just put them on the bigger rug, so they don't slide.I'm going to order a new one, with dual brushes...for two reason, 1. because I read that the brushes can be removed, (mine can't) 2. because something this inexpensive, and this all around GOOD, I'm afraid might disappear. Hurray for the Bissell Sturdy Sweeper! Let me add this: The more Good, Functional 'non-electric' 'non-battery' appliances I have, the happier I am! No Bells and Whistles necessary. I think this is (my) way of the future..(what I have left of it, at 70!)Anyway, It lives up to it's name.
