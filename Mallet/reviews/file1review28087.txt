review/text: I use this as a post-workout and sometimes between meal protein source. The taste is pretty good, not really like vanilla ice cream but definitely very vanilla. I like to mix it with bananas for a breakfast smoothie, the two work well together. The artificial sweeteners aren't great, and I would prefer something that didn't have so many artificial ingredients, but I haven't found a natural options that tastes better. It's still very drinkable and also mixes very well in a blender bottle or a blender. The price for the 10 pound bag makes it a very competitively priced option for anyone who plans on incorporating this a whey protein source into their diets.
