review/text: I got this as a gift for Christmas after getting fed up with my old Wahl beard trimmer. I have to admit that the magazine ads sold me on this product, and I kind of regret that. But it's not without it's good points.The good:-The beard trimmer works fine and trims quickly and precisely.-Quick charging-Extremely easy to clean, and can be rinsed with water.-Shave in the shower.-An acceptably close shave, but not the best you could get from an electric.The bad / the ugly:-A charge doesn't hold for very long...several shaves at most. Luckily it charges back up to full capacity again in an hour.-Shaving can take FOREVER because this razor simply REFUSES to cut some hairs, no matter how much you run over them. Most of the time I get so frustrated that I just switch to my Norelco.-It feels like you're holding a lawnmower, and it's almost as loud.-There are only two settings on the beard trimmer attachment: fairly long (for my goatee), and really short.-I experienced much more razor burn with this razor than with my previous ones.All in all, this razor will work great for you if you want an easy cleaning beard trimmer. But if you are looking for something to shave your face with quickly, look elsewhere. I highly recommend Norelco razors, as mine has lasted me six years on one set of razor heads and still outperforms this Braun.
