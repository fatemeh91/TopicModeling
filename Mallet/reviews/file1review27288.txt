review/text: Gold Standard packs a lot of protein into a single scoop, so you don't have to mix a ton of powder. I have been using the chocolate flavor for three years, but I have recently switched over to the banana flavor. Not only does it taste much better (to me), but it mixes more completely with the milk. As for results, this protein powder has assisted me in moving from 147 pounds to 172 pounds over the last three years of working out.
