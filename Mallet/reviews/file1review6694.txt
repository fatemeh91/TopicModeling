review/text: This is a sturdy piece of plastic with pointed tips that can certainly be used for a lot of different things, but don't expect to get some amazing massage to the pressure points on your back and shoulders from this device. Sure, you can use it to massage the back, just as you can use any pointed device to do the same (broom handle for example) but there is nothing about this device that does anything different. Be careful though - it's very easy to bruise the body with the hard plastic points. The instructions say use no more than 10-20 seconds in one area, but I would say even less than that.I will give them credit for creating an interesting conversation piece however, as everyone who looks at it immediately asks "what is it"?
