review/text: The device works good, though it's not big enough for penises of average girth. Even if you are less than 2.5 inches in diameter, the vacuum force engorges your penis to slightly larger than your normal size in order to achieve an erection. Another gripe I had, was the price of the replacement select tension rings. $20 a piece! The one that came with it didn't last me but a couple of months. I could go for a pack of 3 for $20, but 1? That's unacceptable for me.If you can get around the price of the rings and the small tube size, then it may be a good purchase for you.
