review/text: My husband who is 95 and has just had surgery on his foot was told not to get it wet! Yes you can try to tape a bag on the leg etc. etc. But it's risky. I trawled through Amazon looking for a product that he could use for the week or so that he would be unable to get in the shower. There are many, but with this foam, the reviews were excellent. And for good reason! It works! My husband who loves his shower, was more than pleased and satisfied. He said it made him feel clean, truly clean and easy to use everywehre. I can't say enough good about this product. So helpful and so easy and so affordable. Bless Amazon for carrying it.
