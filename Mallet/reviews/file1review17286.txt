review/text: I would not recommend this trimmer if you expect to get clean edges. For short haircuts you need to go over the same area many times in different directions. I also don't like battery operated trimmers, as when the battery dies, you need to need to replace the battery. In this case you can't do that, you need to pay the manufacture to replace the battery. Buy one with a cord.
