review/text: The product description for this item said no sweeteners, that was the primary reason I went with this brand. Beware, fructose is the second listed ingredient! It's super sweet tasting, too sweet really. My kids love it and I'm going to use the whole bottle, but I'll be buying an actual sugar-free vitamin-C next time.
