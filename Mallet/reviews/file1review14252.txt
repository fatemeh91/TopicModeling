review/text: I enjoy the flavors apple/peach. I have been ill and pretty much living off the stuff for 4 months and I axtually look forward to my next one.My only complaint is I have been out of work with very little money coming in and I have to use the free shipping to make it worth my while with Walmart.Apple will get to me alot faster than the peach. Look forward to at least 3 weeks for Apple and 6 to 7 weeks for PeachThank you Amazon for carring the product.Lee Oliver
