review/text: I brought this kit after a recommendation from my chiropractor. I had been using homeopathy to help get my son over a fever and sinus infection and had used oscillococcinum to treat the flu in my boyfriend, with great success. I wanted to save money and late night trips to whole foods so decided to purchase this kit. I'm very happy with it!
