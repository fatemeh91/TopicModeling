review/text: Pros: Heavy Duty (has the feel of equipment rather than a toy). Nice big size. Moist heat is nice. Every indication is it will last a long time, Though we have only had ours a couple of months.Cons: Size though listed in pros, can be a con in some cases. I figured that bigger was likely better , not always true, consider the medium size as well. It is much closer to a normal heating pad size. The Manuel (dead man switch) on this model must be gripped in your hand to keep it on, so if you go to sleep it turns off. This is a necessary safety feature because this baby does get hot. And turning it on and off is the only way to control the heat. So no real temp control. It is designed to put out a very warm 180 degrees and that is what you get.At first I rated it 3 stars. But then I realized it was because maybe what we needed was just a heating pad and not a therapy appliance. It does exactly what it says it does and just by handling it you will know it is well built. If you want timers, temperature controls and so forth you may wish to look elsewhere.
