review/text: I really like Oster buzzers. I bought this replacement blade because T trimmer dropped onto the tile floor and chipped off 5 teeth. I was worried there might be alignment issues but it was VERY easy to switch out. This is a great blade, but unlike some reviews say, a razor is still needed to clean up nice and close. This is of course expected though. Only a razor can do a razors job.
