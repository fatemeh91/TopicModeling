review/text: First off: the order went in on the 14th and it arrived on the 15th. That's fast!Secondly: After un-boxing it and setting it up, I tried it. It works. It's that simple. Cat hair, dog hair, pieces of paper (a real test) all got swept up in a couple of strokes. Then I got the big surprise: the combs inside the dustpans are metal, not plastic! That means they will last a very long time. My previous sweeper had plastic combs and after six years they were worn out; not this one! I tried it out on some cat hair on a carpet and in half a dozen passes it was gone. Similarly, Husky hair on the floor was swept up in one pass. This sweeper is good!Note: it is small. It's about 9 inches wide and sweeps about an 8 inch swath. It is not for large jobs. It only has one brush, not two. So what. Carpet sweepers are for little jobs, for small cleanups; and this one does excellently. I'll use it to spot areas in a given room that need quick cleaning. If you need to do a whole room, use a vacuum; you'll be happier and the job will be better done.Note: This sweeper comes with a plastic brush comb. It's been my experience these last about two months if you use the comb each time you use the sweeper or when you empty the pans. When the comb dies, just get a cheap coarse tooth comb and continue. The brush(es) need to be kept free of hair and other stuff or they will clog and cease to work. Keep the brush(es) clean and your sweeper will do its job properly. Let the brush(es) get clogged with stuff and you may have to cut the matted stuff out of the sweeper which is not a fun thing to have to do. This is doubly important with sweepers that use plastic combs; dust is abrasive and plastic combs can turn into plastic lumps if you don't maintain the brush(es) properly.
