review/text: I had been battling a terrible skin yeast rash that would not go away for over a month. The topical anti-fungal creams were doing a good job, but the rash would pop up in different places, all over my body.It seemed like an endless battle.My doctor gave me an oral prescription of Diflucan (powerful anti-fungal)that I took for weeks to no avail.Read how Allicin, what this product is made of kills fungus. I took about 10 of these Garlinase pills per day... 2 in the morning, 2 in early afternoon, 2 in late afternoon..etc.I saw improvement within 2 days. After a week of taking Garlinase (10 pills/day), the rash was completely gone.I highly recommend this Garlic supplement.
