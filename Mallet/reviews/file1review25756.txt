review/text: Interspersed throughout the comments for this product is the occasion person whose product broke shortly after purchase. I am one such person.The groomer worked very well and I was excited to have it, but it stopped working (meaning that it still ran but the blades did not cut any hairs) after about 3 uses. Yes, I cleaned it out and checked to see if anything was clogged or wrong with it. For some reason it whirred but would simply no longer trim hairs at all. No, it was not because my hair was so dense or thick that it ruined the device.Although it was only $15 I was hoping for a longer-lasting product. I would suggest shopping around a bit more if you are in the market for this type of device.
