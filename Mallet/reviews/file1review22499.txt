review/text: I have tried many vitamins over the years--including the big names like One-A-Day, Centrum, GNC vitamin packs--and they all made me jittery and made me feel like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. After doing some research and talking to my doctor, I learned that some people have an adverse reaction to the fillers they use in vitamins.I bought Nature's Plus-Source of Life for the first time in January 2011, a month after I started a new intense exercise plan that left me very tired/drained. These vitamins did the trick! After a few days of taking them, I felt a renewed energy and have NO adverse side affects!! I started out taking two a day and when I had no side affects, I increased it to three a day, which I still take. I used to get sick all the time with whatever ailment was going around. Since I started taking these, I've rarely gotten sick.A little more expensive than the big brands you can buy at Target/Walmart, but WELL worth it!
