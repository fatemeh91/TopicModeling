review/text: I've been taking Oxy Powder for 3 days, following all the prescribed recommendations (including the healthy diet). I don't know how it works for other people, but for me it causes a very obvious diarrhea. It makes me go to the restroom a couple of hours after I eat anything, I clearly see the pieces of what I ate in what comes out. I feel dehydrated (in spite of drinking lots of water), dizzy, and have a very bad headache. Will not take it any more and will call them tomorrow to request a refund.This bad experience also made me browse for medical research article on colon cleansing. Surprisingly, I could not find any.... On the contrary, it seems that our colon is typically nice, pink and clean, and no doctors or pathologists have ever observed a mucous plaque or anything of this kind. So I am not sure whether to trust the whole industry of colon cleansing products in general...
