review/text: Our son is now 9 months old and we have used this changing pad since birth. We have been happy with it. We actually keep it tucked under the coffee table for when we change him in the living room. We havent had any problem with it leaking through. On those occasions when he has &quot;suprised&quot; us between diapers, the pad has wiped clean easily with a wipe.I had origionally bought it to keep in a diaper bag, but most come with their own pads anyway, so we never needed to. I think it would be a bit large for a diaper bag.
