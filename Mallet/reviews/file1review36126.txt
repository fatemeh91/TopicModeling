review/text: I bought this lighter for use as a torch for soldering and other such uses. I don't smoke. The description above tells you that it has a lock to keep it on for continuous flame. What it does NOT tell you is that the directions say "Do Not use continuous flame for more than 30 seconds." I have ruined a few nice lighters before by keeping them on too long. I bought this lighter specifically because I thought it wouldn't have this limitation. Needless to say, I'm disappointed.Futhermore, the lighter I received was damaged in shipping. It was sent in a padded envelope rather than a box. It appears that someone may have dropped something heavy on it and cracked the plastic fuel tank. As a result, it leaks badly and can't be used. I haven't bothered trying to get it replaced as it is not a manufacturing defect and so won't be covered by warranty. Besides, it doesn't serve my purposes anyway.I gave it 2 stars anyway because if you wanted to light a cigar and got a lighter that was undamaged, it would probably do nicely. However it is a bit on the bulky side for carrying in your pocket.Update. I superglued the crack in the tank and it seems to hold gas fine, though I don't entirely trust it. The lighter does work well but there's no way I would carry it in my pocket with the suspect tank.I just discovered that you can find torches on Amazon by searching "soldering torch". Curiously, there are a number of torches that look very similar to this lighter that claim to be suitable for soldering. I'm not sure how much I trust them now.
