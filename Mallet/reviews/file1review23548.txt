review/text: I looked a long time both in stores and online for a magnification mirror that would work for me. I wanted one tall enough so I didn't have to bend over to look into it--got it. I wanted quality--got it, I wanted versatility (three different magnifications)--got it, and I especially wanted it to be bright enough to be useful--got it. And it looks really nice on my bathroom counter. You will love the oval shape. This is one of the better products of its kind on the market. Can't go wrong!
