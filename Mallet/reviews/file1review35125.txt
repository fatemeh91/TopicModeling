review/text: This is the first pair of graduated stockings that have worked for me. I have problems bending so getting these stockings on and off isn't the easiest thing in the world to do. The material that this particular pair is made of seems to be more durable and breathable than others that I have tried. When I go to take them off, they don't cling to my leg as much. Others seem to have almost a rubbery cling when trying to remove. I bought a second pair as soon as I tried the first one and found that they worked great.
