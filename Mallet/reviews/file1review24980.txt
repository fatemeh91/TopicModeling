review/text: I am still breastfeeding my son at 17 months and didn't have my period back yet. I wanted to get it back so that we could start trying for our second. I had no sign of my period coming back. Within 2 weeks of taking fertilaid I felt like I was PMS-ing and I was! I got my period just 2 weeks after taking fertilaid. Here's the catch- I was having really strange side effects like dizziness and cramping so I decided to go off fertilaid because I didn't like how I felt. That's when I got my period. I am not going to take it again because of the negative side effects but I will say that it is powerful stuff because it brought my period back after over 2 years of not having it.
