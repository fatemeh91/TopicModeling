review/text: I decided to give my opinion as a 5-Star review because this product does exactly what it is supposed to do. The price, including delivery, is much less than getting it at the local store.If the review stars were for taste alone, I'd make them give me 5 Stars for allowing this stuff anywhere near me. Have you ever tasted, or even smelled this mass of gooeyness? If you like things that taste super sweet, buy a big truckload of this product. If not, get it really, really cold- pinch your nose shut & drink quickly. Now, go brush your teeth.
