review/text: My family have been Glade users for a very long time. Even though some of the scents aren't the same as they used to be, we have found a new favorite!! I cant speak to if anyone else would like it but lord knows we LOVE IT! Its very refreshing its not too strong, its not watered down. It does take care of any smells from cooking, etc. It's awesome. Glade please never change this one!!!!
