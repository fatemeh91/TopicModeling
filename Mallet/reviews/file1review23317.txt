review/text: Other reviewers have noted that the handle tends to come apart. It does. Whether your solution of choice is tape, double sided tape, epoxy, or a welding torch you're going to do something to keep this thing from coming apart. Otherwise, with frequent use it will eventually, no matter how hard you jam the sections together.There is also, on mine, a problem with the dust compartments opening on a schedule of their own choosing and sending an accumulated bundle of dust and debris into the room.I haven't found anything better so I put up with it. I'm getting the torch and the brazing rods out tomorrow.
