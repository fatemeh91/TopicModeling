review/text: I think the razors were superb. First, I have to say, they have an easy grip with no slipping at all. They gave a close shave and left my skin feeling very smooth, and I got no nicks or cuts. I was also able to use the same razor quite a few times before having to dispose of it. I would definitely buy these.
