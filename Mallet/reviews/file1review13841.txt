review/text: I LOVE this massager. It is flexible. lightweight, easy to use and I could drift to sleep using it. Tried the rigid massagers and they just didn't work at all. I need massage and heat in tmy lumbar/sacro region and this one works like a dream. I can use it in my recliner or even stretched out on the sofa or in bed. I was in severe pain from a chronically bad back and after a few days if using this, my back was almost back to normal.
