review/text: The back pack is a great idea, but seems to work better for heat than for cold. A minute or two in the microwave makes it piping hot and the heat lasts for some time... Hours and hours in the freezer and only a few minutes of cold on the back. A little disappointing that way, but the heat factor is worthwhile.
