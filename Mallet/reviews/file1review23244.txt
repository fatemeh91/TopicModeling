review/text: The broom itself functions absolutely perfectly. Push it around the room and prepare to be surprised by the amount of debris you pick up. I have two dogs who have dedicated their lives to bringing in leaves and sticks from the back yard and shredding them on the living room carpet, and this sweeper takes care of that without a problem....but then you have the handle. It's 4 pieces of enamel-coated tubing that need to be stuck together to make the complete handle. The weird thing is that there's no way to join them securely. They don't screw together, they don't twist and lock into place, they just push together, one tube inside another. It relies on friction only to keep them together, so they come apart shockingly easily. It amazes me that Bissel designed such a great piece of equipment, but then decided to ignore the part that allows you to use it while standing.My solution was as simple as could be. Once the handle broke apart in the center I unscrewed it from the base, stood it up, and pounded on the top with a rubber mallet. It hasn't come apart since.Overall, I love this sweeper.
