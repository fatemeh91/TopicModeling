review/text: I had the previous generation MB-35 that worked fine for a couple years, until it could no longer hold a decent charge. I got to the point where I was charging it every night, and that's just no good. So I bought this MB-200. It is just as amazing as the model it replaced, and then some. Solid fit and finish, holds a robust charge, and meets/exceeds expectations.
