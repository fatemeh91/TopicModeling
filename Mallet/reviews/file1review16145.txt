review/text: This case is really awesome - it's bright and colorful, and pretty toughly made.Since it's vinyl, it's easily cleaned - it lives at the bottom of my bag, but it looks as clean as the first day that I got it. The zipper sticks a bit, and the stitching isn't perfect, but I'm sure this will last quite a few years with nice treatment. It holds about 8 tampons and a wipe, plus it's little 'know your flow' cardboard chart.It's fun, get it
