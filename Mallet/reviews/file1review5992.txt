review/text: I have used a standard above-elbow cuff model for many years. They are clumsey and having to do the pumping of the bulb perfectly makes it extra work. When my unit seemed to be giving incorrect readings it got dumped and I got the Omron. Outstanding. Slip it on the wrist (above the wrist joint), push the button, and the device does everything, including recording the readings for later recall. The unit stores in a small case and has no long tubes to bother with. I'm pleased.
