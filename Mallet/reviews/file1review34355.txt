review/text: Well the massage oil has a great flavor and an awesome scent. It lubes up very well and it requires only a small amount to massage the entire body. My only issue with it that keeps it from getting a higher rating is that it leaves a sticky feeling once it begins to dry. It doesn't stay smooth like most higher costing oils. "Get what you oay for." Right. Other than that the product would be great, but that sticky feeling can often kill the mood.
