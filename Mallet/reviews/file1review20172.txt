review/text: This is the second shipment of this item. The critique that I have is concerning the packingof these shipments. Both shipments had leakage of the Cherry juice into the box. These bottlesare plastic and were laid on their sides with other items on top. They could have been individuallybubble wrapped which might have helped. UPS is not gentle with their handling of materialand if liquids aren't properly packed, there will be problems.
