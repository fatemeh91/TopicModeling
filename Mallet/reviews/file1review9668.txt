review/text: This product is beneficial, but may be a little misleading. Can you really identify your baby's heartbeat? It is difficult to hear while listening to "movements". You can hear movements and gurgles. Heartbeats are not what you expect from traditional doppler. On the plus side, the audio play mode that lets you talk to your baby and play music CDs I considered to be beneficial
