review/text: I bought this about a year ago and it tasted delicious. After reading how great pomegranate is for the skin, even slightly sagging skin, I bought it again.This time it is so bitter that I have to add a ton of my NOW Better Stevia to be able to get it down! I can understand that one crop is less sweet than another; but this is so bitter, it tastes as if they also juiced some of the membrane around the juice seeds.Although I did dilute it more than directed as soon as I realized the bitterness, I found that diluting it a great deal more helped decrease the bitterness.As far as the skin goes; yes, there is enough of a difference that I want to be sure to drink some each day. I just want to find a brand that is more consistent in taste.
