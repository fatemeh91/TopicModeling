review/text: The picks are great to get extra plaque out - can't get enough of them... nice before bed ritual.Flossing - with anything like this, stick to the old fashioned way - all flossers like this (any brand) always shred after one or two teeth (if you have tight teeth like mine) and break.The pick function - fabulous.
