review/text: This monitor has nice reporting features and a very small AC adapter but was very inaccurate. I compared it to a Samsung home model we have and to professional equipment at a clinic. It consistenly gave both readings 15-20 too high and once indicated irregular heart beat. It seems from the reviews of most of these home grade monitors that a few people get poorly calibrated machines. I have returned it since accuracy is critical.
