review/text: I just want to start of saying that I had purchased these with the intent of cloth diapering my baby. I had used Gerber flatfolds and prefolds on my first two children back in 2000 and 2002. They were amazingly awesome back in the day, so I'm wondering what on earth happened.These are very thin . . . I mean see through thin. I couldn't even use them as a changing, shoulder or lap pad in a pinch. Any baby "mishap" would immediately seep through. Not only that, they feel very rough - not something you'd want to rub on a newborn baby's skin to clean spit-up or drool.I feel bad for giving such a poor review because I'm normally a huge fan of Gerber products. I just think that these are pointless and a waste of money. You can find better flatfolds for nearly the same price as these. As far as burp cloths, the Gerber prefold diapers work awesome for those.
