review/text: I've been using electrics exclusively for the past 7-8 years, until recently my wife has gotten into couponing, and she picked me up a Gillette Fusion something-or-other for next to nothing, so I decided to give it whirl. Well, that got me interested in wet shaving, which went out of popular style well before I was even conceived. After much deliberation, I went with this Merkur and some Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Soap. I just received the package a few hours ago and tried it out - Amazing shave! Yes, I cut myself maybe three times on the middle of my neck (where my beard is thickest) which is nothing compared to the fifteen cuts I got with the Fusion the other day. This razor and wet shaving all-together have introduced me to the "lost art" of shaving. Also, the included Merkur blade is intensely sharp, but not too sharp as to not allow for a second pass against the grain (where I cut myself, lol). It was a bit smaller than I expected, but I warmed up to it quickly. All-in-all, this is a fantastic razor and the best shave I've ever had.
