review/text: My little boy had a rash on his neck and back that would not go away. His doctor didn't think it was anything serious and recommended hydrocortisone ointment (which did absolutely nothing and I am not a fan of continuous use of steroids, even if its over the counter). I jumped on amazon to see if I could find something mild to use on him. I found this item and was immediately interested because I often use tea tree oil for many different reasons. Once I received this product, I immediately began to use it once a day on during his bath on the rash on his neck/back. Within 3 days, the rash was gone. This product is lightly scented, mild, and does not leave any residue. I even use it to wash his hair (it helped his dry scalp).
