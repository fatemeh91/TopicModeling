review/text: I have used BSN Syntha 6 for quite some time now. Figured with all the great reviews and price I would give this a shot. Protein itself is okay I guess with fewer calories, less fat, I think 2g more protein per serving BUT for me, the taste and consistency is no where near my Syntha-6.Using same ingredients (8oz water, 1 banana, 12 cubes of ice) Syntha is much thicker and I feel, much tastier. Don't get me wrong. Great product, great price... loses a star for taste. For a few bucks more... going back to Syntha 6 as my daily drive.
