review/text: We used to use the Oral B rotary toothbrushes, but after brushing the first time with this, we realized the amazing difference in thoroughness with cleaning. I especially like the polisher head that comes with it - it really removes all the rough spots that tend to accumulate with time on the surface of the teeth that toothbrushes don't seem to completely remove. Try it - you won't be disappointed.
