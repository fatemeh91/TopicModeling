review/text: I love and depend on this product. I stocked up for my move overseas. I weakness has always been orthopedic/rheumatoid, suffering shoulder pain, neck pain, knee pain, and the aftermath of Achilles tendonitis and broken bones in my foot. I've tried everything, and this is the only product that gives me relief--and because it's topical, you avoid all the side effects of pain killers. Those who complain that it doesn't last long enough obviously are not chronic pain sufferers. First of all--you can reapply it. Second--anything that brings real relief is 5 STARS!! Don't waste your money on Tiger Balm or any of the other stuff out there. This is the gold standard.
