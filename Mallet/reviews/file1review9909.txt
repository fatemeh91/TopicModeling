review/text: These tweezers are VERY sharp and seem like they'd be great at removing ingrown hairs, however they perform about as well at removing tough-to-get hairs as my other Tweezerman tweezers. They're decent, but not great. They might be really good at removing larger things like splinters, but I haven't had to try that yet. Overall they're not a bad purchase, just don't expect anything special as far as tricky ingrown hairs are concerned.
