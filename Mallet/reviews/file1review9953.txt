review/text: It doesn't grasp a ingrown hair at all I have to dig out the ingrown hair with a needle then I can grab the hair with this product. if you are wanting something that can dig the ingrown hair out this wouldn't be the right product for you, the so called point isn't really a point it's squared off and just doesn't grasp the small hair.
