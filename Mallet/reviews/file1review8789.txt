review/text: I have tried a few different greens and this is has become my go-to favourite.It has a multi-vitamin component in it, which makes it have added value. I take this pretty much every morning I'm at work and it gives me a nice boost of energy before my morning coffee.The taste: I mix mine with Crystal Lite and have no complaints with it being chalky or leaving a terrible after taste in your mouth.At around $50 for the 60 day container it is expensive, but Amazon still seems to have the cheapest price. I'll likely buy again once I run out. FYI my service size is two scoops per drink I make.
