review/text: This chinese herb is incredible! I purchased it for its reputation as an immune booster, and indeed it is. The recommended dose is 4 capsules per day - I decided to take only 2 capsules per day. I have been taking this product for 23 months now and have not had a single symptom of anything - no colds, no sore throats, no flu, nothing!!! The research says there are essentially NO side effects or dangers with taking this herb - it has been used for 1000 years in China with no ill effects - a pretty good trial, I would say. It also is reputed to prevent or diminish the progress of cancer tumors and many other illnesses - certainly worth the effort and price, since there are no ill side effects. I am very impressed with my experience with this herb.
