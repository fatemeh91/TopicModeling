review/text: I bought this tube for a trip I took to Fla. with 3 Toddlers it was worth the money. I loved the fact that i could put in in my suitcase. It did not take up much room where we were staying and now i plan on using it with my 4th child. If it had grips to keep the baby from slideing it would be perfect. I would recomend this for anyone who travels or just wants to give a older baby a comfy place to take a bath.
