review/text: My husband loves the gloves, but the finger openings are starting to fray, and he is unhappy that the price paid and the fabric threads are getting fuzzy after 6 days. He does not wear them to jobs around the house, as he is afraid they will get worse. Do not know if they can be returned or not after being worn for a certain time period. The support he gets is good if the finger seams come apart , I will have to find another vendor. Star review should have been a five for the price. He has large wrists and they have a hard time fastening properly.
