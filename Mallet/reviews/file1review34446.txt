review/text: I've tried several different lubes, and this is by far my favorite. It stays slick, doesn't stain the bedding, and doesn't taste bad. It lasts a very long time and is easily "renewed" with a little water. My gripe is with the bottle. No matter how careful I am, I always end up with lube on the outside of the bottle, and consequently, on my nightstand. I wish it came in a pump instead. Overall though, it's worth the hassle! Oh, and it doesn't take much either...a little goes a LOONNNG way.
