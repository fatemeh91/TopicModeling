review/text: I had hoped that this supplement would allow me to get away from taking levothyroxine (Synthriod). It didn't work out that way, but I have to admit that, for the fist 6 months, the condition of my hair, skin, and nails did improve. My nails were stronger and less brittle, and my hair was fuller and softer than it has been in a while. Oh, and I was able to lose some of the weight that the Synthriod packed on! My doctor has me back on Synthroid again, but I am considering getting more of Gaia's TS and trying a smaller dose (one a day or every other day) to see if it will have the some of the same results, even while taking the regular medication. I've read good reviews from people who say they were able to avoid going on a thyroid medication by taking this. For me, I think that the results were very promising, but I had already been on the med too long to be able to quit effectively. If you're not on a thyroid medication yet, but your doctor has suggested it, you might try this for a few months, first.
