review/text: I bought the Remington Beard Trimmer Model MB200 two weeks ago. It appeared to be a good product and worked fine during the first couple of times I used it. One of the reasons that i selected this product was the ability to wash the heads with water after use as indicted in Amazons advertising materials which state: "The trimmer's head is washable--a quick rinse removes loose hair. The MB200 features a rechargeable battery for handy, cord-free use."When I reviewed the instructions on cleaning and maintenance, however, it became clear that Amazon's descriptions were false and misleading. The documentation that was included with the razor is quite clear. The first page of the instructions state: "KEEP AWAY FROM WATER." The section on cleaning and maintenance states: "Blow out any loose hair that has accumulated. Brush out any remaining hair from the cutter teeth and hair pocket with the brush provided. Do not rinse the cutter assembly under water or use cleaning fluids with could remove the lubrication." the product materials are quite clear.The descriptions, charts and materials on Amazon's website, however,are inaccurate and misleading. This shaver should never be cleaned with water.Although the shaver appears to work fine (my single star is a rating of Amazon), as long as you are not interested in cleaning it with water. The experience forces me to reconsider Amazon as a reputable merchant. Fortunately, there are several others to choose from.Follow-up note: When I complained to Amazon, they apologized for the inaccuracies and promptly refunded my money. Nice job.
