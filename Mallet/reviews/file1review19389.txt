review/text: I can only speak for me on this product,as anyone who takes Vitamins,minerals etc on a daily basis can probably vouch for, we all have different reactions to the diversity of products in this field particularly those of us with stomach,colon,liver,kidney etc problems where the tiniest ingredient can make aworld of difference in how our bodies react,so it always pays to identify the product you might be thinking of buying and read up on it elsewhere in product reviews or warnings before commiting to buy, that way you could save yourself time,anxt,discomfort and money if the product contains anything or has effects you recognise to be to your detriment.For me, and me alone ,all i can say is that, i take this product daily with no adverse effects or discomfort,do i trust the brand and product itself to do the job i`m paying for,yes,i do.Rainbow Light Women' s Nutritional System Multivitamin Supplement Food Based Tablets 180 tablets
