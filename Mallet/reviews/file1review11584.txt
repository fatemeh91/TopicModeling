review/text: Writing good reviews is always a joy because you affirm to yourself that you made the correct decision. -- This won't be one of those --.Before you add these batteries to your cart, think about all the other low reviews on this product, then please move on.I purchased these batteries for a variety of purposes and so far six out of the eight batteries have failed to charge on the first try or failed to hold a charge more than 4 days (probably more than 90% depleted since I was only able to take two photos. For you techies, you are probably thinking, "Its your charger". I understand your point as I've tried two chargers, my ole reliable MAHA MH-C401FS that has successfully charged my other PowerEx, Sanyo, and and Sony HiMH batteries. On one new set of these Duracell's I tried my Sony charger that came with the Camera and it took fully four more hours to charge the Duracell's (My two year old Sony 2500 MaHr batteries were my measuring stick) but these Duracells were found to be depleted three days later when I dropped them into a radio (BTW: I also noticed this same charging pattern on these cells in my MAHA charger.) My perception of these batteries is that there are much better ones to purchase. It was surprising that I had so many defectives. Other purchasers must have had identical problems. Save yourself a few bucks in this economy and look further.Oh, and the the two unused cells that I have left, they're stored away awaiting to disappoint me in the future and the one redeeming point being the packaging, my cat loved to play with it.
