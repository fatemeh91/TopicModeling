review/text: I like the feel and look of the razor a lot--it's heavy, shiny, and the texturing on the handle looks and feels good. The handle isn't too short for my rather average-sized hands.I just used this razor to remove 3 weeks of beard--took me 1/2 hour or so. Having done the same exercise with gilette swivel-head razors, my face feels better after the Merkur (though the shave isn't as close--I'm inexperienced).The razor didn't do as well as I had hoped regarding clogging--it still clogged when confronted with a beard. However, since there is a lot more room underneath the blade compared to common N-blade razors, I believe it can definitely cut more hair before it clogs.I was surprised to learn that when shaving off a beard, I had to push harder than expected--plenty of advice floating around the internet says, "Use no pressure, just let the razor's weight do the work." However, that doesn't work when attacking a beard.
