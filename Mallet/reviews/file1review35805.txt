review/text: Although I'm not a man, I decided to try this shave gel when I noticed that the dyes and heavy fragrances in women's shaving creams were drying out my skin. I used Nivea for a couple of weeks and, voila, no more dry, itchy legs! I was able to get a close shave with no irritation. I also like its nice, clean scent. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the price. It's kind of expensive for drugstore shaving cream. But if you don't mind the price and have sensitive skin, then this is the shaving gel for you.
