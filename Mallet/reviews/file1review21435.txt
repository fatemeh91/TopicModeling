review/text: Oral b claims to have our oral hygiene as their top priority, designing products to aid in saving our teeth. For the replacement heads, they give us the indicator bristles so we will know when they should be replaced. This is all wonderful, right? Then why do they charge such a high price for the replacement heads? My instinct is to use them until there is not a trace of blue left in the indicators. The list price for a 3 pack of replacement heads is $22, and with 1/3 off, using Amazon takes some of the sting out of keeping updated - an action that Oral B should be taking!
