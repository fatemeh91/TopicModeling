review/text: This funny looking device has been a blessing for me. No more leaning on door jams or begging family members for a shoulder rub. This thing is great after hours on the PC or sewing machine. Works well for the upper/lower back, shoulders, neck and even the soles of your feet. It comes with a helpful card showing different positions to get those troublesome spots. Of course the Back Buddy won't replace a Licensed Therapist, however I highly recommend this for in between therapy/massage visits.
