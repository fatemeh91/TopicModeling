review/text: The only thing these "cloths" might be good for is invisible dust that could just as easily be blown off ... certainly not smudges, because they are dry and slightly abrasive and if you apply any pressure at all they will scratch your CD. Forget about any kind of "cleaning" with them! Also, the name is misleading. They are not "cloths", the texture is actually similar to a Bounce dryer sheet -- and who would try to clean a CD with one of those?
