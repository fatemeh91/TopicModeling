review/text: I have been trying a lot of the protein powder for after my workouts. Most of them have been chocolate. All of which have been pretty good. I really like strawberry flavor. So, I thought I would try a strawberry protein powder. Big mistake. I find myself struggling to finish the shakes. I would not buy this again. My advice, stick with the chocolate flavor.
