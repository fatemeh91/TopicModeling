review/text: I have owned this product for several years. It really works great. I use it on my legs, under arms, and bikini line. The hair doesn't need to be really long (like it does when you wax). Legs are easy to do and the results last for a long time. Underarms are a little tougher. . . just be sure to keep the skin pulled tight, otherwise it will be more painful. I have a tendency to get ingrown hairs when shaving my underarms, but when I use this product, I don't them at all. Plus, the underarm area doesn't look "dark" (due to the dark hair under the skin) and the results last a long time. This product also works great on the bikini line. Painful, yes. Results, great. And I also do not get ingrown hair after using the Emjoi.Be sure to get this product with all the tweezers. Some people have complained that the tweezers spin in different directions. I find this design more efficient, especially with the underarms.The Emjoi Optima works great! I recommend it all the time. It is a little painful, but gets better with practice.
