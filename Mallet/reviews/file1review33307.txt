review/text: I've been wanting one of these for awhile, but I felt like they were over-priced. Amazon had this on sale at a price I just couldn't pass up, about five bucks. So the scent is definately strong, but it's a nice strong and feels very therapeutic and relaxing. The black cover is soft and velveety feeling, actually much nicer than some similar pacs I've seen for much more money. It's easy to use and stays warm for as long as I need it. I keep it in a big ziploc bag so it retains it's herbal scent and properties.I just wish I had bought a few more for gifts.
