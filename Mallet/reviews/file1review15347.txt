review/text: i really should have gotten one of these a long time ago. i've always had a sort of grudge against smokers that like to flick their cigarette butts when they're done smoking, and to be honest, i'm one of those people sometimes. but ever since owning this Zippo Pocket Ashtray, i've eliminated the chances of me littering the environment with cigarette butts, plus it's a snazzy little device, too. it feels good in my hand, and it's easy to clean, so there is absolutely no excuse for me not to recommend this. it's also a great gifting item in my opinion.
