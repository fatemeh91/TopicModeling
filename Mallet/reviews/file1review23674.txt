review/text: These gloves are very strong and durable. I use them when working on my car, house cleaning or simply washing dishes. Yes, they cost a bit more than the usual latex gloves but they are stronger and last longer. I purchased two boxes and I've barely used the first box. For casual use around the house one pair can be used multiple times. I strongly recommend them.
