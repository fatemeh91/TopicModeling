review/text: I am on a restricted calorie diet and recently added power 90 workout videos. I started drinking one of these after my workout and it really lessens my soreness and recovery time. Also I am building a considerable amount of muscle despite my very low calorie intake. At 230 calories per 8 oz glass (if taken with 1%) it had to replace my mini ice cream treat I ate each night, but the double chocolate tastes almost as good! I also have tried vanilla ice cream and I can get it down after a workout if I use an immersion blender, but it doesn't taste very good. The double chocolate tastes very similar to a malted milk shake.
