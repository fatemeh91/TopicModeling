review/text: I heard about this item from a friend. She personally hadnt tried it but some one she knew had. The Candy dosnt taste good and it didnt help relieve any morning sickness at all. The flavors were wierd. I couldnt even stand the smell. The sour flavors were too sour to stand. The thought behind this product has good intentions but it didnt work for me personally.
