review/text: Sometimes things I eat leave my body NOT smelling the best inside.I know which foods these are, so I take a couple of chlorofresh before I eat and maybe 1 or 2 later or the next day, and I don't have that "fishy" scent...This has been a miracle for me.By the way, I'm as clean as clean can be, shower everyday, but certain foods ( fish especially ) just cling to me.This is an internal body deoderant, and I highly recommend this. I am not a pill taker, so I was hesitant to take this product, but have been taking it now for two years when I eat those certain foods, and now I don't avoid eating those things..I'm sure there are many of us out there who are too embarassed to talk about this, and once I talked to my neighbor about it, she took a couple of mine, and was shocked at the results. It really works and the price is right!
