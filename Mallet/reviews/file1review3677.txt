review/text: The description given for this product is erroneous and doesnt state the primary use of this supplement which is as a remedy for constipation.As per wikipedia (and many other sources);Magnesium citrate, a magnesium salt of citric acid, is a chemical agent used medicinally as a saline laxative and to completely empty the bowel prior to a major surgery or colonoscopy. It is available without a prescription, both as a generic or under the brand name Citromag or Citroma. It is also used as a magnesium supplement in pills. The magnesium content of magnesium citrate corresponds to about 11% by mass.It is always important to correctly follow the prescribed doses; extreme magnesium overdose can result in serious complication such as slow heart beat, low blood pressure, nausea, drowsiness, etc. If severe enough, an overdose can even result in coma or death.However, a moderate overdose will be excreted through the kidneys, unless one suffers from serious kidney problems. - wikipediaThis product is used to clean stool from the intestines before surgery or certain bowel procedures (e.g., colonoscopy, radiography), usually with other products. It may also be used for relief of constipation. However, milder products (e.g., stool softeners, bulk-forming laxatives) should be used whenever possible for constipation. --www(dot)medicinenet(dot)com
