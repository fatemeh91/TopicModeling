review/text: I bought the little tube of this masque (since I was experimenting) but I wish I had bought the bigger size. It beats the heck out of any other mask I've used. It smells great, isn't too heavy (lighter than, say, a clay mask), washes off easily, and leaves my skin soft and clean. It also tingles in a very nice way when you first put it on. Highly recommended. When I run out, I WILL buy a bigger tube.
