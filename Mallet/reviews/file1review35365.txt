review/text: I purchased this for my uncle who is 82 and it makes him feel much safer getting in/out of the car.I would recommend this product to anyone who "could use a hand" getting in/out of the car.I have only two comments on the item. First, I left the CarCaddie "in place" after my uncle used it to get into the car. After ensuring his seat belt was secure, I closed the car door and the CarCaddie proceeded to swing into my uncle's face. Oops! Good thing he has a sense of humor! A minor readjustment on where the CarCaddie was mounted on the window eliminated this issue.The second issue is why I did not give it 5 stars. As I stated previously, I left the CarCaddie in place. This worked fine until the first time it rained. The strap wicked water into the car. It was actually a lot of water. However, we also had a lot of rain, 2 - 3 inches.I liked the product so much that I also purchased another product by Standers to aid in entering/exiting the car, the Handybar. Although it seemed to work very well, my uncle did not want to use it. He preferred the CarCaddie. I think this is just a matter of personal preference and as it becomes harder to get in/out of the car, both products used jointly will be very helpful.
