review/text: The Carson Optical Lumiloupe 10x is compact and relativly easy to use. It is worth the cost. However, being someone who has worked in the graphic industry for 50 years I was a little disappointed in the sharpness of the image and the lack of rotating the lens cap to focus for my personal eyes. My bottom line is for convience and the cost, it is good choice.Billy
