review/text: I purchased PekiFix for a diabetic family member who was going through a cycle of infection on her feet that nothing seemed to help. Even the products recommended by her physician seemed to do little to help. When she tried this soap, the relief was notable, and I immediately reordered for her continued use.This is an excellent product, certainly worthy of a try.
