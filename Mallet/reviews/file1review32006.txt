review/text: I began using this because a family member with multiple sclerosis was using it as a way to supplement her health regimen. Her husband was also using it and both claimed they both were feeling great. Also, because they felt their health was improving, they were eating more whole foods and lost weight in the process. Just healthier all around!This formula DOESN'T have near the "earthy" taste (powdered wheatgrass - gag!) that most green drinks have. I put one scoop of Perfect Food with one scoop of Designer Whey double chocolate protein mix, add 8 oz. of water and shake. It has that "protein-healthy-drink" smell but tastes like the chocolate. I actually look forward to it! This has been my breakfast and afternoon snack for almost 3 weeks and I can tell there's a difference. The first thing I noticed was a much healthier digestive system (no problems with gas or bloating) and then added energy besides. I usually eat fairly healthy, but because this formula has so many green veggies and probiotics, it has helped me to really improve my nutrition. It's my understanding that the longer you use this product, the better you feel so I am sure I will re-order.
