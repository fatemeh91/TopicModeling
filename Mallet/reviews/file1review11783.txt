review/text: The product was delivered in a timely fashion (as always from All Star Health) and is a great product for someone like myself who wants to add some extra protein to a healthy diet. A single serving each morning is what I normally use, which adds just the right amount of protein to allow me to work out on a regular basis and not feel depleted or bloated.This is not a product designed to make you big fast, but will help produce a well developed healthy body over longer periods of time if used consistently throughout the year.I would certainly recommend this product to a friend.
