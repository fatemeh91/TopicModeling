review/text: The manufacturer's description is misleading. It sounds like it's an all-around basic sweeper, but it does not work on hard-wood floors. Sure, for carpets, it's quite helpful, but that's not why I bought it. We have the pricey vacuum for our one and only oriental carpet (I have allergies). I wanted something to pick up all the debris my kids bring in on our hardwood floors, which cover the remainder of our house. The sweeper picks up nothing. Literally, you can run it over the same spot 5 times, but you'll be very lucky if it picks up anything. It's really meant for carpets -- the rollers inside use the friction with the carpet fibers to pick up debris. Without that friction, nothing happens.Yes, the handle doesn't work on mine either, but that didn't concern me: a piece of packing tape easily solves that. My problem is that the product is not as versatile as the manufacturer leads you to believe.
