review/text: I keep joking that we've spent a fortune pimping out our stroller, but this was a must have for long days out. Keeps healthy snacks like fruits and veggies cold. And don't forget a bottle of water for mom.It's about the size of a six-pack and doesn't make the stroller (we have a city mini) any bulkier when we fold it up.
