review/text: Try mixing a scoop of slimfast chocolate royale, a big tablespoon of flaxseed, then use chocolate milk or regular milk. I add ten to twelve icecubes to get a milkshake consistancy. Blend it in a blender and enjoy. It makes you feel full for many hours and is good for you. It's a great way to use flaxseed for colon health.
