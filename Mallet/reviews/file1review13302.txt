review/text: We have been using these pads for more than 3 1/2 years for a child with Autism. The pads are very durable and have held up to repeated washing/drying - approximately 2-3 times per week. A great product for those that tend to move around in the night, as the pads stay in place much better than disposable pads do, and are a lot larger than disposables. Overall this is great product, I highly recommend it.*Edited 10/26/12*Some suggestions: for areas with very hard water or to remove odors, add 1/2 - 1 cup of Borax to the wash, in addition to your regular detergent and then use the extra rinse cycle. Avoid using fabric softeners, and do not use the high heat setting on the dryer. If necessary, you can put a thin fitted sheet over the top of the pad to keep it in place for those that move around so much that the pad doesn't stay where it is needed.The pads will tend to pill after years of use, but this is an aesthetic rather than functional issue.
