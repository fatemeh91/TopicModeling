review/text: The ties included with this did not hold it in place. Eventually I got it to stay on and it did the job well and caught a bunch of lint until a few weeks later it fell off the hose and plugged up the drain in the washer drain tub and flooded the basement. So if you use this make sure you are standing by the washer when the water drains through it.
