review/text: It's a shame we live in a world where gadgets and gimmicks rule supreme over quality and simplicity. This razor is as straight forward as it gets. Its blades are sharp and the guide is dependable. It looks like they had to drop the price dramatically; most likely due to the supreme need for more and more and more choices, instead of quality items. If you are looking for simplicity of design, ease of use, and quality of craftsmanship, then this is the best choice.
