review/text: I have been using Green Vibrance for about six years. I first started taking Greens plus which is also a very good Green superfood, but I was introduced to Green Vibrance by a local health food clerk...she was taking it and highly recommend it to all of her family and friends. I feel a lot better when I take Green Vibrance, it gives me lots of energy and my skin has a glow...I think it actually makes me look younger. I usually buy the larger Green Vibrance, which is a better deal. I purchased two (60 Day supply)from Amazon at a great price for $41.59. I recently purchase Rainbow Vibrance and I mix a small scoop with the Green Vibrance for added nutrition. I take it with a little water mixed with my favorite juice...usually cranberry juice or apple juice. It does not taste bad to me when I only mix it with water, because I know I am doing something positive for my health. I will continue to take Green Vibrance as long as they make it. You can not beat the price from Amazon.com. If you want to take a very good Green superfood, I would highly recommend Green Vibrance....it is a great product...give it a try!
