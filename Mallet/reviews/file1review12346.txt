review/text: I bought this solely for RV roofs, primarily the type with white fuzzy carpet like material. I tried bleach, Oxi-clean, carpet cleaner, etc. with no result. After searching on the internet, Instagone was mentioned. Was worth a shot. It really works ! Can barely see the stains. Careful where you spray it and not to breath it in though.
