review/text: I did my research before buying this item. I've spoken highly of Adventure Medical Kits in the past and I was not surprised when I received the Ultra-light/Watertight .7. True to its name, the kit is super lightweight (around 6 ounces or so). It comes with the basics as far as quick patch job medical supplies go but the clear DryFlex bag bag still has room to add several more items for customization. I'm going to keep this kit in my personal bug-out bag. I picked up the larger Outfitter kit for my extended getaway bug-out box as well. AMK is the way to go if you want reasonably priced, well thought out, functional, transportable, and easily customizable medical kits.
