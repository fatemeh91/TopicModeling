review/text: This is the worst replacement I've ever purchased for a product I own. I have been a happy 8585 owner for years, with the razor and its replaceable parts provider the best shave I've ever had. This new horrible replacement block has torn up my face and made shaving a nightmare. I'm trying the 7000 replacement as advised here. Braun made a terrible mistake. I don't know how I could trust them again.
