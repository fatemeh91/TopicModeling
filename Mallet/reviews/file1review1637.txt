review/text: This really works! I had a wart on my foot that I had for over a year and went to 2 doctors and it would not go away until I used this stuff! I put a hunk of this stuff on the wart and then covered it with a bandaid. I did it every day for 2-3 weeks. After a week the wart and the skin started peeling off. After 2-3 weeks it was gone!! I'm am so happy! It is important that you use it at least 4 to 5 times a week or it won't work. My daughter tried it but put it on sporatically and it didn't work for her.
