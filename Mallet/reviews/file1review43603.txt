review/text: I have this unit about one month now and am very impressed with it. You shouldn't have any trouble getting consistent readings if you read and follow the instructions carefully. Make sure the cuff is applied correctly to your left arm about a 1/2" above the elbow, the arrow on the cuff points to the inside of the elbow on the cuff, centered with the middle finger. The right arm could be used too. I suspect that if the unit is off it may be reading a "little" high, which of course is much better than a little low, but I'm not sure given the variability of blood pressure and the many variables than can effect readings slightly. It is consistent though.My only misgiving about this unit is the limited functionality of the memory, particularly the inability to store reading for two people and not being able to store readings on a memory card or plug it in to a computer USB port to download readings to a spreadsheet so the data could be further analyzed and graphed. But, as this memory functionality was never advertised and given the price of this excellent unit, I gave it 5 stars. I would have gladly paid more if this data accessibility were an added function.
