review/text: I AM A MEDICAL ESTHETICIAN AND I USE THESE IN MY FACIAL TREATMENTS. I PERSONNALY DO NOT LIKE TO HAVE A HOT SOGGY HEAVY TOWEL ON MY FACE DURING A SERVICE AND FOUND NEITHER DO MOST OF MY CLIENTS. THESE ARE LIGHT WEIGHT, HEAT UP QUICKLY, AND ARE SUPER ABSORBANT FOR REMOVING MASQUES AND PRODUCTS. THE REAL UPSIDE IS THAT YOU CAN DRY ABOUT 100 OF THEM IN 10 MINUTES INSTEAD OF AN HOUR IN THE DRYER. THEY CAN BE BLEACHED AND WASHED REPEATEDLY WITH NO SHRINKAGE, FRAYING OR SHREDDING. THEY ARE THE BEST SECRET WEAPON OF REAL PROFESSIONALS.
