review/text: Purchased this tape because my podiatrist had taped my foot before for my plantar fascitis and I wanted to be able to do it myself. The tape makes my foot better and helps it to heal. This tape is great. Its definitely waterproof. I have been water walking in the pool at my gym and this tape stayed on and hasn't even curled up at the ends. I highly recommend this tape.
