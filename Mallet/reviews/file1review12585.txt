review/text: I've taken different types of laxatives in the past until I recently found out that they can actually damage your digestive system. So I decided to give Oxy-Powder a try and it's been a very rewarding experience for me. This product has gone beyond my expectations and I've never felt so young and full of energy! I highly recommend this to anybody suffering from IBS, constipation, diarrhea, etc. If you're a long time sufferer like myself, you might want to give Oxy-Powder a try...I'm glad I did.
