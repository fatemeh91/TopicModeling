review/text: They were recommended to me by my chiropractor. They help a lot with my ankles rolling inward causing my knees to be out of alignment. I will say they make my feet hurt, but I just need to get used to them. When I'm not at work and actually at home, I don't wear shoes very often. If you need an orthotic they are your best option to a custom as they are around $300 or so to have done. I would recommend them if you have issues with your knees, back and hips due to standing or walking all day. At this point all my children have them(they have the same problem with their arches as my wife and I) and they seem to love them.
