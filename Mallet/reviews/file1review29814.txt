review/text: I LOVE THIS HAD ONE AND MY BABY BROKE IT I ASAP GOT A NEW ONE, SO MUCH BETTER THEN HAVING THAT HUGE THING OF WATER IN THE BEDROOM, THIS IS GREAT FOR BABIES THAT ARE SICK IT REALLY WORKS GOOD THE ONLY DOWNFALL ARE THE REPLACEMNTS CAN BE A BIT EXPENSIVE, BUT FOR ME IT'S SO WORTH NOT HAVING THE MESS OF A BIG HUMIDFIER.
