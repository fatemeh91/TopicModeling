review/text: I was very excited when I first saw this product online and when I received it in the mail. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment after using the product. I ordered two boxes and used both on my hair. My hair did NOT look anything like the color shown on the box, it didn't even come close. I would not recommend this hair color if you have dark blonde hair (one of the recommended hair colors) as it turns more of a dark red than a nice shade of plum.
