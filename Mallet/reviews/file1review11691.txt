review/text: I had two back to back kids' birthdays and thought a decorate your own cupcake would be fun, but didn't want to pay $2-$3 a bottle for the little ones. I found these and they worked great. I still have a lot left over, which my kids are enjoying. the only thing I didn't like, was I ordered this bottle and the ball sprinkles bottle and was hoping the shipping would be by weight, not by number of products. Overall, I still think it was a cost savings and having only 2 bottles rather than a bunch of little ones is great for the pantry.
