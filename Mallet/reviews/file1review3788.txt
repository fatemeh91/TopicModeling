review/text: This tea tastes pleasant for your first 2 or 3 sips. Then it starts tasting pretty foul. I hate, hate, hate how they put Stevia into it. If I want my tea sweeter, allow me to put my own sweetener in it. Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea, but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird, not yummy, sweet taste. I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is, but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink, I use conventional sugars that don't taste terrible.It does give a bit of a relaxing feel, but the Stevia really ruins it. I wish I could just take it out!
