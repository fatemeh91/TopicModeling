review/text: I had this for two years and it worked great. The bubbles are pretty powerful, and the massage is nice. The rollers on the bottom are useless though. The only problem is that the stopper that keeps the water in the bath just broke off. I went to tighten the stopper, and the plastic piece just broke off. I cannot use it any more because of that little piece of plastic. It is unfortunate because the bath is still working.
