review/text: I make a total of 5 school lunches and snacks for my kids each weekday. For reasons that I don't precisely understand, lunch-making is a task of bother disproportionate to how much work is actually involved--but it has truly been a necessary irritant for years. I slack and make sandwiches, my kids complain (nicely) and bring home lunchboxes still half-full of rejected candidates for their mid-day attention.No more. I have resolved this year to present lunches that resemble choices that I myself would find appealing--many small portions of diverse foods, unexpected combinations, a little bite of something sweet at the end, not too much bread. And I have to say, these boxes really have helped toward that end. The sizes of the compartments create maximum flexibility for leftovers, pinwheels, pasta salads, fruit and veg, crackers & cheese, roll-ups... and yes, the trusty sandwich, now and then. It's easy to slip in one little surprise with the more predictable fare when I can count on the sections maintaining water-tightness; even with the vigorous shaking elementary school kids give their boxes, we've had no leaking from one section into the others. They're holding up in the dishwasher just fine (I do keep extras, because life is nicer when I'm not forced to wash a dish to complete lunch packing).Ours fit beautifully with a separate snack (usually in aRubbermaid TakeAlongs 1-Cup Twist and Seal Containers, Pack of 4) + a water bottle in an LL Bean Flip-Top lunchbox. The box inserts at a slight angle, which has not impacted its functionality.Recommended for kid or adult lunch usage. A great, simple, straightforward, affordable product is always a pleasure to find.
