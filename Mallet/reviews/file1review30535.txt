review/text: My skin is very sensitive (rash/irritated skin) to a lot of brands of deodorants out there. I used Tom's of Maine, but they changed their ingredients. I can no longer use Tom's of Maine deodorant. Now, this is the only deodorant I've tried that I won't react to, and I cannot find it in any stores near me anymore. It does a good job for day to day wear. It may not be ideal for sports, and I should note that it is not an antiperspirant (although to me this is a benefit, as it will not clog your sweat glands).
