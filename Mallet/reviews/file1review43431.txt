review/text: Imagine taking the smoothest, creamiest milk chocolate, melting it, and pouring a very thin ribbon of it - so thin that it sets immediately on contact with the previously poured ribbon. This is a Cadbury's Flake - layer on layer of extremely thin ribbons of chocolate. When you bite into it, it crumbles into tiny flakes of chocolate on your tongue, then melts into the creamy texture that Cadbury's is famous for. British chocolate does not contain any wax, so it melts at a far lower temperature than American chocolate. This makes it taste much creamier - similar to a very high quality Belgian chocolate. Flake bars are incredible and one of my most-missed candies since I moved to the USA (I'm English). My favourite way of eating them is to crush the flake up while it is still in the packet, then to open the packet and eat the flakes by dipping my finger into them! In England, ice-cream vendors sell something called a '99', which is an ice-cream cone with two Flake halves stuck in the top of it. Flakes are not only good served with ice-cream, but are also used to decorate frosted cakes and gateaux (cut or break them up into 1" pieces for this). You have to try this product - I don't think it's an 'aquired taste' at all, and every single one of my American friends who have tried one have loved them. I can guarantee that you will too. A similar product is the 'Aero' candy bar - this is choclate that has had air bubbled through it before it sets - creating a very light texture of chocolate filled with tiny bubble holes. Aero bars come in other flavours, such as orange chocolate and mint chocolate as well as plain milk chocolate.
