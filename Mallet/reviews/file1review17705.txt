review/text: I had my previous Remington trimmer since 2000 and loved it. A few months ago, the lever to adjust the guard busted and you couldn't pick a level anymore. Distraught I went to Walmart, Target, Sams, everywhere looking for a simple trimmer that would easily cut my beard, mustache, and burns at an easily specified height. Surprisingly hard to find. Eventually I decided to go online and find the same model. I guess the MB200 is my originals grandson but it works just about the same, except it's got a wheel instead of the lever to adjust the height, and it charges. Love it so far. No problems.
