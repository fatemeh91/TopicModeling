review/text: This battery charger is poorly constructed and (mine) does not work as advertised. It has a switch that will supposedly allow you to charge two or four batteries at a time but mine will only charge four. The two battery function does not work. The only reason I am keeping this is because of the car charging function which is why I am giving it two stars and not one.
