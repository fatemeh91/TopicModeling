review/text: I have had a goatee for more than 7 years now and in that period I have gone thru many beard trimmers who did an adequate job. This is the first trimmer which costs less than 20 bucks that solves the basic problems most of the previous ones did not.1. Trimmer attachment is solid and snaps on easy.2. Trimmer can be adjusted in height easily.3. Trimmer attachment can be removed easily.4. Trimmer is powerful enough to cut through my slightly thicker hair.5. Trimmer can be used to shape the goatee easily.6. You can easily remove the trimmer blade and remove hair from inside.7. You can easily put the trimmer blade back in place for reuse once removed.#6 and #7 are elusive beasts that no other product has been able to do as well as this product.5 out of 5 for the features on a sub 20 USD price.
