review/text: Note, this review is for the ointment only - I have not tried the capsules.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------I've been plagued by cold sores for years, and have tried everything to reduce the length of time the sores last. I always got large sores on my upper lip that were painful, not to mention embarrassing. My treatment of choice was a teensy tiny tube of a prescription cream that helped - but at $24 it was not a great deal.I was on a road trip in Vermont when I felt the tingling lump on my lip, signaling the start of yet another sore. I was out of my prescription and dashed into the nearest store to see if they carried anything that might help, and came across Quantum's Super Lysine+ treatment. I had no faith whatsoever that this product would do anything but soften the impending sore - there are so many products out there that claim to help but don't do much at all - but trying something new was better than doing nothing at all.I was really blown away by how well this stuff worked! The sore that showed up in the coming hours was TINY, and disappeared in a couple of days. Since then I have kept this ointment with me at all times. If you use it at the very first instant you first feel a sore coming on - before it raises up - and keep applying it to the spot over the next 24 hours, you won't get a sore at all!I have now used this for the past couple of years, for every outbreak, and the results are consistently awesome. I can't recommend it highly enough!
