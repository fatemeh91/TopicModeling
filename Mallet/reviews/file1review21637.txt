review/text: My son has now 'graduated' to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year. It is perfect for when they are too big for the 'seats' and your tub doesn't accomdate the rings. In fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand. Ours has withstood a year of use so far and we'll be using it with the next baby too.
