review/text: I have one of each size of the thermaphore. They are wonderful with the moist heat that they put out. The neck size arthritic one is a little different from the others I have. This one has a timed on/off switch, and because of that, the heat is not as intense. That being said, the heat is still more moist and intense than other heating pads. This one also, being as narror as it is, allows you to wrap it around and elbow, neck or knee.
