review/text: I've tried other brands, but the Wahl razor with Super Close screen has been the only razor that is effective with my beard. My beard grows in at an angle almost parallel to my skin and before trying Wahl about 10 years ago, I frequently suffered ingrown hairs on my neck.My first Wahl lasted about 10 years before it would no longer accept a charge. After trying a triple head electric razor unsuccessfully, I bought my new Wahl and have been happy with it. The only drawback has been it's slightly larger size which I dealt with by finding a slightly larger space in which to store it.
