review/text: I usually buy a solid, but I thought I would try out this roll-on and see if I liked it. Well, after trying it out, I think I will stick to the solids. The roll on goes on too wet and it leaves white marks on my dark colored shirts. It did keep me dry, but so does my usual brand. I won't be purchasing this item.
