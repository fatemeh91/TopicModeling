review/text: I bought these gloves for my husband who has arthritis in his fingers and hands. He is extremely active and usually just works through the pain. After wearing the gloves for two hours, he brought up the fact that he hadn't been pain free in years. Even when doing tedious hand work (electric and guitar) he couldn't belieive how wel they worked. These gloves should come in tan though so they would be less conspicuous at times.Thanks!!!
