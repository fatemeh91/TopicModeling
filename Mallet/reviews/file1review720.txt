review/text: I've been using ScarZoneA for about 2 weeks now and I'm in love! I started getting acne when I was 24 and it's so embarrassing to have acne as an adult. Most products I've tried make your acne worse before it starts getting better. ScarZoneA didn't do that for me...it starting working right away. I just ordered 2 more tubes! The smell is kind-of gross, but you get used to it...just don't put the cream on your upper lip and you won't smell it as much. The smell is a small price to pay for how well it works. Seriously. It is keeping me from getting NEW zits and it's finally fading my old scars out. Try it!
