review/text: Love the cream it doesn't gives me zits or breakouts so that's amazing for me, loving it, I only use it for sleep and I see some wrinkles going down!!!! I am only 22 but we have thin, dry skin on my family so by 15 we have wrinkles around our eyes and lots of expression lines.... Well I think this cream is really good, really makes you feel younger... I am only using it for sleep time and works like a charm...
