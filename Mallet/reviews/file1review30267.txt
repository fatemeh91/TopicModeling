review/text: This would not be the first time I bought the wrong item. But, although I wanted a cordless vac, and was hesitant to open the box, I gave it a try. All I can say is the cord is not much of a problem. This vac has more then twice the power of any cordless. And the attachments are the icing on the cake. Kind of nice to make an error in the right direction.
