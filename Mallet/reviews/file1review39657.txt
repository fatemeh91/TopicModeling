review/text: I purchased the Flossaid Dental Floss Holder from teethnthings.com through Amazon. The plastic "y" snapped in half after about six months. I am not a vigorous flosser, but this instrument wasn't up to the job. And the shipping cost essentially doubled the price! No more "flossaid" for me.
