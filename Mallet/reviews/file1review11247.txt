review/text: I have used Remington, Philips and Braun in the past. The ES8163 is the most powerful of the lot. Works well wet and dry. The power cord plugs directly into the razor and it charges fully in an hour. I get 9 to 11 shaves per charge. Cleans easily, shaves closely, what more can one want. Operates on both 120V and 240V.
