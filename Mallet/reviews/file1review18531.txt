review/text: I've been using these waxing strips for years and am pleased. Of course, they aren't a substitute for a salon waxing, but great for touch ups (and when you don't want to drop $80 on full leg/bikini wax). Refering to another reviewer, no, there aren't 2000 strips in the box, but I guess I didn't consider that possibility either. There are 8 strips in the box, but each separates into two strips. Takes a little less than a box to do both legs (for me). The strips used to come with more wax on them, but all-in-all, these work better than some other brands.
