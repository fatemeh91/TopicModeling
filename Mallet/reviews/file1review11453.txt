review/text: It seems like most products are reducing their packaging, reducing the number of ounces for which we pay the same price, and otherwise cheapening their product at our expense. I've owned Norelco beard trimmers for as long as I've had a beard, which is to say most of my adult life and when my old one finally burned out, I replaced it with this one, which was, theoretically, the same design as the old. Not so much. The motor doesn't seem to be as powerful. It doesn't hold a charge (for something that's supposed to be "rechargeable") for very long. It trims well enough, but not as well as the old one. Not sure what or why they did whatever it is they've done to this trimmer, but it's more toy-like than tool-like. It works well enough. And I mean that as faint praise.
