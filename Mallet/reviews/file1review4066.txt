review/text: After trying to save money on blades by buying them off of Amazon and getting obvious counterfeits... going to war with the reseller... getting slapped around and retaliated against by the reseller, buyers should know you are running a likely risk buying razor blades from anywhere besides a retail store. I contacted Proctor and Gamble about the counterfeits I received and here is their response.Richard,We appreciate your bringing this to our attention. P&G; doesn't distribute our products through Amazon. If you have questions about the authenticity of the product you purchased, please contact Amazon. In the meantime, I'm sharing your message with our Security Team.The safest, most reliable way to purchase our products is through retail stores. [...]Judging by the mixed reviews, some people may get real blades and some may not. In any case, if you get fake ones you have to pay the postage to return them to get your refund so you will lose time and money if you come up with the counterfeits. Also consider that you may get reasonably good counterfeits (though doubtful) which still isn't giving you the actual product's quality experience. Because I had to return the blades to the reseller I was unable to send them to Proctor and Gamble for their security team to research. All I'm saying is, it's a gamble to save a few dollars. I will never buy blades again from an online seller.
