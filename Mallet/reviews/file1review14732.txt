review/text: I started taking this product after coming down with hives. I'd heard it was good for rashes and thought I'd give it a try. My hives went away a couple of weeks after taking it and also my post nasal drip which I've had for the past three years has cleared up significantly; maybe 80%. I give credit to this supplement and am happy with the results so I'm giving it four stars. My concern was about the ingredient Bromelain (100 mg). I read in "well being journal" Vol. 19 No.2 that Bromide is a nutrient blocker of Iodine. If Bromelain is closely related to Bromide/Bromine this concerns me since I have hypothyroidism. I haven't researched this yet but thought it should be noted for those who would like to investigate this ingredient further.
