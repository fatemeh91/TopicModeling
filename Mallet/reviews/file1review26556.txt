review/text: My husband and I used this for our flight from New York to Hong Kong. We were on Cathay Pacific with their newly designed seats that were suppose to be very comfortable. The new seats weren't that great but this cushion definitely helped, especially since my husband had a back surgery a few years before. It made flying in tight economy seats on long flights more tolerable.
