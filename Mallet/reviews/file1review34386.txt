review/text: I have been taking vitamins since I was a kid. I have gone from Flintstones, to Shaklee, to Vitamin World , to GNC, to Puritan's Pride, to making runs to multiple vitamins stores and buying multiple brands. Then I found a local store where I could get everything in one place. I now order a majority of my vitamins online.With age doctor visits have increased and so have the blood tests. About a year ago my wife and I started going to a different kind of doctor. She gives you a full physical and a full gamut of blood tests once a year. Throughout the year you have 4 checkups and many follow up blood tests to try to get your system to where it is supposed to be. Part of these blood tests include a wide range of vitamin levels.With Jarrow Formulas I have been able to increase and decrease different amounts of the vitamins she tests for and get to the level she is looking for. This has worked for both my wife and I.Jarrow Formulas are a little on the pricier side of the normal vitamins, but my experience over the years with vitamins has shown you get what you pay for. I would recommend Jarrow Formulas to anyone.
