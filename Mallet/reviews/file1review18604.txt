review/text: I have tried many many home waxing products, and this one is far superior to anything else I've tried. I'm now ordering my third jar because my daughter uses it too. One note of caution: unless it is a very hot day, it really is hard to work with when it is "cold." I generally just microwave it for a little bit until it is the right consistency. Once it is warm, it really easy to work with, and works amazingly well. As with any wax, you want to be sure that you skin is very clean first.I use it mainly to touch up my brows and lip in between professional waxes. It has saved me tons of money this way, as I only have it professionally done two or three times a year now (just brows). And the only reason I do that is because they are way better at getting the right shape than I am. Once I have the right shape, I can easily maintain it for several months.The fact that it cleans up with water is a huge bonus. It is really hard to believe thatit works this well AND cleans up with water. I hope they never stop making this product!
