review/text: I bought this mainly for use when I have a migraine, loved the idea of being able to secure it in place. The problems: The mask doesn't get cold enough, only stays cold for 15 minutes and then actually begins to warm up considerably (much more so than any other reuseable cold pack I've used in the past). It's comfortable, durable, would work well for puffy eyes, just not the right product for migraines.
