review/text: This is my second Trim N Vac. I bought my first when they first came out about 10 years ago. You just have to watch that you don't block the exausts with your hand otherwise the vacuum catches about 90% of the whisker. This makes it a lot easier to clean up afterwards then all of it ending in the sink. I have had quite a number of different trimmer devices over the 45 years that I have had a beard and this one works well for me.
