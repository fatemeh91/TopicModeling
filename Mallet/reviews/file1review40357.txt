review/text: At the first symptom of a cold or virus, this is the product my wife and I reach for. And so far, it has not failed either of us. Our son and daughter also take it and enjoy the same results. Some would say it's rather pricey, however the benefits it offers far outweigh the cost, at least as far as we are concerned. And it appears to be safe, with no side effects nor interactions with other drugs or supplements.
