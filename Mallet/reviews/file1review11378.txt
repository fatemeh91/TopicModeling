review/text: As I said, great product I haven't tried the chocolate test, but vanilla tastes pretty good.I highly recommend this, but DO NOT buy it from Amazon. The reason it get's a 3/5 stars is b/c you can get 30 of these at a Costco for the SAME price. Where as Amazon you only get 24. So go to your nearest Costco for these !!
