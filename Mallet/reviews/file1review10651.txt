review/text: I researched the best sources of protein for a smoothie/after workout drink. Whey Protein Isolate is the best, but you really need to make sure there's not allot of additives. Such as: sugar, flavoring etc..NOW Whey Protein Isolate unflavored is all natural and has no additives. It mixes in great with other items I use in my smoothies. I also do Weight Watchers and 1 serving is 2 points. Easy and provides lasting energy. Also, I received the product from All Star Health and it was quick and easy.
