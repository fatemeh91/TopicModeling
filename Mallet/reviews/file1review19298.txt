review/text: First off I wanna say that if you are reading this review chances are you possibly have some fertility issues....let me get str8 to the point. First my husband had a low sperm count and little or no movement (don't know the count) I can say my obgyn said forget IUI and go str8 IVF. However, my husband had just completed his 2nd bottle and was going on to the 3rd. BAM I am pregnant...I was also taking the one for women... Please understand my husband was taking this at night because he said it would interfere with his bp medicine. he was also jus taking 2 pills and weight loss was not a option or exercise. All I can say is use this product you have nothing to lose...Don't give up and trust God. This product is the inhabitants of the earth...to God be the Glory for All the things he has Already done...
