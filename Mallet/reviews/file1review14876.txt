review/text: I ordered the Extreme Chocolate 20 packet at a lower price from this site than from the one I normally order from, only to find out at checkout that they charge an outrageous $10 delivery fee. I should of seen that lowball ploy coming, but went through with the order anyways. Received the order on a timely basis, but with only 18 packets instead of 20. I e-mailed my concerns and the company did repond back timely, with an assurance that my account would be credited accordingly. When I received my credit card statement, the amount of the credit did not reflect the correct prorated amount for these missing packages. I will not use this site going forward.
