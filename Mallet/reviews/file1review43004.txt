review/text: Just what I wanted. Healthier than other sprays, inoffensive smell, really keeps the stall clean. However, I don't think the bottle's going to last as long as I want it to - one use seems to put out a lot of the contents. Maybe my husband is secretly using it too because the scent is so much better than those on the grocery store shelves (and why DO they smell so BAD?!). That said, it certainly does what it's supposed to.
