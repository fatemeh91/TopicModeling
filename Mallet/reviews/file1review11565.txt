review/text: I had bought two sets of these as the "4-pack". Sadly, half of my batteries don't hold a charge. Since I have the La Crosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger, I can check the current voltage of the batteries. After brief usage, some batteries still had high voltage, while others had completely run out!! Consequently, I don't use the ones that don't hold a charge (and the others work just fine). I own many other brands of batteries, but these are the worst. I think the Rayovac have been the best.
