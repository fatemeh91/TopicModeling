review/text: I bought 2 of these brushes a while ago and I still using them regularly. They are perfect to clean those tiny white/black hairs/lint on your clothes. The trick is to use each side in the direction the brush shows and you are good to go. The quality is good, not top notch but it's good indeed. One of the brushes stopped working because the red material moved out of position but that was because of overuse on my part, so I glued back into position and it's now as good as new.Note: The price is darn cheap for this kind of product.Note2: It's super easy to use and last a very long time.
