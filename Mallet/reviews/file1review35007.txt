review/text: This is the best belt I have tried. It is a bit wider than other similar style belts and it has much more substantial elastic. This is hands down more comfortable than some lumbar supports that are several inches wide and have boning. Absolutely love this belt and would get another. Highly recommend if you are experiencing SacroIlliac issues.
