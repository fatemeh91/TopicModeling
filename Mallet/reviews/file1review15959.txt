review/text: I bought this product on the advice of my physical therapist for sciatic pain during my 3rd trimester (4th baby). The directions were a little hard to follow and I was grateful for the confirmation of my P/T. As soon as I put it on, I couldn't believe I ever went through a pregnancy without using this!! As my back/sciatic pain improved, the support was uncomfortable and later unnecessary when sitting. However, I would still use the support if I needed to move around alot (cooking, cleaning, groceries, etc.) with great success. Love it!!
