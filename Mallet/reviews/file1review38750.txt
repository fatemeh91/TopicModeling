review/text: **I could not be more disappointed with this purchase.**I started losing weight in mid-September and was steadily losing two lbs a week. For reference, I cut my calories down to 1200 and started on the elliptical. I decided to buy this shake mix since it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup like the cans and I wanted a drink for breakfasts(solid foods early in the day make me feel sick for a few hours, I was hoping this would be a great way to get around that.) I started drinking it every morning starting November 1st, while adjusting my solid food intake to about 1000 calories, and I immediately plateaued. I even GAINED a pound and had to work really hard to burn it off.Most people gave this stuff 5 stars?? REALLY!?!?!?! It seriously makes me hate advertisers who use product reviews to sling their junk. I'm trying to lose literally half my body weight while battling severe back problems, I do not need this. I stopped the Slim Fast breakfasts at the last day of November and BAM! by December 2 I'm down 4 lbs. This is ridiculous. It should have helped me instead of making things more difficult. I don't know if it's the sugar content or what, but I will never be buying this shit again.
