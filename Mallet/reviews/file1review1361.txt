review/text: The tea is delicious, but I haven't experience the &#34;runs&#34; as mentioned by other reviewers -- even when I let it steep for a long period. I have, over a period of a week, found myself to be more regular. Overall, I like the product and will continue to use it to promote regularity. Maybe being more regular will get that scale moving downward again. :)
