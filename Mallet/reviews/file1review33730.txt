review/text: I bought these for myself after trying one to remove makeup at one of my beauty stores. My skin immediately loved them! I could not believe it! I have rosacea, oily skin and sensitive skin; with that being said, a product has to be superb in all the areas for my skin to like it. Did I mention I'm also sensitive to strong scents? I loved everything about this wipe that I had to have them. I'm glad they sold this item there; I hate it when they use certain products, and when you inquire about them the response is "I'm sorry those are not for sale". I went in there getting a specific item, and walked out of there with that and my Mustela facial cleansing cloths! To see my skin calm, comfortable, and moisturized makes me happy!
