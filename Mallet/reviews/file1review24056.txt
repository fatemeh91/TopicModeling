review/text: I bought these from our local health food store (much more expensive...) when I was battling w/mastitis for the 2nd time in a month. These, in combination w/cabbage leaves :) and lots of vitamin C, worked beautifully. I take them to maintain my health in this regard. I do not want to be w/o them! Hope they work for you as well as they have for me. Additionally, I have used many brands of probiotics and was skeptical of these in the beginning.
