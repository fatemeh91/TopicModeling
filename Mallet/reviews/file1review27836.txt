review/text: No reason for me to go into detail as to why nutritionally this is a good protein powder, as others reviewers have much more knowledge and background in this. But as far as taste, it's amazing! Nothing artificial tasting about it and not chalky like some others. We use 2 rounded scoops with 8 oz of 1% milk and blend up with ice. I think it tastes like a Mocha Blast from Baskin Robins, my husband says he thinks it tastes like a Jumpin Java from Juice It Up. Either way, it's delicious!! Not too sweet either like some other good tasting protein powders. Perfect flavor.
