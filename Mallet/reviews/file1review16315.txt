review/text: Ive been gettting these through Subscribe and Save for a while. Does a great job cleaning the dishes. Couple it with Finish drying agent and you are in great shape. My only complaint is that the red ball falls out of the other piece more than it stays in so you have to be careful handling them or you will be chasing it around your kitchen.
