review/text: This protein blend tastes great! I make one big shake and have half with breakfast and half for lunch. As others have stated if you like chocolate, buy the vanilla and then add cocoa power so you can control how much chocolate flavor you want. By one big shake, I mean I use one packet of Met-Rx and then add a banana, peanut butter, dry oats, honey, and baby spinach leaves (you won't even taste the spinach with all that good tasting stuff added in). I use it to replenish my carbs as well as protein after a run/workout. Just have to watch the calories when adding additional ingredients.
