review/text: I don't want to be misleading, as I never got around to actually using it, but I'm writing the review I wished someone would have written earlier to save me some time and grief. The advertised picture on every website that sells the 178 is a little misleading; it appears bigger than it really is.The razor arrived to my home, I giddily opened the packaging, and was rather dissapointed. The thing was weel-made, shiny and pristine, but...well, tiny. I have medium-sized hands and the 178 was too small for them. The handle, from the bottom of the head assembly to the hilt of the handle was about 3 inches. My hand is about 4 inches at the widest part. I just wanted something more substantial, so I sent it back for a refund and ordered a 38c "barber pole," which is more to my expectations and liking.The two razors have the same heads, so the only difference is the length and weight. Although I do enjoy my 38c, having shaved a couple of times with it, I can see why one would opt for the smaller 178. Because it is smaller, I can see where the 178 may be a little more managable and agile. It seems more "strictly business" than the more cosmetic 38c. If you want to save some money and don't mind the looks of the stumpy little razor hanging in your razor stand, then go for the 178. If you want something more substantial and aesthetic, buy the 38c. You can't go wrong either way.
