review/text: I bought one of these after my second Sonic Care died within a year. The toothbrush does not clean quite as well as a Sonic Care but it is much better than a manual toothbrush. You don't need to spend the kind of money they are offering them for here however. Found mine at a "big box" for a lot less money. You might also want to consider an Oral B sonic for about $24 at a big box.
