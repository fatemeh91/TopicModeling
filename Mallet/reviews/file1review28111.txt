review/text: First and foremost... Amazon.com I LOVE YOU!!! Shipping was super fast, amazon prime is not joking around when they say two day shipping! The product itself is great, it tastes good, it does taste a lot better with milk, and it does the job! This product has been around for awhile and it is simply great for amateurs or pros. It can be used to loose weight or pack some solid mass. I recommend it and if you do automatic shipping every three or six months you can save some good money!
