review/text: I only took the product for 3 days and at half dose. If taken first thing in the morning, it kept me up an extra hour later than usual but ot caused me to have unrest-full sleep in the early morning. Maybe that goes away after a while. But from my experience these things are cumulative. It did help me "focus" , but then so does a cup of coffee! Finding something for focus, that doesn't interfere with my sleep, continues to elude me.
