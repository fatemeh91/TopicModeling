review/text: Powerful Motor, quickly adjusted for different lengths, solid feel. For a while there, I thought that the blades never come fully out (I thought that the shortest length was 1). However, I learned I could simply pull the guide off to do edges. Unlike other trimmers, the comb looks like an integral part of the unit, rather than an afterthought.
