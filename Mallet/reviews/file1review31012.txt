review/text: As pointed out by other users, these pills are mighty humongous! And if you chop them up into smaller, easier-to-swallow chunks, they taste like the plastic upholstery of a 1966 Volvo wagon; straight-up nazzzty.But here's the funny part - after just a week, my bum knee (15 years of karate and kickboxing plus ACL surgery will do a number on your joints, I'm here to tell ya) is feeling MUCH better, and improving every day! Truly a miracle; I thought I was gonna have to live with a cranky left leg for the rest of my days. That wrinkly old waitress with the rad beehive hairdo on the commercial was right; who knew? This stuff really works. Yeehaw!If you can stand a little nasty flavor in trade for a happier skeleton, then this is definitely the stuff for you. My advice? Cut 'em in thirds with a pill splitter, take each little chunk with a HUGE mouthful of water (don't breathe in while doing so, or you'll experience a really lovely vinyl taste that lasts and lasts), and chase the whole mess down with a small chunk of chocolate or other Scooby snack. Hey, that's why God created Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!
