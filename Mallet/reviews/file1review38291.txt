review/text: I bought this vitamin after seeing several good reviews. I used Rainbow Light Womens Organic, and loved them but this one was spoken highly of so I thought I'd give it a try. HORRIBLE! As soon as I opened the bottle I literally gagged...they smelled just like urine...an old nasty outhouse. I took 2 and got sharp headaches off and on all day (I'm not a headache sufferer). If i could return them for a refund I would. I'll stick with what I know works from now on.
