review/text: If you're worried about switching to a reusable pad, I have one suggestion: JUST DO IT!!! Once you do, you'll never go back to disposables. I ordered this brand when I realized I'd be starting my period during my vacation, and hadn't brought anything with me. The thought of going to the store for products just repulsed me to the point that I quickly ordered these online just in time.My only comment is that this brand of reusable pad(unlike other brands I've bought in the past)gets all wrinkled up in the laundry. Once it's been washed, it's all wrinkled, which makes it difficult to smooth out and place comfortably in your underwear. Plus, I've never quite been a fan of pads "with wings."My suggestion (again) is to make the switch. You won't regret it. Beyond that, which brand you choose is just a personal preference.
