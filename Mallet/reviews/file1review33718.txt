review/text: This is a great all-natural, organic face moisturizer, and I love that it doesn't clog pores but still keeps my skin from getting to dried out. It even works pretty well through the winter, although if you have drier skin, you may wish to switch to a heavier product in the winter. Also, this has a nice, light scent. I'm very pleased with Zia products in general. They're a bit pricey compared to non-organic products, but for organic products they're pretty reasonable and very high quality.
