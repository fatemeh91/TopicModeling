review/text: I received this kit (the .5) 3 days before the expected delivery date. I like it a lot. Fits well in my Maxpedition Jumbo, which is my EDC/GHB. I checked the expiration dates on every thing and I have about 18 months of good dates, which is better than many preassembled kits. I check all my first aid products annually any how. I had room to add a bit more in the areas of pain relief, burn gel and antibiotic ointment. I can barely feel the the weight of the kit. I plan on ordering the .9 or the weekender for my car. I really like this product and the fact that there is a little room in the bag to customize it a bit.
