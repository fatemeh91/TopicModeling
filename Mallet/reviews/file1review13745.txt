review/text: The heat doesn't last as long as liquid packs, but surprisingly long for what it is. Just make sure you 'mist' the pack sufficiently to have the moisture in the pack get warm enough. . The smell is a bit strong right out of the pack for those of us with sensitive noses, but let it sit out for a few hours and it helps moderate the smell a lot to a more tolerable level. Be careful to let all the moisture out before putting it into an air tight storage pack. It'll mildew if you don't let it air out!I think these units are an amazing value for the price.
