review/text: This is very easy to Velcro onto the side of the crib. Has a spot for a box of wipes, to small mesh compartments as well as 4 other places to put things and a diaper stacker in the middle. The problem I did run into was that the newborn diapers I would put in would just fall out through the opening which was frustrating but I got a clothes pin and pined the two sides together and it works fine now
