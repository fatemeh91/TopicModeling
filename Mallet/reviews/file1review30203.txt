review/text: I bought this primarily as a car vacuum. It's an amazing little vac - I've had mine a few years now and have been using it to vacuum my entire house because my new full-size Dirt Devil just doesn't work well (to put it mildly). Even though the vac is small it's got great suction and is easy to use, clean and empty. As a pet owner, I very much appreciate this great buy.
