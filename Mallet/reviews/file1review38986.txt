review/text: I am 50 yrs old and used personal touch razors as long as I can remember, but frustrated because walmart hasn't had refill cartridges in a long time. I don't use credit cards so I can't order on line. Tried other razors and can't find one I like. Want my personal touch but can't get refills. Is there another store that carries them, cause I've looked everywhere?
