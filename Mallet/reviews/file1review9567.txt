review/text: Incredibly rich and tasty! Lists lots of protein, so that's good. But, watch out for sugar overload! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me. 26 grams of sugar in the Apple Crisp! OMdiabetes! To my knowledge, all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels. The wrapper is super noisy; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone...forget it. Again, on the plus side the bar is really tasty and alleges high protein; on the down side, sugar quantity is sky high and the wrapper is really noisy.
