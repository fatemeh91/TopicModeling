review/text: This is my favorite pen of all time. The new capacitative touch cap is exactly what this svelte little writer needed. It's so thin for a tri-function pen. People are usually really surprised when I switch colors since it's thinner than some single-function pens.This is actually my second Tech3 pen and I noticed Cross changed the spinning mechanism in the pen. It feels more solid (it was already very smooth), but it will only turn in one direction now. This kind of annoyed me because I used to keep it centered between black ink and mechanical pencil and go back and forth between the two. This new mechanism will allow me to extend one tip and retract it again, but if I want to switch, I can only progress forward to the next color, but not back. A minor inconvenience (and probably more of a convenience if you're not like me and don't memorize the order/positions of tips) on an otherwise flawless product.
