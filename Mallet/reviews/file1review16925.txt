review/text: Used over one year - very satisfied. I bought another Norelco, cheaper than this one, for a back-up and was surprised that it did not shave as well as this one. Based on my experience, the more expensive Norelco models shave closer and more efficiently. If you have the money, spend it. I am going to try the newer Arcitec model (which is now Norelco's top of the line) to see if it is equal or better.PS: For those looking for the same shave they get from a wet razor - stop fooling yourself - electric is a timesaver, not an equivalent shave.
