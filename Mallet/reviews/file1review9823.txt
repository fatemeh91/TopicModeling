review/text: I happened to run across these tweezers when looking for something else online. I quickly realized these would meet a purpose at home - besides ingrown hairs, they're excellent for pulling splinters and, a problem for me, nails that splinter on my hands and feet. Besides a regular pair of blunt edge tweezers, every home should have a pair of these around for those problems that the blunt edge tweezers just can't handle. The tips are just as sharp as they look so you do want to keep the little rubber tube over them when not in use to avoid accidental sticks. Well made, these are worth the price!
