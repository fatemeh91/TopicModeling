review/text: I've gone through the gamut with lotions. Ultra healing, intense moisture blah blah blah. Other's have come close but this takes the cake. My legs get so dry in the winter so that I have little bumps all over. I use this once every 3-4 days after my morning shower and I'm good for days. My legs are so soft and this smells so good. It's a little pricey but if you think about how often you apply, it's worth it. Use this on your feet, elbows, legs, hands or where ever you have trouble dry areas. I'm a fan for life!
