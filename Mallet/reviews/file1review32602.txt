review/text: Tried this tea from 6 other sources and many are bitter. This one ismuch better. Although I find the loose tea bought from Mountain RoseHerbs (brown bag) is most definately the best. Just get the Spice BallTea Infuser from Amazon for $7! Well worth it. Gave a couple as giftsover the holidays. Very easy to use.
