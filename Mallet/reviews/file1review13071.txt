review/text: I thought this product would be great compared to simple ice packs which we have to hold with our hand onto the sore spot. However this just does not get cold enough. Its only mildly cold, not ice cold - which is required for treating pains.plus the package is bulky. I wish they could make is slimmer less heavy.
