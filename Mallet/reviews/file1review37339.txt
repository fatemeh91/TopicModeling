review/text: I have always shaved and living in a hot State always in shorts, so just about every other day, out came the razor. My girlfriend recommended me to epilate, although she warned me it could be a bit painful. I brought this item based on previous reviews and used it 2 weeks ago. For the first time, I would not say it was painful, quite bearable and my skin got used to it pretty quickly. Only now, 2 weeks later, hairs have come through but so much lighter. I can imagine it only getting better the more I use it and the interval of time inbetween also. Good bye razor.....I love this.
