review/text: My 87 year old Grandmother suffers terribly from excruciating post-herpetic nerve pain, that comes after having shingles. She has trouble sleeping through the night and often wakes up screaming in pain. She had shingles on her forehead, and she said that it feels like a burning itch under her skin that she can't reach, but needs to be scratched. Medications for post-herpetic nerve pain from shingles was not an option, because of other medications that she is taking. I began searching Amazon for a topical cream that could help her. So far this has helped her. We put it on her during the day, and right before she goes to bed and so far so good...she hasn't complained about the intense itching or any pain. Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus -- the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles. If you or someone you know is over the age of 65 please talk to your doctor about getting the shingles shot to keep you from getting it in the first place. If my Grandmother had received this shot she wouldn't be suffering from nerve pain now.
