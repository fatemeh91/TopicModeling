review/text: I bought these for my husband who recently quit smoking. They have really helped, but be aware the cinnamon flavor is VERY strong and he got a couple of irritated spots in his mouth. You have to put them in and out of your mouth and not hold them in one spot for too long. These were recommended by a smoking cessation counselor and my husband really likes them.
