review/text: I started shaving in the very early 70's. My first razor was the Gillette Techmatic--anyone else remember these? It used a razor strip rather than blades and one got a new surface by turning a wheel to get fresh blade surface. My father was a Gillette double-edge user while I was growing up, and I ended up with one myself. The kind that has the little hangar-type doors that open up for blade change.One problem with those--they gum up the mechanism over time with accumulated shaving cream. I bought my Merkur in the late 70's, found on vacation. I was fascinated by the mechanism--so much simpler and easier to keep clean. To change blades, one simply unscrews the top surface which is attached to a long threaded screw inserted into the top of the handle. Put the new blade in, put the top on and screw down.I have used my Merkur since I was in my 20's, and I'm in my 50's now. How many shaves would that be? My razor could pass for new. Periodically I can just brush the disassembled razor parts with some dish detergent and it looks like new.I never liked the waste of either plastic-encased blade assemblies or disposable razors. Still seems like a waste when all one needs it just a new blade surface.I'm not a blade snob. I have happily used Gillette, Merkur, Personna, Walgreen's, Wilkinson blades. I have a relatively soft beard, not the Fred Flinstone type, but it grows fast. It's another thing I really like about a double-edge. If you go on vacation and skip shaving a week or so it won't--can't--clog up like the multiblade systems. I've ended up loaning mine to friends on camping trips when theirs can't cut the mustard!One of these Merkur razors is an investment, as mine proves. I am amazed when I see what replacement blades for these multiblade systems cost. I expect I'll be using this type as long as I shave.
