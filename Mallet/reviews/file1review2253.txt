review/text: No one ever "taught" me to shave, so I don't really know how long to use each one. But shaving my head (full head of hair) and my face with these is awesome. I think I over use them a little bit, but one cartridge lasts me for like two, three months. (Shaving my entire head once a week) I've used them for about three years and have gotten an extremely close shave every time. Not once have I cut myself using them.
