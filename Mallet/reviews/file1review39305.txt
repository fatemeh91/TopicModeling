review/text: Actually, I cheat - I use these on my toes. When toes were handed out I got whatever was left over that day. A bit like joining the army and being last in line when the kit's being issued. Because of that I wear sandals a lot and - well never mind the gory details, I'll just say that I use these on my toes and they stay on despite the wear imposed by my walking around, driving, chasing the chickens and so on.
