review/text: I also have been fighting skin rashes from psoriasis for the last 30 years. OTC and Rx fungal treatments usually provide me the best relief: they take anywhere from 2-10 days to work, the rashes go away for a few weeks before settling in again.This soap is even worse. Yes, it provides instant gratification: my skin dries and stops itching as soon as I use it. The cooling action of the peppermint and tea-tree oils does work in that regard. By the end of the same day, however, everything is back to normal. If I miss a day, I'm miserable with the itching. On hard days, it doesn't even last 24 hours. Bottom line: this is a temporary treatment for my symptoms that doesn't work as well as others out there.Edit May 2011: as two commenters have correctly pointed out, I have a skin disease that cannot be cured. I have tempered this review to reflect that more fairly. I cannot speak to how well this product works for those not dealing with psoriasis.
