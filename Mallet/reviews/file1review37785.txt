review/text: For at least ten years, probably longer, I have used Sambucus to help alleviate and reduce the duration of illnesses. When used in the initial hours or day of sickness, this product is especially effective.The actual product looks like a purple cough syrup. The container also resembles a cough syrup bottle. This product tastes no worse than cough syrup, probably a little better.The packaging recommends that for daily maintenance, two teaspoons be taken. For intensive use, two teaspoons should be taken four daily. If you are using this for daily maintenance and only taking 2 teaspoons a day, you will get 12 days out the 4 oz. bottle. The manufacturer does make an 8 oz bottle but that will still necessitate frequent purchases if you are following the product's recommendations.I personally only use this when becoming ill and follow the instructions for intensive use. I have experienced great results using Sambucus and always have a bottle in my house. I highly recommend this product.This product is kosher and gluten free.
