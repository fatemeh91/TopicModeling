review/text: I had WLS so I need a high protein intake. I have had difficulty finding a protein powder that Packs in the protein AND has a great taste! This product does. It is thinner than most when mixed with water. Not thick and chalky. It gives me 23grams of protein of course you can always do a double scoop shake! Mixes well with out clumps. I recommend this to anyone with a need for high protein and good taste
