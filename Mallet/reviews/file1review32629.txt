review/text: I've been trying out all kinds of food bars... raw bars, granola bars, cheap bars, expensive bars. This is the first one I have had that felt, looked, and tasted like real food. The flavor I got was cran-lemon twister, and from the first bite my body said "Yes!". I must confess I'm going through them quickly. These folks obviously want you to like your bars, because the ingredients look nice -- not all smushed up -- are varied and plentiful -- not just mushed cashews with dates -- and give you the satisfying chew that just might be important to you. (It is to me.) There are sesame, peanut, and other potential allergens, but it's funny -- I usually have a problem with sesame, but not here. Maybe the tangy fruits give my body a way to deal with the seeds? Anyway, I'm a new convert. Keep 'em coming!
