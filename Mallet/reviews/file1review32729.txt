review/text: This product is a waste of money, is poorly made, and the customer service from the buyer is awful. I've rarely encountered such nasty customer service reps as I did with this buyer. Additionally, the product is not manufactured well, is difficult to use, and overall does not stablize the knee. A one star rating equates to "I hate it", which sums it up nicely. However, I wish I could rate this product with less than one star to also account for the seller's poor service!
