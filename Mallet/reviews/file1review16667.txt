review/text: I bought one of these in 1964 while I was in Air Force basic training for about $5. It had been a dear friend for many years. It provided great service until 1996 when it was lost out of a jacket pocket. It had been back to Zippo a few times for repair, mostly worn out hinges or hinge pins. Each time the lighter was repaired free and returned with new guts installed. The finish is not gauranteed and mine had been used so long that most of the chrome was worn off around the edges and some in the middle of the case. I found this wear to be sort of a record and history of all the places it had been with me. I was heart broken at it's loss.It was definitely the most valued $5 I have ever spent. I just purchased several for gifts for my sons. I hope they will appreciate the longevity and quality I have enjoyed.
