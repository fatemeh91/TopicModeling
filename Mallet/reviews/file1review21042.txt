review/text: if you are working in a noise enviroment, where you still need to hear people speaking, they work great, can be pulled half out if noise is low to hear better, but you can still hear speech well when they are all the way in. the hard plastic part allows for them to be put in easy, no fighting and smashing like with foam plugs
