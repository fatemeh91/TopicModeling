review/text: I've been taking this product for six nights now. It doesn't make me drowsy at all. I expected it to take a few nights to kick in and make me sleepy, but the only thing that I've noticed differently the past couple of nights is that I've had some pretty vivid dreams including a nightmare last night which involved my ex-husband ....lolI usually don't remember dreams nor am I aware that I'm having them so I thought it unusual, but who knows.I've taken 4 pills each night. Unless it takes longer for this "natural" stuff to work on the system, I give it a thumbs down. If it starts working I'll come back and post.The one good thing I will say, is that once I actually do fall asleep, I seem to be staying asleep without waking up as I often do, so that deserves one thumb up and three stars, but I won't buy it again unless it starts making me sleepy here pretty soon! Scrabble,.. anyone? :)Maybe I'll have a good dream tonight instead of a nightmare....(wink wink)
