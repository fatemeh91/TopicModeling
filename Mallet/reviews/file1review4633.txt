review/text: i received the free gillette fusion razor in the mail as a sample. the first time i tried it, i was like "HOLY SMOKES THAT FEELS SO GOOD!" the shave is very close, and it leaves my skin feeling really smooth when i use it with edge advanced shaving gel.i shave about 2-3 times a week, and have been using the same cartridge for about 8 months (january 09-august 09). do NOT use this with anything less than edge advanced. i used the shaving gel that came with the razor, and it doesn't quite cut it very well.the reason why i only gave this razor 4 stars is because of the price of refill cartridges. those things are EXPENSIVE. i just bought some off of ebay, and they run for $2 a cartridge. those are pretty pricey, but retail stores are even WORSE - they average about $4 a cartridge in-store.if you've got the money, get it. this razor is great.
