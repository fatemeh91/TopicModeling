review/text: I love LUSH massage bars. They feel and smell great but be forewarned, if one uses too much, they're very greasy and will take a little rubbing to get this to disappear. This is the only one I've tried and it's not my favorite scent with like chocolate or cocoa bean tones but I love it and can hardly wait to try the other options. I use this on myself with normal body skin and also on my 5 year old, who has extremely sensitive skin! He takes a shower, gets into his heated towel and then lays out for a little pampering. He says he likes the scent a lot.
