review/text: This is great to have handy for reading small print or even just seeing something under magnification. I even was able to use it as a macro lens for my camera. I set a small item on white paper and lit it from the side with an led flashlight and held the camera lens against this magnifier, focused, and the shot came out great. Who knew? It is very good for reading very fine print also.
