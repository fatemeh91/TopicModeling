review/text: MSM, basically a superior form of good old "sulpher" the buiding blocks(Legos)Sulfur is needed for everything from the repair and maintenance of joint & connective tissues,skin, hair, nails to regenerating the gut mucosal cell lining which is paramount to your gastrointestinal health!Who'd have thunk it! LOLNow this sulpher is naturally occurring in onions, cabbage and most crucirferous vegetables, however there is no way to eat enough to give you what 1 serving of this supplement provides.It is safe, effective and best of all AFFORDABLE!I take it for my old age(aka "body falling apart)troubles, my sons take it to regenerate & repair damaged tissue from their athletic endeavors.Anyone & everyone would benefit from this!I like to drink down a glass of Alacer's EmergenC with my MSM, I read where sports Dr's for NFL Teams used this combination to accelerate the repairs of damaged tissues in their athletes. Give it a try and see how it reduces your "down" time!
