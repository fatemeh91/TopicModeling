review/text: We have to rewash all the knives, most of the plates, and all plastic cups. Everything gets some sort of a film on it. I really must say, this is the worst dishwashing gel ever. I have yet to run the experiment, but I bet just water would result in cleaner dishes. Its back to Cascade for our family.
