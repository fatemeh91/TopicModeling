review/text: I have been visiting the eye doctor religiously every year but had deterioration in the my left eye where I have been applying my "mono lens" for several years. Myvision was cloudy and the contact lens seemed to dry up by the end of the day. I realized that my left eye (my non-dominant eye) was not producing tears and that I had a film covering it when I woke in the morning. Fearing that I would not be able to use my contact lens any longer, I decided to try lubrication to see if it would help. I found this product at a local drug store and gave it a try. Every night I applied one to two drops of Similasan Dry Eye relief and gently stimulated my tear duct at the inner canthus of my eye. Within one week, my eye was tearing up as it should and my vision was improved dramatically. I think it is a fantastic product and highly recommend it.
