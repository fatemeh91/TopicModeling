review/text: After battling with a cold sore for almost a week with Abreeva I had enough. I have used lysine capsules in the past with success, but I didn't have any on hand, so I turned to Abreeva which did nothing for the cold sore. I went to look for this product at my local Vitamin Shoppe and they didn't have it in stock. They did however have theQuantum Super Lysine, 180 Tabs, 1 Bottlein stock so I went ahead and bought that while I waited for the lysine cream to arrive. This lysine cream arrived the next day and I immediately began applying it while also taking the capsules. My cold sore was gone in about 48 hours. The throbbing pain and swelling went down immediately.If you suffer from cold sores don't even waste anymore time using anything else like I did (i.e. ice cubes, vasoline, abreeva, alcohol), or any other stuff out there that is promoted as a miracle cure. The virus simply doesn't like lysine, so it goes back into remission fast. Anything else you try will make it worse!I also like the fact its a natural brown color (looks clear when you put it on) and isn't ghost white colored like Abreeva. Who wants to walk around with ineffective gob of white cream on your lip? Im going to purchaseQuantum - Super Lysine Plus+ Coldstick, .18 oz sticksbecause they have spf in them to protect from getting cold sores in the first place. Sun is a major trigger for these buggers. If your on the fence about this product or looking for something that actually works, go for it!
