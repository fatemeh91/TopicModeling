review/text: I have to admit, this is by far my favorite trimmer. I myself like trimming the mustache and shaping my sideburns. This will definitely do the job if you're looking for something in that category. The blades are ultra sharp, and the trimmer itself has a good sturdy/ergonomic feel. Cleaning the blades is tremendously easy. Just pop up the blade and brush/blow out the excess hair. I have realized that sometimes trimmer can make unequal cuts. But, to fix that make sure you use edge side of trimmer or the flat side, and not both. Overall, I am very satisfied with the results and would recommend it to anyone. Although, I'm sure there are better ones out there with more superfluous features, but this trimmer has everything you need and love.
