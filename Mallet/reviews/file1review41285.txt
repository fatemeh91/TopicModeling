review/text: I recently took the plunge and made the switch to reusable pads. These Glad Rags work well and are very well made. I specifically like the way the wings wrap around your undies and snap in place. I also like the multiple inserts provided because they allow you to choose how thick the pad needs to be. I've been sincerely satisfied with the product itself, but even at the price they are here on Amazon, I still believe they are more expensive than they should be (hence, three stars instead of five).When I looked at the pads I recieved, even as well made as they are, I quickly realized it wouldn't be hard to make them and felt a little ripped off at the price I'd paid. I later found several websites that offer patterns and ideas for sewing your own at a fraction of the cost. So if you are looking to purchase these and you have even the most beginner's skill in sewing, do a little online research and ask yourself if it might be better to make them yourself. You could spend $100 or more to purchase enough of these pads to last a single period versus $10-$25 in materials to make them.
