review/text: This is a great product. As a first time potty trainer, I bought multiple products to find one that worked. We used this product upstairs & the BabyBjorn potty chair downstairs. My 2 yr old likes this product more than the potty chair, especially when it came time to poo poo. Less mess for everyone. Its hard to get him off the potty now. We liked it so much that we bought a 2nd toilet trainer for downstairs & have put away the potty chair for good.
