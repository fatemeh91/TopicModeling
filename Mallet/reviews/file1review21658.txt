review/text: Nothing I could say would do this tub justice! I think every Mom should have one! It really is a great transition between the infant tub and the big tub. I purchased this for my 9 month old son who was using one of the traditional blue bath seats. The seat doesn't allow you to clean the baby's bottom and he would constantly slide toward the front bar squishing his &quot;little boy parts&quot;. The Snug-tub gets rid of that problem! He sits up well in it and the cushions protect him from the hard surfaces of the tub. He is free to play with his toys and explore in a safe environment (with Mom by his side at all times, of course)! It is worth every penny!!
