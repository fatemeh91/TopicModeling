review/text: I ordered 3 of these for my toddler son as he transitioned into a full size bed to reduce the need for middle of the night bed changes. Initially they felt stiff and a bit scratchy. They are a quilted fabric on top (not all the way through), and some type of vinyl beneath.These can shift a bit in the bed, and I now have a system for placing vertically and tucking between the headboard and bed. It works well and covers the entire area of the bed where my son sleeps, head to toe. I also found that after about 5 washings they were soft enough to be comfortable against my son's skin, and seem more absorbent. The protectors do a good job of keeping the bed dry. They are large enough to fold in half to use as a changing pad. I do wish they were fabric on both sides with vinyl in the center, but maybe that doesn't exist.Last night they were put to the test when my son had a stomach virus and was sick in his bed several times throughout the night. I slept beside him and all three were a godsend helping me keep him clean and dry under pretty difficult circumstances -- I am ordering 2 more in case we have a repeat of that type of episode so we aren't running the washer all night. If I were handier, I would cut a few in half and sew them to make smaller versions for travel, etc.
