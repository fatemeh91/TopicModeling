review/text: I bought this because my partner and I wanted to try the Strawberries & Champagne flavor of the Honeydust, and this seemed to be a pretty good deal for a lot of products. However although the "Oil of Love" tastes good, it's nothing special as far as massage oil goes, and it's definitely not suited to be a lubricant. The "Stimlulating Pleasure Balm" was anything but. It did nada for either of us. The best thing about this is the Honeydust and the pleasing flavor of the Strawberries & Champagne. The feather applicator is a real treat as well. However the idea of the drawstring bag is a poor design concept. If you are interested in the Honeydust (which I truly do highly recommend), get it in the canister instead. Much easier to control the inevitable cloud of dust when you use it.
