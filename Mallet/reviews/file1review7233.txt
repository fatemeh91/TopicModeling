review/text: In a world full of posers, It's nice to find a product that does what you expect it to do. If you purchase a fire extingisher, you should pick it up, pull a pin, aim it at the base of the fire and let 'er rip. There is no place for, "Well, the other model actually does a better job at extinguishing the fire because it uses a real fire retardant!" When you want a foot bath, you want powerful, adjustable water jets, massaging pads, sturdy design and a real water heater that actually heats the water.Sure, you can pay less for a unit that looks like a foot bath, but when you want to put out that fire, go for the real thing, not some toy!
