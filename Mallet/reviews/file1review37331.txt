review/text: It's fine, the first one I've ever had, so I don't know how to review it. My friend who recommended epilators to me has used them for 15 years tried it, and she's buying one. Most of the attachments didn't seem to make much difference, but my hair is very thin and not hard to pull out.It has two attachments meant to help with the epilator's contact with the skin and efficiency. Another attachment functions as a shaver (for touch up?) and trimmer for cutting longer hair down to optimal length for epilating. That attachment is handy for any shaving and trimming needed, so the tool is more versatile.
