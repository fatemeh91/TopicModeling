review/text: I love this product! My lips felt like it had a sunburn because there was an annoying dry ring around it. Or it could be that I started using this other chap stick and it did not mix well with my skin. Whatever it was, it was NOT going away. I got desperate so I looked on Amazon and saw great reviews about this product so I ordered it. Within 2-3 days it healed up my lips. Well worth the price and I got 2! I highly recommend this product to everybody. Hope this review helps you :)
