review/text: A great supplement that I have taken for years. Hearty greens with probiotics that assists the liver and provides a good source of greens not necessarily found in most people's diets. Generally I can get the 600 Grams for substantially less than on the food shelf in most grocery or supplement stores.Oh, by-the-way it has a greenish flavor so if you want a candy flavor this won't be for you but you easily adjust to the taste. You can mix it with a nutrition bullet or merely shake it in a container.
