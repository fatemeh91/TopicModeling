review/text: Says it's accurate up to .01, but I'd say it's accurate up to about .02 at best. You must wait at least 20 minutes before your last drink or you will get wildly inaccurate results, which the manual states in its defense. I bought this as a party favor, but it's not real user friendly for that purpose. Great tool is your want to test if someone is fit to drive if they haven't had a drink for 20-30 minutes, but not real fun just to see how drunk your friend/guest is just for s**t's and giggles, which is why I bought the thing. Bottom line is that the device works, but is not as accurate as it states and it takes some abstinence to be "accurate."
