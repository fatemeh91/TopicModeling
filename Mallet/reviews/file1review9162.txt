review/text: New improved version of their pill chest.The clear plastic is helpful; old version was opaque.The box frame is streamlined (compartments are same large size)and will be easier to pack. The older version was a lot bulkier.BUT... handle with care.I tend to be rough on things and this needs to be handled gently.Using a lid to pull out a day case from the frame can tear off the lid.Instead, use the hole in back to pop it out easily.Amid the praise, complaints here are about those lids coming offand they can if you use the lids to (as one reviewer complained)"lift the individual trays out." Instead, use the hole in back.That is what it is designed for!
