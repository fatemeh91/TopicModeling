review/text: I understand some people's frustration but this stuff really does work. If you have a big stubborn wart it's going to take longer. I was vigilent using the stick 3 to 4 times a day and when the wart would dry out I would file it down. At one point my wart was a little sore so I left it alone for a week and then started the process again. Now about 2 months later it is entirely gone. I also heard that Duct tape works the same way..(Of course I found this out later) Like to hear if this is true. Apparently you cut a piece to cover the wart for a few days. When the skin cells die you file it down and keep putting the duct tape on until the wart goes away.I'll have to try it if I ever get a wart again.Good Luck! :)
