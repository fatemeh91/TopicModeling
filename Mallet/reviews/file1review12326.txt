review/text: really i liked it ,it makes a great difference ,you can see clearly with bigger magnification , you can see the disc clearly and the vessel as well even before you reach the aye it is really great invention and revolution in ophthalmoscopy worldbut the worst thing is the delivery it took a very long time ,longer than the estimated time and they never called or even explained the reason until i sent many inquiry messages which made harder on me to get it oversees anyways overall it is a nice product
