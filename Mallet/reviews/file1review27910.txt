review/text: I bought this for a friend of mine, but I have used the 5.15 lb version of the Gold Standard Whey Protein powder. After using it after a few months, I have to say it does really well to increase muscle mass and decrease fat. However, I heard that this helps with lean muscle, and I have come to basically a dead-end where I'm not noticing as big of an improvement while not noticing that much more muscle, which is the reason why I gave this 4/5 stars.As an FYI, the package advises eating a gram of protein per pound you weigh everyday. According to the instructions and my friends, that's the only way to notice big improvements. I should note that I didn't follow this rule all the time, which may have limited my ability to lift more.
