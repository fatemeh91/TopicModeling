review/text: Zoe's chocolate energy bar is very yummy. It's got a fudge-like texture with little bits of puffed rice towards the middle. What's really fantastic is how good it is for you. It's got plenty of Omega-3 fatty acids (really good for brain function and lots of other stuff). It's got whole grains instead of processed grains, etc. Don't make it a regular meal, but it's a great thing to grab to tide you over until your next meal.
