review/text: I had to replace the one blade that came with it immediately, it was so bad. The handle was as good as my old one. It still has the same basic terrible design, made of white metal with a thin part right where the most strength is needed, so it breaks if you tap it too hard when you clean it. But it will last a few years, I suppose.
