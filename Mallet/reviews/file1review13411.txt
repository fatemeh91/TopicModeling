review/text: I bought this because my 13.5 year old Aussie is wetting the bed now. I had purchased two other pads from different stores but they don't compare. Of course, this is pricer but "you get what you pay for." I just ordered a second one last week so I have more than one to use.Was looking for the old style rubber sheets but couldn't find any except very, very, pricey ones. This one works great.
