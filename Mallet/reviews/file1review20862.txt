review/text: Bought the shaver for myself as a Christmas present and love it. One of the reasons I was willing to spend the money was the $50 Amazon coupon that was promised with the unit. (...on any Braun purchase of at least $129, I believe...)With all the holiday rush, I may have missed something, but it didn't come in the box, and is no longer on the site.Does anyone have any additional info on this offer?
