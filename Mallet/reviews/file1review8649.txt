review/text: I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally, plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit. Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon. But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush, but it is also very hard to find in stores. The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top. It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain. The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house. Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this, and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best, and highly recommended...
