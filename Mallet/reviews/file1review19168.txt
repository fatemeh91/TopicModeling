review/text: Great price, fast shipping, but not as advertised. They claim they can detect your pregnancy as early as 6-8 days after conception. I took several of these tests starting at 6 days and as late as 16 days after what should be the conception date based on my cycle - all negative. My husband and I decided to read the reviews we found on several sites for this product and the high number of low ratings prompted us to go buy another test from the drug store - first attempt I got the positive I was expecting based on things I knew were different with my body. I then took 3 more of these tests and they have all shown positive, but it was not until 17+ days of conception that they reflected the positive. I would not have wasted them as early as 6 days had I known that trait was falsely advertised. Additionally, 2 of the positives took more than 30 minutes to show the positive!
