review/text: I have never used protein shakes before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I mixed a full scoop (double rich chocolate) with a 8oz glass of skim milk and stirred it for about 30 seconds. It dissolved in the milk well enough so then I drank the concoction. It reminded me of drinking chocolate milk made from the chocolate powder from when I was a kid! It was sweet but not too sweet (just right). This is going to be very easy to drink everyday.
