review/text: I have taken these vitamins since 1999. They are the best I've ever found. And they boost your energy level. For about six months I quit taking them because I felt they were causing me stomach problems. It turns out that I had an ulcer. During the time I didn't take the vitamins I didn't have as much energy as usual. Once I found out my problem was an ulcer I started taking the vitamins again, and within a couple of weeks, my energy returned.The vitamins were recommended to me by a nutritionist and I must say it was one of the best recommendations I've ever had!
