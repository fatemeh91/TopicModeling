review/text: I like it because it is not the standard Chocolate or Vanilla. 20 years of lifting and I can't stomach any form of those flavors. This Tropical Punch flavor has a bit of a metallic aftertaste like a lot of creatine drinks. If you add a squirt of black cherry Mio, it kills the metallic after taste and makes it mighty tasty while adding a bit of caffeine to it.
