review/text: This pad soaks up all the wetness--even the time she wriggled out of her diaper and was sleeping free all night long! It's been washed lots and lots of times over the past three years and three kids. I use normal detergent along with half a cup of vinegar in the bleach tray to get the urine smell out. The pads are still white. They are in good shape. They are uniform in color. They still absorb all the wetness. They don't stink. The only trouble I've had -- if I wash two pads at once WITH a full load of clothes then sometimes I have to run the drain/spin cycle again to get the load dry enough for the dryer. (More likely that I overloaded the machine, though.)
