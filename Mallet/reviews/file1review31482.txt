review/text: This medical kit is great for day hikes and kayaking. It has just enough stuff and I added some additional things like emergency blanket and more custom tools.It is very light and there is still some room in the bag. I use it in very humid conditions therefore it is great that they packed it in two waterproof bags.The price was good, too.
