review/text: This is so helpful for my unstable arthritic knee, but also the most comfortable support I have tried. I can wear it all day and it is comfortable, even after sitting for hours. Other supports tend to bunch and be uncomfortable if worn while sitting. I have worn one when needed for about a year, and finally decided to purchase additional ones. I don't know why these don't seem to be available in my local drug stores - only the uncomfortable ones are there. This one provides comfortable support that I can wear all day, no matter what I am doing.
