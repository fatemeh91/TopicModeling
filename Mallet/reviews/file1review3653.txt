review/text: Magnesium Citrate is rather difficult to find. None of the stores in my area carry it. After the company I used to order it from quit carrying it, I found this. I am glad I did. These tablets have a smoother coating than the brand I previously purchased, making them much easier to swallow. I take one in the morning and one right before bed and I haven't had restless leg syndrome since!
