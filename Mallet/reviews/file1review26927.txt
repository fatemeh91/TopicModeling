review/text: I wasn't sure how well the protein would absorb but evidence suggests to me that the protein is actually getting absorbed in my body. I donate plasma twice a week for money and they measure the protein levels in your body each time. If your protein levels aren't high enough you can't donate. I would frequently be turned away for low protein levels. After using this product regularly my protein levels have always been high enough, so it seems to work.
