review/text: I have a fairly rare form of hand arthritis that affects the top and middle finger joints. I'm currently in a phase where the same joints on both hands are undergoing a slow and painful erosion of cartilage. The warming properties of these gloves, without a doubt, make the affected joints feel better, reducing pain and swelling, even after wearing for a brief period. There is compression, but not so much that makes the gloves hard to remove or uncomfortable to wear.The material is substantial with a red lining under the black. Since it's summer, I'm only wearing the gloves for a short time, and expect they will be great in colder weather to keep my fingers warm and supple.My only complaint is the finger length. I have small hands so the fabric comes very close to the fingertips and limits dexterity.I believe if this glove came in a thinner fabric they would be fine for work that requires more fingertip movement. Right now I'm satisfied with their therapeutic aspects and will continue to type, etc. without them and wear them for pain relief.
