review/text: I used dip-it to clean the awful stains from my white porcelain sink.I sprinkled the stuff on the bottom of the sink and filled it with about an inch and a half of boiling water.After 10 minutes I sloshed the water around which turned brown.When I let the water down the drain, I found the original white sink shining like new.Amazing stuff. I was sure that I needed to get a new sink. NOTHING got out the stainsuntil I rinsed with this miracle compound.
