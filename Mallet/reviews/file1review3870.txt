review/text: I have sensitive teeth so I expected to have some of the symptoms described in the reviews, but WOW ... I didn't know what I was in for. I would describe the the pain as sharp zaps that come and go. It is unlike any other tooth pain I've ever experienced, and I can see why some people would stop after their first encounter with this pain. I decided to stick it out anyway, and I'm glad I did. I saw results instantly, and by the last day my smile was perfect. A tip for anyone with sensitive teeth: clenching my jaw or rubbing the gum area directly below the affected teeth helped with the severity of the pain.
