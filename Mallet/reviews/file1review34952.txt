review/text: I started taking this product after an LFT (liver function test) came back with high liver enzymes (both ALT and AST were abnormally high). After 6 months of drinking vegetable juice (mainly Carrots, Celery, Beets, Parsley and Ginger) mixed with this powder, my liver enzymes were normal and stayed that way after 1 year. Highly recommended!!!
