review/text: My guess is that I am not alone in this experience, or maybe I am.This cartridge does a fine job - it MUST be used manually, as the product's name suggests.Without paying attention to this important difference, I turned on the power and experienced pain.If you read any reviews with the word "pain", that may be the reason.Happy shaving.
