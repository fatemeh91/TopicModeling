review/text: I have been happily using Panasonic's ER411 (not ER411NC) for the last few years. I use the trimmer daily due to a family curse (lol). The ER411 is the best trimmer I have ever used...and I tried them all. The ER411 trimmed hair very close to the skin. Well, I dropped my ER411 and the trimmer was dead. So, I purchased the ER411NC thinking the trimmers were the same. The trimmers are not the same.As other reviewers have stated, the ER411NC is a re-design of the ER411. The newer model does not work nearly as well as the older model. The newer model just ignores my annoying ear hair. Panasonic changed the blade design in the ER411NC. In an act of desperation, I replaced the cutting blades in my new ER411NC with the cutting blades from my dead ER411, now the trimmer works great. Great move Panasonic!If you need a trimmer that cuts hair close to the skin, the ER411NC is not a good choice.
