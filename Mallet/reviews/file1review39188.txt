review/text: I have used the Wahl 79524 3 times (actually my wife has used it on me) since recently purchasing it. Simply stated, the item works better than I had hoped and is very comfortable. I had been concerned about pulling/pinching etc., but there is none of that. It is actually nicer than going to the barber, not to mention much more convenient. A well produced instructional video comes with the product. I highly recommend this item.
