review/text: First off, let me say I LOVE the design and absorbancy is awesome BUT the velcro is not very sticky. My little guy had this diaper off in seconds. He awoke from his nap one day and pooped. He then took the diaper off and smeared it everywhere. I've never had him do this with any other velcro closures. The velcro comes apart as I put on his pants and when he crawls across the floor without pants on over it, it catches on our carpet and comes off of him. Again...I haven't had a problem with any other diapers that have velcro closures. Also, this diaper is definitely not a one size diaper. My little guy is 10 months and 25-30 pounds and this diaper was barely small enough. It still swallowed him up and there isn't a way to adjust the rise. All in all I am not impressed with the velcro though the version with snaps is a little better.
