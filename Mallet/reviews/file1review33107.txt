review/text: I like this product. It seems to work on cold like viral infections. My only caution would be to keep taking it a day or two after you think you are well. If I don't do that and the sickness comes back, it doesn't seem to respond to the wellness formula a second time. I discovered this stuff from my Doctor's (M.D.)recomendation. I went in there with a sore throat and fever about 16 years ago, hoping he'd prescribe me an anti-biotic. He said anti-biotic would do no good because I didn't seem to have a bacterial infection, but a virus. I asked if there wasn't something that would work. He thought for a minute and then recomended I try this stuff. I was very skeptical, but it worked.
