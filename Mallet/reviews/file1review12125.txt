review/text: If you have a problem swallowing large pills, this is on the med size of pill. Otherwise, great pill for the money. I am a little over halfway through my wifes pregnancy and she will be purchasing another bottle soon. She took these for a long period of time before even becoming pregnant. I think this is key (when possible) to avoiding getting sick off them. Most of the people who report getting sick or nauseous started taking these after becoming pregnant - not the best time to introduce so many new things to your already rapidly changing body! One other note: this product contains Vitamin D2, NOT D3. I also supplement D3 in the fall and winter months because it is superior and helps me greatly. Just a thou!
