review/text: I have been suffering from a grade I ankle sprain due to Canyon Trail Running since the tail end of November of this year. I knew I had to purchase something in order to stabilize my ankle so it could be properly set and heal from over stretched lateral ankle ligaments-OUCH! This brand was the least expensive compared to the other makes in amazon. I received the tape on time as mentioned, and I also eventually visited a general doctor to get a further analysis if anything may be broken after I unfortunately, resprained my ankle after the 11th day of the first sprain. I didn't need x-rays (thank-god) nothing was broken. I had this wrap around my ankle a tad before the Dr visit. It is very beneficial; it stretches and or gives like the material of lycra. Breathability, and enough give to allow some movement, but still keeping the ankle stable. After binding my ankle, this wrap self sticks and stays in place; no need for those prickly clasps that tend to gouge into the sensitive skin of one's foot. I highly recommend this product if anyone has stretched ligaments and needs some stability with alloted movement to their injured area.
