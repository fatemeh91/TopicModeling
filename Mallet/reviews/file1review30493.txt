review/text: I can't imagine anyone not having success w dermalogica if used correctly. A good product is probably going to break your face out at first bc all of the impurities will come to the surface. Also, if you've never used dermalogica before, you shouldn't just pick the product that you "think" will work for you, you need to go to a dermalogica skin care store and let and aesthetician recommend the correct product for your skin. I have tried different products from time to time, but ALWAYS go back to dermalogica. You get what you pay for, and that remains true with ALL of dermalogica's products.
