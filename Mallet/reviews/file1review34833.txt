review/text: Great product. Very little mess and incredibly easy to use. The only things you should know are that the product you will get is the Shelly brand, not the Shweta brand pictured. I would also make sure you have a paper towel ready when you open the tube, because the henna paste will start flowing out as soon as you puncture the opening. Some reviewers said that it isn't very dark on there skin, but I have very light colored skin and it shows up wonderfully on my skin. When I use up this tube, I will definitely buy this product again!
