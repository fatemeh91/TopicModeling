review/text: Miracle Greens-Nutrient-Rich Super Food Supplement, 30ozMiracle Greens : One scoop a day equals 5 servings of healthy fruits and vegetables. Even though I love veggies, it's difficult to get enough nourishment to equal the daily recomended amounts. I have tried several other products, most of which taste like garden soil (yuck!). But Miracle Greens is pleasant tasting and mixes well with fruit juice and health shakes. I am blessed to continue this product at a cost much lower than retail stores. So glad I found it on Amazon.com.
