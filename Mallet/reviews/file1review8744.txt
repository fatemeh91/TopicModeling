review/text: I didn't learn about Sugilube until I was reading a review on a toy I was considering. Well ... I decided for $5.00 what the heck. Awww ... what a difference. I have tried ten different kinds of lubes and each one has been a disappointment. They were either too greasy, to thin, to expensive, something. But this stuff is excellent, for me anyway. It gives all of my toys the slip they need. It washes off easily with no mess. I would have given it ten stars if could. But I cannot so ... I purchased 5 more tubesSurgilube Lubricating Jelly, Flip Top Tube, Eachs.
