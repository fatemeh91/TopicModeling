review/text: That's right, this bad-boy has seen some pretty heavy action and is still in really good condition. The battery lasts for a while after a charge (enough for a two week road trip) after about 3 years of (bi)weekly use. I love this trimmer. I have had no problems with it at all. To be honest, I don't mess with the length adjustment, I always shave with the plastic head off. It keeps the hair short, but still gives a scruffy man look that women love (without scratching too much).I would recommend this trimmer for everyone with a beard who wants to keep it in control, or who has a beard and does not want a beard (but hates shaving with a razor) or just wants the scruffy look. It works great for keeping your "privates" in check too.This trimmer just works, and it just works well. Don't waste your time on anything else.
