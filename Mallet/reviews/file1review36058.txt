review/text: Do not buy if you have a sense of smell or taste buds. i read the reviews and saw that it tasted bad but i figured it would be ok, i was wrong. it smells like man juice and it taste horrible!!! the ONLY way you can take it is with orange juice. the jug says take with juice or water, dont even attempt to take with water. dont buy, go with the pill form. i wont be buying again, i dont even know if i can finish the jug i have. otherwise great amino acid and the more economical choice.
