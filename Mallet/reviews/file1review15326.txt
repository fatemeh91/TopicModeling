review/text: This product isn't bad in terms of effectiveness, but its strong and NAUSEATING SMELL literally made me gag. It smells sickeningly sweet like a pound of saccharine or something. What the heck were the manufacturers thinking when they think that this is an ok smell to put on one's face?! Sigh, I still have 3 jars left...I have only put this on my hands so far because I can't stand the smell.
