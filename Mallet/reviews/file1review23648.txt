review/text: This item is very handy if you have to take pills many times a day! It's a bit pricey (my reason for 4 stars) but I think they have the market cornered with this item. I like that you can have up to 24 alarms (one per hour) every day. The alarms can only be set "on-the hour" but it's all right. simply shift your pill schedule to fall upon the hour. This company shipped FAST !! (had it in 2 days)
