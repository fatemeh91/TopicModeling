review/text: I'm having my 3rd child and really didn't want to buy anymore maternity stuff but I was getting desperate and was looking for some way to alleviate my back pain. When I first got it at around 32 weeks, I really didn't see any benefit to it but now that I'm at 34 weeks, I really feel a difference. I didn't think this old skool looking contraption was going to do anything but it did. It has adjustable &#34;bra&#34; straps as well as an adjustable part at the bottom to support your growing belly. It washes well too! I do agree with the other buyers who've said that the top straps are visible when wearing any kind of top. I just use safety pins to hold it in place. I love wearing this and am so glad that I made this purchase. It makes a world of difference.
