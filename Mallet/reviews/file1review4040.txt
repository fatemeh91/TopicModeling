review/text: Cartridges are replaced without ever touching them. They snap right into the Fusion razor and can be replaced by just pushing the button on the cartridge. They last about 2-3 weeks and always give a smooth no-nick shave. Gillette has come up with the perfect razor and perfect blade replacement system.
