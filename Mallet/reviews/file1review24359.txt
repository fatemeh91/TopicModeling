review/text: Your body has a finite amount of "ready to use" energy (blood sugar, liver glycogen, etc). Fat calories are pretty much a constant burn rate. Go faster, you use more blood sugar/liver glycogen. Go long enough and use use up the "ready to use" and the next source is protein. If you have run a marathon and "hit the wall", then you know what running out of the "ready to use" energy feels like.When I go longer than one hour, I like to bring calories with me to avoid this. The hotter it is, the more those calories tend to be liquid (Gatorade, etc.). The cooler it is, I like the gels and a little water to dilute them to keep absorption good. If you eat too much gel and not enough water, you will get nauseated. Drink plain water to dilute to get rid of the feeling.I will rotate through different gel products for taste issues, but especially like the hammergel. Especially by the bottle to fill up flasks. Nice to have 500-600 calories in the palm of my hand during a run.Been using this product for several years for running, biking, and triathlons up to the Ironman.
