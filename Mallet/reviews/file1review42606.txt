review/text: I ordered this powder based on some positive reviews, and I'm VERY happy I did. I've tried MANY different powders over the years, and none had the good nutritional values (especially low low low cholesterol), BCAA's and such great taste. It's actually GOOD tasting, not just tolerable, like most other products. I had Vanilla, which is the easiest to taste off flavors, and I didn't get any. I personally throw a tablespoon of hot chocolate mix in as the company I ordered it from was out of chocolate at the time.Great product. I'll never use another unless they stop making it.
