review/text: I went through so many potty seats when training my children. For my boy, having the shield build-in was key. At one time, I had one with a removable shield and it kept falling in the toilet. This one also has an adjuster for different sized toilets. It fits long bowls as well as the smaller ones. It was very durable as well.
