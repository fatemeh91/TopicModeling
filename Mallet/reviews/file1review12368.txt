review/text: Product was supposed to be two packages of powder and a bottle. When received the two packages of powder was wet mush and one had broken and was all inside of the box. Contacted a very nice person at Instagone and he informed me that I was not the first to complain to them. It seems that &#34;As seen on TV products&#34; was selling their Instagone that was 8 years old. He was nice enough to replace the two packages and it worked as advertised. Never again will I buy anything from &#34;As seen on TV products&#34;.
