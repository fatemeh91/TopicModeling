review/text: I am the disabled mom of 3 teens/young adults--I physically cannot scrub the shower (can't bend/twist) and my kids are lousy at cleaning showers.We first put a unit in the master bath shower (glass walls/door -- miracle! It took about 2 weeks for the build up to disappear -- just as the insert said. I'm the last to use this shower daily so it's used after my shower. The _only_ downside is that it doesn't reach quite to the top of the shower walls, but that part still looks great since I do 'scrub' it monthly (with a scrubber on a telescoping handle since I cannot bend to get to the floor). It has been in this shower for nearly a year and I have NEVER used any other cleaner in it yet. And I just changed the batteries for the VERY FIRST TIME yesterday!A month later we put a unit in the kid's bath/shower combo -- which to say the least was a mess. It did take about a month to dissolve the scum and it doesn't reach to the top 12 inches of the back wall, but it's a HUGE improvement over what was for sure! The shower curtain liner is a 'mildew proof' one that we throw into the washer about twice a year -- it looks great and no more build up on it at all. We have found that the tub part needs to be scrubbed (we use baking soda) about once a month -- not too surprising since the directions say to clean the shower once a month anyways. We're still on the original batteries on this one.For less than $10.00 a month for refills (watch for coupons and it's even less) this has been one of the best cleaning product investments I've made.Having clean showers even tho I can't do the bending/twisting to scrub them has been a true godsend. I've recommended this to a friend with similar spine/mobility issues and it's worked great for her too.
