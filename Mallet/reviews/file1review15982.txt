review/text: I bought this thing a few years ago and really didn't use it much. I just found it in a drawer and decided I should look up some reviews to see how many other people bought and hated it. Seriously, you're throwing away over 100 bucks if you get the same piece of garbage I got. The first 20 times I used it, it seemed SOMEWHAT consistent.... and I use that term loosely. As in I could have a few drinks and blow a .04 one time, then a few minutes later I might blow .07 and anywhere in between if I would keep trying. At some point I tried blowing into it without having ANY drinks and it would show .04. I just fired it up now to see if it still worked and with no drinks I blew a .05 and had one drink, tried again and got two readings in a row of .4, I mean legally dead kind of numbers. I know I know, it's time to replace the sensor, but why bother if the thing was always inconsistent and all over the place from day one. My recommendation would be that if you really need an accurate meter, spend good money for a quality unit, or just don't bother, because this one really is worthless. Be safe people.Ciao
