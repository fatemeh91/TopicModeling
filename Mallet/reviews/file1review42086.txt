review/text: I was recommended by a friend who said this would really help with belly support and back pain. In my 7th month and at 116 pounds, I ordered the Extra Petite. I wore it to work the day I got it and it was super tight. Painfully tight on the belly, but the back support was fantastic. I took a couple days off and tried it again and magically it felt 10X better, although I would recommend ordering a size up to avoid this initial discomfort since mine is still a bit snug, but not painfully so. It doesn't work well when sitting as it can dig into the belly or thighs even, although it forces great posture, but it surely helps when walking or standing, only it does make you rather stiff and nearly incapable of bending or squatting (I simply took a knee when picking up objects on the floor) It also helped take the strain of the weight off my belly and helped reduce swelling in my legs as well as prevented about 95% of contractions while working or simply walking. Personally, this product has been wonderful for me and I think every woman should try it out for their own personal benefits around the second trimester. I wish I had gotten one sooner!
