review/text: I read about DIM several years ago. Apparently, all is still true, DIM, from Broccoli, will turn your bad estrogens into HDL: good, helpful estrogen/cholesterol going to your liver, and bad coming from your liver. So does Flush Free Niacin which lowered my cholesterol 60 points in 6 months and lowered lipoproteins (LP's) which are very damaging to us. This broccoli extract is a boon to women's reproductive organs as it will clear cysts, change your cholesterol ratio of HDL to LDL and lipoproteins.They are further lowered with the Niacin. L.P.'s are even more damaging to heart disease than cholesterol levels. I take both. This DIM product comes with powder from broccoli and a few other vegetables. However, I would still munch on a couple of broccoli flowerettes/cauliflower a week (RAW). Very good products to keep in a woman's house. I have read extensively on this and had excellent blood cholesterol and breast cyst results from DIM and probably also the way I was instructed to use Flushfree Niacin from a health book I have from Bastyr University in Oregon.
