review/text: I bought 100% Whey protein the double chocolate flavor today because I couldn't get to a store that sells my usual Jay Robb protein. I have to say the taste is not even close to what I'm use to. Its not repulsive or anything but Jay Robb's protein taste is way better. For some reason Jay Robbs even makes me feel more.... fuller....satisfied.Glad I just bought the small 1 lb.
