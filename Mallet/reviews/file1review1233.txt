review/text: Ugh I hate tweezing! This is the very first time I ever tried cold wax strips and I'm very pleased by the results. If you follow the easy instructions inside the box, this is a relatively painless product, compared to tweezing. It's fast, easy, simple, lasts a long time (compared to tweezing) and is a great price and value. I would purchase again for sure.
