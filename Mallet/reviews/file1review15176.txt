review/text: Sometimes this item comes fresh and sometimes it tastes and looks like it has been sitting around for a while, crumbly and poor tasting sometimes even try. Never had this issue when i bought at the local store. I like the deal but the quality isn't consistent almost like they send out items for subscription without any care, bottom of the barrel.
