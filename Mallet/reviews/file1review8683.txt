review/text: It might be good to review how to best pack this admittedly difficult-shaped object for shipping. I got the broom and the first thing I used it for was to sweep up some plastic pieces that had broken off from the base during shipping (the packaging was essentially sticky plastic sheeting wrapped around the broom twice). The broom works well and I'm not going to bother returning it, but there wasn't the normal "ooh, something new" feeling . . .
