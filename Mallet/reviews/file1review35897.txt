review/text: When allergy season starts, I get pretty miserable and stay that way for a long time.I've found that once I've taken this for a while, everyday, that my allergy symptoms diminish.It's not a magic bullet, because there are times when I do get sneezing fits and whatnot. Overall, however, things are a lot better while I am taking quercetin.
