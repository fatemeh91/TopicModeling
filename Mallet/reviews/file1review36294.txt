review/text: I bought this to use for my child. I had wanted to try the ear type thermometer for a while. The first two reading seemed to be correct but after that it was horrible. The readings were all over the place on multiple uses, and were not reliable at all. It is also hard to tell if the probe is positioned in the childs ear correctly. The batteries did not last long either. I do not like or trust this thermometer and am must happier and confident with the plain old stick thermometer. I do NOT recommend this product.
