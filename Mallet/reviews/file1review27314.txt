review/text: This was just the protein I was looking for. For the quality it was a great price, I had to switch from a more expensive protein because I was going through it too fast. I ordered Chocolate Malt flavor, and I was nervous about the taste, but was very surprised it has a great taste. Mixes very well, no stomach aches, overall a great product.
