review/text: I started using this the day I recieved it in the mail. I had 3 ..one larger and 2 smaller plantars warts on the bottom of my foot. I have had them for years and did'nt know what they were until I did research and figured out what they were. I have been using this stick every day 2 times a day. It has been about a month and a half and they are GONE! I also used a file to take off the dead skin and would wipe alcohol on it before applying acid stick again. Keep using and do not give up. THIS WORKS Great!
