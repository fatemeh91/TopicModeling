review/text: It looks very promising, with competitive price. However, the experience largely depends on who is using it. The rabbit's vibration worked out fine, but the steady movement of the head and the beads wears off pretty quickly in that a getting used to stops any stimulus. Even though it is adequate in size, fully insertion might not be possible if the partner simply hate the rubber.
