review/text: I have tried many different green drinks before and am used to eating and drinking unpleasant tasting things for the health benefits alone but this was just too aweful, I could barely get it down. I really wanted to try it because the ingredients look great, one of the best I have seen but I just can not tollerate the taste. I thought the addition of stevia would help but it couldn't really cover up the very stong taste.
