review/text: After trying other prenatal vitamins, i went back to these &#34;Just Once Prenatal&#34;. First, I like that it's one tablet that I only need to take once a day. Many of the other brands you actually have to take a tablet 2 or 3 times a day just to get the full dosage. Second, taking the full dosage does not give me a headache or make me nauseous like some of the other brands.Some of the reviews I read said they felt less tired when they take these versus when they don't take it (or forget to take it). I tested this theory out and there is a little truth behind it. I definitely don't get that mid-day crash when I take this but I don't get a major boost of energy either. I think it helps maintain my energy throughout the day.A complaint I've read was that it doesn't contain 100% of the RDA of Calcium. This wasn't quite a deal breaker for me because I have a good amount of calcium in my diet. I usually have 4-5 servings of high calcium foods in a day. And if I feel I'm not getting enough in a day, I'll take a Tums that day.I'm really happy with this prenatal vitamin and highly recommend it over the other brands out there.
