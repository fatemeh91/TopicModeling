review/text: I got these as a shower present, and I was all "what the heck am I going to do with these? I'm using disposables!" Various moms at the shower told me these were invaluable for lots of non-diaper uses, and sure enough, within a week of my daughter being born I had ordered two more packs of these (almost the only thing I actually bought MORE of). They've been variously useful for burping pads (folded up), nursing pads (I had a lot of overproduction), wiping up baby spit, impromptu bib, and security blanket (how awesome is it that my baby has a supply of thirty security blankets... if one gets dirty or lost, there's always another one!). When she grows out of them I'm planning on using them as rags, if there's anything left of them. Just so pleased.
