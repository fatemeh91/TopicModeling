review/text: It's easy to use, and once you've determined your correct dosage for the 7-day cleanse portion of it, you'll be amazed and how much "stuff" falls out of you. Admittedly, it's not the greatest conversation topic, so I had to stop myself from talking about it to my family, but it was truly astounding to me and I wanted to share that with them.I took it upon myself to extend the initial 7 days to about 9 days because I had never done a colon cleanse before. I've just finished up yesterday, and although I'd run out of capsules and had none to take last night, I STILL had 5 BMs today even though I only ate once yesterday. So, it's definitely gotten things moving in the right direction. Side note: you definitely have to drink a lot of water, otherwise it doesn't work as well.If there was any drawback to it, it's that after 7 days, I began to have a little pain in the affected areas because I don't think the elimination system is designed to get rid of so much waste so often. It was kind of like workout pain after not working out for an extended period, but it only happened the day before I took my last capsules, and it only lasted one day. I've had no pain since, and in a way it's a good thing that I had the pain because it really let me know that this stuff does what it says it will do.My overall after-effects are, a much smaller waistline, a clearer head, more energy, a higher sex drive, I feel great, I don't need to eat as much, and best of all, I've lost approximately 6 pounds or more of the worst kind of weight. I'm sure I've added to my lifespan, and I'll order this again as soon as I can. I read somewhere that you should do at least a 30 day cleanse your first time out, but frankly, I'm tired of sitting on the toilet and I could use a week-long breather. Regardless of that, when I get my new supply, I'll do another 9-10 day cleanse to get at the remaining impaction and be done with it until next year sometime.
