review/text: This is my first time purchasing protein for myself, being that I am on a diet, and I was not disappointed. I didn't know what flavor to purchase because they all seem so tasty (just by reading the name) so I decided to go with: extreme milk chocolate and my hubby took rocky road. I first tried with half 1% milk and half water and it tasted like cold "hot chocolate," which was not bad at all. I just prefer it warm. Now, I can drink it with water only and I even add oats and its delish! I even took a scoop of my hubby's and its great too! I am able to drink it cold and warm and adding oats makes it a great way breakfast. I am happy with my purchase and have a faster more healthier way of starting my day.My hubby drinks protein on a regular. He has tasted them all! and for him to say this brand and flavor (rocky road) is good, means a lot!Extreme milk chocolate: Great chocolate taste, mixes well with both water and milk (warm or cold), delicious, and filling. **if warming do not make too hot...mine got a little lumpy and when blending it, it turned foamy**Rocky Road: Light chocolate taste, mixes well with water or milk (warm or cold), tastes great.
