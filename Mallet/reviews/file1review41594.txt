review/text: Disregard reviews that say it's not worth the extra money. The price on this toothbrush is now in the $60 range and WELL worth it. I just got this toothbrush, well, yesterday actually. I've only used it twice but so far I LOVE it. My teeth are already noticeably whiter and cleaner. I actually kept going after the two minute time buzzed because it was doing such a nice job. It says in the manual that it can make your gums bleed for the first two weeks or so (if you didn't use an electric toothbrush previously), but I had it on the "Sensitive" setting and it was fine--no bleeding! I really really like the toothbrush. Almost all electric toothbrushes over $50 or so get great reviews because they are all pretty good! The real difference for me is the price...this one ran me $67.99 and I think it was worth every penny! The 30 second quadrant alarm is pretty nice, but I usually brush my teeth for a total of 4 minutes so I do two rounds on each quadrant! If you can get it for around $60-70, you are doing well. The setup is easy and using the toothbrush is easy too. A GREAT investment in your dental health. LOVE IT!
