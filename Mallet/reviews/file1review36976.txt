review/text: Showed up in a wonderful padded envelope for safe travels. The wheel is exactly what I was looking for, sharp enough tips to get a reaction, but will only draw blood with pressure. The handle is nice to fit into my small hands but would still work for much larger hands. Has a heafty weight to it, but still easy to control and easily moved about over the skin.
