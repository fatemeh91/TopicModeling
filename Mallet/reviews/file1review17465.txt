review/text: I bought this trimmer after reading many favorable reviews about it. Previously I had been using a Remington PG-200 which was alright, but the attachments that it came with left much to be desired. The plastic pins that secured them to the timmer broke off and left them virtually useless. I am very happy with the MB-200, it's easy to use and clean. It does a good job of trimming my beard and doesn't give a choppy uneven cut like I was getting with the other trimmer. I highly recommend this trimmer.
