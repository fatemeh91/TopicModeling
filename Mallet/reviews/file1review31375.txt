review/text: I have suffered with Rosacea for my entire life..a couple of years ago I came across this wonderful product..I only wish that I had researched a relief product years ago..this product does work wonders for me..its cool to the skin when applying..also I have noticed that when I have a flair up they are mild..no longer do I get the flaming red cheeks or neck..I recommend this product to anyone who is tired of the embarrassing results of Rosacea.You will be quite pleased!
