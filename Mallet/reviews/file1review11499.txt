review/text: If people with really good trimmers saw how I operated with this trimmer they'd probably laugh. You have to go over and over and over the same spot to cut your beard with any semblance of uniformity. Also you have to be careful to apply equal pressure each time or your cut could be spotty because of the spring loaded guide. Also as others have said if you want a close trim, you will probably end up looking like a bad joke with plenty of skin showing.The design is bad, and the battery croaked after a few years of use(while religiously following the use/recharge guide).Kind of annoying but probably for the best, since I can get a better unit now.When you look at the selection of 115-220 volt travel trimmers its no wonder that Norelco is producing garbage theres almost no competition. If any companies are reading this you have a wide opening to take on Norelco.
