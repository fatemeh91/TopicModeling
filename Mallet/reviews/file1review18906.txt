review/text: My daughter is severely lacotse intolerant and we cannot find this good tasting(better alternative to lactaid)in town anywhere. So, we buy it in bulk. I accidentally used another vendor on Amazon the time before last when we ordered. However, this time, we found this vendor again. They are by far the best choice. They delivered quickiest and their prices are better if you are buying in bulk. Thank you!
