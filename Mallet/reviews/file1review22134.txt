review/text: I bought this at Target recently. I wondered why they were all on sale. I love the lotion and the light scent, so I got the baby oil. I have not stopped itching since putting it on a couple of days ago. I need to change my linen, etc. Something in this oil is causing me to itch. I saw that others were having the same problem on other sites.
