review/text: I've tried my fair share of protein powders and have to say this is one of the best.The POSITIVE:Good Taste - The Double Chocolate tastes more like rich chocolate milk then the generic brands.Mixes Well - This is a big one for me... I hate when there's chunks no matter how well you try to mix it. This Gold Standard Whey protein seems to mix well, especially if you blend it.Cost - The price isn't too bad especially if you buy the 5 pound container. It's not as cheap as you'd find some generic brands, but there's a reason it's cheaper.The NEGATIVE:Nothing I can really think of... I'm strictly speaking about the Double Chocolate flavor though.OVERALL:It's a great protein powder. I definitely recommend it to everyone.
