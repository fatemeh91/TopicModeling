review/text: Wonderful ingredients, super moisturizer, and beautiful fragrance. Reminds me of hikes through a botanical garden in the tropical forests of Maui! I loved the heavenly fragrance of the white ginger plants. This brings me right back to those gardens and the scent of those lovely blossoms! I use this oil instead of lotion and it absorbs and moisturizers nicely.
