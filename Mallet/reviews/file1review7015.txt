review/text: The Wahl 7367-500 works great. I use the meduim head attachment and I get a very close and smooth shave just like my last Wahl which died after 4 years of use. I don't consider my last Wahl shaver lasting 4 years to be a problem given the price. One thing though, the side burn trimmer is very loud and it can be quite disturbing to hear first thing in the morning. I'm sure I'll get use to it though. For the price this is a Great shaver!
