review/text: this case rocks, it does hold "bunches"... most of my friends want one too. it's hilarious. plus sturdy and protective of satan's cotton fingers..lol. it survives in my purse.. and that's saying a lot as I'm pretty rough with my stuff.. V's tamp case is holding up and my tamps aren't all squished and beat up. rock on vinnie!
