review/text: Best out there! My mom absolutely loves it and my roommates were impressed. I left my mom what was left and she asked for more just lately. Roommates mom uses Melaluca(I think thas how you spell it) and stuff leaves streaks and residue. Only wiped window once and they came clean and shocked them. I will only use this window cleaner!
