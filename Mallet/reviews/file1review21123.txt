review/text: I was looking for a pad that actually got hot and covered a large surface area. Most of the ones from drug stores remind me of plastic wash rags. This one is awesome. Its huge!, and the sucker packs some serious heat. I have to turn it off after a few minutes because the heat is almost unbearable. It does its job. The best heating pad I have ever tried.
