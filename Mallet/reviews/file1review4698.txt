review/text: Ok so like other mine didnt have a experation date... 866-617-4273 herbalife! So I got the number from amazon. IT was really complacated. At the bottem of the container of your shakes thiers a number the third number in is the year so if its a 0 thats the year it was made not the experation date but the year it was made then the next three numbers you subtract 300 ! wierd right anyays mine was723 so it came to 323 so march 23 2010 is the date it was made it is good for two years from that date if not opeaned. so mine is march 23 2012 and it is good for ayear once you opean it so thats how it works in case eveyone needs to know its complicated but if I did a bad job of explaining it the number is the number at the top that icallled they will explain it hope this helps people!
