review/text: After all the reading I did of all the reviews and comments, I was SURE I made the right decision for this heating pad.However, no one mentioned that there were ONLY TWO settings for it: OFF and BLOW-TORCH!!Yes, I had already thought carefully about the weird switch that I knew HAD to be HELD DOWN THE ENTIRE TIME you want heat. I reasoned this out, "No big deal,...I'll get a rubber band to hold down the switch for me...then I can just relax and allow the heat to relax these awful spasms,...right?"Oh, no! Within seconds, your SKIN is on fire, and no, it is NOT relaxing. **OMG!! FOLKS, there is NO DIAL TO ADJUST THE HEAT AT ALL!** You feel one of two things: "COLD"... or "FIRE"... and, you have to stay very alert to turn the switch off when the intense heat hits you!Also, the enclosed instructions WARN YOU NOT to wrap this pad inside another insulating blanket, or towel,.... something I immediately had considered, before reading it. Seriously, it says that putting a barrier between the pad and your skin could start a "FIRE", ...After only a few minutes of the heat, I have no doubt this COULD happen.Other than that, this Thermophore is constructed with great quality of workmanship...both the pad and the cover. I get the feeling it is made for professionals who know what they are doing.The superior construction is just no comparison with the cheap, no-good Soft Heats we bought for $20 at WallyWorld. (Three of them broke withing 4 months.)This Thermophore would be perfect if they would have just researched what people WANT in a heating pad...operating controls with good visibility and ease of use.If only there was a DIAL...to adjust the heat of hell to a reasonable level.Thank you Amazon for making it so easy to make a return. All I had to do is print the label and get the box to the UPS drop. I love Amazon!
