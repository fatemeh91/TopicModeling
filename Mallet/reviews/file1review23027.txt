review/text: This Knee support is SO much better than the one I've been wearing for over a year! It is easier to put on, (my husband had to put the other one on me), I can do it myself!I have had it on all day, and I've been able to get up from a chair with no pain, walk through the house with no pain!I really do like the design and the lightness of the brace!Thanks!
