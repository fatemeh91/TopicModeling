review/text: Nature's Way Oregano Oil along with lots of Vitamin C was recommended by my holistic doctor to keep my stage one cancer in remission. The plus side of NW Oil is that it has no side effects or interference with other meds. Plus, it actually cuts down on lactose intolerance so I can enjoy yogurt again. Feaked out when you ran out of it awhile back!
