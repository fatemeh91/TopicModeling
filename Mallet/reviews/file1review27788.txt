review/text: Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard is without a doubt the best product on the market for anyone looking for a protein drink that has solid nutrients, is low in sugar/fats/calories, and concentrates on giving the consumer a product that uses the best most expensive whey protein. Optimum Nutrition creates high-end products that prove great results all while managing to provide their products at affordable prices in comparison to the ingredients they use. The 100% Whey Gold Standard comes in a myriad of delicious flavors; I highly recommend the chocolate flavors if you plan to simply drink the protein straight. If you are like me and you love to spruce up your protein drink by adding fruit, oatmeal, milk, yogurt, etc. then I recommend the vanilla and fruit flavors. Studies show that whey protein is an extremely important nutrient for muscle recovery and Optimum Nutrition provides a top-notch whey protein drink that is sure to keep you feeling sustained and energized all while doing what whey protein does best, helping the body recover from any workout and building long-lasting lean muscle!
