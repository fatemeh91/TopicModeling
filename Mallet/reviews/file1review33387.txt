review/text: These blades are a little too mild for my taste. My facial hair is on the thicker side so when I made a pass with the Merkur blade I could feel it tugging away. I had to make multiple passes in order to get my face nice and smooth. The result of these multiple passes was horrible road rash and a quite a bit of blood. Stepped over to Feather blades and they work like butter.
