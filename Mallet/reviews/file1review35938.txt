review/text: I noticed a difference from the first time using this toothbrush. I can't wait to see what my dentist has to say in a couple more months when I go to my regular 6 month appointment. You don't have to push hard when using the toothbrush my mouth and teeth don't feel like it has a lot of plaque anymore! After using at bedtime I feel like I don't have morning breathe my mouth feels cleaner for longer period of time!
