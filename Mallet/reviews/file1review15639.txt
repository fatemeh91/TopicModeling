review/text: My wifes navigator broke and the wheels fell off and she fell and hurt her self badly. They are very unsafe and I do not recommend it to anyone. The wheel fell off twice and i had to drill it out and put new better hardware on it. Then before I trashed it the other wheel literally busted in the middle nad collapsed and almost tossed her out again. The company had us sign a release with the promise of a replacement transport chair but did not ever honor their offer.The company scammed us and would not replace the chair. Do not buy or deal with that company or buy this unsafe chair for you will regret it.
