review/text: There a a few things that me and my wife like about these.First, when I bought them I was glad to have so many choices of colors and patterns. I actually found something that matched our bedspread. So if they're just lying out, it blends in with the room and doesn't make it look messy. And she's just likes that it matches.More importantly, the fit is great. With the adjustable velcro strap, she's able to get just the right tightness where it'll block out the light and stay on, but not so tight is keeps her from sleeping comfortably. On top of that, they're sleak ... not bulky. So lying on her side or stomach is still comfortable.So we highly recommend these.
