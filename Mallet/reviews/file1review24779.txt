review/text: I bought a bottle of Hoodoba 750 mg a year ago, I wanted to loose weight before my wedding, these pills worked so good, I had no desire to eat I always felt full, it was a miracle. This year in October I bought the 3 bottle package and half way through my second bottle I was not noticing a change in my appetite. I contacted strictly health and I explained to them my situation and I received an email from a representative telling me '"This appears to happen every one in every thousand situations where the body seems to reset itself". ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? I only took this product one time a year ago , how can my body reset itself? He recommended for me to "Try doubling the dosage from what you took last time. Do this for at least one week straight or until the saturation point is reached which would then allow it to kick in for you. " THIS WOULD MEAN I WOULD BE TAKING TWELVE OF THESE PILLS.... Of course at $60 a bottle it is clear that I was going to need to buy more which was in his best interest not mine.... Well it's been two weeks already and nothing has been done for me. I will not stop until I get a full refund. It's too bad the pills did not work this time all I honestly wanted was for them to work...
