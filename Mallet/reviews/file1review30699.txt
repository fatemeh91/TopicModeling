review/text: It's funny, but the older I got, the more retro I started getting; at least with shaving. Classic old time double edge blade razors like this one give a much better shave than the current trend of adding more and more blades to (expensive) replacement cartridges. The last time I bought a pack and finally realized they ran around $2 a cartridge I got out my grandfather's old double edge and found it gave just as good a shave. I decided to invest in the Merkur Classic (more finally crafted than grandpa's shaver) and have been extremely happy with the results. The initial cost may be more, but you will save money in the long run.Be sure to get good blades. Merkur's stainless steel blades work well. They are still 1/4 the price of the Mach 3.
