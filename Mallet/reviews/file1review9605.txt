review/text: Just do not put them in the fridge. They become solid bricks and are difficult to chew. Taste is similar to a candy bar. No after taste of whey, or powdery chalk taste. I'd buy them again though I prefer Detour bars.Edit: Just ordered "Mud Pie Fusion" and they do not taste as good as "Chocolate Chocolate Chunk."
