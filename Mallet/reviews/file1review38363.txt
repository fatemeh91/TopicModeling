review/text: Holy Cow Batman - IT HURTS ! But it also works ! Wish I had tried this years ago. Did my legs and arms in about 30 mins. Only thing better is Laser Hair removal, which I did on underarms and bikini about 7 years ago and still no hair regrowth. That is no joke also, it feels like someone is snapping a rubber band on you but sooo worth it. My tips if you do Laser - pay a flat price for hair removal usually 6 treatments so the incentive is to get rid of your hair, if you pay per session - the incentive is to drag it out for more $$. If it doesn't hurt like hell, then the technician isn't putting it high enough. That's just my opinion. I didn't do my legs with the laser because it was fairly new and the price was too high, also my legs are tan. Laser works best on light skin with dark hair. Back to this Epilator - I chose it over the Braun because of mostly positive reviews here so THANK YOU to all of you who took the time to review. LOVE THIS EPILATOR !
