review/text: I bought this Valeo Yoga Kit almost two years ago. At the time I purchased it, it was significantly cheaper price than it is now. That still didn't make it a good deal, however.Where to start? The mat of course comes with a slippery Chinese manufacturing goo that smells terrible and has to be washed off. I'm betting this residue is toxic, and exactly the opposite of what you want from yoga. The manufacturer should consider the use of the product when making this stuff. Anyway, even after washing the mat by hand, it continued to smell like a combination of cat urine and acrid sweat for the remainder of its life.The next problem with the mat is that it's of terrible quality. It's ridiculously thin and, compared to other mats of similar construction, not durable at all. This mat is basically the lowest density neoprene available, and it tears or shears anytime something rubs against it. Even my perfectly-trimmed toenails gouge chunks out of this mat in Downward Dog. Sliding a hand across it causes abrasion. It's cheap junk, and if you're on a hard floor, this mat will not be enough padding at all.Lastly, the mat carrying bag is made to last perhaps a week, if that. It's a bag in name only, if you can call some pieces of fabric stitched together a "bag."Anyway, buy theYogaAccessories 1/4" Extra Thick Deluxe Yoga Matand get some blocks on the side. Together they're cheaper, and you can figure out some way to carry the stuff around that's going to last longer than the junk bag in this Valeo Yoga Kit.
