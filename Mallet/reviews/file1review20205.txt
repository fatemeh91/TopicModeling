review/text: The black cherry concentrate makes a very nice drink...it can also be used to make cherry lemonade, etc. Since I have been drinking it regularly, I have not suffered a gout attack. The price was right, and I ordered 4 bottles at a time which lasted me a month or so; the price was right compared to various health food and vitamin stores. Unfortunately, there seems to be an issue with my Amazon "subscription" in which these are supposed to be sent automatically each month...I have stopped receiving them because of some "review" of the product.
