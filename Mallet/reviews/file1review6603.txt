review/text: Great for getting those touch to reach spots in your back between your shoulder blades!I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from muscle tightness in their upper back.I'm sure it's great for other areas of the body too, but this just happens to be the particular part I need to work on.The easiest part is that you leverage your own body weight to apply the pressure - so YOU can decide how soft or hard to press on the trigger point.Very happy with this product WHEN I can find the time to use it!
