review/text: I was having supply issues, so I was told to try Fenugreek. I saw measurable changes within 12 hours. For the next 2 weeks, my supply drastically improved with regular use of these capsules. It tapered off after that, but I was told to stop for a few days and restart, and it definitely boosted my supply again on the second restart. It is true; I did smell like maple syrup, but a small price to pay for being able to keep up with my baby's feeding demands.
