review/text: I'm sure I can rig a way to get the Velcro parts off my neck, but you'd think they would have considered this design element. It doesn't get or stay too cold--especially if you're up walking about and not leaning against a pillow or chair back to help target the cold therapy. You can add a second gel pack underneath this one to intensify the cold (or heat)
