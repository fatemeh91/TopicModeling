review/text: Let me preface my review with a little background info. I work 3 nights a week from 7pm - 7:30am. Needless to say, this reeks havoc on my sleep schedule. On my days off, I try to get up early and make the most of the day. Then come a work day, I have to make sure to get a solid 8 hours of sleep before heading into the office.I've tried all sorts of sleep aids; including Nyquil, Ibuprofin PM, and pretty much anything else you can get over the counter.I finally decided to try the natural route. I first tried the non time release melatonin and found that it does help me fall asleep rather quickly, but after a few hours of restful sleep, I would normally wake back up.***Enter Time Release Melatonin***Being an advocate for trial and error, I bought 2 different doses of TR Melatonin. 1mg and 3mg.The 1mg works ok for getting me to sleep, but the 3mg has been the ticket for staying asleep. I take one 3mg Time Release Melatonin about 15 - 20 minutes before I want to fall asleep and begin the countdown. No matter how restless I am prior to taking the pill, I am able to relax and fall asleep before you can get to 50 bottles of beer on the wall.***As an added bonus, my dreams have become much more vivid since I've begun using Melatonin. Before starting Melatonin, I would rarely, if ever remember my dreams in the AM. After melatonin, I am usually able to remember at least one dream from the night before, even on the days/nights that I don't take Melatonin.I am a 6'2" 180lb man, you may be able to work from there to figure out your proper dosage.
