review/text: Bought this for my elderly mother and myself. Been using this for several months now and she feels great and loves drinking this once a day.I think I wrote a review on this several months ago but just wanted to let others know that there is a new version out. Version 12.0 . I had just reordered our supply and just tonight noticed that the version on the bottle was newer and well to me the taste is better and looks more greener. It seems to mix much better as well.I loved version 10.3 but this 12.0 seems much nicer. I haven't looked on what the difference is yet but came on Amazon to look at the front advertised page to check out what at least in the picture of it shows and it still shows as being vrs 10.3 so perhaps they are shipping the newer ones out now but picture has yet to be updated? Anyways I would highly recommend getting the newer version.EDIT: Yep just checked the main site Vibrant health and they are selling version 12.0. Why is Amazon selling outdated products? Getting rid of older supply? Anyways I had just re-ordered this newest order of mine thinking version 10.3 was the newest and Amazon did send me the version 12.0 so perhaps they just did not change the picture? Be sure you check before ordering though. Nothing wrong with 10.3 but to me 12.0 is much better.
