review/text: I really like these. I'd been having metatarsal pain in one foot, and this cushion eases the pain when I walk. I'd been looking for a cushion that I didn't have to attach to the inside of my shoe. These are nice because they adhere to the bottom of your foot, so they can be worn with any shoe. Plus it can be washed at the end of the day and re-used, the adhesive comes right back and the cushion stays clean. I place it just below the ball of my foot, where the arch begins. If I get the placement wrong I just reposition it. I've had mine now for a few weeks, and it's still comfortable.
