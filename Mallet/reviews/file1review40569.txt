review/text: I weighed 188-189 pounds and I needed to lose about 8-9 pounds. I was taking other pills, but all they did was make me feel all hyper and gittery, I hated it. Since I started taking TrimSpa about 2 months ago, I am now down to 177 pounds and I feel great. I can't say my appetite went away, but I do get fuller more quickly, nor did I feel I had more energy, but I did lose the weight.
