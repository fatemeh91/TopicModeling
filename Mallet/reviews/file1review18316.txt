review/text: I started getting seriously fit in the last 4 months. This involves a personal trainer and working my body to the point I could never do on my own. I have found that after an hour workout, if I soak in a tub with this Elemis for 15 minutes, I AM NOT SORE.... When I don't have time to soak with Elemis, I AM VERY SORE FOR SEVERAL DAYS.Bottom line, when you have extended yourself physicaly, be it gardening, hiking, etc. a 10-15 minute soak afterwards will relieve any muscle pain.
