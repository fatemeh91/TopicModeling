review/text: I had such high hopes when I searched for this, and saw all the positive reviews! A good night sleep has eluded me for a long time..it said the bet results would be achieved after 2-3 nights..so i gave that a try...each successive night got worse...last night after being unable to relax i got up and was unable to fall asleep till 5 am. Not sure why this did not work since i know all the herbs in it are good for producing sleep..but it did not work for me at all.
