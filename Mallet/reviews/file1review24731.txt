review/text: It is very difficult to adjust the coverage area to exactly what you want. The image on the unit only only gives you an idea, it is not possible to adjust the oscillating angle on one side without changing the other side, and the maximum oscillating angle available when you have it on full coverage is not available if you only want partial coverage. I have spent close to half an hour each time trying to adjust it, and result is only partially satisfactory.
