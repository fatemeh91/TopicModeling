review/text: For the price, you get a lot out of this purchase for a beginning yogi. However, the main part, the mat, leaves a lot to be desired in terms of quality. For me, it is not thick enough or sticky enough compared with other mats. And the instructional wall-chart is pretty useless. But, can't beat getting a free bag and blocks!
