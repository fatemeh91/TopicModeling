review/text: I buy the double rich chocolate,the taste its very good mixed whit water its like a cocoa or ovaltine drink.The product mixed very well i dont need a blender,i use only a shaker cup.I drink this after my workouts(best moment for drink),and helps me to give some protein for my body 24 grams per scoop(its like eat a piece of chiken or meat).Use a combination of high protein foods and suplements for building muscle.I play basketball and go to the gym and this product its the best whey protein i drink.After 3 months of hard training i gained 5 lbs of muscle(specialy shoulders and biceps)OVERALL:TASTE:very good(go to the basics Chocolate,Vainailla,Strawberry)MIXING:dont need a blender if you shake whit waterPRICE:I buy 2 lbs. for $15 bucks its a giftDIGESTION:GoodPD:Trainig hard,eat good,drink whey(after your workouts)and sleep 8 hours,is the best way you bulding muscles.For 15 bucks you have a good dose of protein,sometimes the people spend this money in beer in weekends.
