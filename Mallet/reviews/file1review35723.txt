review/text: I have been suffering with severe dry eye and going to the doctor. He tried me on everything out there along with proper hygene. Nothing worked and I was continuing to get worse in a panic way. I found these eye drops and instantly felt better. It's like velvet on your eyesand doesn't take away your eye sight. The burning, sharp pains and grittiness in my eyes went away. I would highly recommend this and have also bought some for my dad. My eyes instantly new this is not chemically iritating. GREAT! GRREAT! GREAT!
