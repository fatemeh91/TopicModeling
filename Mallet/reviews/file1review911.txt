review/text: I purchased these in college because I was using my hands all the time for art projects (when cutting, sewing, using exacto-knives). Now, four years later, I have carpal tunnel syndrome for pregnancy in my right hand. This glove didn't help in alleviating the pain back then and it doesn't work for me now.
