review/text: I ordered the 3/4 to try them, as I always use the full length. I didn't like the 3/4 length because if you put it in your shoe with the insole of the shoe left in it takes up too much room. If you take the insole out there is room in the shoe, but you don't have any sole or cushion in the front of the shoe, and the transition from the orthotic to the sole of the shoe is uncomfortable. So I returned them and reordered the full length instead. Other than the length, they feel and do the job as the full length. Oh, by the way, I love that you can mold them to your specification.
