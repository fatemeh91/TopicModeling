review/text: This stuff isn't as sweet at other protein supplements I've had, but it mixes very well.In water alone, the flavor and sweetness is very light, which I really like, but in milk (I use non-fat lactaid) it is absolutely incredible. Like having an actually milkshake almost. Its awesome in Lactaid.
