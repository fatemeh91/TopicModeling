review/text: Having tried many variations from all the major condom brands (Trojan, Durex, Lifestyles) I can say with absolute confidence that this is the best condom I've ever used. Thin but very durable, they beat all the competition on feeling, safety, and especially price. 7 or 8 dollars for a 12 pack (more if it's a convienience store or pharmacy)? Try 15 dollars for a 100 pack! Really, make the purchase and try them out.
