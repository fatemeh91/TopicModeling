review/text: Our experience is that people who are rather unsteady (wobbly), like my wife and I, may tend to trip over the base of this cane. For them a walker or rollator would be much safer. Also, the feet on this cane do not sit evenly on the floor, which doesn't inspire confidence, although it probably doesn't contribute to the tripping issue. We could not recommend this cane for wobblies, like us, and have had to give it a low rating.
