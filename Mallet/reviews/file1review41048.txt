review/text: This is a vegetable/dish brush. It's priced at around three bucks at Kmart or your local grocery store. I tried informing Amazon.com that they'd accidentally gave this item an absurdly high price ($12 for a dish brush?!), but they sent me back a form email that indicated that a human didn't actually read what I'd sent them. I wonder if there's anyone who's ever actually bought a twelve dollar dish brush from Amazon.com?UPDATE: Amazon dropped this to $5.77 which is, obviously, still a crazy price for a plastic dish brush. K-mart's got them online for about half the price.
