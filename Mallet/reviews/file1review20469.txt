review/text: I thought this product would help my back when driving, I have had a spinal fusion with rods. It is a well made product. Great item. Some reviews suggested to purchase the larger size, but I am small in width and have bucket seats so I purchased the smaller size. Wish I had purchased the larger size. The problem is the cushion made me taller in the car and made it hard for me to reach gas and brake pedal and just felt akward when driving. Still in car and may try again. As several mentioned it slides around, but I plan to put velcro pads that have sticky tape for applying.
