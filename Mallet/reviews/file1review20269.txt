review/text: I really enjoy using these cloth diapers, but one thing onlyit is so difficult to find the diaper liners. I called to so many stores the only one that carried these liners wasBaby R Us. These liners really do the job as far as to keeping the babys dryer and when they have a bm you just discard the liner without so much of a mess.
