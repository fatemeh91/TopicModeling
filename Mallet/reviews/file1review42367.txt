review/text: I love this stuff! I drink it all the time when I can find it. I usually have to go to the natural food store but it's cheaper on Amazon most of the time. It brews cold so it's really simple. It has a sweet taste all on it's own so I don't add any sweetener. It's mostly caffine free, salt and sugar free. It's great taste with no bad stuff what more could you want?! I don't know about 'energy' but I do feel well hydrated when I drink it. I would say it gives you pretty good energy for not being caffinated, but I still like coffee too :) I think everyone that trys Sport Tea would like it. It's kinda like a mild Gatorade, but better.
