review/text: I shave very rarely (once every 3 to 4 weeks). Consequently, my shavers have to mow through a jungle at that time. I have previously used Norelco and Braun electric shavers with mixed results at best. This Panasonic handles the thickest of my beards. Granted it takes a while to get through the growth, but I truly appreciate the &quot;Linear Motor&quot; feature, which ensures that the razor does not slow down in direct relationship to the thickness of the beard. The speed is fast and it remains constant! As long as there is power left, which is conveniently displayed with LED lights, the shaver works its way through and I get a very close shave. Guess if I shaved more often, I would appreciate this product even more! Never tried &quot;wet shaving&quot;, but clean-up is a snap...pour a little hand soap on the foil, turn it on and rinse under tap water. I would highly recommend this product.
