review/text: I have been a fan of Twinlab products for years. I also like pills that are time released in some cases and this is one of those times. It sounded like a very good idea to me to have time release vitamins in two doses so that you have a steady supply of them in your body throughout the day instead of one big dose.It makes sense, to me at least, to keep the vitamin intake spread out throughout the day as much as possible.The two hundred pill bottle is a fifty day supply if you take four a day as directed so these are pricey but I am still putting them to the test in terms of listening to my body as I take them.So far it seems to be giving me a boost throughout the day but it could be the placebo effect. In particular vitamin C is washed out of the body quickly, and so are some of the B vitamins. I am liking these and feeling good about them and that's the main thing. I trust this brand a lot. I'm dead serious about my vitamins and supplements.According to the website RealAge run by Dr. Oz, taking a big single dose of vitamins has been proven to be somewhat risky, and he has recommended breaking your daily vitamin into two doses, so for this reason alone these are worth a try. We learn new things about nutrition and health upkeep all the time and that website is a valuable tool that I pay attention to. This double daily vitamin regimen seems to be reasonable to me.
