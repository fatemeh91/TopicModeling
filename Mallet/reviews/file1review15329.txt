review/text: This is a thick creamy lotion that goes on smooth and really works well for dry skin, leaving a moisturized or 'dewey' look after application.I think it is awesome for the dry, winter months, but slightly too heavy for the hot humid summertime.It also works very well at diminishing pervious acne scars, and worked in no time to heal a really dry patch of skin I had around my chin. Does not clog my pores or cause breakouts.The scent is very pleasant, like an aloe-ey mild flower type, but dissapears quickly.
