review/text: I am a huge fan of this baby detergent, honestly, mostly for the great smell. It smelled to me like a baby should smell. It also is tough on stains and doesn't wear out my baby's clothes. So why in the world did Method stop making it? What is the method to this madness? Another "why in the world question" is the price of a case on Amazon???? Serves me right for not buying a case sooner, but $20 a bottle. Be real!- Dissapointed Mom
