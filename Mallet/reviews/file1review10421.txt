review/text: Have used this product for many years - but only as a way to &#34;regulate&#34;.... My husband fights keeping his bowel movements regular daily - I just have a little cup of &#34;diet tea&#34; every evening - and &#34;wallah&#34;! no problems here... lol. I do not use it as a weight/diet program; but for this reason, it works for me....
