review/text: I am very pleased with the Cross Pen. It is compact, stylish and very functional. It replaces a similar Cross Pen that I was happy with for two years -- until I lost it. However, my complaint (it may be with Amazon, not Cross) is that the description clears states "Set includes 1 black fine ball-point refill, 1 red fine ball-point refill, 5 pencil leads, and pencil eraser; guaranteed against mechanical failure, " but my Pen arrived in nice Cross box with no extra refills, leads, or erasers. I am disappointed, but will keep the pen, which is fine.
