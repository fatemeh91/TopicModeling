review/text: This bath chair has been a great help to bathe my mom who has late stage Parkinsons. It is sturdy. The padded vinyl seat keeps her from slipping off and it's open enough to make sure she is clean. I am glad that we bought it. Also, one store actually recommened Nova products as they tended to be more consistent in quality than other manufacturers.
