review/text: The slippers are soft, warm and when you follow the directions smell great. The microwaveable packets keep feet warm for about an hour. The only downside is you cannot walk in the slippers with the aroma packets inserted. They also don't seem to be sturdy enough for regular wear around the house. Even the package states that they are not walking slippers. That would have been nice to know before purchasing!
