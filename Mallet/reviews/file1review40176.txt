review/text: I've used this toothpaste as long as I can remember. Ultrabrite and Pluswhite whitening toothpaste are the only toothpastes that leave the mouth feeling clean rather than the candy tasting ones like Crest.I cannot find it in any store these days, and I am almost out. Does anyone know who carries it in the Milwaukee, WI area? Otherwise, I'll have to settle for buying online from now on.
