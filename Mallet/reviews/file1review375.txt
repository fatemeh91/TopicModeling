review/text: I love this toy and must say it was a great present. Fun and after 3 months of use minimal to non existent signs of wear and tear (believe me it gets a lot of use hell 18-22 days per month).Also, the sound is a bit loud on the higher levels, but as someone already suggested a fan on as the perfect cover. In all honesty, I get the impression that someone(not in room) would have to be listing directly outside the door. So, far has not been an issue between me an my 2 other housemates.I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.* Random general tip for all sex toys that generate sound; make sure that you are not using it against an inside/support wall. Strange lesson I learned at college; vibrations travel very well via walls.*
