review/text: Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush.I think this is a terrific toothbrush. It was recomended by my dental hygienist. It's rotary action is very powerful. It does not take up much room on the counter. It is easy to angle up towards the gum line to help clean there so as to prevent pockets that may collect cavity-causing bacteria. The only drawback is that the brush attachments are a little short and sometimes I hit my teeth with it when brusing in the back of the mouth. It does take some practice to learn to use it effectively and get past the clumsiness of using a heavy object to brush your teeth. I still think this could be solved if the brush attachments were longer.
