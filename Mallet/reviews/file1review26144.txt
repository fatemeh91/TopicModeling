review/text: I was prepared for the grainy texture of this since I had read the reviews that described it. It's true that you need to massage it into your lips for a few seconds to break down the granules and turn it into a waxier state. Once you do, it's got a nice, thick texture that is very moisturizing and that stays put. It's a bit too thick for me for during the day (I need a lighter lip balm to wear under lipsticks), but for night time use, it's perfect! Apply it and wake up to nicely hydrated lips!
