review/text: this i by far the best protein powder I've ever tried. i have gone through countless tubs of powder to help my "lean mass" look, but no other protein powder has made as much of a difference as gold standard. it only has 24g which is perfect! don't be fooled by other protein powders claiming 50g because anymore then 25 and you will just shit it out. Like most protein you won't see an immediate change, but it will bring consistent results and make you feel great! tastes amazing too!!
