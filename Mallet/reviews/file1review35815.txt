review/text: This review is of the 7 oz. can of Nivea for Men Sensitive Shave Gel. I've been using it for several weeks with both throwaway and refill (Schick Hydro 5) manual razors, and am quite pleased. It spreads thick and is comfortable, and is fairly easy to remove (just take it ALL off, as residue can get a little sticky). After shaving, I personally use a bay rum, whose astringent quality gets all the foam residue off. The gel itself has very little scent, just a barely discernible floral aspect. I have the worst of both worlds: sensitive skin combined with a tough, stubbly beard that runs every which way, so I need some coddling; and this brand gives me the gentleness I need as well as the body.An interesting feature of this product is that the user needs to use very, very little of it to get a good shave. Unlike the Gilette-type gel, Nivea does not expand into a foam upon leaving the can; it comes out as small translucent strings about the size of kite-flying cord, and does not immediately expand. Spread it on the beard, though, and it expands big and thick. Thick though it is, the expanded gel washes off the razor blades easily. I had to train myself to use so little of the gel; about half the surface size of a book of safety matches (closed) for the full beard. Don't believe me? Aim to expel the minimum amount you think you'll need, then cut that amount in half, and you'll still probably have too much. All told, this is not a high price to pay for the deceptively small can of product. The gel and remarkably "tight" (high fit-and-finish) aerosol can were made in Germany (Nivea is owned by Beiersdorf of Hamburg). If you're at all dissatisfied with your shave cream or gel, particularly if it does not hold its body well, I heartily recommend giving this Nivea product a try.
