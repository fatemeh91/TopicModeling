review/text: It has all the ingresdients found in Ovaltine - but it also has the all important proteins. SEVEN grams per serving. Generally, growing children require about 2g of protein per kilogram of weight (or about 1g per pound), so one drink provides about a third of my 24lb daughter's requirements.A nice surprise - I actually received a case of 24-BOTTLES instead of cans. Not sure if it was an error, but it made my day.
