review/text: I love this lubricant, it is not sticky or clumpy, and all natural. It lasts a very long time. I've tried many different lubricants KY, Astroglide, ID, etc..either they were sticky, or would clump and dry really fast. O'My feels so natural almost like it is all your own. I definitely recommend this for women who have sensitive skin it is very gentle and fragrant free.
