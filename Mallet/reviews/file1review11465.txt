review/text: You get what you pay for with this trimmer. There is no battery indicator so you never really know how much charge is left. You also can't use it while it's plugged into the wall. It seems to charge and charge for ever. The trimmer blade is good though, with a good adjustable height that won't move on you when pressed against your face. Overall a good trimmer. It's hard to find one that is not outfitted with an unnecessary vacuum.
