review/text: I would have to say I was not very impressed by the quality and taste of this product. I guess I really expected more from this product, as they seem so expensive. The peanut-butter taste was very strong and the texture was very grainy and dry. I don't think that these bars are very filling. You have to drink a lot of water with them to even get them down. I would not recommend this product to my friends.
