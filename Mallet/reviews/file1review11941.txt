review/text: Full disclosure: I'm not pregnant or trying to get pregnant (taking these on a doctor's advice), so I won't speak to anything &#34;natally&#34; about these.I honestly gagged on these, even when I broke them in half and tried to take separately. I have never had a problem with swallowing any pill since 4th grade, so I don't know what the deal was there, but had to stop taking them after two days. The only reason they get two stars instead of one is because they didn't hurt my stomach (as advertised) the two days I got them down. That was all my gag reflex could take, though, and they started making me feel ill to look at after that. I switch to gummies.
