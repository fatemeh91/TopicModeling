review/text: I love this product. As a Weight Watcher follower with a sweet tooth, I find this 100 calorie Balance bar satisfies my need for sweets and it's only one W.W. point. Be careful with the chocolate variety; my last two orders from Amazon came in a melted mess - doesn't seem to effect the vanilla bars.
