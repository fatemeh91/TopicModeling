review/text: A previous reviewer of this product does make a good point - you have to read the product description very carefully to determine the exact dosage of each capsule; be sure this is the formulation you want. I compared prices of the many options on Amazon and these were very competitive. I give them to my dog (54 lbs - 1 capsule/day), who has hip dysplasia. This medication helps alot. I like the capsules because it is easy to open and sprinkle on food; it's tough getting her to swallow a pill. I buy the "human grade" rather than in a pet store because I believe it has to meet higher quality standards, and is about the same price.
