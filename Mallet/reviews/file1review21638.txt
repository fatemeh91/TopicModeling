review/text: This is a great product! First, when my son began to sit up by himself well, we transitioned from an infant tub to a swivel bath seat that suctioned to the tub bottom and this worked well for the time when he wasn't great at sitting just yet, however after a few months he was really too big for the bath seat and I always needed help from my husband to get my son out of the seat more easily so bathing him solo was a challenge. Then came this Snug-Tub! I bought it originally to take on a trip to Grandma's, but we keep it inflated and use it all the time at home. It is very quick to fill up and keeps my son confined and happy without having to fill the whole big tub. When we're done, I pull the drain and use our hand-held shower head to finish rinsing him while the water drains. (I just wedge a toy underneath the corner so the water flows out the bottom easily.) I can easily pick him up out of this tub, too. The only small gripe I can say about this tub is that the plug is a little difficult to put in so be sure to get it ready beforehand. Overall, with the low price, this product should definitely be on your must-have's list!
