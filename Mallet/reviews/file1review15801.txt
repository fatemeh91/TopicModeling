review/text: As an engineer I carry my Tech3 religiously. It is a fantastic pen if you need the multi functions. I've tried several on the market and the Tech3 is the best. Plan on getting a stock of refills from Cross as the ink volume is low.My only complaint is that the black ball point function writes poorly. This includes the original black and one from two different refill packages. A 25 cent Bic Stick writes better than my Tech3 in black mode.
