review/text: I've been through several trimmers and this one is a keeper. It works as advertised as a nose TRIMMER so it won't neatly collect hairs like a SHAVER. The tip can be safely rinsed out under the tap, but don't dunk it in the shower. The motor gets hot within 30-60 seconds of use, so take a break between nostrils. During cleaning take care not to lose the blade down the drain like I did. I was hoping Panasonic would send a replacement blade for free, but they want $10 + $5 shipping for it. YOWZA... I could get a brand new trimmer for less than that when Amazon has it on sale!
