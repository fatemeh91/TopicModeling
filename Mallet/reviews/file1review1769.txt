review/text: using this soap daily as a body wash for about 10 days took care of tinea versicolor (covering the whole back, some neck/chest-possibly misdiagnosed??) that we've been struggling with for over 3 years! doctor prescribed pills, it always came back. doctor said use tea tree oil and nizoral, it helped a little bit but could never clear up the problem. I happened to stumble on this soap when searching amazon for nizoral.so far so good with fungasoap! We're using it every other day or so now... I'm not sure if the tinea versicolor will return but at least there's something that finally works. I'll probably always try to keep some on hand.
