review/text: While time has removed the necessity for trimming my raven locks as frequently as during my youth and middle years, I decided to save money and have my wife do the honors. It took a couple of times but now it is almost impossible to tell the difference between a shop and home haircut. My cut is short and not styled but works well for me. Good directions and plenty of accessories.
