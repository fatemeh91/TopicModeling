review/text: We give vitamin e to our dogs each day with their meals. With four dogs we go through quite a bit of it. Very happy with the NOW brand. Packaged well, priced right, and so this is the brand we always choose. Have this product on a subscription from amazon. No other retailers in our area can match that price.
