review/text: This is by far the best tub to get when your baby no longer fits in an infant tub. I bought 4 tubs before trying this one. My daughter LOVED it from the minute she sat in it. She loves the printed designs, the feel of the tub, and she can move all she wants without bumping herself on a hard plastic tub. It's safe and easy to use. It stores right in your shower by a suction cup! No more bulky tubs hanging around ! It's great. I would recommend this tub to anyone... and I now have a great shower gift idea as well.
