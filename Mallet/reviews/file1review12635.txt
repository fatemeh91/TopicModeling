review/text: I am a 55 year old female who has always been constipated. I would not go for weeks at a time and never felt like I totally would eliminate. Yes crazy as that sounds. I went to a great colon hydrotherapist and before she would even touch me she recommended some products, one being Oxy Powder. After a week I then was on course with the colon hydrotherapy for a few cycles.I give Oxy Powder 4 stars cause I do have to take pretty much a daily dose of 2 for maintenance. The thing that amazed me and I have never asked is when I am on Oxy and drinking plenty of water I am amazed at the amount I go. All those years I was never going I was wondering where was all that poop going? It creeps me out thinking about it.It has helped me. Sometimes I do get the watery stuff but mostly it is regular and plenty. I would recommend folks try it if they are really having problems. Also my doctor seemed to think it was fine to use.
