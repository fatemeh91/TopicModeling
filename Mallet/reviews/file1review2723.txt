review/text: I absolutely LOVE these soy candles. My absolute favorite scent is Lilac. It smells EXACTLY like my lilac bushes when they are blooming in the spring. Anytime someone walks in my room they comment on how great it smells. The candle lasts forever and I love that it is made from soy. Something about that just makes me feel calm. The other Bean Pod item I love are the Beads for plug in/heat up devices. I love Lilac and McIntosh Apple. They are both true to smell, the apple literally smells like a bunch of freshly sliced apples. I have not used any other scents, and I do not know that I will as these 2 are perfect.I was really surprised that there were some negative reviews, as I have been using this brand for over a year now and I am always satisfied. I hope this review helps.
