review/text: Two slight problems were that the packaging the batteries came in were bent and wriggled from the shrink wrap.Not a problem unless they are displayed.Second it was not a 24 pack as advertised and pictured but rather two twelve packs of batteries.Sell what your advertising or get out, because the web has many competitors.
