review/text: I have a Slim Fast shake every morning for breakfast...one scoop in 12 oz of milk instead of the 8 oz the directions call for. A little more milk makes for a shake that is easy to drink. It tastes very good and keeps me full for 4 hours. I appreciate the Subscribe and Save option. A canister this large is very hard to find in the grocery store.
