review/text: This is a great toothbrush. Replaced an older Oral B and this is superior. Great battery life. Comes with a nice travel case and allows you to go about a week without a charge.Only downside is that the replacement brush heads tend to be pricey. The good thing is they are available locally - saw some at a Walmart recently.Highly recommended.Only downside is that it came with only ONE brush head - so if multiple members of the household are going to use it then add the replacement heads to your order.Price I got on Amazon was best onthe web and also received free shipping.
