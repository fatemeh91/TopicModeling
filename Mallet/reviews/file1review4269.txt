review/text: I shave about every other day due to skin irritation from other razors that I have used. I purchased a Gillette Fusion razor with a $4 off coupon out of the Sunday news, and that gave me the razor for about $1 after the in-store rebate.This is easily the best razor I have ever owned/used. One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth. I won't be switching to anything else after buying this product.TIPS:Don't throw the cartridges out after the aloe "indicator" strip fades - that thing is useless junk added on to make you replace the blades more often than is necessary. Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies. The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing. They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry. I can get more than a month of shaves out of a single cartridge before the blades dull and start to nick or pull at the skin. Buying a 12-pack of blades lasts me longer than a year . . .
