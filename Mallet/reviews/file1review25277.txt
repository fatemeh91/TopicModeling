review/text: I received a pair of these as a gift. I love them! This year I have ordered several to give out as stocking stuffers. They heat up quickly. The process is amazing to watch. I have boiled them up and reused them several times. Directions are staight forward and easy to follow. I found that if I put a couple of spoons in the bottom of the pan first, I don't have to worry about the HotSnapZ resting on the bottom of the hot pan. I couldn't be happier.
