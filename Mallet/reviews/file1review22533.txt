review/text: I order these all the time from another company and love them but the other company ran out of stock so I ordered them here. They came with partial water spots on them. As if the were in a puddle and then they dried. Gross, I had to throw half of them out. I know it wasn't the mail because the outer package wasn't wet and they were wrapped in plastic. I think this happened at the warehouse and they still shipped them to me.
