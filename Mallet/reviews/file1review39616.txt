review/text: Flossing the old-fashioned way (floss around the fingers) uses less floss and is less of a hassle. I gave it 2 stars because I could see how maybe if you had bad arthritis or something that prevented flexibility in the fingers it might be of use. For a healthy-handed person, it made the flossing experience clunky and used about three times as much floss.
