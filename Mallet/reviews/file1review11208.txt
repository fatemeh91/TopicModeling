review/text: Let me start by saying that my Vicks Comfortflex doesn't look like the one above. Maybe mine is an updated version. The top is more round and the push button is beneath the lcd screen. So maybe they've made improvements. Mine works great! I have gone through 5, yes FIVE thermometers in a week before finding this one. Two were under the tongue, three were in the ear. NONE of them were reliable or accurate. Finally I found an article on the web recommending this one and I was skeptical because it was so inexpensive. But I tried it and it worked great, consistently. My daughter's temperature was 104.5 when her old thermometer was reading 99.8. This one sounded an alarm and turned red! (and I know it was accurate because we promptly took her to the hospital, where they checked it and got a temperature that was just a couple of tenths lower) I've been using it to monitor her temperature ever since and it's been consistently accurate. And what's also great is that it takes exactly 8 seconds (you can time it) for the reading. And as an unexpected plus, my six year old daughter loves the light up screen. She'll ask, "Is it green yet??" She gets so excited. I can't say enough good things about this thermometer. I am soooo happy we found it!
