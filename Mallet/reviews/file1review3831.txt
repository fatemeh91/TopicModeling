review/text: First, any Yogi tea is a great product. And, while this one isn't like taking a Xanax, it's really a good tea to relax with. It's tasty and soothing and good for you. What else is there to say about a tea? I have a hard time finding this in the local stores so I'm very glad to find it on Amazon.
