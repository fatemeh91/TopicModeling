review/text: I bought 6 of these Priva Ultra Waterproof Sheet protectors. I call them bed pads. My adult son is a quadriplegic and bedbound. He's incontinent. I don't use diapers, but I do use the paper pads over these types of pads too for double protection. The pads are large which I really love. They weren't as thick as I expected them to be but so far they do the job and one pad covers a large area of his hospital bed.(34x36) I will probably buy more in the near future but I'm wondering if they have ones with a different thickness? I don't remember given the option when purchasing. I recommend these pads to anyone that needs to use them for sheet/bed protection. I won't be able to tell how their endurance is until a few months down the line - as I wash them every day. J KelleyI love these pads...and I want to buy more but I can't until they have them on sale again for 15.84 (I think) when I bought them last time. When is the next sale???UPDATE: Some of them are falling apart on the inside and won't absorb much. I have to constantly wash them but NOT ALL of them are doing this. Too expensive for such short use on some of these. Haven't found them on sale again either.
