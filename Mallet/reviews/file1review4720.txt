review/text: The only reason this shake is getting two stars instead of one is because I have lost 7 lbs. in the past four weeks by using the herbalife products. This flavor of shake tastes like chalk and leaves the dark "cookie" pieces in the bottom of your cup. It tastes bad and doesn't mix well. The chocolate, vanilla and cafe latte flavored mixes are a vast improvement in the taste department.
