review/text: As others have mentioned, the tiny plastic tabs that hold the sponge on snap off very easily. I figured I was just being too rough with it, so I went out and bought another one, and made sure to be more careful...had the same problem. The sponges don't last all that long, either. The only thing I liked about it was the oval head (as opposed to the round kind you see most often) made it easier to wash tall, narrow glasses. I went back to the ordinary kind I can buy at the supermarket.
