review/text: These are very handy--you can stick one right on the side of your toilets with the two-sided tape. The scent comes out strongly almost immediately, so you can screw it shut again by the time you leave the bathroom. I'd recommend the "crisp breeze" scent over the "fresh waters," however. This one smells like the disinfectant used in a lot of restaurant bathrooms, where they leave them open all the time until the scent is suffocating.
