review/text: I have been using Rayovac for a few years now, and find them to be as powerful and last as long as the super-advertised brands like Duracell and Energizer, for a LOT less money.If you want a powerful, reliable battery for a bargain price, then go with Rayovac. If you want to support a cute electric bunny, then buy the over-priced other brand.
