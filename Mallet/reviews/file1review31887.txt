review/text: I bought it as a gift for Christmas and he loved it. I'm personally not a big fan of shaving balm. I use a product called Shave Secret because it's a tiny bottle of natural oils that lasts forever. I can't see myself using this product but my brother is VERY happy with it so I am happy too!
