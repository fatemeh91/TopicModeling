review/text: I love this product. I have tried numerous different products for posture and this one is by far the best. Sometimes simple is best. I read other reviews and am suprised at how many negative comments this received. In the beginning I wore this band maybe an hour or two each day. It initially pinched my under arms but that went away after I got used to it. I don't wear it on my shoulders as the model in the picture does, I push the straps down so it is on my arm so the straps are parallel to the ground. I wear this to work and take it off when I get home. I usually wear it 7-10 hours a day. I look like I have bad posture but it's actually genetic. I also have whip lash. This band has helped me more than anything else. I took the advice of another reviewer and bought several bands so I could use a fresh one every day. I wish I discovered this product 20 years ago.
