review/text: these things are delicious. I only really like the chocolate raspberry fudge, the rest are good, but have more of that typical energy bar taste, where as the raspberry fudge are like a candy bar. I eat one of these about an hour before i work out and it gives me a great energy boost. Also very filling, great for breakfast on the go. Drink with a full glass of water, and you will be satisfied for hours.
