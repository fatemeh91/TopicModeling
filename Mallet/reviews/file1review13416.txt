review/text: When my daughter wakes me in the middle of the night to tell me she wet the bed, its a relief knowing I can just pull this pad out for washing and put her back to bed. It doesn't bunch, doesn't make plastic sounds, dont even know its there. I bought two and it does a nice job of covering up the main portions of a queen sized bed. I fully recommend it.
