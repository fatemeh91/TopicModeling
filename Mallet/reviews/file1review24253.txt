review/text: These insoles are great for an alternative to the 'Boot' method for planters fasciitis. Though I am not in the medical field, these insoles do help to stretch the tendons in the soles of the feet. Sometimes the feel of planters fasciitis is in the sole, and sometimes it feels like a bruised heel. This product helps to alieviate both in this case, when followed to its instructions.
