review/text: Cryoderm has been around for awhile. My husband's podiatrist recommended it several years ago. He found it to be an affective pain reliever for muscle and joint aches. A couple months ago I picked up the bottle and looked at the ingredients and said to myself, 'this should be a powerful pain reliever, everything in it has been used separately in the past'. So... I gave it a try; Cryodern does relieve muscle pain symptoms - and you can sleep better if it's chronic pain. The affects seem to be cumulative, meaning after several uses the relief is just as affective. I sleep better because my hips aren't aching at night.
