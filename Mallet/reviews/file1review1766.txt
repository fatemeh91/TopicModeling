review/text: I have been using FungaSoap for 5 months for toenail fungus on all five toes on one foot (go figure). I just use it in the shower with a soft nailbrush all around all five nails. My new nails are growing in beautifully. And, I have nailpolish on my toes and it's still working!! I use it in combination with Clearly Confident Antifungal cream. I had been using the cream for over a year with minimal improvement, but when I added the fungasoap, it really started to clear my nails up. I use the cream at night and then scrub it off with the fungasoap and nailbrush in the morning in the shower. This combination is working well for me!! Halleluia!!
