review/text: This is my all-time favorite energy bar, and I've tried them all. It's almost too good - watch out, you may soon find yourself eating these not only for that quick meal-on-the-go, but also grabbing two for you evening meal as well, just because you are craving that yummy yogurt coating over the honey peanut center. And very filling, as well. Not a weight-loss plan, but will keep your appetite in check.
