review/text: 4 hour charge cycle. These things last For 25 - 30 hours of play time in an Xbox 360 controller. These have saved me alot of money on batteries and them recharge packs Nyko and Microsoft sell for the controllers. Just ordered 2 more packs of 4 to add to the ones I already have. The first two packs are still going strong after a year of use.
