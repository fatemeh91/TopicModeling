review/text: I have been using Gillette Atra Plus for over 26 years now. I still prefer the two blade cartridges over the 4-5 blades which is total nosense. I shave every other day and a single cartridge can last me one month. Given the fact that these are the cheapest blades from Gillette currently on the market, a single cartridge costs $1.45 on average so that equals out to $18 per year for shaving. Not bad considering I shave 180 times a year. These 2 bladed Atras give me a closer shave compared to the mach 3 blades. I hear Gillette plans on phasing out the Atra Plus very soon. In fact, I don't think you can even buy an Atra Plus handle anymore, but they still sell the blades at most department stores. This review has been updated on October 29, 2011.
