review/text: My husband's was on testesterone replacement for 20 months. We were TTC and read that the testesterone replacement would make him sterile. So I got him off the shots on January 20th. We got his sperm tested on March 2nd, sure enough, the count was zero. I had already had him taking the fertility blend starting in February. We just got his sperm tested again today. and count was up to 30-40 million, all normal and great mobility! after only 4 months on Fertility blend. So we will resume with TTC and hope we get a BFP soon!
