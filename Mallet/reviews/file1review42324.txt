review/text: As a 90 year old balding man, I sometimes have trouble eating. What can I say? Old age creeps up on you I guess! But I can still take you down, chump! Where was I? Oh yes this bib. My ex-ex-ex-wife gave me this one for my birthday. At least I think it was my birthday. It was a warm spring day and that usually means my birthday, or I wet myself. Anyhow, I have trouble eating. My 4th stroke caught up with me and sometimes I can't feel a section of my lower lip. So when I eat, especially soup or my metamucil drink, I drool! What can I tell ya? I'm OLD! Things don't work right when you're old! I blame the current administration. Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again. I own bibs. Mostly ones I've stolen from various nursing homes and old folk facilities. But people always know when you're wearing a bib, cause it looks like, A BIB! Well this little number has my.. number.. written all over it! No longer will I embarass myself as I drool my Campells chicken noodle down my right side! Gone will be the stares I get from the other old dudes as I spill gruel on my bib. Cause this old man will be sporting a SHIRT BIB! Is it a shirt? Is it a bib? You can't tell! And that's the point - no one will think twice about me spilling on it! It will look natural! Now if only they made diapers that look like pants.... could use some of them suckers right now.... NURSE!!!!!!
