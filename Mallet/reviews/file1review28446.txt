review/text: This is no Burger King chocolate shake, but it tastes good, probably better than most proteins out there. It has worked for me so far. There are some cheaper ones out there but not by much. I'd rather pay the extra couple of bucks and stick to this one. It goes down easy on my stomach and I have seen the difference in my body.
