review/text: These orthotics are fantastic. I originally got them because when i was running i started to develop tendonitis in my knee. Although my tendonitis was from running in improper footwear, i spoke to a orthopedist and he suggested trying these orthotics. I didn't want to buy them because they can cost between $60-$70 in a store. I still bought them and they are fantastic!!!! The arch support is outstanding!!! It takes some getting used to but once your feet get accustomed to the orthotics, you will feel much better when your walking or running. Even though my running improved, the biggest difference i noticed was with my back, almost all the back pain i used to have went away. I still have a little back pain but only because my back is hunched. After owning these, if the price were to double i would still buy them. I would highly suggest you try these before ordering a pair of custom orthotics. It could save you several hundred dollars.
