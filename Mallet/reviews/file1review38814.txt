review/text: I've been drinking the pre-mixed Chocolate Royale shakes sporadically for about 10 years and I find the chocolate taste in the powder to be a lot tastier than the premixed shakes! I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't give it the 5th star because it never seems to mix fully. I took the advice of others and use it in a shaker, but it still never mixes perfectly for me. I have NOT tried it in a blender though, so that might help. Also, rather than drinking it at once as a meal, I sip it over an hour or so as a beverage, so it separates a lot and needs to be reshaken during some of that time. I'm the kind of person who is hungry every two hours or so and that is still the case with the shakes, but the plan DOES include a snack between shakes, and an apple is sufficient to get me between my morning shake and lunch.
