review/text: Like another reviewer said, I would floss regularly following my 6-month check-ups. It would only last a few days and I'd stop because of the extra steps and time it took. I'm a WOHM to two pre-schoolers so my extra time is very limited. I received a free sample of the Reach Access Flosser about a month ago and I have never flossed so much in my entire life! I can't wait for my dentist appointment next week. It is so easy and convenient to use, one of the best new products out there!!! AAA++++++++
