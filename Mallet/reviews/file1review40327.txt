review/text: Being an Elementary school teacher, I come into contact with a LOT of germs, and for quite a few years there, I could count reliably on coming down with some sort of new cold or flu every six to eight weeks.While things are no longer *quite* that bad (knock on wood!), I still frequently fall ill during the school year (and am always perfectly healthy during the summer when I'm away from my students!). I felt something coming on just a few weeks ago, and, remembering that I had these capsules, I decided to put them to the test. It was a good time to do it, too, since there was a particularly nasty bug making the rounds at my school. Thankfully, I never did catch whatever it was - either way, it never developed into a full-blown illness - and I fully credit these Gaia Herbs capsules for that.I like that one can look at the packaging, and be able to tell specifically where the contained herbs originated. I also found my nerves soothed by the knowledge that these herbs were processed in a manner that maintains their purity, keeping them pretty much as close to fresh-harvested as possible.It may have only been one time that I tried these out (as you're supposed to consume all 20 capsules, over the course of two days, at the onset of whatever illness you're battling), but they seemed effective enough that I definitely believe they'd be worth it to keep a bottle on hand. I always used to believe firmly in OTC meds for fighting various things off, and was skeptical of vitamin or herbal remedies, but with Dr. Mehmet Oz's consistent touting of natural and herbal remedies, and my own observation of their effectiveness, I think herbal is definitely the healthier, safer way to go on average, and these are being added to my list of smart things to keep on hand...
