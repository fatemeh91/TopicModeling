review/text: I tried this device for the first time today and it worked splendidly. As the previous reviewer noted, you can hear when it's getting hair, which is helpful. It cleared my nose right out and there's a bit of stubble left but overall I'm amazed at how smooth and clean it is in there now. A lot better than plucking or shoving your regular razor up there (hey, some days you're desperate).One thing - use this device over a sink and clean your nose out with a damp tissue afterward to get all the hair. I think it tries to get the hair it cuts, but it doesn't seem to be as successful at that. No big deal though.I have a feeling that I'll soon wonder how I ever managed without this device.
