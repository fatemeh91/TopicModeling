review/text: This is a great, sleek (but not uncomfortably thin), multi-function pen. There are a number of other-brand refills that fit it, if, like me you enjoy thinner points (I recomend the ones sold for the Pilot Hi-Tec C Slims, which are available in "0.3" and "0.4" sizes). I was very sad to lose this pen recently, and will gladly purchase a replacement ASAP.
