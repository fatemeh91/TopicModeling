review/text: This is a nice little sweeper. Others have said they had problems with the handle coming apart, but we haven't had any problems with that. I put it together as instructed, set it upright on the garage floor (didn't want to damage any indoor flooring), and hit the top with a hammer/mallet a few times. Seems to be very sturdy. Being a manual product, it takes some arm power to maneuver, but it's lightweight and actually requires less effort than our bulky vacuum cleaner. Since it has no suction, it doesn't have the pick-up power of a vacuum cleaner, but it's good for light touch-ups and spills which is what it was meant for. It's also nice that there are no cords to mess with.
