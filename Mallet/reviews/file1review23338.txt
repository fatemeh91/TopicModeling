review/text: I purchased this soap some years ago SOMEWHERE where it came with a boar's hair shaving brush, nice shaving mug with "Burt's face" on it, bay rum soap, aftershave and this shaving soap. I loved the smell of this soap however it didn't lather very well. Whether it was the soap, brush or and my technique I can't know. The brush and soap are gone but I still have the mug for my shaving. The price here is rediculous as are the prices on Ebay. Does Burt's Bees manufacture this anymore?
