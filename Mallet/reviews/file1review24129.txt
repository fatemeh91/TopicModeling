review/text: Unfortunately these are a great idea for cold feet but they don't work. The warming beads are in the sole and they move around and are very lumpy so you can't walk in the boots and in bed they shift around and the boot doesn't stay in place and if you have to get out of bed you have to take them off you can't walk in them. A great idea but not quite workable. And costly at that.
