review/text: Bought two and have used them while traveling. I like the multi-sized compartments (are all of YOUR pills the same size??) Also, the multiple sizes accommodates the fact that you don't take the same NUMBER of pills for each pill you take. I like that each compartment has its own lid and the entire thing snaps shut with a little latch. Works perfectly and a good price.
