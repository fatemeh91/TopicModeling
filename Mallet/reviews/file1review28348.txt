review/text: I figured most of you probably know the benefits ON's whey protein, and probably have done the research and read reviews on body building sites, so I won't talk about the protein itself. I'll review the flavors I have tried.Vanilla - 4/5: Not bad, just plain old vanilla like you would expect. I got this so I can get a relatively neutral flavor to blend with other ingredients when making a smoothie.Double Rich Chocolate - 4/5: Tastes pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolatey drinks.Coffee - 5/5: My favorite flavor so far. I want to try as many flavors as I can, but I may have to keep getting coffee from now on. Tastes pretty close to the coffee flavor in coffee ice cream.I'll update this as I try more flavors.
