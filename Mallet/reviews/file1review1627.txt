review/text: For a mere 5.00,this stick has to be one of the best remedies I ever ever used!! Its doesnt happen over night if you have a big one or a small one for that matter.But over time a daily application,it will start to vanish.I would just fine any kind of medical tape,or something that will temporally stick to the skin.To tape off the good skin around it,this way you dont eat the good skin off as well.Nice product!!
