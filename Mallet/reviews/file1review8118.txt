review/text: This squeegee is the perfect squeegee for our needs, and I'm sure it will be for yours too. We keep ours hanging in our shower, and use it at the end of each shower to clear off the glass enclosure. The suction works so good that the squeegee doesn't fall off the wall. Also, it is so convenient hanging from the suction to be out of the way, and used regularly. Once again a terrific product from the OXO family.
