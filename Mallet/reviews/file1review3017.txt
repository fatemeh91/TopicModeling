review/text: All I have to say is These are the only condoms I plan on buying again. I remember reading about these and how they were .0018 or so inches thick and thought that I could not tell a difference from the Trojan bare skin (.0020 inches think ) condoms, Boy was I wrong! I will admit that I have never like Trojan condoms because I found they broke way easier then any other brand for me (Durex, lifestyle, etc ). I Like the bare skins frankly because they felt good but I had no idea what was in store when i got the crown condoms. At first I noticed that they were a bit longer then a normal condom, and I am not a huge guy (6 1/2 -7 inches on a good day) but these went the farthest by a long shot. Of course they feel amazing for me and my girlfriend says I can perform better so she its better for her as well. On top of it all, the crown condoms are so strong and durable! I did not feel like I needed to be afraid of it breaking some time during intercourse! All in all I do not think I will be using any other condom for a vary long time. I LOVE THESE THINGS
