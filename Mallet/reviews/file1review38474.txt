review/text: It comes in a very pretty case, which makes it a perfect gift. (And it looks lovely on my bookshelf too!)When I first tried it - it REALLY hurted, but when I finished with both hands and feet - pain went away at all, and I started to search, where else could I use it.Anyway, even when I started, it hurted less, then laser epilation (and is also a way cheaper!)Manufacturer claims that it suits for underarm area - for me, it didn't work, I've got several wounds. But for arms and legs - it's perfect!The design is really nice, and the set includes a shaver head, so my boyfriend liked this thing too!Want to buy one more as a New Year present for my sis (and her boyfriend)
