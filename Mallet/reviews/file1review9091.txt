review/text: I was a bit overwhelmed by the selection of this sort of product but I'm very, very happy with my choice. I drink it with pineapple juice once a day and the taste is no barrier to all the goodness inside. I held my nose the first few times but after a week I started craving it, and now I'm hooked. Being gluten free with a sensitive stomach I find that whenever I eat something that doesn't agree with me 2 glasses of this sorts me out faster than anything else. I'm trying to get my senior-aged father to drink it! No miracle for my sinus/allergies but I'm not disappointed.
