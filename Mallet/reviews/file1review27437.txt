review/text: I purchased this in hopes of using it for the first time. I opened the package and was appalled: the container was damaged/dented, there was no protective seal on it (on the inside), and there was only half the powder that should've filled the container. Im very upset with the purchase and even more upset that I cannot send it back and get a refund. Thankfully Amazon gave me a refund, but I would not purchase this protein online again. Better buy it in person so you know everything is correct.
