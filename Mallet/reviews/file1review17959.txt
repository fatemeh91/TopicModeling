review/text: As a hermit living at 7500 feet, now surrounded by deep snow under really tall ponderosa, you'd think looking good wouldn't be a priority.But every three weeks I reluctantly go down to Las Vegas for grub. I've had the Clio Designs 3040 for months and it's great. Easy to use,effective, superb engineering to match its slick exterior design; no tangling or tugging, easy to clean and maintain, easy to control styling.I had a Black & Decker before; its rechargeable battery was impossible to replace; awful design. This Clio beaut of a trimmer reversesthe 'form follows function' line; its function follows its elegant form. I've used it dozens of times and its battery still keeps it humminghappily at full speed.Now when down to Vegas I can flaunt my well-trimmed face and Vegas Visitors no moreback away in terror. I can even get into the Bellagio Buffet without Security being called.(Oh, every so often a wanna-be hermitress comes a-visiting.She uses the Clio and loves it too. And I love that.)rclarknv
