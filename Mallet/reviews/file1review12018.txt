review/text: I'm not a vitamin wuss. Or at least I wasn't before these. Overall my review is positive, these are great vitamins as far as what you get in the whole package once a day (which is a nice perk). However, after a month of taking them, I could barely bring myself to swallow them. It wasn't the size so much as the roughness of the pill. There was no smoothness to it. Just hard for me to get down. I finished the bottle and ordered something else that I take 3X a day that is smaller and very smooth (still natural).If you don't mind slightly larger, rough pills - I would highly recommend this! If you think you might have an aversion, go for more times a day or a different pill.
