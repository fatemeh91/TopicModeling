review/text: This looks like a good sponge mop refill. It has a cellulose surface glued to a "cellulene" backing (cellulene is the stuff that you can't ever rinse the soap out of or dry your floor with, which makes it useless as a mop or a sponge). However, as far as I can tell, this refill will not fit any other mop except the Mr. Clean mop it was made for. It has no screws and apparently somehow clips onto the mop frame. If they had shown a full picture, front and back, of the sponge head instead of only the box, I wouldn't have wasted $8.00+ thinking I was getting a cellulose refill that would fit my wonderful and durable Quickie butterfly mop. I looked up the Mr. Clean butterfly mop units on the website, which clearly show the screw-type attachments, and the box says "butterfly mop refills," so I thought they would fit the butterfly mops with the screws as pictured on the website. They don't. And you can't even find this mop on the Mr. Clean/Butler website. Waste of money unless you have the kind of mop that goes with these refills. I feel a bit taken advantage of.
