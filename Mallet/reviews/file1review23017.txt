review/text: Bought this brace for my husband because the one the doctor gave him was wearing out. When the brace arrived, there is an insert stating that the brace cannot be worn more than 1-2 hours due to the type of material. My husband needs support all day at work. We returned the brace but the seller would not refund shipping and we had to payt he return shipment as well. Bought one at Walmart instead that is working great and cost less. Next time we will just go to the store!
