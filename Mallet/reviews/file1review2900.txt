review/text: I've been taking the Megafood Women's supplement for several months now and have been pleased. I never took a vitamin until I was an adult and had a very unpleasant experience with a mega-store brand (I had no idea that nausea was a side effect of vitamins at that point). After doing a great deal of research, I decided on these. Their claims are perfectly true. I have never had a single bad side effect from these, and I've taken them at different times during the day. Although it's hard to judge whether vitamins are &#34;working,&#34; I do feel that they're having a good result.My one major complaint is that these vitamins taste bad. If you don't get them down very quickly, they'll leave a pretty rough flavor behind, and, even if you do swallow them instantly, they still put a bad taste on your tongue. I will say, however, that the flavor is not long-lasting. With some bad-tasting supplements, you hear about people &#34;burping them&#34; for hours. That's not the case here.
