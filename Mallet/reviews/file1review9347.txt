review/text: I've had to take meds on a regular basis for 16 years and so far,this organizer is pretty good. Off the top, unless your meds are fairly small, I doubt these compartments will hold 25 pills, still shut, and not spill everywhere. The individual packs themselves will yes...two days worth of pills for me is 20 pills. I split mine up into days, so eventhough each pack says AM/PM, I do it as days. I got 2 weeks worth of meds in it. I gave this product 4 stars because it needs a stronger latch for the packs and the ability to lock into the base. As much as I like the product, I know it is a matter of time before one of the "days" gets lost under the bed!Update: I have not lost any of the day containers but I did accidentally ran over "Thursday" and cracked the divider which had to be super glued. I agree with some of the others saying that the compartments need to be deeper and with separate doors. The pill keeper as it is now only fits my smaller pills. The Omega3 capsules I take are too big for the compartments.Update 2: Ran over "Sunday" and broke it! Oops! Now I've replaced it with a jumbo version of a tradition pill keeper.
