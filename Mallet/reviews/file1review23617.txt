review/text: Oooh, is this an awesome toothbrush! It really does massage your gums as you brush - I've never felt anything like it. It's just incredible, especially since I have sensitive, bleeding gums and most brushes just irritate my mouth. This one doesn't do any of that - just massages as you brush. Great, great product -wish it had been out years ago! Highly, highly, highly recommend!
