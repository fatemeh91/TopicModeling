review/text: I became aware of these blades after watching a cable TV program called, "How it's made", so I specifically sought this brand. Not only are these the sharpest blades I've ever tried, but they hold their edge longer than any blade in any type of razor. It seems difficult to believe that such a fine product could come in such a cheesy package, but I'm sold and I will continue to buy only this brand until such time as it becomes unavailable.
