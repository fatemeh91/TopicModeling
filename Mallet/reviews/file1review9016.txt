review/text: Green Vibrance originated when the founders of Vibrant Health declared jihad on all plant-kind. In the aftermath of their war against the flora of Planet Earth, they disposed of the millions of slain vegetables by creating a company to sell a wonderful drink made of rainbows, sunshine, and their slain foe: god-awful-tasting vegetables.Drinking Green Vibrance is like eating 3 sacks of veggies, and then an additional 2 bags full of fruits and other plant life, without having to spend the 10 hours-a-day required to chew the disgusting stuff (drinking it via powder suspended in water distills that 10 hours into the worst 30 seconds of your day). After those 30 seconds though? You'll feel like 600 million bucks. The girl and/or guy who just won Mega Millions will want to be as energetic, happy, and all-around awesome as you, but won't know how. Because he won't know you drink Green Vibrance.More seriously--my junior year of college I had 8am classes and drank 5-hour energy every morning. I'd feel jittery and awful right after taking it, and then crash later in the afternoon. The following year I drank a scoop of this stuff every morning and evening (along with a small scoop of the Rainbow Vibrance they also sell), and I'm never turning back. I wasn't sleepy, and wasn't jacked-up, I was just awake and focused for 18 hours-a-day while drinking it. It gave me a really lucid energy-boost, and doesn't make my heart or nervous system 'splode like caffeine does.Brb, taking my Green Vibrance for the day.P.S. Beware of Green Vibrance mustache (like a milk mustache, but unsettingly-green). After consuming the frothy beverage, the green carnage all over your face is a sure way to scare the pants off of any of your houseplants.
