review/text: The plastic of this tub is sooo cheap! (I mean cheaply made). I'm sure it will do the job, though, at least for the next couple of weeks. This is like my 5th inflatable tub in the 20-25 dollar range and never has the plastic been so thin. I have two kids and never have used a hard plastic tub because these inflatable ones rock: they are portable, fun for the bath, I never have to worry about them hitting their heads, etc. Oh well. Hopefully when I need a new one more options will be available for this price. Will not buy this one again! Can't wait till my little ones are over this phase and begin to use the shower!!!
