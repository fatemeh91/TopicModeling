review/text: I've worn a short beard all my life and always used inexpensive trimmers. Unlike most, this one feels solid, not cheaply built, and it holds a charge unbelievably well. Its powerful and fast and cuts cleanly, no tugging. I've used it once a week for several weeks without recharging it, and it still runs like it was just charged (which doesn't matter to me, but is amazing anyway.)The height adjustment locks in positively so, unlike many I have used, you don't have to worry that it will click down a few settings by accident in mid shave, which is hugely important. It also has very fine adjustments, and you can remove the guard to get a very short trim (down to almost a two or three day stubble length I'd say.)If it has any drawback, its that the longest length setting is relatively short - maybe an inch. Not a problem for most people, but if you wear your beard longer than that, it might be. I wear a short crew cut and use it on my head too - works great. It has no other attachments (nose/ear trimmer, etc), but in my experience most of that stuff is next to useless anyway.
