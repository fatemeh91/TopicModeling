review/text: This product is the only one I'll use. The size is a little bigger than regulars, but not as large as a Magnum or similar - which is exactly what I need. I've ordered two sets of 50 so far, and everyone has been perfect.Keep in mind when you order from condom man that you're not getting manufacturer pre-packaged sets, rather they buy in bulk from the manufacturer and send you the specified number in a plain brown box.These are more than 85% off drug store prices in my area, even including shipping costs. You can't find better anywhere else.
