review/text: Got this a few weeks back when it was on sale. I can't compare it to other power toothbrushes as this is the first one I've owned. My dentist recommended the phillips brand but I chose this one over the price. I love it. If you are currently brushing your teeth with a normal toothbrush I would highly recommend upgrading to this one. It's amazing how clean it makes your teeth feel. I was skeptical at first - I just thought my dentist was trying to give me something I did not need. I was wrong I'm glad I bought this one.It is easy to use and kind of tickles at first when using it but after about 3 or 4 times using it there is not weird feelings at all.
