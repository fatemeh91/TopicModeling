review/text: We purchased this diaper pail because all descriptions, and even the video on the Graco website made it seem like when you drop the diaper in the pail, it falls directly into the bag and has the filtration system to contain the smell. This is NOT the case. This pail has a similar system as the Diaper Champ, in that there is a "ball" that catches the diaper, then it spins and drops it into the chamber below with the bag when the lid closes.We were hoping to use this for cloth diapering, so we were looking for a pail that has a filtration system, but none of the special bags, crimping or chambers that catch the diaper and drop it into the pail. With this method, we'd have to constantly clean the "ball" that catches the cloth diaper, and we just don't want to deal with that. I guess we're stuck using a standard garbage can or pail for our cloth diapering. I wish someone would invent a great filtered pail for cloth diapering!
