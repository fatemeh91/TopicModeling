review/text: I make sure I have a bottle of these Wellness tablets in the cabinet at all times. Sometimes I might feel a sore throat or maybe just some kind of imbalance in my health. If I have any concern that it might be a cold, I pop a couple of these pills for a day and usually the symptoms go away. (I get about one cold a year--sometimes none if I catch it in time.) If I don't catch my cold in time, I find that taking these Wellness tablets speeds up the symptoms and all the stages of the cold. Before I discovered these Wellness tablets, my colds lasted a week to 10 days. When I take these pills at the beginning of my cold I find that the cold goes through the stages in about 3-4 days. For me, that is wonderful. They smell like whiskey, but don't be put off by them. There is no whiskey in them! It's just all the herbs. They work wonders. My husband and I both consider this one of our favorite and essential natural remedies. Great product!
