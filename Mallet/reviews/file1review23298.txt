review/text: This is a good little sweeper. I got it to sweep-up cat litter on low pile carpet between my vacuumings; and that it does. I esp. like the comb (included) that comes in handy when you're cleaning the bristles, it then attaches to the sweeper's pole so you don't loose it--nice feature, it's made of all metal construction so it won't crack like the plastic ones do. In this item, quality actually superceeds the price.Sincerely,E.Morton
