review/text: Length:: 1:36 MinsIn response to N. Brush's review, I found that a Dr. Harris Shave Stick, which comes in a plastic screw-up dispenser, similar to a tube of lipstick, was the perfect fit for a Speick shave stick, so I just keep refilling the same dispenser with Speick shave sticks for at home and on the road.
