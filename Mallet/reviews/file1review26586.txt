review/text: I bought this on a whim and wondered if I could have found a better product elsewhere. However, I'm glad I ordered this. I love that fact that it can be inflated for various degrees of support. It's good for chairs that don't have a lot of 'seat' room...you just inflate it less. And I like the strap - so handy for lawn and deck chairs. Because it's inflatable, it's deflatable....packs well in a pocket or purse. I own several types of support cushions and I must say I like my inflatable ones best for unwavering firmness.
