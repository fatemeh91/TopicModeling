review/text: These massages oils are so much fun to use. They each have a different scent and different 'purpose' (ex. healing, relaxing...) so it is fun to choose which one to use. They are not too greasy or messy and are absorbed well by the skin but don't dry up. Great quality and they will last a long time because the bottles are perfect size. The packaging was great and definitely fun to buy a Kama Sutra book on massages along with it!
