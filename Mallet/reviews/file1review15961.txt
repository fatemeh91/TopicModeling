review/text: This product was recommended to me during pregnancy by my physical therapist.It definitely serves its purpose, giving immediate noticeable relief to lower back pain as soon as you put it on.The strap to position over the belly is way too long, so I haven't worn that.The only heads up when ordering this product is to order a size bigger if you're border-line on their charts. I was a size 18 prior to pregnancy but my waist was fairly small so my therapist told me to definitely go with the Large. This was too small and did not stay in place so I returned it for an XL which is perfect.
