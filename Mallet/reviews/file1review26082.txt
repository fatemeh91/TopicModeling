review/text: Around a year ago I started having trouble sleeping partly due to bursitis in my leg. For the past 3 months I've been taking Zyflamend Nighttime (two capsules) and Bromelain before I go to bed. I also take 1 Bromelain capsule in the morning. I'm happy to say that my bursitis bothers me much less now and there are times I can lie on that leg with little to no discomfort. It is important to know that herbs take some time to get into your system so they can have an effect on your body. I tell people to give a new herb you are trying at least 3 months to see if it will help you. Good Luck!
