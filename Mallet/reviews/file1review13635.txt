review/text: This is the best flosser I've used for years. It's better than any other product in the market (that I've tried) by far. Easy to use, it reaches all the way to the back teeth despite its short size. The vibration makes the flossing quick and efficient keeping the in-between teeth clean and the gums healthy. It's a shame I can't find it in stores any more.
