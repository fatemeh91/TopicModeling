review/text: First, let me state, I have never actually used these as diapers. EVERYONE gets these for baby shower gifts, and they all look at me funny, until I explain why. These are the best "spit rags" ever created. Perfect for using as burp cloths, as they are large, and can be washed in hot water and bleached (though it's always best not to use bleach on baby stuff, these aren't actually put ON the baby). Products sold as "burp cloths" are generally very small....I think they were created by people who have never actually been spit up on. These flatfold diapers are very large....I fold them in half or tri-fold them long ways, and throw it over my shoulder. It's long enough to cover the front and back of my shirt. They are also good for a makeshift bib once the baby is old enough to eat baby foods. Simply tuck into the collar of the shirt. They make a good makeshift 'prop' for the head, if you roll it up (you know the "U" shaped cushions they make for helping baby keep their head straight). Of course you would never want to use them like that and leave baby unsupervised.If you need to lay the baby on a couch/chair to change a diaper, in a pinch, these can work as a changing mat too.Once the baby is older, and is done using them, they are fantastic cleaning cloths....great for glass, countertops, etc. They're good for keeping in the car to wipe up any spills, etc. There's a bunch of uses for these things!
