review/text: I purchased this item with a rebate coupon I got from my dentist. I reasearched the features across this and other models. This one turned out to be in the same price range and works wonderfully.The brush vibrates every thrity seconds to let you know to switch to another quadrant and then gives a nice smilie face at the end of the two minutes.There a couple of things of note however, 1) the base can get gunky if the bottom is not dried before putting it into the charger. Not a major problem but if you are like me and like your toothbrush handle not to be sticky you'll need to rinse it and dry it off completely before placing it back in. 2) It didn't come with any additional brush heads even though it has a space in the back for storing them. Again, not a big deal but I did have to create a seperate order for more brushes so that hubby could use it.
