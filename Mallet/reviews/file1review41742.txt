review/text: This is a great toothbrush. My new dental hygenist recommended it. The dental office was selling a fancier version for $100.00 but this one is sufficient. The only thing it doesn't need is the cover for the brushes as the surface under the toothbrushes began to smell musty from no air flow within the first week. I just removed it permanently.
