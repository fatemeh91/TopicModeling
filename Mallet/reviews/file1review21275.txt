review/text: This is a great little toothbrush. Actually, it's not so little... But it gets the job done well, and the timer ensures that you'll give each quadrant of your mouth adequate cleaning. After my last AA power toothbrush corroded and died after just a few months of use, I picked this one up. It seems to be made to last.
