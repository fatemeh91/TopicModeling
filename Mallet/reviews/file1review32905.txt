review/text: My wife takes this. She has suffered from cronic constipation for well over a decade. She has tried all kinds of laxitives/stool softeners without much relief. With Smooth Move combined with other Stool Softeners the results have been amazing. She has 3 Smooth Move teabags steeped for about 15 mins before bed time, but I would recommend to start with the recommended dosage. Then she may have another 1 or 2 cups during the day using 1 teabag. Yes and she really likes the taste. Yes and she would recommend anyone with constipation to try it. Believe me she was so skeptical, but she is pleased I ordered it for her, she still can't believe its working. Thank you Traditional Medicinals.
