review/text: Thirty years ago my attempt to wear hard contacts ended after months of struggle with my eyes hypersensitive to light and constantly irritated. I was using drops by Allergan, who manufactures these (not sure if same active ingredient) and it never occurred to me to suspect the drops as a source of the problem.Yesterday I started on the preservative free individual packets as a run up to Lazik. To my surprise I felt a horribly familiar burning sensation, dryness, and light sensitivity which began after the third use. Without contact lenses.I suspect the effect makes eyes actually drier rather than more moist -- if not careful, someone may think they need *more* drops to relieve the discomfort.Apparently less than 2% of users get this side effect. I will tell my eye doctor, however. I have switched to a different brand on his approved list with no problems whatever, with a different active ingredient. When I was at the store comparing active ingredients this brand was the only one using it.
