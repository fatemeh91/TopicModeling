review/text: I had the Oral-B circular only brush before, and the Sonicare before that. This is the first one I don't feel the need to do brushing at the same time. It really does the job just pressing down on each tooth (with a little up and down motion). It REALLY gets the job done.The thirty second timer is useful, the 2 minute timer is useless, since the timer reset each time you power down, even for a second (to spit). The 4 flat rubber things actually work, I have watched them in the mirror, and they do brush well.
