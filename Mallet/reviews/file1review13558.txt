review/text: I was looking for a comfortable, long lasting shoe insert. Any inserts I have found in other stores, just didn't hold up. The SmartSole inserts are comfortable, and brought new life to my sneakers, but I have not seen nor was I expecting an insert to help with cellulite, unless you are exercising daily as well. Nice product, should only be worn in sneakers. I tried to put them in regular shoes, but they made the shoe too tight.
