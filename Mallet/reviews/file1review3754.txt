review/text: I have struggled with regularity for years. Recently got worse. However I was on a mission to eat healthier, be healthier and pay attention to what I put into my body. In a book I read, she recommended this product to help regularity. Not harsh at all. I take 3 each night and without a doubt, I am now regular!!!!!!! No gripping, no issues. I take them at bedtime, in the morning, there is an "urge" and I just go. Most of the time, twice a morning. That is GREAT for me! I will definitely continue to use this and recommend to anyone that wants something more natural. Adding fiber wasn't enough for me. THIS is the trick!
