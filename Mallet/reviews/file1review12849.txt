review/text: Great item which retains warmth for almost 20 minutes (after microwaving on high for 45 seconds). It's EXTREMELY comfortable & very soothing when warm. Gel products do not freeze so it did not retain cold for longer than ~5-10 minutes. I wish it could have stayed cold longer but that's the trade-off for the comfort of gel. Because it doesn't freeze, you don't need a barrier between the mast and skin. It is adjustable with a reliable Velcro strap. The mask is really well designed. Fast shipping, perfect seller.
