review/text: You will feel the difference literally the day you start taking them. I really believe these are the best vitamins around by far. I took a well known national brand and was feeling very lousy. I saw these on sale and tried them because the natural ingredients seemed appealing. Best decision I made. I have more energy, feel more alert, and do not get that queasy feeling after taking them. They also have a pack that comes with the DHA pills. These are great there is no aftertaste. This brand has really won me over, and after my pregnancy I am going to take Rainbow Light's regular women's multivitamin. Note this pills are kind of big. But they have mini versions available, or you can just opt to cut them in half as I do. =)
