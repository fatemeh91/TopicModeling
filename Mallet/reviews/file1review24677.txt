review/text: This is scary stuff, I took the recommended dose and felt dizzy, super shaky and like I was going to black out. I was afraid to be alone in case something happened to me. The weird thing is it took about 3 hours to affect me. I dumped the whole bottle in the trash. This is nothing but pure speed. Too risky in my opinion.
