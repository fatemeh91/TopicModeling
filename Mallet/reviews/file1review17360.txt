review/text: I purchased this to gift it to one of my cousin in India and after checking the reviews I was very confident that this will be a great gift. Not exaggerating, it started but it just doesnt solve the purpose. I have been using Panasonic ES224s from last 3 yrs and its blade is still much better than this piece of junk. I am not sure if my piece is faulty or what but it just dont work....it was just so embarrassing to gift something which just dont work..
