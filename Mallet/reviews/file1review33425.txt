review/text: Everyone in my family has to have warm feet to go to sleep! We have several of the Bigger Rectangle Shaped Happy Company warmer ... and I bought this small one for my granddaughter. We heat it in the microwave for 2 minutes and it is EXACTLY the right temperature to keep her feet warm. It is well made and we have had no problem with stinkiness that another reviewer mentioned!
