review/text: This is a great stethoscope. I got it as a gift after I got a job in a Neonatal ICU. It was not the smallest size, but it worked GREAT even on the micropreemies. I thought it would be to large and get to much overlap of heart and lung or lung and bowel sounds, but it was wonderful. Great product.
