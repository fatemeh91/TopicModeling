review/text: This product is awesome. It is definitely more painful than shaving at first, however, after a week of using this product, I can go several days without epilating, and I used to have to shave my legs everyday to keep the stubble at bay. It is a little time consuming until you've completely transitioned, but it's worth it. And I'm going to save a ton of $$ on shaving cream and I feel really good about not having to discard the metal cans they come in!
