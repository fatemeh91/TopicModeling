review/text: I have never received my package of Mach 3 blades for which I was charged. When I contacted the supplier. they assured me that they had shipped the item. I was given the choice of receiving a credit or an expedited shipment. I requested that they reship the item. I was provided with an internet tracking number which, when contacted, assured me that the item had been shipped and delivered. This is my first truly negative experience with an Amazon ordered item. I still have not received the promised item nor have I received credit for it.Please take the necessary action to give me credit for an item which I have never receivedRalph Shapiro rshapiro002@socal.rr.com 310-809-9467Gillette Mach 3 Refills - 12 Cartridges (Purchased on 03/11/2008)by Gillette
