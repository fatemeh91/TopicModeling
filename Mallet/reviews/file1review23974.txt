review/text: I'm glad after almost 2 months, I finally received the battery... Amazon was great in taking care of responding to my concerns... I would never go thru this seller again.... ever... the battery it's self is great... on one charge I took between 700-800 pics and was using my flash the whole time, since it was at night.... that is great... which means I could go a long ways, maybe days (not using flash) on one battery... I have since obtained another Olympus battery... I have tried buying a couple of the non-Olympus BLM batteries... they do not last very long, and are only good for backup... I would stay away from them... Olympus is the only way to go... I learned the hard way... as a photographer I need great batteries...
