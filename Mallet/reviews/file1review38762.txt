review/text: I am usually famished when I come in from work and with this in the house, I can resist the temptation to eat something bad. The Chocolate Royale flavor is very rich, not too sweet, and dissolves completely in milk without using a blender. You'll feel like your cheating and drinking a big glass of chocolate milk! I'm not giving it 5 stars because it (for me) it is not filling enough to serve as a meal replacement, it only postones my hunger.
