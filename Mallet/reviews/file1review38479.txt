review/text: This is my second Emjoi Epilator...My previous one lasted several years without my doing any preventive maintenance...I just had to purchase another because it's the only device that removes my tough leg hairs...And the hair "disappears" for a good couple of weeks without having to remove it again...Also the new hairs seem to be much finer than when I use a razor or conventional shaver...Finally, as long as my current Emjoi lasts at least two years, I'll buy a third one; I'm just that pleased with it!
