review/text: This product is great for upper respiratory infections, allergies, and even urinary tract infections.When I started having more allergy related asthma, I took Golden-seal once a day for 10 days... My allergies lessened. I no longer had sinus/allergy headaches every day.The one thing I did notice.... My ankles swelled some and my blood pressure went up a bit.I took half a capsule for a few days, a whole one for a few days, then 3/4 of a capsule for a few days.Now that I have stop taking Golden-seal, my blood pressure is normal once again.Another good one is Oregano oil. This does not cause high blood pressure.
