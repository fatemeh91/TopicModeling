review/text: This bronze colored metal cane is infinitely lightweight and yet, very, very sturdy! It is not flashy, very subdued in color. A 300 lb. individual would have no problem using it without worry. Folds easily (case provided) and open in an instant and locks open when required beautifully. A winner!
