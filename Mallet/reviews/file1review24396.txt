review/text: I have struggled with sleep issues for years. I have never found a "natural" sleep aid to help, but this one has done the trick. It doesn't have melatonin which I've found really messes with my sleep cycle. I take two of these before bed and have a noticeable improvement over the course of the past month. They don't knock out you, so don't expect that. I find that they relax me and make me more susceptible to falling asleep and sleeping through the night.It hasn't been perfect- I still have had a couple of occaisions of poor sleep in the past month, but I used to have bad nights 3-4 times a week prior to starting these. In addition to taking these pills, I have used a lightedPhilips HF3510 Wake-Up Light, Whitealarm clock. The combination of these two have me on a regular schedule of sleep, I have improved from about 5.5 hours before to 7 hours now. This may not work for everyone, but I feel a million times better. I will continue taking these for the foreseeable future.
