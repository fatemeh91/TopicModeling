review/text: I just got this yesterday and used it last night. Fumbled just a bit getting the hang of where to put the hands and whether to push or pull the device. It took just a couple minutes to get the feel of the leverage. The tool is very effective at pushing in to trigger points. For me, it took very little pressure to produce profound results-- electric zaps and pain in places I had no idea were affected by my trigger points. I woke up this morning in a bit less pain than usual. Loosening up the vise grip in my back and shoulders will be a lengthy process, I'm sure. But, not being able to afford time or money for regular massage therapy, this is my solution. I feel a sense of relief and happiness that I can manage on my own.
