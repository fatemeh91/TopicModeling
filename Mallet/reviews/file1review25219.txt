review/text: The batteries I received were what I wanted and arrived on time HOWEVER they wouldn't fit in the device because someone had stuck a label on them saying something to the effect that if you removed the sticker the warranty was void.Huh? The batteries don't fit in the Sennheiser device they were made for unless you peel the label off which says you can't return them if you do. I assume that somewhere along the supply chain someone wanted to hide the origin data stamped on the batteries. Why I don't know.I'm not unhappy but I wouldn't recommend this company to a friend as I am still scratching my head as to why all the subterfuge was needed. Maybe they are recycled. Who knows.
