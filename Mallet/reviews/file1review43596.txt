review/text: Before purchasing this product, I was using an old, manual unit that was showing signs of age as far as accuracy and had very few features. The Omron unit has the features I need and appears to be accurate, based on the readings I have seen at my doctor's office. The self inflating cuff is a really nice feature. The display is large and easy to read, is laid out nicely, and gives systolic, diastolic and pulse readings at a glance. The memory holds the last 30 readings and gives an average of BP and pulse at the touch of a button. The unit also has a plug-in DC power supply that I find really nice. No more replacing batteries. The unit also records irregular heartbeats, but as far as I know I don't have that condition so I can't speak to how well that option works.I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure and my old unit was giving some very scary and unreliable readings. In order to accurately monitor my blood pressure I needed a reliable, accurate unit and the Omron 711AC does the job for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this unit.
