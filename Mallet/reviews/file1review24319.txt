review/text: I've used WalkFit Insoles for 7 or 8 years with great results. As the instructions say, it takes a few days (or more) to get used to them. It took about a week, and I haven't had heel pain since. Amazon gave me an excellent price and quick delivery to purchase additional insoles. Easy shopping!
