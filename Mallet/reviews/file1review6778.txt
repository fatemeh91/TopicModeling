review/text: I told my brother that he'd be getting a really weird birthday present from me, but that it would be his favorite. He wasn't too sure about it at first, but a few weeks later he confirmed my prophesy. He loves it. (Bonus, it's a great ice breaker at gatherings; everyone wants to try it!)
