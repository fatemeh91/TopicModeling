review/text: The trimmer would not take a charge. I contacted Remington and they sent me a replacement charger and cord, and a return prepaid shipping label, if needed. New cord and charger arrived; unit would still not charge. Have returned unit for replacement. Was told to expect its arrival in about a week. Waiting.
