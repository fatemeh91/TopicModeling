review/text: I've tried a few other protein powders out there and Optimum Nutrition is my favorite. I've been lifting weights/working out for almost a year now. When I started, I wasn't taking anything and was getting adequate gains, but I soon hit a wall.Adding this protein allowed me to get the amount of protein I needed to feed my muscles. My gains shot up dramatically and now I will not work out without this product.The taste is great too because I went through a 5 lb container and still loved it. I highly recommend this.
