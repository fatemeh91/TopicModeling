review/text: Before i discovered Optimum Nutrition, i hated protein drinks. They always seemed to taste nasty, clump up, and would trigger my gag reflex. Well i gotta give it to these guys, their protein tastes just like chocolate milk. I take it every day and this is the only protein i will buy from now on.
