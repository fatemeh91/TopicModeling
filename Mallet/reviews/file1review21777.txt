review/text: I'm wondering if the dosage on this capsule is REALLY correct. The capsule does zip -- you get a vague energy buzz, but nothing sensational or really "rhodiola" feeling. This is more like caffeine. I am sure that either the processing of this herb is off base, or they have included some other ingredient that flavors the way it feels when you take it. Not at all like the quality Rhodiola from Siberia.
