review/text: My first epilator was a Norelco Satinelle, and I adored it. After I'd been using it for just a few weeks, my legs, underarms, and binkini area became baby soft and touchable. Re-growth came in much finer and scarcer, and that trend continued over time. No more razor nicks! No more balancing on one leg in the shower! No more dropping the razor because my hands were slippery with hair conditioner (works much better than shaving cream, for those of you still stuck with shaving).I was very distressed when my trusty Norelco disappeared during a household move. To make matters worse, I couldn't find another Norelco. I bought another famous brand of epilator but was very unhappy with its performance: It didn't find all the "little hairs" that the Norelco did, and it often broke hairs instead of extracting them -- so I had stubble even though I was epilating. How frustrating is that?!!I finally bought another Norelco Satinelle (bonus: it's less expensive than the "other brand"), and now I'm back to silky-soft, smooth skin in the most low-maintenance way possible. (One reviewer commented that hers broke right away. I would suggest that if that happens, just exchange it for another. Even Mercedes-Benz gets a lemon off the factory floor now and then!)I'll never be without a Norelco epilator again.
