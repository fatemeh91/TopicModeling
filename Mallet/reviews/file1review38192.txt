review/text: I had rough dry heels from all the sandles and flip flops I've been wearing so far this Summer and this showed improvement in just one nights use. I used it and then wore socks to bed. The next morning my feet were so soft and moisturized. I use it everyday and each day my feet look and feel better and better! I think this product is great and would suggest it to anyone who has rough, dry, or cracked feet.
