review/text: I bought this product a few months ago to use on my upper lip. I'm still waxxing, I just can't get myself to use this thing. I've tried several times, but dang it looks like it's going to chew me up and spit me out! Maybe someday. I feel I wasted my money for now. I did investigate the different epilators and this one rated as one of the best, especially for the money. Good luck!
