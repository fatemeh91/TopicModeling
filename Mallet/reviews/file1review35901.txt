review/text: i have a collapsed immune system. so i take a combination of activated quercetin... 6 capsules three times per day. plus, i take 10 grams or more of vitamin c and 1800 mgs of NAC (n-acetyl-cysteine). if you want a good vitamin c try solaray's reacta-c, alcer's emergen-c packets including their multivitamin packs.anyway, quercetin is not only good for allergies but it can be used with other immune supporting supplements to combat any lingering reactions.it does take time to get the body's mast cells under control and calm the immune response. my advice is to begin a regimen of allergy products like the ones i described above when you are not having many allergy problems. then by the time your allergy season arrives, like in spring, you'll have a good foundation to keep allergies at bay. you can also increase your quercetin, vit c, and emergen-c packets to help with your allergies.if all else fails , go see a naturopathic doctor... it worked wonders for me.thank you.
