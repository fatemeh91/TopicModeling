review/text: There isn't a lot more to add from what others have said. ON gold standard whey is just the best basic protein powder. If you want a before bed shake, check out the Casien protein but for breakfast or snack or post work out protein shakes, this stuff is the best. It tastes great and blends into milk really well, even if its just skim milk. I like the chocolate flavor enough that I haven't even tried the different flavors.
