review/text: I don't remember where I purchased this seat but it was the second one I tried for potty training. The seat is good, nice construction but it did not work on our toilet seat. We have a Bemis brand, easy close elongated seat, the opening is about 10 inch long, just under 8 inches wide, with a curve to the seat, this seat did not work on it at all. We brought it to my in-laws for the kids to use there and it fits no problem. Both my daughter and niece use it at grandmas with no issues.I really wish they would show you pictures of the under side of the seats and the measurements for the minimum opening. After two seats I'm still trying to find one to fit on our toilet.
