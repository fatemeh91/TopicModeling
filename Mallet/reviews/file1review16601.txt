review/text: Had a Zippo when I was a kid, & loved it. Went without for decades, then decided to buy this one. This thing works even better than I remembered. In still winds, generates a nice big tall flame, and of course you need some awfully gusty wind to blow the flame out. Quasi-brushed finish on the jacket makes it perfect for carrying in your pocket: scratch it up, and you probably won't notice. Filled it with Zippo brand lighter fluid, and no odor to speak of when this lighter is in operation.
