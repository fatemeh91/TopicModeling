review/text: I started buying this product for my cats after reading about how the body is less able to digest food and obtain health benefits from it due to age (most of my cats are 8 years plus) and the effects of cooked food in general (cooking destroys natural enzymes). I am happy to say that my cats are all very healthy at their ages and those who had a tendency to yak up hair balls and undigested food are doing so MUCH less frequently (every once in a while versus daily). This has also decreased my use of paper towels and laundry soap. :)
