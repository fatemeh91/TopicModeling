review/text: I am in the process of trying to lose weight, and this seemed a great way to skip lunch but still get all the nutrients I needed. When the Balance Bars arrived, I was surprised to get a whole box, enough for a two-week supply, plus one. My husband and I immediately pulled out that ""plus one"" to give it a taste. The bar looked delectable and smelled wonderful, but that was as far as it went. They are plain awful! The chocolate coating is good, but whatever they have on the inside is sickening. It's not very sweet, but it's the texture that's so bad. It's like chewing wet sawdust. We immediately spit ours out, and the box of 14 is still sitting on my counter. I would definitely not pay money for these. Skip them and go on to Slim Fast, is what I'd tell my friends and family. They definitely need to do some work on this product, not just that flavor.
