review/text: Like the other reviewers, I was impressed with the quality of this product but shocked at the bland taste and gooey consistency. However, I have found a way of using it that I find to be very delicious and part of a satisfying and healthy breakfast.I put about 6 oz of boiling water into a blender, add an egg and run the blender. This has the effect of slightly cooking the egg, which is safer than using a raw egg because of the risk of Salmonella, and of cooling the water enough that it will not cause the whey protein to curdle. Then I add 1 scoop of Whey to Go and a little bit of Stevia. If you prefer, any sweetener will do - sugar, honey, agave. Then I just give it another whirr.I like this very much just as is, or sometimes I shake on a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg or both.Using this in this manner, it is smooth and very tasty and I haven't added anything artificial. Fruit would also be good in it, or cocoa powder or any other flavoring, but I find it like it very much like this and prefer to eat my fruit separately.
