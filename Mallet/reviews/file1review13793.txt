review/text: Neck pillows have long been a necessity for me when traveling - -if the heads lolls to the side interrupting sleep a chance for a total departure from consciousness may be lost!Now magical buckwheat comes to the rescue, swathed in the comforting softness of a removable chenille cover. In this "HAPPY WRAP" it combines with moist heat & hints of scent, primarily lavender. Microwaves are usually available for a 2-minute heating-up and that guarantees a deliciously therapeutic tension-melt-down.The value increases greatly for someone like myself who is convalescing or must sleep sitting up. Reviewer mcHAIKU reminds readers that recovery can be contingent on sufficient sleep. One's health gains mightily from total relaxation and near-meditative surroundings. For me this "purple passion" has become a life-saver.
