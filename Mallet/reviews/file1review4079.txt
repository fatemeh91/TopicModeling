review/text: My first time using a powered stick razor. I definitely get closer shaves when using the power in addition to the 5 blades. The power is nothing more than a small vibrator motor, like a cell phone, but it provides a closer shave because you end up applying more pressure with slower strokes. I used to get 2 or 3 days out of the Mach 3 before it was semi-dull. I can get about a week of close shaves and an additional week of not-so-close shaves out of the Fusion.Overall, the best razor I've ever had. Also, the most expensive blades I've had to purchase but Amazon's subscribe-and-save program is cheaper than Wal-Mart!
