review/text: For many years now, we've used Butler brand flossers which were originally provided by our dentist. The original Butlers were of fairly stiff, opaque, plastic such that the forks don't flex too much and hold the floss nice and taut. It was thus easy to manipulate the floss between every tooth in your mouth (even for those with a small mouth, like me).Problem 1: Once every few years, flossers break.Problem 2: Last time we replaced the Butlers (several years ago, bought in a drugstore), they changed the plastic - to a more flexible and translucent type. Though the shape of the flosser didn't change, it didn't work nearly as well as the original, more rigid type of plastic, as the more flexible forks meant that the floss would either be looser, or you'd have to pull the forks too close together to get it taut. Not nearly as good, but still, we got by.Problem 3: We noticed that you can't even find "permanent" flossers like these brnads in the stores any more - just the disposables. So when another Butler finally broke, I turned to the web.Lo and behold, Amazon listed both Butler, and these Flossaid ones. Knowing that the Butler would likely be the newer, more flexible plastic (not good), I figured I'd try Flossaid. At this price, you can't go wrong to try them - even with shipping.So bottom line, if you want to floss your teeth easily and regularly - develop a daily flossing habit - you need these babies. Get a set of three Flossaid and you won't regret it. They're just a little bigger than the original Butlers, and the plastic is similarly stiff. With a pack of 3, you have one for you, your mate, travel kit...As for re-using the same inch of floss on all your teeth as someone mentioned - get over it. It's better than the alternative - not flossing. I just advance the floss one turn each time I clean, so a single 2-foot length of floss lasts a week or more. Happy teeth! For less than $20 you get 3 flossers, delivered - the Long Tail in action!
