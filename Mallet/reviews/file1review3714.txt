review/text: Good product, reasonable price, and very quick shipping. I feel a slight but noticeable effect when I take this. I don't spend as much time searching for words, and it's a little easier to remember things like appointments and errands. I still have to use lists, but it's easier to remember to make notes and check my lists.
