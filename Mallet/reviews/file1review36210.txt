review/text: good clippers. probably the best Ive ever bought. Lets see how they hold up over time. If youre looking for clippers to replace shaving... thye dont cut that low. No clippers will. there WILL be hair left. I was looking for a shaving replacement. Still, they cut closer than any other clippers Ive owned. In that respect Im happy.
