review/text: I have used just about every type of lotion and cream, including LacHydrin 5. The Doak Acid Mantle cream works better than anything else. It even helps with itchy spells, rather than having to spray Benadryl spray which gets sticky. It is very expensive so I use it on my affected areas, for me right now my face, hands, and neck. Worth the price to me!
