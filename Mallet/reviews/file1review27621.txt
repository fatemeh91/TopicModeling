review/text: Receiving this Whey made my day. First of all, it came literally overnight. It was supposed to come in 5-7 days, but it literally came in a day. That says nothing about the product itself, though. I've just finished a tub of the extreme milk chocolate, which had a sickening, cloying fake-chocolate taste and I was eager to get rid of and unsatisfied with. I love coffee, and this Whey -actually tastes like good coffee-. I was simply blown away at how high quality the product was, I don't have much more to say.
