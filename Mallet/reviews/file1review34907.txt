review/text: I get terrible bouts of stress-induced insomnia, and my acupuncturist recently recommended that I take a time-release melatonin tablet to help. My problem is that I usually can fall asleep, but then I wake up at 4:00 or so in the morning, with work-related thoughts swarming through my brain.These usually do help me stay asleep if I take them about twenty minutes before bed time. My acupuncturist also told me that you need to take them for about three months to really regulate your sleep cycles. I notice that if I forget to take these for a night or longer, I'm back to my 4:00 AM wake up.I've tried other sleeping pills in the past, and hate the next-day "hangover" effect. These don't do that at all. I'm a *little* foggy when I wake up, but the fogginess dissipates pretty quickly.My acupuncturist also recommended that I pick up the CDDelta Sleep System, which I had actually already purchased ages ago, but hadn't used much. I now fall asleep to it and if I wake up in the middle of the night, I hit "play" again and it helps me get back to sleep. The combo of the melatonin and the CD has been working well for me.
