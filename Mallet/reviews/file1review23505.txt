review/text: I have been taking this product for about a month now. I all of sudden started having crippling stomach pain. My doctor did the normal tests and found nothing wrong but told me to start taking fiber. I can notice a big difference when I take this product. My stomach pain is gone for the most part. Whenever it starts hurting again, I just up my dose by another 1/2 tsp. It was very easy to start taking this stuff, it did not upset my stomach at all. Actually the first day I took it, I was so happy to know that I might not be in pain and bloated for the rest of my life! The only thing I really recommend it letting it sit for awhile to dissolve well. I take it in the morning and night - for the morning I mix it at night and let it sit and vice versa for the night.
