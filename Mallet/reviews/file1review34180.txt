review/text: I must say this is a tube of excellence!!! I have suffered for well over 3 months with a severe hemorrhoid problem. I really was not sure if this product would be any different, but it was. After trying witch hazel wipes that some times dry up your skin and break you out, and then trying preparation H ointment which my own doctor advise me to try, Walgreen's ointment, as well as others, I was not receiving no real success. When I read the reviews for this I thought to myself why not try it; this product had such positive feedback. After the first day of applying this ointment, it immediately knocked out the competition, and went to work on the problem. For the first time in awhile I was able to sit down with comfort and not pain. Also the cooling concept everyone has been talking about is definitely true. It feels like a breeze of relief!!!! (You can feel it as it works)To all people who are interested in this product and going through the same thing, go ahead and click the add to the cart button and purchase this, you will not be let down by any means. I will be sure to keep this in my medicine cabinet on stand by.
