review/text: This deodorant has healthy ingredients instead of the usual semi-toxic ingredients. It's January, so the real test will come next summer when it's hot outside. However, my daughter recommended this and said she used it all summer and it worked great. It does sting slightly if applied immediately after shaving, but otherwise it's not causing any irritation and it actually seems to work fine! Give it a try if you want something more natural that still works.
