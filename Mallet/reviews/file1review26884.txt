review/text: I've been using this for over a year now in the morning and after my workouts. After trying many other protein powders, Optimum Nutrition seems to always been on top as far as price, taste, mixture and consistency goes. I'm no expert, but as far as I know this is as good of quality protein you will get for the money.I wish the subscribe and save still worked though I liked that.
