review/text: It's a flawless item...I like everything about it.. The shape, how it fits perfect for the my son's little tushie..And the fact that it fits snugly to the toilet.. The splash guard is perfect and perfect sized opening for the little ones..During the Potty training perios, One day my son decided not to use the BabyBJorn Potty chair and use the 'big toilet'... So I had to buy one trainer next day.. I looked at BabieRUs and Target in our area to buy this, but they didn't carry this, so I ended up buying a Safety 1st one, as it felt cushy and soft and thought how bad could it be?? What a wrong choice... I ended up ordering this one after few days of use of the first one.. So ended up spending more.Go for it.. Shipping was faster and arrived in USPS.. Save U R money by ordering this itself and don't fall for the cheaper ones..
