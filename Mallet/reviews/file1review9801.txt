review/text: I absolutely LOVE this product. I have been looking for the perfect tweezers for many years, and now I have found it. I am going to be getting more of this product...maybe even the whole collection. The tips are so precise...just last night I got a sliver out of my daughters hand. It was so easy! I also use this to extract pimples/blackheads with ease. Also, the price is amazing. Other tweezers cost more and don't even work as well...And they bend easily. Not this product...no bending. Plus, it's guaranteed.
