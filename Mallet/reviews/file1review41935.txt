review/text: I have an altimeter watch that needs a new battery literally every year, and almost right on a year time frame. The local store I can get them for about $3 or $4 is frequently out. So I had to buy here for a little more with shipping. I couldn't see an expiration date on this pack since it came from some kind of bulk pack, but it seems full strength. If it doesn't last as long as they normally do, I'll report back but I bought it Sept. 2011, so it'll be a while.
