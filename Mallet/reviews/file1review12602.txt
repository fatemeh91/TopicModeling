review/text: I'm not the type to write reviews, but I love to read them. So this time I want people to know this stuff really works. I am on day 4 and my pimples are gone and my stomach is flat again. I love it.I have been driniking lots of water as well and I have had atleast 3 bowel movements per day.I tried lots of stuff to get rid of constant constipation but nothing has worked so far. This is the only product i would recommend to anyone out there.
