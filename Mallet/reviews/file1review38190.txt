review/text: I highly recommend the Band-Aid Water Block adhesive bandage! I found it to be longer lasting, less thick and constricting, and a more comfortable wearing bandage. After frequent hand washings, other bandages tend to tear at the edges and fall off, whereas this one didn't. I felt comfortable relying on it to offer me protection in my healthcare profession where frequent handwashing is a necessity.
