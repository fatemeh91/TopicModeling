review/text: My new favorite deodorant! What's not to like? I loved the fact that this product (unlike so many of its competitors) really is invisible. It's a comfortable shape for application purposes and glides on easily. Initially, because it was not 'cakey' like other products, I was worried that I wasn't applying enough, but I soon found that one or two strokes kept me completely dry. My favorite attribute, however, is the scent. Usually I search out unscented deodorants since scented ones often smell worse than not using anything! The Powder Fresh scent (and the Orchard Blossom which I have also since purchased) is extremely pleasant, not at all overpowering, and remains all day. Highly recommended.
