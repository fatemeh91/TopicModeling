review/text: I was hesitant to try this product because I HATE the taste of other weight loss shakes, but this actually tastes really good. I've been using the fomula 1 shake twice a day for two weeks and I've lost 10 pounds already. I don't expect to lost 10 pounds every two weeks, but it is a great start! I also feel really good. I have more energy. I am going to keep using it!Also, to the guy who is so mad that it is being sold on Amazon: amazon is not selling it. An independent distributor is.
