review/text: Since this prenatal is plant and food based, it was super easy on my stomach. I could not keep down the over the counter ones from the pharmacy. I still take them after delivery because they are so great for skin, hair, and nails:) Just a small note: you will want to suppliment with addition folic acid (about 800 mg more than what is in these vitamins. That is no biggie- just thought I would mention.
