review/text: This toothbrsh fell way below my expectations; primarily because it came with no added brushes; required what seemed to be a simple assembly but proved difficult. Instructions were very poor. I got a wonderful Oral-B, with three additinal brushes, from COSTCO for $[...] less than this cost. I returned the item to One Stop Shop which shipped the product. To date, this return has not bween reflected on my American WExpress account.
