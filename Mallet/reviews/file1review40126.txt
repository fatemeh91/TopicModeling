review/text: This is a great set, not just for the beginner. The mat is oversized compared to others I've seen. And the thickness was comfortable. Having two blocks was a plus, especially to lend one out to a friend. I would recommend this to anyone, it is a complete set in a bag ready to go.Thanks for offering a great product,
