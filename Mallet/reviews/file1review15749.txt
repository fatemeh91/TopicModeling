review/text: I've used this pen pretty much every day in the three months since I bought it, and it's become one of my favorite writing tools. I've never had a problem with it, and despite heavy use I'm still on the original refills. Cross has always made my favorite pens and this one is no exception. [I've used their pens for more than twenty years, so I have a long history with their products.]The only improvement that I can think of would be the addition of an optional medium-point refill.
