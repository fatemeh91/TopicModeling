review/text: I really enjoy this item. Girth isn't a problem for me, although I was concerned about it after reading the reviews from others. It is not terribly larger than most of the men I've been with. The only reason I did not give this item 5 stars was what seems to be the #1 complaint about this item: the smell. It really is odd, however, this product is not meant to be stuck up your nose, so at least once it gets under the covers, it is not bad at all.The shipping time was amazing as well. I ordered it on Christmas Eve and actually had it before New Years. That was just the standard shipping.I like the fact that it is clear jelly, I am a tech and love to see the way things work, so seeing the innards in action is fun. I just wish the hard plastic was see thru as well, but I can see the visual reasoning for the silver. You can't see it in the photos, but under the head some of the raised bumps make a smili face.This by far outdoes any other product I have tried; it is fun, waterproof, clear, gets you off almost faster than you would like and has a smili face on it, definatly worth the money!AN UPDATE!I have now had this product for almost a year and am still happy with it; however I did discover a bit of a problem with its nature. I love this product so much I was using it at least once a day, and after a while my clitoris began to hurt. Long story short, it was the constant use of the product that caused it, as well as the insensitivity that folowed. Not to fear though, when used in moderation (1-3 times a week at most) this product is still my favorite!
