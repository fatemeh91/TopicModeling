review/text: i have been shaving for 10 years. i've tried the Venus, the Gillette Daisies, and generic brands. but the Intuition blew them all out of the water. i mean, shaving is not fun especially because i shave my entire arms, but this razor cut my shaving time in half. it cuts CLOSE, glides and moisturizes. i love it.
