review/text: I recently had to remove a rug from my bedroom that had been there for years. I found that the floor underneath had been somewhat damaged from the rug. The floor was discolored and didn't match the flooring around it. It also appeared that any wax or finish that had been under the rug was gone.Luckily I had some of this wax on hand and took the chance that I could restore the floor a little.It did take 3 applications to this particular spot because the flooring had become porous, but now the flooring under the old rug matches the rest of the room, it has a nice glow to it and it isn't so glossy as to make the floor slippery when walking on it with socks on.The flooring has a nice semi-gloss look to it.I've also used this product on my undamaged flooring and it has proved to keep my heavily trafficked areas in good shape. If it scuff from moving furniture you simply just wax the spot that scuffed and forget about it.Do NOT use a sponge mop to apply it. I use my Swiffer with an old face towel attached to it.If your floor has dried to a dull finish once your application has dried, you need to follow the easy directions on the back of the can. No other product other than the One Step is needed for this step.Each new coat you use dissolves the one already on the floor.Do not use this product on pre-finished flooring.
