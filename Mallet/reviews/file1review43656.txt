review/text: I recently purchased this product based on its good reviews. The other day I took it to my cardiologist and found that the Systolic Pressure is way off. Now I can pack it up and send to Omron to get fixed which means I won't have it for another 2 weeks. My health issues are very recent and I am trying to cope but something like this doesn't help!
