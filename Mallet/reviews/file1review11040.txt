review/text: I've experienced stale bad breath my whole life no matter how often I brushed, nothing worked. Until I found this!If it's possible to be in luv with a product this is it! I agree with one of the others who've reviewed, I wonder why dentists don't recommend it? I will admit that I use this in conjunction with Therabreath Toothpaste & Mouthwash daily. It is definitely pricey but it works also. The regular otc pastes/mouthwashes seem to make things worse for me. So anyone experiencing foul breath try the therabreath products and Chlorofresh! PROBLEM SOLVED! By the way I'm only on my 2nd week with Chlorofresh...it works that fast! (liquid formula, will try capsules next) I'm ecstatic with the idea of waking up to neutral morning breath instead of the previous invisible roaring lion.
