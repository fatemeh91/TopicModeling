review/text: We originally purchased this from our vet for $27 because one of our dog's ears were consistantly bitten by flies. Even though we try to let him stay inside the house, whenever we let him out, his ear tip would be filled with flies. Ever since we got this product, we would apply a small amount to the tip of his ears before we let him out. Surprisingly, there isn't a single fly ever got on his ears again!!! LOVE THE PRODUCT!!!!
