review/text: I've been using these for years but for some reason they are no longer available in any of the grocery stores near me. I like them because they offer enough friction to clean tough stains (especially when used with BarKeeper's Friend) but they don't scratch my stainless steel pots the way steel wool used to. They also work great on my stainless steel cook top. I bought a case which reduced the price per item and spread out the shipping.
