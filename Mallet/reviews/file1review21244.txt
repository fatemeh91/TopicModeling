review/text: The other reviews all cover most of the basics, but one thing that keeps this from being a great toothbrush is the incredibly annoying "timer." If you brush your teeth in four quadrants for 30 seconds each and stop at exactly 2 minutes, then you'll love this brush (when did it drop to 2 minutes anyway? Dentists recommended 3 minutes when I was in school). If you would rather brush your teeth on your own time, then it's incredibly annoying that the motor skips every 30 seconds and then stutters for a few seconds every 2 minutes.
