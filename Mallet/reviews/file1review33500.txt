review/text: I had a WaterPik when, as an adult, I found myself with a mouth full of braces. It was a Godsend! All these years later I decided I needed another one, and I'm so pleased to have it! This water flosser is a fabulous addition to brushing and flossing as it blasts out debris from beneath bridges and in between teeth that sometimes get missed with traditional flossing. With all of the latest research on dental hygiene and cancer, longevity and overall health, this is a 'power tool' I won't be without.I opted for the "cheap" model as I didn't need whistles and bells. Reviewers who have complained about poor pressure probably aren't adjusting it on the handle. I find the pressure just perfect, and adjustable!I recommend this product.
