review/text: BE CAREFUL!! Please don't waste money to buy troubles. I got 28 pieces of CROWN brand and 72 pieces of BEYOND SEVEN brand in a bubbled envelop. Not a variety pack at all. There is no DUREX,no LIFESTYLES, no OKAMOTO as shown on the picture on Amazon web site. Those two brands are all made in Thailand and I have never heard before. I asked a return but the seller asked me to drop to the post office marked "return to sender" first.( They saved the postage for returning and didn't trust that I would return.) I asked the new shipment should be DUREX, LIFESTYLES, and OKAMOTO only. Unfortunately, I still got 12 pieces of CROWN brand and 24 pieces of BEYOND SEVEN brand. I drop these two unknown (may be fake) brands products (36 pieces, i.e. 36%) to trash can already. This is a very EXPENSIVE AND BAD experience from Amazon. This seller is totally not reliable and not trustworthy.
