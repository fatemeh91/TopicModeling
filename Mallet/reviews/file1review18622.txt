review/text: I looked all over the place for a battery to go in our thermometer and could never find them. This is the right size so I bought it and was hoping it would work and the price was right. Well, it worked....once. I put the battery in and turned it on and it was fine. Went to use it this weekend and it was dead. The only time it worked was the first day I installed this batter. The thing hardly had any charge at all. What a joke. Save your money.
