review/text: I was totally ignorant about human physiology until I took the "HeartSaver AED" class. Now I know to operate an AED and I understand CPR. I was amazed when I read that HeartStart is the first heart defibrillator available for home use without a prescription. I want to be prepared for sudden cardiac arrest, since heart disease runs in my wife's family. Hopefully if I ever do have to call 911 and she has to wait for an ambulance to arrive, I can increase her chances of survival.
