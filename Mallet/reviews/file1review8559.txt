review/text: this brush is the best of its kind I've ever used. The brush collapses easily to get through any bottle neck and then expands perfectly down in the bottle to wash it very effectively - and compresses easily to come back out with no resistance. Handle is plenty long enough to get to the bottom of any tall narrow container where a normal adult hand cannot go. Highly recommend it.
