review/text: I love this massager. The variable speeds come in handy. I really don't need the attached posts but I bought the unit with the posts just in case I ever needed them. This model is the same as the local chiropractic clinic uses. I can even use it when I am alone. I just prop it against the recliner and let it vibrate my back. It's great. I highly recommend the variable speed jeanie rub massager.
