review/text: These things work okay for a while but then the plastic hose that goes from the pump to the wand will get brittle and it will just break. Then you will have to throw the unit out and buy another one because they design it so you can't fix or replace the hose, so plan on buying a new one every year or two. The quality of this product is extremely poor. Another good example of the garbage coming out of China.
