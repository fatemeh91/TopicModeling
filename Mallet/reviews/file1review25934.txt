review/text: So far charges great and for the price you can't beat it.Currently mine has an issue is after it finishes charging. There are two lights on the charger. One for power (red) one for status (green). The green light is supposed to stop flashing when they are done charging but mine the green light just turns off.I have contacted the manuf and waiting their response. In all fairness I just emailed them minutes prior to writing this review.So we'll just have to see what happens.Rick K.
