review/text: Bought a couple bottles at Costco to try out. This stuff is horrible tasting. I'm going to bear it out for the duration of these 2 bottles because I've already bought them and others say it will work for aching knees. Check back in a few weeks and I'll update my review. The taste is something like an awful cough syrup with some rotten berry jam swirled in it. It's nasty!
