review/text: This can really find those trigger points and since YOU are in control, you can give each spot as much attention as it needs. I think an improvement would be to have an area with two larger extrusions close together that could allow you to really stretch your neck out, where you could pull more into your spine without digging in too much so as to put your neck in traction and help restore the natural S-curve of the spine. But still, i highly recommend this. My chiropactor charges $30 for one visit and this will no doubt save more than a few trips and keep small problems from getting bigger.
