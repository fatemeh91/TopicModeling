review/text: What can you really say about a brush? Well, it's ergonomics are excellent for one. Most brushes with a single connection point for the handle are very flimsy. This brush is not flimsy at all. The handle/frame are very sturdy. There are multiple layers/kinds of bristles that handle any type of mess. It's a great brush. Get it. Make your cleaning a tad less miserable.
