review/text: im a college student with a small living area, so ive been looking for a good push broom and this was the best deal i found anywhere. u cant find these at target,and their too pricey at wall mart. i use this mostly on my carpet, but its great for smooth surface areas to, but the best part about it ,is that its quiet and doesn't need electricity.Ive also noticed that recent reviews have stated that the handles kept falling off--but if you follow the instructions carefully like me, then ur handles will never fall off.***my only complaint is that it doesn't come with a tiny robot to clean the dustbins and sweeper brush, lol**hope this review helps.regards, Johnny --the cleanest dorm in history guy--
