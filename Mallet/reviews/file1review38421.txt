review/text: I've been really happy with this. I've never waxed or used anything like this before, and still the pain is not unbearable. It works best if the hair isn't too long (usually a day or two after shaving). I haven't had success in the bikini area at all, and the underarms are pretty painful, but it's great for legs. It'd be nice to have a cordless option, but it's not a big deal for me. It is a little noisy but no worse than an electric razor.
