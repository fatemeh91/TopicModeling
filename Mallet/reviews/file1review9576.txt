review/text: This protein bar tastes great, however the major problem I have with this protein bar and the other flavors with this brand is the amount of sugar alchol. While they claim only 2-3g of sugar, the rest is compensated with 26-28g of sugar alcohol which is way more than one person should have. The amount of sugar alchol gave me the worst case of gas I had in a long time which is simply not ideal for working out in a gym full of big angry scary men yelling all the time if you know what I mean. I think if they were to decrease the amount of sugar alcohol and compensate for a little more actual sugar to keep the sweet taste, it would be smart move.
