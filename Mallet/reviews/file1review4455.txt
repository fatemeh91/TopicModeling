review/text: At the time I began to shave (which I consider the bane of being a guy but look forward to getting done for the sake of looking professional, pleasing the lady, and not having a scraggly beard or whiskers), I've always wanted to shave as close as possible and not cut myself while shaving. (I've always looked lousy with a mustache and/or beard.) No razor blade is perfect but the Gillette Fusion is good enough. I refuse to pay prices at the supermarket and drug stores or go through all the madness of getting it cheap at Costco. The best bang for the buck and to save time is to get them via Amazon.
