review/text: This clipper is heavy and works very well for my amateur home haircuts. After using another brand for the past 20+ years, the Wahl is a treat. It comes with instructions for best results and a variety of accessories. The noise does not bother me because I am used to the sound of a clipper. It just hums and you can adjust the amount of sound that is produced. Wahl gives a 5 year warranty too.
