review/text: I have been using this for many years now and will use nothing else. One review here said they only got 1 day out of it. I cannot imagine how. I'm a hairy guy so I've found a few tricks to making it last longer. Trim the under arm hair as short as you are willing to tolerate. I buzz mine very short. Bacteria lives in the hair and on the skin. That is why it is so malodorous (fancy for stinky Jim). The fewer surfaces for the bacteria to live on, the easier this product will work. The more hair the harder it is for lavilin to be distributed evenly. I found that as the hair grows, so does the odor. I have also found that activity and diet play a roll in how long it lasts. I can get as much as 14 days out of it but in summer I've gotten as few as 4 days.
