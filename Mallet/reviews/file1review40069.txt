review/text: Of all the toothpaste I have tried over the years, Mentadent proves the best in quality. The Crystal Ice is my favorite and I order this through amazon because I was not able to find this one in stores. The hydrogen peroxide and toothpaste blend are the "best" among all brands with similar ingredients. For the price it is well worth ordering online. I highly recommend Mentadent toothpaste.
