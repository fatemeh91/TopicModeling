review/text: I should explain exactly how it went down:I am normally in shape but i usually have some off weeks and get lazy, workout every few days and eat crap food.I decided to workout and eat right, i started doing the insanity workouts (following the calendar) and within a week(yes, a single week) the fat in my stomach cut down enough for you to see my abs. (I still have that exact picture of just a single week of working out)So the next monday i began taking the CUTS product. I took it twice a day like it says and worked out following the insanity calander (and sometimes did bonus workouts)I continued to eat healthy, meaning no junk food, low sugar, high protein, etc.Three weeks later and i could almost swear it did nothing. Yes, i know my shoulders and chest look nicer, maybe my abs are slightly more noticeable. But i KNOW that i would have achieved this without CUTS.How do I know? Read my post from the beginning again and it will be clear.I honestly feel like I was ripped off. Luckily Universal has a money back guarantee.I have been taking Animal pak and Animal flex.Out of the 3 products i've been using, i think flex had a more noticeably (positive) effect. My joints don't hurt as much, but i do notice that my lower back is less flexible. Perhaps not enough yoga is the problem.Animal pak doesnt give me energy throughout the day and i would feel either tired, lazy, or depressed... BUT i do notice that DURING my workouts, i seem to be able to push harder. So thats good.Well, back to the CUTS review, i wouldn't say avoid it, but it honestly didnt do much for me. The ingredients in the capsules MUST be good for something, right?
