review/text: I recently purchased the "Wahl Sterling Reflections Senior Clipper #8501" and I am amazed at the sharpness of the blades and the power of the V5000 motor. These clippers cut with ease and precision. The design and motor housing is simple yet of sturdy construction and probably lasting.
