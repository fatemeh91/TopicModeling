review/text: I used the same Gillette razor blade for about 6 months. I finally decided it was time to get a new set of razors. I saw these and thought it was a good deal as it was the cheapest price I could find.When I started using my razors, I noticed immediately that I was not getting the close and comfortable shave I had with my older razor. I thought maybe one out of my box of 12 might have been dull, so I tried another razor. Unfortunately, that one had the same problem.These razors work, but they could be better. They wear out much faster than I expected and they don't give me the close shave I want, but they sell at a decent price. I think next time, though, I will just accept the $50 price tag and buy them from Costco.
