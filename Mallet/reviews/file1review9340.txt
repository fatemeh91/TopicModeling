review/text: This product has helped with my marriage! I can fix my husband's meds for the week and he simply pulls out one packet a day. I can tell when he has missed medicines. I love the color coding and how easy the individual day packets are to remove - just pick one up. (similar products have to be snapped apart). I am glad I found this product. Especially glad to find it on Amazon where the purchase was easy.
