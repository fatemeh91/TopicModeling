review/text: I am surprised that so many Amazon reviewers are put off by the taste of Garden of Life Perfect Food Powder. If your diet up to now has consisted mostly of Coke and Krispy Kremes, maybe I could understand; but if you're accustomed to the flavor of fresh green vegetables, you should have no problem.I like the taste and prepare Perfect Food according to the instructions on the label. I mix the powder and water in a blender for a few seconds so that the final result is smooth, even a bit frothy. Then I sit back and slowly sip the dark green elixir like a fine cognac.I've never tried Perfect Food Original, which is stevia free, but even Perfect Food is not at all sweet to my palette.Garden of Life now offers Perfect Food Raw. I've read a lot of reviews but I can't find any that discuss differences (in taste or purported benefits) between the two drinks. Perhaps another Garden of Lifer could enlighten us.Don't expect health miracles from this product. But if you're coming up short on the vegetable side of your diet, give Perfect Food a chance and see if it's right for you.
