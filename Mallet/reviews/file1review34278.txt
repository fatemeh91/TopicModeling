review/text: I had my first flare up at age 40 and it lasted about 5 weeks. At first I tried over the counter stuff and no relief. Then looked into the Fargelin and Mayinglong Musk Hemorrhoids Ointment Cream. The 4th week I was happy to have had some relief from the ointment. That worked and I took 4 pills of the Fargelin for 5 days in a row and that seemed to work. BUT even more IMPORTANT, I was eating salads for 2 meals a day, soft foods like boiled potatoes and carrots, soups and bananas. No Meat, No Breads, and not crunchy stuff. And lots of naturally squeezed juices and lots of water. Also daily hot sea salt baths. A combination of all these things made the hemmies disappear.. FINALLY!!
