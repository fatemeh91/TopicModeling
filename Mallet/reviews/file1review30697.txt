review/text: I really hate the multi-blade cartridge razors, and electric razors really irritate my skin. I decided to try wet-shaving using a safety razor, and after reading reviews, I went with the Merkur classic.Although a little intimidating at first, the Merkur is actually very easy to use, and provides a nice, close shave. The key is to just be patient while you shave, and to pay attention to what you're doing. The single, straight edge makes shaping sideburns and facial hair pretty easy. Combine with a decent blade, brush, and cream, and you're on your way. I bought the inexpensive Tweezerman brush, Tom's of Maine cream, and the Derby blades, and I'm very happy.
