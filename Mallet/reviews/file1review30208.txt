review/text: Having tried several different cordless hand vacs, I wanted a corded version to make sure I got as much power as possible. The pet hair attachment that comes with this is awesome for picking up pet hair (cat) off of furniture. The attachment has little rubber stubs for brushes and it works fantastic. It's like watching a commercial for a product, where there is a bunch of hair on a couch and with one swipe of the vac, it picks up virtually all of the hair. This thing really works great. You won't be disappointed if you want it for pet hair. It's also easy to empty and you can get replacement filters for relatively cheap.
