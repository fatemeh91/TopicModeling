review/text: I have tons of insoles, and these are decent. I also have several Tuli heel cups which I think are excellent at cradling and supporting the heel. What I wish Tuli made were insoles that have their full heel cup built in so we could have arch support along with heel adjustment. When I saw the waffle heels on these insoles, I dared to hope that Tuli had combined the two, but alas, it was only a slight indent. Frankly I think the Spenco supports with firm arches are better, even without the heel cup.Tuli, if you are listening: your heel cups are your best asset- try combining them with an insole that gives good arch support and you will have a winner!
