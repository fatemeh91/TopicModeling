review/text: I purchased this tub for my son 11 years ago. We tried many infant tubs (from cheap to expensive) and this one was the BEST HANDS DOWN! For years it was my go-to gift at all baby showers. Then, about 6 years ago this style tub disappeared from stores and online. I was devastated! Now it is once again back on the market! So glad. Do not be mislead by other reviews that mention fingers/toes being caught in folds. This NEVER happened to my baby. Keep in mind... this is an INFANT tub. Not a toddler tub. It is to be used in the sink. It keeps the baby secure and upright with just enough water to get the bath done. The well at the foot of the tub is perfect for dispensing a bit of baby wash and holding the wash cloth. The pull plug in the base is perfect for draining with no mess. And for those mom's who don't have the luxury of a lot of space... this tub folds up quite small for storage! I highly recommend it. And I don't work for Safety 1st...
