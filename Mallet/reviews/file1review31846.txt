review/text: I have to say that I am one of those people constantly looking for the perfect product. I recently purchased this at the AOS store while questioning the sales person who stated she was also a cosmetologist. I don't know if that is at all of use, but she assured me that I needed the lotion and not the gel for my skin type. I was concerned that with the Shea butter/oil it might be a bit thick. She stated not at all, it would not be a problem. I had been usingEdwin Jagger 99.9% Natural Moisturizing Aftershave Lotion - Sea Buckthorn, 3.4-OunceWhich I really liked, but it does contain some alcohol, so I thought I would try a brand without.I must say that the AOS lemon is a very pleasant scent. It does go on a bit thick and I did notice a residue (dare I say oily/greasy) that seemed to linger most of the day. I also developed the start of a pimple on my jawline. I am 41 and haven't had a pimple in I can't remember how long, so I did attribute this to the heaviness of the lotion. The next day I used my alum block (Bloc Osma Natural Alum Block) and then applied the lotion. It seemed to resolve the pimple, I didn't feel as heavy a residue on my face, but I could feel the lotion all day, never seemed to get fully absorbed.Summary: This is a decent product, with a pleasant scent and does seem to moisturize face well post shave. I do like the Edwin Jagger lotion better, considering both are at about the same price point. I believe the oils in the latter probably offset the small amount of alcohol present (not enough to feel any sting on application).
