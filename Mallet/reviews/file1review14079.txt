review/text: If you want a soft-hanging organizer, this is the best you'll get. It does tip forward a bit, as any hanging fabric organizer will, but it has compensated for that with pocketed shelves (as opposed to open shelves like on theDex Products Ultimate Baby Organizerwhere everything slides right off). I use this Munchkin organizer with thePrince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmerand it fits great right on top in a very convenient place. It fits everything I need in the organizer, whereas with theDex OrganizerI had to use an extra TV table tray to handle the overflow. The pocketed diaper middle section is great! It actually holds the diapers in! It's tricky to "restock" it, but the fact that the diapers do not tip out more than makes up for it! If you want something sturdier, you'll have to go with hard plastic, because you won't find a better fabric organizer.
