review/text: I've had a splinter in my hand for quite some time and haven't been able to remove it. I had tried several different tweezers and sewing needles without any luck. I ordered the "Splintertweeze" and within 5 minutes of opening the package, I was able to remove that irritating little splinter that I thought was going to be a permanent attachment. Thanks Tweezerman!
