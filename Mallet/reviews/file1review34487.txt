review/text: I used this lovely thing along with Vinpocetin and Neurostin to reign in my regurgitating brain. I have to say, for the very basics, this Brain Essentials alone is actually not bad. I added the other things to make up where it lacked. Then that started to get expensive. The Vinpocetin is cheap but the Neurostin is expensive and kinda trashy. That and taking a fistful of pills every morning (with my multivitamins) made me feel like those old commercials where that girl is smashing pots around the kitchen trying to show you what your brain on drugs is like to you and your family... or even the frying egg!Anyway, back to reality. This stuff, not bad, really if you want to try something take it alone or with Vinpocetin and it won't break the bank. Steer clear of the third thing I added. Don't care about breaking the bank to getting your brain all fuzzied up with herbs that you don't smoke: Neuro-Natural Memory is the supplement I've moved to. Yep, it's more expensive, but who's explaining themselves? No I don't work for them. It just took me a while to find them and I thought I'd mention it. You can come to your own conclusion if you do your own research. That aside, this supplement won't do any harm and certainly it'll do more good than bad.
