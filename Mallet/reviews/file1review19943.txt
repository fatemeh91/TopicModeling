review/text: I have two of these potty seats - one for upstairs and one for downstairs. They fit the seats perfectly (no sliding around). The built-in splash guard is great for boys AND girls. At first I thought girls wouldn't need it, bit I'm SO GLAD it's there. My daughter has some pretty wild sprays, but the splash guard catches everything. The best part is minimal clean-up (unlike with potty chairs).My daughter is only 22 months old, so she needs a foot stool to reach the toilet. The kid foot stools are too small and unstable. If you have a very young child, buy an adult foot stool (like the ones for elderly patients). They will not flip up/over. The child has plenty of room to step up, turn around, and sit down. The stool is wide enough for the child (and parent!) to feel confident and comfortable enough to bend over and pull his/her underwear up or down.
