review/text: The straps come undone easily, and you can easily see it under a bra and tshirt, but with a sweater/sweatshirt over it, it's not bad. It does work as a 'reminder' to straighten up posture, but still leaves plenty of room for poor posture/slouching.A better alternative would be to work those muscles at the gym or at home to strengthen them, thus, less likely to slouch.
