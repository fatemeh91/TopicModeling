review/text: The Tide to Go Instant Stain Remover is pretty handy when you have an emergency situation on your clothing. It works great on Pen stains, not so much on the greasy, food oil type stains. Best is to use the laundry detergent right away, but in tight situations an Instant Stain Remover sometimes keeps the stain from sticking or clinging to your clothing.Removes: Soda, Ink, Coffee, Milk, Ice Cream and Orange Juice so far..DOES NOT Removes: Any HIGH OIL TYPES like, Curry, Salad Dressing (sometimes), Chicken Stew etc.. Mainly, it will take out the stains but still lives a slight mark on the clothing..
