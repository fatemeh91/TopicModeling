review/text: These are really good quality for the price!! Advice to note prior to ordering, Natural factors has 2 types of this salmon oil 1000mg, BE SURE TO GET 'Enteric Coated' version Soft gels. NO fishy aftertaste w/ this one!!! Better oils come from cleaner waters in Alaska per studies I have done, this one fits the bill!! Great Price for E.Coated and product quality, health purposes. I take them (2 a day) for better health and lower cholesterol levels. They are the standard large size pills, so if have trouble swallowing might avoid. I have NO problems swallowing them myself!! I love these, repeat buyer!
