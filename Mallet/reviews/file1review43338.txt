review/text: Not sure why people are dissing this. I only have one stainless steel appliance, a toaster. And with the trouble I had with that toaster looking awful I am very happy I don't have SS appliances. This toaster I was about to get rid of because the streaks on it drove me mad. It worked fine and looked like heck. I remember having seen this at Target back when I didn't own any SS item (except pans which BKF takes care of) and when I went looking for it out of desperation it wasn't there. I have tried all manner of natural cleaners on that darn toaster, KD Gold which I use everywhere, the all purpose Method cleaners and even Windex.I finally found it at Whole Foods. Initially was unhappy when I sprayed and just gave a quick wipe. But then I felt it with my fingers and felt some sort of granules (for want of a better word) I grabbed a washcloth and rubbed it a bit. Beautiful.I think this is akin to car polish or Jubilee, if you just swipe it you are going to have a mess. But buff it just a bit and it is gorgeous. And yes, it stays that way for quite awhile.Taking off one star for the lack of stressing to buff it a bit (directions do say to buff but I think they need to word it stronger)
