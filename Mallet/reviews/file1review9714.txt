review/text: This product worked for me where others failed. The SmokeAway kit I ordered lacked the compact disk and cost a lot more. I should have checked Amazon first, but since it REALLY WORKED I'm very happy even though I spent twice the money for less product. I took phase one for just five days, then gave the rest of the kit away to a friend. Now, four and a half months later I'm still nicotine free and the &quot;nic fits&quot; are less frequent and way less intense. Sometimes I go for days without even thinking about a smoke.Is there willpower involved? You bet. This product gets you thru the first week or so, after that its up to you. You must WANT to quit. This product does what its advertised to do, however. It helps you get off nicotine in that all important first week or so. After that, you have a fighting chance to gut it out the rest of the way.Great product.
