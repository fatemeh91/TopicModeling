review/text: Sorry, these comments are for the DPS 9000....Even though the manufacture info does not list my HP photosmart 425, I took a chance. Works perfectly, and have not had to recharge once after 3 weeks. Only relatively small drawback is that with it attached, my camera will not fit properly into its case.
