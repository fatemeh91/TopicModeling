review/text: It just arrived tonight and I've already got an opinion on the cover - and I'd rather have my $90 back (I think the price was $160 w/o vs. $250 w/). (For sanitation, I will of course be using clean sheets for each client anyway.) I wasn't sure that I wanted it, but also I didn't want to need it and not be able to order the cover separately.As a licensed massage therapist, I have taken more than 32 hours of Thai massage training and this is exactly what I was looking for in a mat - I didn't want to make do with a futon or replica (60x80 "queen size" bed toppers). I got the 66 x 80 and I feel like it will definitely be enough space for both client and practitioner. It's very comfortable. So far I'm very happy.
