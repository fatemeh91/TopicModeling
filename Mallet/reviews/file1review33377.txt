review/text: Though I love the Merkur super blades and rate them 5 start the non-super is only average. It feels kind of rough on my face and like it is hacking a bit. I normally use Shark blades and they are much better than this. I got a free blade in a Merkur razor so tried without buying. I'm glad I did. I was so impressed with Merkur supers that I might have bought these.
