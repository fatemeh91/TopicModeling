review/text: All I can really say is this stuff tastes terrible. I'm not picky when it comes to taste, so believe me when I say it's bad, it is really bad - worse than original flavored Nyquil in my opinion. It doesn't remotely taste like punch in anyway, has a chalky texture, and does not mix well with water (even when doubling the recommended amount). I even tried mixing it with juice and crystal light to mask the taste, but it is so overpowering, even that didn't work. I was only able to use it three times (each time I had to choke it down and then convince myself not to let it come back up) before I decided it just wasn't worth it. I decided it was better to cut my losses and throw it out than try to stomach it any more. I can't say for sure if it works or not, because I couldn't bring myself to keep taking it. Instead of boosting my workout performance, Gakic made me nauseas, and made my workouts more difficult.Maybe the pill form would be a better choice than the powder. However,8 pills at a time seems like quite a bit. If Muscletech isn't willing to spend the time perfecting an aspect like flavor, who knows how much effort was put into formulating the product? I'll try something else next time.
