review/text: This is great and fast breakfast and lunch. The larger size is very convenient. The flavor is outstanding and the drink nutritious. I have it on subscribe and save (which reduces the price). That means I have it set to to be sent automatically and I don't have to keep going to the store to get the smaller cans.
