review/text: I was never able to get this to fit comfortably. Then, possibly because of the poor fit, it never seemed cold enough to offer me relief. I've only tried it cold. Perhaps it works better hot. It is good for a flat surface like your back, shoulder blade or legs. But I didn't think it worked well as a cervical collar. I do much better with the $1.50 rectangular gel packs.
