review/text: I'm TTC and have been taking these vitamins for a few months. They do have a vitamin smell, but that is expected with any good vitamin. They areeee on the larger side, but you only need to take one! I switched to the Rainbow Lite Prenatal Petite Mini's for a while, but you have to take three of those. While they areee smaller, it's so much easier to just take the one big vitamin. Especially if you dislike the taste, it's just easier and less painful to choke down the one. I really loathe taking pills, but taking the one isn't so bad... especially when you know what it's for!! = )
