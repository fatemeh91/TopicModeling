review/text: We recently took a trip with our almost two toddler and purchased these bibs since we wouldn't have the means of watching bibs after every meal and packing space was limited. These worked great!The bibs stay on very well, unless your child deliberately pulls them off. I have received other disposable bibs as gifts before that simply had a sticker to keep them around my child's neck, and they didn't stay on well at all. The size is great for covering the full front of your child's clothes.The pocket is great for keeping messes out of laps. The fold over flap that helps keep it open didn't always stay down, but that was a minimal issue.Around the house I prefer to use cloth bibs that can be washed and reused to minimize waste. But I think these might be my new best friend to keep in the diaper bag for when eating out or on the go!
