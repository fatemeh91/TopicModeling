review/text: After reading some of the reviews that complained about the taste, I was nervous to try it for the first time. I've taken a lot of herbal tinctures and take fermented cod liver oil, so I was expecting something gross. This stuff tastes FINE, absolutely nothing offensive about it. I don't even find it that strong of a taste. Citrus-y and mildly minty. Liquid, under the tongue is the best way to take B12, so there you go. If you're worried about flavor, don't be.
