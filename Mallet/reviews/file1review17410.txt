review/text: After buying hundreds of products on Amazon, this is my first ever review--I've never been compelled to write anything until this trimmer. I've had a beard for years, and tried several corded/cordless options. Nothing is better than this trimmer.Pros:- Easy cleaning. Pull off the guard, flip open the blade assembly, and brush out any hairs that have accumulated. Brilliant design by Remington.- No oiling needed, ever. I've had these for 1 year and they have never had that tell-tale sound of needing some lube.- Great for traveling. I just throw it in a zip lock bag and I'm set (sometimes I don't use the bag out of laze, but since it keeps clean it's not a big deal).Cons:- Non standard numerical settings. The numbers on the adjustable guard do not correspond to any industry standard (at least one I know of). So I just started high and dialed it down after my first attempt. Not a big deal, really.Bottom Line: You will not be disappointed with this purchase. If you are like me and have tried a lot of other trimmers, appreciate thoughtful product design, and like to own the best, this product is for you.
