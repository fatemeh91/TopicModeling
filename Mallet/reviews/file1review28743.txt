review/text: I prefer the natural gold std whey, but I was bored with the lack of flavors so I bought this. It's actually really tasty with milk (I use vanilla soy milk). Its not that bad with water either. I think buying the 5lbs was an over kill. I will probably try something different if I can actaully get thru all this. I still use the gold std whey natural vanilla as my go to post work out drink.
