review/text: When I first received the Ontel Products GOPMO2 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool Set, it worked fine, but over time it "sprung" the screws and the tips wore down. I am allergic to latex and I searched and found a US made product called EZ Reacher - Standard, with blue silicone tips. Found rave reviews at arcmate dot com. Please, check it out. I am ordering today...
