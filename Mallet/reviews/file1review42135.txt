review/text: I have a little one with a lot of tummy issues, apraxia and mild CP. I bought this, as it disolves in the mouth, not the tummy, so no upset. It is a nice taste. I started taking it too, as I was so overly tired and worn out. I helped my little one in leaps with speech and focus. Within a day I felt so much better and focused---I could not believe it!! I gave it to my older two teens during their finals week. One child said it did not help. My older one in college was asking for it and said he felt more focus. It does not replace missed sleep, only sleep will do that. However, if you are run down after getting good sleep, I would try this. I have order more for my family and for parents. My dad is getting a little more forgetfull and I have read it is often due to low Methl B12. Not all B12 is equal. Now, he just started this week, so to early to say how it is working on him. I also stressed with my mum, there could be more medical issue going on and we need to keep an eye, but this was worth a try for now.
