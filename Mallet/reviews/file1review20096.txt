review/text: This is the best next thing to hormone replacement without the side affects. Has given me back my life. I would recommend this to anyone before going on any other medicine for your hormones first. I was fighting fatique for a year after I realized I was in full blown menopause. My hormones were a mess. This helped me so much. You do need to give it time to get into your system. But after a few weeks, I could really tell the difference.Best of Luck!Jewels
