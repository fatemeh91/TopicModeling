review/text: I must say I was hesitant when I opened the package because the label was different than the picture. Then I read a note from the company which said that they used their own labels and the product is identical. Well I took three as directed the first day (one every 8 hrs. or so) and by the NEXT day my aching back felt about 90 percent better. I am so grateful I saw this product recommended on a tv talk show. This is sure safer to take than what my dr. prescribed for my back, which was a medicine that was really four advils! I hope it isn't my imagination that I feel so so much better. Thank you!!
