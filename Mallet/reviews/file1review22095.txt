review/text: These bra pads are by far the most comfortable and absorbant that I have found. I have tried at least 4 different brands and styles. These are my favorite. They hold up well after months of washings. The only drawback is that they are thick (thus the softness and super absorbency) and have a seam that will not always lie flat along the edge. If you are wearing a tight or extremely thin shirt, you may be able to see the outline of the pad through your clothing. Although I found this to be the case with many bra pads, these seemed to be the worst. But, their excellent performance and comfort still make them my hands down favorite. All the other bra pads I have just sit in my drawer.
