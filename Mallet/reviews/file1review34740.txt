review/text: I guess deodorant is a personal preference, but I like this stuff. My girlfriend also likes the scent too. I think it lasts alright too. Here is a tip, once you have 3 empty bottles of this deodorant, pour 1 bottle into 3 parts into the 3 bottles, then cut the rest with alcohol. So, 1 bottle will give you three bottles that smell pretty much the same. 3 bottles for the price of one!
