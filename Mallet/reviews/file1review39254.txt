review/text: Great product at a very economical price. Nice kit with functional attachments. I would purchase again but it seems that the materials are a significant upgrade from the clippers that we replace. My wife cust the Grandkids hair. It has already paid for itself. I am tempted to let my wife cut my hair but she just says she doesn't want to cut it. Professional quality.
