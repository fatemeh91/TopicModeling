review/text: Futuro makes another version that is like a compression sleeve that extends above and below the elbow and has two forearm pressure points. I find it to be much easier to use. This one goes on fine, then slides down frequently. If I try pulling my sleeve up and adjusting it, it slides down again when I try to get the sleeve back down over it. If you might be using this while wearing long sleeves, or you don't want to have to make adjustments throughout the day, I recommend checking out the other version that just says "Elbow" and not this sport version.
