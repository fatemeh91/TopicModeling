review/text: This product did not work at all. I suspect its unhealthy for people who do not want to ingest chlorine on a daily basis. Additionally, it had no impact on the quality of my breath. Therabreath is a much better product. Dr. Katz's probiotic kit seems to be working. The one advantage to this chlorine kit is that it features one of the best tongue scrapers you can find.
