review/text: I bought this eyelash curler five years ago at a price of $35 after seeing it on Elle magazine. It has worked wonders for me, and has definitely lasted longer than I thought it would. In fact, it could have lasted longer, had I been more careful and not crushed the wand of the curler on accident. (I crushed it when I closed my makeup box on it. It surprisingly still works, but I'd rather get a new one than struggle to use this broken one) I am delighted that they are now selling this item at such a great price. Anyway, as far as the product goes, the reason some people may not like it is that it really doesn't work unless you first put on mascara. And like for most heated last curlers, you have to find a mascara that does not burn off from the heat. On the cheaper end, I like Maybelline's Sky High Waterproof mascara, and on the more expensive end, I like Prescriptive's regular mascara in the gray tube. These will not burn off if you allow the lashes to dry and then curl them. It doesn't take THAT long to heat up, probably about a minute. I usually just put on my other makeup while I wait for it to heat up. Trust me, I have been using this curler for 5 years. The only downside is that sometimes I forget to turn it off, and it will stay on all day and use up the entire AA battery. But then again, I've done that so many times in the past 5 years I've had it, and it has never broken from the extended use I've put it through.
