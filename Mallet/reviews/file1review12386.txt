review/text: I travel extensively and over the past 20 years or so I have tried to take it with me as part of my first-aid kit. For me it has worked very well when I have an upset stomach and very often diarrhea. The symptoms are relieved very easily and quickly. As opposed to taking medications that only stop the diarrhea and not really do anything else, but they allow the body to heal while you wait may be 5-15 days. This actually ADSORBS as opposed to absorb toxins from your body. Charcoal works similarly, but I find this more potent and better on the taste test and since its in liquid form easier to swallow.
