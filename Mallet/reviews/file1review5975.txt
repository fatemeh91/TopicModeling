review/text: I loved the idea of a wrist blood pressure monitor, so I was happy to get this one. At first, I thought my blood pressure was lower - then I tested a couple family members and then tested it against other monitors. It was always low, so I returned it for another one. Same thing, so the manager at Rite Aid let me try one more - it was also 20 - 25 points low every time.I am pretty disappointed as it was quick, comfortable and easy to use. If accuracy is important, you might want to test this against some other blood pressure monitors, though. Maybe I got 3 faulty units in a row, but that doesn't seem very likely.
