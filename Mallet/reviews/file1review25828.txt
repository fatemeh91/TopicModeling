review/text: This product is amazing! it really works! smells like bleach and taste stronger than pool water. But its manageable and doesn't leave your breath smelling like bleach either. morning breath disappears pretty good. you really have to have time to do it because it does take 3-5 minutes to do the whole process each morning and night. i reccommend it completely!
