review/text: I brought this after I saw the youtube video with the african american woman. It taste pretty good and I think its helping with my hair growth. I do however take other vitamins in pill form as well as this drink so I can't only attribute this to my hair growth and strong nails but it's not hurting it. I've been drinking it for about a month now. I'm now on my second bottle. I only wish they sold it at a local health food stores like Vitamin Shoppee or GNC. I would definitley buy this product again.
