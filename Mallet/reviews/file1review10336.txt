review/text: Stocking up on batteries and searching for the best bargain? I suggest you skip this one. I was also looking for a great deal on batteries that I planned on storing for emergency use, this was the best price I could find on 9 volts. When I received the package I checked the date of production... 2009. It is now November 2012 so these batteries are at least 3 years old maybe more. From what I have read the life span of 9 volts is about 5 years so these batteries now need to be used up pronto AND I still need to buy more for my emergency stash. Not exactly the bargain I was looking for.If you are using these immediately I have nothing negative to say. In November 2012 this was the best deal I could find on Amazon.
