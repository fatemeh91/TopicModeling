review/text: I am unsure what to say about this product. It hasn't harmed my digestion but I am unsure if it has helped. I have noticed an increased ability to digest high fat foods but only those of non-animal origin. No side effects. I would recommend at least trying it. Just because it wasn't a "miracle" for me doesn't mean it might not work well for you.
