review/text: I have a love-hate relationship with this product. I love it because IT WORKS and makes my knees feel great. It works fast and almost completely stops most of the cracking/popping/grinding sounds when I bend my knees. I hate it because it tastes AWFUL and I only seem to be able to suppress my gag reflex a bottle at a time - two in a row is too much.I also don't like the inconvenience of the plastic dosage cup (you need to rinse it and use it again for 30 days) - I like the liquid glucosamine better with the squeeze bottles that you drink straight out of.I am going to giveDrinkables Liquid Joint Care, Citrus, 33-Ounce Plastic Bottlea try this month and see if it tastes any better. However, there are plenty of mentions about the bad taste over there as well. :(
