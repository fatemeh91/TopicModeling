review/text: On the plus side, I found this personal groomer to be a step up from the Remington model I was using previously. The adjustable attachment is relatively sturdy, and the trimmer is powerful for its size. I have had it for well over a year now and it still makes for a consistent/even trim every time.The real downside that I encountered was that the jack at the base of the trimmer became loose very quickly so the outlet cord charger slips out all of the time during use. This problem just made it necessary to use the separate base charger beforehand so it is fully charged before I use it. I used to just plug it directly into the bathroom outlet and use it while it was plugged in.You can either charge the trimmer directly by plugging it into a wall outlet or mounting it on the charging stand and plugging that into the outlet.This could be a problem limited to my specific trimmer, but either way it still functions fine with the charger base. I tried the nose trimmer once and never used it again, but I was not purchasing it for that item, and it was simply because I can't stand that tickly feeling in my nose.
