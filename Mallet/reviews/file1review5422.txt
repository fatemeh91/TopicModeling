review/text: We have a mold problem on our windows because we run a humidifier all winter. Our windows are painted, but this product only removed the mold. This saved me countless hours and a huge mess. Of course, if you use this on any painted surface test in a small area first. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! p.s. use your head and ventilate properly.
