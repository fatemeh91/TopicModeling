review/text: I'm surprised anyone could tell whether or not this deodorant was working, the scent was so strong! I don't care to walk around smelling like the deodorant I slapped on in the morning. If you aren't into strong fragrances this one isn't for you. And for the record it didn't work for me but none of the natural brands I've tried thus far have. I think Tom's of Maine has come the closest.
