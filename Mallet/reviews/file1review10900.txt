review/text: I have the original cho-pat, which is wonderful. It is the only product I've found that keeps all my knee "parts" steady and feeling good when I exercise. But the original has velcro that rubbed me the wrong way, so I thought the new & improved version would be better. But this one won't stay put - slides down my leg, no matter how tight I make it. I would like to return, but they won't take it back. Save your money ... or better yet, buy the original one and modify the velcro so it won't hurt your skin.
