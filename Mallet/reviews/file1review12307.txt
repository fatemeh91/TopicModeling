review/text: I guess I should have known that at $9.99 a box that there would be something wrong with them...I ordered the Smores and Mocha Crunch varieties of the Atkins Advantage bar, and when they arrived, I noticed that one of the boxes was past the expiration date (Dec 2004) and the other is almost expired (Feb 2005). I can't believe that they can get away with selling expired food without advertising it as such. So, buyer beware! You get what you pay for sometimes! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
