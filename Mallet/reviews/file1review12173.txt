review/text: I don't know what it is in this vitamin, but I started getting hives that come and go all over my arms and legs a few days after starting them. Once I stopped the hives went away. The pills are large but I did not have any difficultly swallowing them. No other side effects at all other than the hives, which were bad enough that I had to completely stop taking them.
