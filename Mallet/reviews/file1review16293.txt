review/text: I like finish products way better than cascade. They simply clean better. and I do like this powerballs BUT there are some things I don't like about.Like: It cleans anything and everything. Dried out food, stuck on baking pans... just put this in the machine and everything will come out clean. It even cleans the nonstick coating on frying pans.Dislike: It destroys the nonstick surface on pots and pans. I've ruined 2 pans and now I need to buy new pans because it's not nonstick anymore. My pot didn't come out that bad, but I don't use this on it anymore anyway.I will still buy this product and keep it in the house so when I need to wash extra dirty dishes with food dried on it I know I can use these. But for everyday dishwashing jobs, I will just use liquid only.
