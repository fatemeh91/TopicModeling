review/text: I could not be happier with this product. It works well, is accurate, great size, and easy to use. Absolutely perfect. My only suggestion is to make sure your arm will fit the cuff provided. My husband's arm is quite a bit larger than mine, and we needed to order the larger accessory cuff. You will not obtain accurate readings if your arm exceeds the maximum cuff diameter (I think 13 inches).
