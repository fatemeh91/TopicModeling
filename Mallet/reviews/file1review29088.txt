review/text: As an herbal tea to soothe cough and sore throat, this is superb. It has a strong flavor and sometimes I even just breathe in the steam.The main use I have for it is to dissolve a very large gel capsule. I have a daily medicine that comes in a capsule that's too large for me to swallow without gagging. I make a half cup of this tea and dissolve the capsule. The strength of the Ricola flavor masks the terrible taste of the dissolved capsule's contents (I tried heavily sweetened hot water or even regular, but sweet, mint tea but neither was sufficient to mask the taste). This stuff does it.The only negative is, as someone else here mentioned, the price. It is about a third higher here than elsewhere online and more than double the price in the big-box pharmacies (but less than the natural foods stores.)They also make a caffeine free version, although this Amazon vendor doesn't seem to carry it.
