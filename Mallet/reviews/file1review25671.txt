review/text: This small shaver works really great for no stress grooming of both nose and ear hairs. It makes a good clean cut without any irritation and without pulling hairs out. Other shavers I've used yank some of the hairs out and bring tears to my eyes because they are more like pluckers than like shavers. This one is pain free and washes up easily in the sink because it's fully immersible. Highly reccomended!
