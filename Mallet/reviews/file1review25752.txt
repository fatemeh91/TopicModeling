review/text: I got so tired of getting nicked and cut with my old one (and it still didn't do the job effectively) that I thought I would try this one. What a gem!!! Simple to use and works great. Gets rid of that unsightly noae and ear hair in a few minutes with no nicks, cuts, scrapes! Would recommend this to everyone.
