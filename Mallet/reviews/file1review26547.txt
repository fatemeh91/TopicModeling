review/text: ORDERED THE PRODUCT, USED FOR A HAPPY MONTH, AND THEN THE PRODUCT DEPLETES IN 15 MINUTES, NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY. AND AMAZON DOES NOT ALLOW RETURN FOR OVER 30 DAYS. A TOTAL WASTE. I HOPE THE MANUFACTURE WOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE WARRANTY. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.GET YOURSELF A PILLOW INSTEAD, MUCH MORE DURABLE.JUNE, 2012 UPDATE:THE SELLER IMEDIATELY CONTACTED ME AND SENT ME A REPLACED ITEM. GREAT ATTITUDE. I AM CHANGING 1 STAR TO 3 STAR. I HOPE THIS TIME THE REPLACED ITEM WOULD WORK OUT LONGER. IF IT WORKS OUT WELL, I WILL UPDATE.AUGUST, 2012 UPDATE:2 MONTHS HAS PASSED, IT STILL WORKS.AUGUST, 2012:AT THE END OF THIS MONTH, THE PRODUCT LEAKED AGAIN. THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A PRODUCT THAT COULD LAST.
