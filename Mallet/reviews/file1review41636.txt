review/text: I received this as a gift 1.5 yrs ago, and I must say...it is arguably one of the best gifts ever! I went from brushing (& hating it) and my teeth having tons of rough "funk" on them all the time...to using the Oral-B Triumph power toothbrush and having both clean feeling teeth and enjoying the brushing process.PROS:-Cleans teeth extremely well.-Enjoyable.-LCD screen with charge indicator, timer, & smiley face when you reach two minutes to provide a sense of accomplishment.-Changes in brush motion ever 30 secs help you keep track of time elapsed.-Brushheads do last a long time, several months each.CONS:-Loud, but I suppose this cannot be helped.-Included plastic travel case has flimsy retaining mechanisms that break easily.-Brushheads cost alot compared to a standard toothbrush...but hey...it's worth it completely!You will not regret a purchase of this or another power toothbrush. It's a true necessity that will enable you to enjoy brushing and keep from putting it off.
