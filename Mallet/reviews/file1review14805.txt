review/text: I had my doubts about this product. Somebody recommended this to me to help with a sports-like activity. I didn't even want to spend my own money on it, so I asked my girlfriend to buy it for my birthday.Wow, that was one of the best decisions I ever made! On the very first session, I noticed such a difference in my game. It's not the 'placebo' effect either, since I wasn't expecting anything at all (and was beyond skeptical). I let my friend try it once - who had a game coming up, and had been struggling recently. One time using it, and he won by a landslide.I'm also a singer, and I've been having trouble lately because of a mountain of stress. After a few tries, I relaxed enough to really have that rich full sound again.Honestly, pretty freakin' cool item. Not what you would expect. Not the typical metaphysical junk you're always hearing about. This is a practical, real solution to problems dealing with stress, and activities requiring the 'zone'. I want to check out the portable version next, to take to the 'field' with me. But won't have the great software that comes with this, I'm sure.And Kudos to Mind Modulations. If you know electronics, they're like the NewEgg of Health Systems. Unparalleled customer service, and really fast shipping. They even throw in the Ear Sensor for free. And it's still less than the competition! Love this company.
