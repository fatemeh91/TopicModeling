review/text: I take a lot of supplements daily, which was making it very hard to keep organized. Most pill boxes are way too small for my needs, but this is almost exactly what I need.The good:- The size! There are four compartments a day that each allow for a considerable amount of pills.- The convenience! I love being able to take a day of pills with me or multiple days of pills with me when traveling.The bad:- The hinge on one of the lids on one of the compartments is tearing a little. The others seem to be holding up well, but this worries me a bit.All-in-all this is a great product, I think. I am hopeful that I can replace this container that is tearing at the hinge. If it weren't for this, I would give this a five-star rating.
