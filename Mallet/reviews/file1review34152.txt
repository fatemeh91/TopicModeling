review/text: I have not used this particular brand, but have used a similar product that only contained 1000mg per tablet. I am a 51yr old male and have several bulging disc in my lower back and suffer from chronic low back pain every day. I started taking 1000mg of bromelain and 2000mg of MSM a day. After about 6 days of use I started getting relief. After 7-8 days my pain was significantly lowered to a point that I can start being active again. I still hurt, but the pain is tolerable now.I became addicted to opiates (percocet tablets & fentynal patches)a little over a year ago after being on those drugs for about two years. I accidentally overdosed and decided to put myself into treatment. Since that time I have been struggling with finding something safe and effective to ease my pain. I had been taking Ibuprofen or Aleve but the pain relief would only last a few days even if I was consistent in taking them every day. I have found more pain relief by taking the bromelain and MSM than anything else I have tried. I have been on this regiment for 30 days now and feel better than I have in a long time. I would recommend trying bromelain & MSM to anyone with chronic low back pain due to bulging disc... it has done wonders for me...By the way... there is no way that dry tablets can contain grain alcohol.
