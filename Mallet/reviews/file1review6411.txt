review/text: I sit in a vehicle at work for most of a ten hour shift. Staring at a computer and typing away in a swiveled, contoured position makes my neck ache. It is constructed very solidly and I use it as recommended for 10-30 seconds (3-4 sets in each spot) when I feel the tense aching coming on and it relieves it. It gives you nice access to really anywhere on your body and it extremely useful for me. I also lift weights and work out five days a week and never realized after using this, just how tender and tight my rhomboids and other surrounding back(shoulder) muscles get. Very happy with the purchase.
