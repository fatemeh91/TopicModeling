review/text: I've tried many products from Band-It to other no name brand elbow braces and nothing worked (other than the Aircast Armband which is not very durable) until the Futuro Tennis Elbow support. It is similar to the Aircast Pneumatic Armband but is a ton more durable.Pain in my elbow has always been there and this just helps to manage the pain but has not eliminated it completely. Don't expect any miracles but this surely does help you get back to the things I love to play and do (tennis and gym).
