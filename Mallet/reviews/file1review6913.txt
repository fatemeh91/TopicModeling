review/text: I love this stuff. You can spray it on food or on toys.You cannot spray lysol on food. like lysol but unlike lysol it is not toxic when ingested. I would not spray lysol on anything my babies could ingest. I love this spray because if I drop something I can spray it and rinse it. I spray this in my mouth if my throat every feels bad and it helps right away. this stuff is awesome. doesn't taste great but does the trick.(black cherry is also good for sore throats...)I feel so much better having this around with my babies and feel so much safer with it. so many reason. when my kids have a scape or bump or bruise.(hylands bumps and bruises is good for the bruises but for the scrapes this is #1.)( I don't say it doesn't sting but I like to use this because it is natural. I trust it and prayer.) This is one of the first things I reach for. If there is any kind of need for disinfection I clean it with this.
