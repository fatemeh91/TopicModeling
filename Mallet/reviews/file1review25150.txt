review/text: We returned one of these right away, because the hands- free option did not work. After exchanging it for a new one, we discovered that it, too, did not work. However, as a parent of a newborn, you just don't have time to run to Babies R Us all the time for a new diaper pail, so we decided to just use the manual lift option and be done with it.Fast forward 8 months: the manual lift option no longer works either! The lid sticks all the time, and you have to open the stinky pail and fiddle with the inside bowl to get it to open. Back to Babies R Us, and this time we got a Diaper Champ. So far, so good, and the Diaper Champ can use any type of bag as well.I will say that this pail does hold the stink in. However, if you have to go into the stink zone to fix the lid all the time, what does it matter?
