review/text: One gets the impression from other customer reviews of the HEM-711AC that it's a fine little machine if you read the instructions and use it properly. I made sure to do so, and was taken aback when my blood pressure readings were considerably higher than they'd ever been. I called customer service and had a nice chat in which the agent assured me that Omron's products were carefully checked before being put on the market, but that it was possible they might be damaged in shipping. She sent me instructions for returning the unit to Omron: I would be liable for shipping and a service charge. I wrote back: You've sold me a defective product, and now you want me to pay you to take it back? Omron replied: Well, okay, just this once we'll pay for the shipping. I sent the unit back to Amazon instead. Before I did, I visited the my doctor to confirm the Omron's readings were inaccurate. Systolic was off by about 10%, but diastolic was grossly high. My concern is that (1) my experience was not anomalous; and (2) that a lot of people will be needlessly (and expensively) alarmed by blood pressure readings that are way off the mark.
