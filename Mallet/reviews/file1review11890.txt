review/text: I have had this, my 3rd Panasonic shaver, for several days. (It only cost $10 more than my last one that is over 5 years old.) So far it has given me excellent smooth shaves with no irritation, and has not had to be recharged yet! I don't know where the other two reviewers are coming from, but I like it. I especially like being able to use it cordless or with the cord. That way, if it runs completely down, then I can just plug it in and don't have to wait for it to charge. I can't guarantee that other buyers will like it, but I give it 5 stars.
