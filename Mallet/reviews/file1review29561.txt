review/text: I love this straw and use it for all my hot teas whether its loose tea or bagged tea. Its made of brass (and then plated with stainless) and has held up with everyday use for the past two months. I accidentally put it in the dishwasher which I do not recommend doing because that clouded the red faux stones. I will be purchasing another one. UPDATE: its been about one year since I purchased this and it is now showing its age. The tiny holes in the bottom of the straw are tarnishing. It is still usable but I'm not sure how long it will last.
