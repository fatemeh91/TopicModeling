review/text: I buy a lot of this for my son who wears a special type of contact lens. [Boston Scleral Prosthetic contact lenses] This lens requires non-preserved, so there's not the option of using lightly preserved saline. [...] We could not use it if it's in a large bottle, as it only maintains acceptable sterility for 3 days, then has to be thrown out. So the smaller bottles are better for that reason.Hope this helps.
