review/text: They made me give this product one star, before I could submit this review. How can I truly give it any stars at all when the item is totally worthless? I opened the box with great anticipation. Boy were my feet sore. I followed the instructions to a "T" filling it with tepid water, turned it on and waited for it to heat. I waited, and waited, and waited. I reckon I could still be waiting. It never did heat. Piece of junk I'd say.
