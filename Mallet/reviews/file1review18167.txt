review/text: After trying many standard eyeshades (usually the flat ones that give you on airplanes that mash your eyes)--I decided to get one with "cups"--seemingly obvious to me now. I like these--though they don't quite fit around my nose--leaving a tiny slit for light to come in. Nevertheless, they are comfortable--and the material (we got black) is completely opaque--as opposed to some cloth models that let some light in.
