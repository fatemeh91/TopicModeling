review/text: 25May2008Paula here in Phoenix. Don't buy the Emjoi AP99 or the Emjoi AP98. Sadly, the tweezer head gears break too soon in both units. In just 5 months I went through 3 AP99 tweezer heads, and one AP98 head with a second about to go. They work great when they work. I'm trying the Braun units, next. They have a better reputation.Paula
