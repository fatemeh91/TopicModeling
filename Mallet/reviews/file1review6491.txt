review/text: I work in a physical therapy clinic where we have a Theracane (TC) at our disposal. The Back Buddy (BB) is by far superior in design compared to the TC. The BB is stiffer in use, has more usable accessory knobs in addition to the 2 hooks, has a second, smaller hook for a different angle, and has a cone shaped knob in addition to the round knob.My main issue with the TC is that it flexes way too much when you're really trying to dig into a knot with the hook. The way the BB is designed actually makes it structurally stiffer so you can bear down as hard as you want without it flexing noticably.
