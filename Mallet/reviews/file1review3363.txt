review/text: This is a great product for teens and smaller adults that need protection. There are fewer options when it comes to products in this size and thank goodness this is a good one. The diaper itself is very absorbent and protects well against leaks. As a bonus the plastic outer cover is very soft and quiet making them discrete as well. Most "cloth like" covers are uncomfortable and rub on your inner thighs but this one is soft and smooth.
