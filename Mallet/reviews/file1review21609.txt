review/text: Since when is taking something out of an injectionmold, "handmade"? The whole thing is light weight,hollow plastic. Can't weight more than an ounce.Not going to last more than a few months.I would not have paid $5.00 muchless $20 if I had seen it in person first.This is my first bad internet experience.Do not buy one of these.
