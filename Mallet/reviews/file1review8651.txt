review/text: So this is the must-have for cleaning floors! Our rental home has tile with many grooves/bumps and I was having a hard time getting it clean, with 3 little kids under 5! Even getting down and scrubbing with a toothbrush just wasn't cutting it! I bought this to use with a carpet cleaner, and it gets the carpet fibers great too (along with the cleaner)! I also use it on the natural stone in the bathrooms, and it hasn't been this clean since moved in! Never had a scrub brush in my cleaning supplies before, can't believe I did without it for all these years! A Must-Have tool for your home! Love it!
