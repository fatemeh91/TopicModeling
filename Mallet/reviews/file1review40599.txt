review/text: I am a fan of green cleaning products. Most of them work well, have tolerable scents, and are generally affordable compared to conventional cleaners. That is why after buying this product I was very disappointed. First time I used it, this product did not even come close to working and that was after carefully pre-rinsing each dish. So I realized I would have to pre-rinse and hand-wash even more, almost to the point of being entirely clean and sanitized already before going into the dishwasher and this soap could be used. Even at that point, it still did a mediocre job. I had to run dishes multiple times to get anything clean. When it was time to unload the dishes, I would have to pull them out individually and scrub them down vigorously and put them back into the wash again to get any decent results with this soap. WHY BOTHER!? By this time, I have already used way more water and used at least twice the amount of energy to heat the water in running it 2-3 times. HOW IS THAT GREEN AND EARTH FRIENDLY? I'M SORRY, BUT USE ANOTHER GREEN PRODUCT FOR YOUR DISHES.
