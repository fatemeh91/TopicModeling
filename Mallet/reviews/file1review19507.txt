review/text: I never found anything that comes close to how well this potty seat works. Fits pretty much any sized toilet seat and is very secure and easy to keep clean. So much nicer than cleaning out a potty chair, and comes off and on the toilet effortlessly. Our son's been using it for the last year and I had to buy another one for the upstairs bathroom because we liked the first one (we use downstairs) so much. Well worth the price.
