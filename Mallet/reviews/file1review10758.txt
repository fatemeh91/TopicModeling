review/text: I purchased this organizer previously and decided to get another so I could fill two weeks at a time with my medications. I like the fact that the days are in individual containers so if you leave for several hours you have a small container to carry. They compartments close tightly and are a little difficult to open at times but I would rather put the extra effort into opening the compartment than have my pills spilled in my purse. I would definetly order another when necessary.
