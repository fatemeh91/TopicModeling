review/text: While I enjoy this flavor, and I find the bars filling and nutritious, I do find these bars too sweet for my taste. I have mixed feelings about these bars. They offer a good source of Fiber, which I suppose balances out the sweetness. However, I do find that I don't look forward to eating them, as I'd thought I would . . . again because of that sweetness.
