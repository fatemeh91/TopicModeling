review/text: I have bought alot of baby tubs. This one is the best if you have a fiberglass tub. The seated bathers with suction cups don't stick to my tub. This is great when babies can sit up, you don't have to worry about them sliding around in your big tub. I am expecting a fourth baby and plan on buying this again.
