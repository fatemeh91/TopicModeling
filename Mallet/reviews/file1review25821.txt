review/text: I had it when my previous trimmer didn't have 1/2" settings and I would have to manually set the length in the middle of 1" and 2". It would constantly slip and move and eventually, a chunk of my beard would be gone. I decided to try this trimmer out. I got it today and I have to say, it is the best trimmer I've ever used. The blade is very high quality, the size of the trimming area is huge and the length locking system (with 1/2" settings) is key. There really isn't much more I can say except that if you're serious about your beard, this is the trimmer for you.
