review/text: My hardwood floors had been covered buy carpet for thirtyfive years. The padding had sucked all the moisture and shine completely out.I ripped out the carpet in my bedroom put three coats of johnsons on and it looks like new..I'm very pleased with this purchase..Have a window fan ready though. It smell like charcoal lighter fluid ..that's my only complaint..
