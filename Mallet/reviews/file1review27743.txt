review/text: I have a pretty sensitive stomach and when I mix protein with milk let's just say I am not a pleasant person to be around lol. A friend gave me a scoop of his and let me tell you I haven't looked back. It's an isolate protein so you won't be getting all that proprietary blend crud that god knows what's in it. I mix this with soy milk 3 times a day and I swear it tastes like a chocolate milkshake and absolutely no gastrointestinal issues.
