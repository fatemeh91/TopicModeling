review/text: Obviously it is always good to get original manuafacturers parts. But having had the shaver for two years, I had always been scared away by the $30 price tag I was seeing in stores for this item. Since Amazon was considerably less, I splurged. I was amazed how easy it was to swap out the parts. I changed the head and foil in literally less than 10 seconds. I have always been impressed with the Braun system, and I am now equally impressed with the replacement package.
