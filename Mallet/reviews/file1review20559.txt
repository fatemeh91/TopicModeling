review/text: I have a 3.5 yr old and a 2 yr old, for the first 3 years I fought my children with the simple digital thermometers and trying to get under arm readings. (try doing this with an autistic 3 yr old) Finally I paid the $40 for this thermometer at Target and it has been a life saver! It reads SO FAST, there is no struggling with toddlers to hold still. BUY this product, you will not regret it! I can't believe I waited as long as I did to purchase one.I don't know how others compare, though my mother purchased a cheapy dig. ear thermometer at the drugstore, and it just wasn't as easy to use and fast as this one.
