review/text: This is a good no frills trimmer. It is inexpensive and does what it's supposed to. It gives a nice cut and has good maneuverability.I previously had a Norelco turbo vacuum trimmer which I loved which seemed to be quicker and the built in vacuum left significantly less mess behind too (so my wife liked it better too).If I had it to do again, I would probably get the Norelco just because the extra 5 minutes spent between the cut and cleanup can be a big difference in the morning (and with getting the kids ready in the morning... being done 5 minutes faster can be huge). But at ~$35 more, is that worth it to you?But honestly, the 2 products are 2 different price points and it is probably an unfair comparison. This does what is advertised to do and does it well.
