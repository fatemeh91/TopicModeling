review/text: I put 7 capsules on one side, and 5 or 6 on the other, and they fit great. They hold large capsules, and when the lid is closed, the center seperator won't let the pills get mixed up. I dropped one of the boxes on the floor, and it didn't even open. Quality product, I love the colors, and I am very glad I bought this. The organizer tray is wonderful also. I wish I would've found this a long time ago. It's so neat and handy, and just perfect! Great price, too. I highly recommend it.
