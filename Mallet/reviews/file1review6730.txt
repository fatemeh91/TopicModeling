review/text: I know this thing looks crazy, but it's amazing for relaxing tight muscles that not even a massage from another person can get out. I suffer from a lot of tension, and my physical therapist recommended this to me and lent me hers to try until I decided to buy my own. It looked like a torture device to me when she first pulled out it, but now it's pretty much my best friend. The S shape is great, because if you are un-tensing a muscle in your shoulder, you can hook your leg onto the end and use that to pull down rather than using your other arm to pull it.
