review/text: This product was terrible - I have had night sweats and panic attacks for about 2 weeks now. After marking off the other supplements I take on a daily basis, this one was still causing me problems. I stopped taking it today, and feel incredibly more relaxed, and not anxious at all. I was getting worried I had major issues, but have now figured out that this product is worthless. Get you B12 someplace else...5000mcg per dosage is WAY to much, and I've read online today that my symptons are textbook B12 overdose. I would never in 1 million years buy this piece of junk again...at least I will sleep good tonight :D
