review/text: I am expecting twins July 2011. My low back pain has become increasingly worse throughout this pregnancy. My OB suggested that I get a support and this one caught my eye. I've been wearing it constantly for the last four days and my back pain is nearly gone. I thought I was going to have to see my chiropractor every week until these kids come. Now that I've been wearing this support, I think every other week will suffice. I have gained 45 lbs (weighing 188 lbs. now) in this pregnancy and know that I am going to be huge, so I ordered a large. It is currently too big for me and hikes up my back and belly on the tightest setting. I don't think a medium would have made it to the end, and even though it's a little big, I still have relief!!! Best money I've spent in my pregnancy to date.
