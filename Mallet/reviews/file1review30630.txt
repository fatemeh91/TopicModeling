review/text: This was my first safety razor, and it's still my favourite. I don't have a very thick beard mind, so I did not miss the feathered edges that some of the others have. What really sets this razor apart from the others though is its handle. Octagonal in shape, this one is very easy to hold onto, and you won't likely slip while your fingers are soaked during your daily wet-shave. Beyond the practical matters of control and comfortability, this razor just looks like something out of an antique shop, class all the way.No, it isn't a family heirloom, but it might become one after you've experienced a fine shave with such a fine-looking and comfortable razor.
