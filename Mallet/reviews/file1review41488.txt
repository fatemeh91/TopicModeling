review/text: Great masculine cologne. Not to strong a scent but will linger all day even after u think its gone (people would comment on it when i couldn't smell it on myself) I spray it on almost everyday cuz it is that good. Have yet to get tired of it. I found it by accident almost when i went to the mall and was just sampling different smells to pass the time. When I came across this one, I was blown away. Literally both guys and girls regularly compliment and ask me what I'm wearing. And my girlfriend esp. loves it. She compliments me every time. Next time you go to the mall look/ask for this and tell me I'm not right. Also, didn't have any irritants mentioned from the previous reviewer. Perfectly satisfied with this product. In fact, I bought the gift set that came along. I've had this cologne for 1+ year.
