review/text: These rechargeable batteries were perfect for my Sony digital camera. They came fully charged out of the package, and worked perfectly in our existing Sony battery recharger. They can also be charge fully up to a 1000 times, about 3-4 years worth of life. I am very satisfied with these batteries, and happy that I can take a lot more photos.
