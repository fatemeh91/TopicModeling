review/text: Bought this item for my daughter, who is carrying her baby really low....its a boy! She was having a lot of back pain so I got her this prenatal cradle. She loves it!!! It has taken all the pressure off her back and redistributed it so she can handle it better. She has until the end of Jan. '12 to go so she is happy she has the cradle to help her through.
