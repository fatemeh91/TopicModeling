review/text: I purchased this product because I am a patient who went from taking ZERO pills a day to 10 pills per day divided among AM & PM. This product is perfect. I load up my pills for the week and have a great reminder if I forgot to take my pills for either morning or night. Although the tray is slightly bulky to keep on a counter, I keep mine in my medicine cabinet and pull each day out as needed. The pods are good sized, fits my 5 pills per side very easily. I believe it could easily fit 10 pills per side depending on the size of the meds.I am very satisfied with the product. Seems like it will last a while & it's a great value.
