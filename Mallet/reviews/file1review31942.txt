review/text: No scientific analysis, just drinking it down on faith, hoping something good is happening.I shake it up with a big squeeze of fresh lemon juice to taste, cracked ice, optimum with dechlorinated & defluorided water... then down the hatch.A psychosomatic glow afterwards, thinking all will be better, even without glowing radiant green in the dark.Pungent, though not soooo bad... oddly enough has me thinking sort of a fish meal factory, without any fish in sight.So, how did that fish odor originate without any fish?
