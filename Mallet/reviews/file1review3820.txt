review/text: I just moved to the Eastern time zone from LA and I cannot get to bed before midnight because of the time change. I tried taking this tea and even supplementing with Sleeping Beauty herbal supplements, but it does not make me sleepy at all. It tastes good and drinking just about any caffeine free tea feels comforting, but I did not feel any relaxing effects.
