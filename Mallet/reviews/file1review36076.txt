review/text: NOW's Arginine powder is likely the best value for the money but the taste WAS unbearable. Here is the fix for the taste issue of NOW (or ANY Arginine powder): I tried it (with water and ice since I don't have grape juice handy) and it ABSOLUTELY works, you just need to adjust the amount of lemon juice - I ended up using a half of a large lemon. Amazing. The acid of the citrus will literally cancel out the base that is Arginine. Chem 101.To try this, get some lemon juice, purple grape juice (just for fun), and your L-Arginine powder. Put a level teaspoon of L-Arginine into a cup or something. Add a little grape juice. Check out the color! Then add three tablespoons of lemon juice one at a time, stirring as you go. When it turns purple again, it's safe to drink (add a fourth if needed). It isn't even sour from the lemon juice, because they neutralized each other. Fairly lemony, though. I add half a cup of orange or grape juice to it to calm it down a little.Hope this helps.
