review/text: I don't know why any company would want to put their name on this product. It is so flimsy and saggy and if I could give it zero stars I would - this piece of junk was immediately returned to the store. I bought it to hang on the side of our pack n play since we use it a lot for diaper changes and I wanted more storage space for things like qtips, thermometer, cloth diaper supplies, etc. It held diapers ok but if you put wipes on top as shown in the pic, the whole thing sags and the wipe container falls out easily. The side pockets also do not hold up. So you are better off just getting a diaper stacker since thats about all it is good for. I attached it to the pack n play with the adhesive velcro that was included in the box. The adhesive held up better than the velcro did...it un-velcroed (for lack of better term) within 5 minutes of me hanging it up and putting stuff in it.
