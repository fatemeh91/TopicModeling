review/text: I have both the oral-b and the sonicare. the sonicare has a tingling sensation and is very splashy and i couldn't brush my tongue because of it.The oral-b is very convenient to use. I can brush the back of my teeth and tongue and it doesn't splash. The 30 second timer is annoying at first but i got used to it.I now use the oral-b but i kept the sonicare in case i crave a tingling sensation.I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit on the heavy side.
