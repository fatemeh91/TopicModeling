review/text: This is the second beard and moustache timmer made by Norelco that I purchased but this one only lasted 6 months. I noticed immediately how much lighter this trimmer was compared to the older model I had. It must have been because of the all plastic insides since after ONLY six months the teeth that allow the trimmer to adjust broke and I had to throw it away. Guess, I should have opted for the more expensive model........ lesson learned.
