review/text: The 34" x 52" white protector is very absorbent yet comfortable. Our bed is two xtra long twin beds put together to make a regular king bed. Because it is easier to put on the bed, I use a regular king sized fitted sheet. My husband has some incontinence issues so I fold a king sheet in half, lengthwide, and place it as the first layer of bedclothes my husband covers up with at night. Above that level I make our bed as I usually do with an additional sheet, blanket and quilt. However, with the sheets pulled back I put one Priva pad the length of where my husband sleeps and put 2 pads across the bed, from one side to the other. Because there is nothing holding them in place I use clear strapping tape [shipping tape] to hold the two pads together by overlapping about 1 inch in the center of the bed, resulting in a secure bed pad coverage. I not only go the length of the two pads, with the tape, but cross the center line 3 times and there is seldom a problem and I've never had to change both pads across the center due to incontinence. The one under my husband proves to be very adequate. The tape does not cause either of us irritation [or aggravation].
