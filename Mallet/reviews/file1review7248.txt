review/text: It must be very difficult to make a reliable foot spa. Noting the high failure rate described in reviews of other models, I bought this one for my wife. I concluded that the much higher price of this Brookstone model would be worth paying if the unit would last and perform better.It did not. The first three times she used it, it worked well: it heated the water, the jets and remote operated correctly, and, although she didn't care for the bubbles, they functioned.The next time she plugged it in, the unit failed to heat the water and would not change jet speeds.We called the Brookstone service line; the agent told us to bring it to the nearest store for replacement. However, the sales managers at the Dulles Town Center store in Virginia curtly refused to cooperate, or even to contact customer service to work out an arrangement.I'm willing to pay a premium for the promise of better functionality, higher reliability, and better service. Brookstone failed to deliver on this promise.
