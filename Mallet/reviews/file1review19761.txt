review/text: I read the reviews of the many, many potty seats out there before I bought this one. It was the ONLY one with good reviews and figured that was my best bet. I couldn't be happier. It fits on the elongated toilet seat which apparently others do not. (Apparently Baby Bjorn also makes one that is rounder and I saw people complaining about those not fitting. I think you just need to make sure to buy the one with the longer depth if you're looking for the elongated fit.) My daughter has no problems using it and has already started going potty in it. Very easy to use and transport and just a great fit for us.
