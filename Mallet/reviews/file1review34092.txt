review/text: I am a huge fan of Garden of Life products. I take the the Perfect Food super green supplements everyday and I attribute many positive health benefits directly to them. Because of my happiness with their other products I thought I would give this one a try. Wow that was a big mistake! within a few hours of taking just one of these as directed, I had the worst heartburn I have ever had in my entire life. I was then up all night as my body to put it politely rejected this and everything else it contained... I was basically out of commission until these "enzymes" had completely been flushed out, and with them went what I can only imagine were many of the natural enzymes my body already had. The most notable side effect is that though I have always been very mildy lactose intolerant(I can eat cheese, cooked dairy, cottage cheese, yogurt, cup or less of milk at a time) I am now unable to consume even the smallest amount of any dairy product without having hours of stomach cramps(which I never used to have). Im sure there are some other side effects I havent noticed, and im guessing as time goes on I will once again be able to eat dairy and everything else will be back to normal, but I would STRONGLY suggest you use extreme caution. Though this may be an isolated event specific to me and my body, or some kind of allergic reaction, if it happened to me it can most definitely happen to you.I will continue to take my other Garden of Life products, and search out other new supplements. but oh man was this a bad idea. additionally I have the feeling amazon wont accept a return on this, so I am out $30...
