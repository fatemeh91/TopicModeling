review/text: I have been shaving with Braun electric shavers since I was about 19. I believe the 8585 is only my 4th Braun shaver in almost 18 years. I replaced my last one, and it was still going strong, lasting over a week on a charge.This shaver is such an improvement over every other Braun shaver I have ever used. It gives by far the closest shave. It has much more power than any of its predecessors. It can go through 2 days worth of stubble without even breaking a sweat. It handles awkward neck hairs very well. I attribute this to the new foil design.What really makes me love this shaver, though, is the self-cleaning. I love the fact that I'm getting a lemony fresh clean shave every morning. I have even checked out the shaver after its done cleaning. I dare you to find a single whisker inside of it. I am still on my original tub of cleaning solution, and I am just shy of a month of usage.I highly recommend the Activator 8585 by Braun. At these prices it's a no-brainer...UPDATE: The cleaning solution tubs are lasting 5-6 weeks.
