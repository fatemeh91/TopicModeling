review/text: My trusty Norelco had died and I needed a replacement that wouldn't cost an arm or a leg. I had read various consumer reviews that indicated Wahl was a good value, so I placed an order from a store selling on Amazon, The Natural Health Shoppe. The razor was delivered in a timely manner and I put it to the test. It did a fair to good job on my beard, though I wondered how someone with a thicker growth might have to keep going over and over a spot to get it shaved. It has a very loud motor that still seems a bit underpowered for the job, and the vibration the motor caused was annoying because I had to use this shaver longer to get the job done. In all, it was merely OK, and I decided to return it for a refund - and that's where the second part of this review comes in.I do not recommend The Natural Health Shoppe because they clearly have poor customer service. They waited 48 hours to reply to my initial request for a return label, then delayed another 72 hours in telling me that their policy "forbids them from accepting personal care products as returns" and sent me over to Wahl. This is clearly a bogus dodge to avoid providing customer satisfaction because any other store will accept such items for refunding, yet they alone cannot. A fair product, and a lousy vendor.
