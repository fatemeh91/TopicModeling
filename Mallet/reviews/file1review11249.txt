review/text: I purchased the Panasonic ES8163 after reading every review on the internet that I could find, I spent days reading reviews. I purchased the Panasonic ES8163 (Factory Refurbished) from [...] through Amazon.com. At first I was hesitant about purchasing a refurbished product, but after the product arrived my mind was at ease.1. The shaver arrived in a well packed brown cardboard box, inside was the shaver, vinyl case, power supply and reproduced pages from manual. The shaver is Brand New, they use a new shaver head, blades and foil, and the replacement battery section. So infact the only difference between this and one from a department store is the original instructions and packaging.2. Ok, so it is not the latest model, but for the price it is a steal, and I challenge any shaver except later model Panasonic to cut closer without irritation, and I have been a top of the line philishave user for years. Never again.3. I was so impressed with it, I talked my father who is in his late 70s to buy one, and he told me it is the closest shave he has ever had from a electric shaver in his entire life (he used dry without anything), and he has owned remingtons, Brauns, and lately Philishave. Never again.4. I am in Australia and delivered the unit was about A$130 - A$140 depending on exchange rate, versus the latest model which retails for about A$469. The later model has 4 cutters instead of 3 and a cleaning unit stand that auto cleans and sanitises. All you have to do is wash it under tap with a bit of soft soap at cleaning setting which automatically shuts off after 20 seconds and your done. This saves the $15 monthly cleaning tablet, and electricity used to autoclean in stand. (Greener Alternative).My advice is buy whilst you can still get them.As for Amazon.com and [...] can't fault the service A1.
