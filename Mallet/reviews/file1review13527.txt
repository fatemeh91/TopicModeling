review/text: I bought these insoles about a month ago & love them. I am on my feet about 7 hrs. a day & was having lower back pain but as soon as I started wearing the insoles, the pain was gone. I also love that I can switch them easily to each pair of shoes. When I go walking I put them in my tennis shoes & I have definitely seen more tone in my legs & bottom. I felt the burn & was a little sore the first few days but that was it. After that, they are comfortable & I am so pleased with the results I've gotten with them. I will for sure get more when I wear these out. Great deal!
