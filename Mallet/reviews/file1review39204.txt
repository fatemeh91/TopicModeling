review/text: Albeit we have only used the clipper once, I am extremely happy with the kit. You get a lot of options for the money: numerous guards including specialty ones, two combs, scissors, clips, etc. I am new to haircutting and was delighted to be able to watch the included instructional DVD for various techniques, hints, and tips. The instructions and DVD made it very easy to use the clipper, and my husband & I were both extremely pleased with the results of his first home haircut and look forward to many years of saving money with this product. The clipper is fairly intuitive to use, seems well made, and has clear instructions. My only 'complaint' would be the quality of the included scissors; they are not terrible to use, but not fantastic either, although for the price of the entire kit, quite suitable. I would definitely not hesitate to re-purchase this item and highly recommend it to all with low-to-moderate home haircutting needs.
