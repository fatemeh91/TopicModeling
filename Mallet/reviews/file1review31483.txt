review/text: As a family of four, we have two cars and always seem to run out of bandaids at home. We looked at pricing a DIY medical kit, but things quickly got expensive and weren't as "self contained" as the individual drug pouches, etc. We look at a lot of kits and many contain a lot of stuff we wouldn't know how to use or what to use them for. These adventure medical kits include essentials, with some nice additions (like Duct tape). These are better priced and equipped than comparable kits (like from your car dealer or some others) and doesn't have a lot of "waste" and have a lot of the stuff I would've gotten on my own in my DIY kit, but at a better overall rate. So, we got 3, 1 that lives in each car and 1 that lives in the house that we take with us on trips (lightweight enough to carry on a hike or even on vacation).Kids inevitably get scrapes and cuts. Parents tend to get headaches. Now, I'll keep an eye on the expiration dates for the medicines in these kits...I would have to anyway if I made my own kit (stuff expires). And while I don't know if the medicines or tape or band aids are brand names or generics in this kit, it's a good price and seems to have everything I've ever needed. It feels good to know that, in the car, I have enough on hand to quickly address an issue for 1-4 people.You can determine whether the smaller kits make more sense...as, let's face it, the odds of 4 people getting injured all at the same time is slight...but, I like the feeling that I have enough "stuff" to quickly apply first aid to my entire family and that I don't have to "skimp" on a dressing because it can handle more than 1 person.
