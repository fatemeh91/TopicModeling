review/text: I used to take the Spring Valley prenatals when I was TTC but switched to these after I got pregnant because I was dizzy a lot and suspected low iron to be the culprit.Once I started taking these the dizzies went away! I think I do better with the form of iron in these vitamins. I was also experiencing a little bit of nausea and that went away too. Although I can't be for sure that it was due to these vitamins, I don't think they hurt. I also no longer suffer "iron burps" and can take this pill any time of day (I had to take my old ones at night to avoid nausea).They are big and a bit smelly, but I swallow them with a glass of milk (I'm not a vegan) and I don't have any problems getting them down.I also like the added digestion probiotics. I haven't suffered any constipation yet and I'm in my 3rd trimester.I think these vitamins are great for the price and I would highly recommend to anyone.
