review/text: This is excellent product that really improves overall cholesterol levels. My overall went from 205 to 135 in 12 months. I also changed my eating habits. I got rid of the red meats, diary, and other high fat foods. Now I eat a low fat high protein diet that consist of vegetables, turkey, chicken, soy products, and fruit.
