review/text: I have been taking phosphatidyl serine for several years. I recently changed to this brand (chiefly to avoid shipping charges). Also, since I'm aging (69) I'm going to take the maximum dosage (3 a day) rather than one. Until I recently retired I was a piano teacher and church organist. I swear I could tell a difference (mental fog) if I ran out and waited a few days for delivery. Now I order before I run out. I always check amazon first for many items. Since I no longer drive and have some difficulty walking, I appreciate amazon's reliable and quick delivery.
