review/text: These gloves have profoundly changed the comfort and mobility of my wife's hands. She wears them at night and in the morning is able to move as she has not been able to for years. During the day they are supportive and comfy. She loves them. Even if they were not very durable as some reviewers claim, I would keep buying them because they are so beneficial to my wife's every day activities. If you have RA and are looking for ways to make life more comfortable and increase your mobility these gloves should be on your short list of things to try...
