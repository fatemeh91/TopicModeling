review/text: We had been using All Day Energy Greens from the Institute for Vibrant Living before we compared ingredients to Green Vibrance. Green Vibrance is not as sweet but I feel it has had a positive change in replacing good bacteria in the intestines and helps to push waste through. I have noticed increased energy levels and just an all around sense of well being. Because I like mine sweeter,I mix mine with four to eight ounces of juice in the morning. My husband also drinks this but mixes his with water. Some people may find it hard to drink the "gritty-ness" of green drinks but I don't think it is too bad. Flavor wise, this is pretty mild. I have actually found myself craving it more than once a day. This drink helps to alkalize my body and helps eliminate my acid reflux symptoms like my esophagial spasms. If you have never had a green drink, I would start with a smaller container to see if you even like it.
