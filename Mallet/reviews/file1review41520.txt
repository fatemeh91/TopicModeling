review/text: We bought this clipper to shave some problem hair from our cat and it worked fine. It is fairly quiet and has an assortment of attachments to suit your pet's coat. I have also used it to trim our 2 Corgis and it is very efficient. I would recommend this kit for average pet owners. Professional groomers will probably want a more heavy duty unit though.
