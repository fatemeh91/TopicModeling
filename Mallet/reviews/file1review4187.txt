review/text: These Razors must be factory seconds. It was painful to use the blades. They were course and hurt my face. I did not get a clean Gillette Shave. Felt like old blades I would have thrown out, but they did have new green ruber indicator strips. I ended up throwing them away. Not the usual Fusion Experience. I tried to order these online because I thought I could save a few bucks. I might still try ordering them from amazon, but never again from these guys.
