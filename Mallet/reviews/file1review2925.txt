review/text: This vibrator lasted me about five years; I haven't had many, so I don't know if this is on the long end of life-expectancy for these things, but I considered it to be a steadfast product. And it drove me crazy. In a good way. The rotating shaft broke after a couple of years, but the clitoral stimulator, which lasted till the end, hit me in that amazing, specific way that I simply cannot communicate to a partner and not because I don't know how to express myself. It cut my orgasm time by 75%, hence great for quickies or when I'm having trouble with a partner.
