review/text: What more can you say about a small trimmer that actually cuts your nose and, for us oldees, your ear hairs. It's great. Just do what you have to do with one hand and use the other for productive work. It is quick and does not pull such as others have. It is durable and so far my other Wahl procuct experience has been super. It is not a fancy face or leg shaver. It is a little trimmer that you can also use to trim those eye brows. Being waterproof is an added feature and handy. Washing the remains down the drain sure beats flipping the waste in the trash can or elsewhere and then having left over stuff.
