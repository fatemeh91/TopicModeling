review/text: OK. There are two main groups of "users" for this product - those who wear the product on their noses and hopefully find some benefit, and their sleep mates who no longer have to listen to snoring that ranges from a light whistling to a full blown deforestation each night. I fall into the latter category, although my sinus problems have me tempted to try the (small) strips out for myself some time soon. My husband uses the strips and he notices a slight improvement in his own sleep, some benefits in his breathing and a less dry mouth on waking. I have to say YAY for the inventor. These rock!
