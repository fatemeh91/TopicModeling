review/text: I stumbled upon Amazon.com - Subscribe & Save less than a year ago, since then I have been using them more and more.I found out recently that the 6 Lbs. bags of protein that I was buying at Costco for $39.99 + Tax of Muscle Milk Mfg. was reviewed by Consumers Reports, the results are profound. I suggest that anyone buying protein take a good look at this independent study & decide for yourself as I did. I have chosen to return all 4 of my bags to Costco & showed them why, as I am still very disturbed about the results.So I have researched & came up with this product, a much Cleaner & more bang for your buck product. A Company known for its Quality and still Affordable to the average person looking to help themselves, without the chance of being POISONED!!!.My Protein showed up yesterday, 2 days before I expected. Life is to short to stay in the problem, I choose to stay in the solution today.Dymatize Nutrition Elite Whey Protein Isolate, Gourmet Vanilla, 10 Pound
