review/text: Good Solid Kit for what i needed it for. Added a package of quick clot, some sunscreen wipes, and a few others that you dont find in any other premade medical kits anyways. I think for the price its hard to beat because its as lightweight as its going to get with the contents inside. The fact that its very resilient but NOT completely waterproof is excellent. Most kits dont consider that and what good is your med kit if everything is soaked. Bright color is easy to see and easily recognized as a med kit. I would buy again. You can't build a kit for any cheaper with the quality of this kit. Everything is quality. And yes, I took everything out and put it back together. I'm anal about things like that. I like to know what I have and where it is.If your looking for a premade kit. AMK's are hard to beat. Pick up one of these cause it should already be in your pack.NOTE! I put a 25 gram packet of quickclot in mine, I feel as if a 50gram will NOT fit. the 25 gram had a perfect maximum fit.
