review/text: We are in the earlier stages of potty training our 3 year old son and are still becoming familiar with all of the potty training accoutrements that are out there these days. I purchased another brand of toilet trainer, because it appeared to have a lot of extra padding, and although it wasn't horrible, I could tell that my son just wasn't comfortable when sitting on the "big boy potty". We all know that potty training requires a lot of patience for both the trainer and the trainee, and comfort is key! My husband came home with this Baby Bjorn trainer and it has worked beautifully. It has a snug fit on the toilet seat (and the fit is adjustable), and is nicely contoured so that my son has the needed support to sit comfortably (and more patiently) on the potty. Although it is made of a harder plastic, it still seems to be more comfortable than the more padded versions that we were using. And with a boy, the built in guard has also come in handy.
