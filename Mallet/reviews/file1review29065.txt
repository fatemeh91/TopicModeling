review/text: I purchased this in June 2007 as it seemed to be the ideal solution for a guy with a goatee. At first, it pretty much matched my expectations - a good three-function trimmer and a half-decent shaver all in one. It's stamina sucks, however. By March 2009 I had to keep my thumb on the trimmer blade extender to prevent the blades from pulling the hairs out rather than cutting them off. By mid-July 2009 this tactic no longer worked and rather than suffer more pain and expletives I now have a full-face beard of over four weeks growth while I wait for my Philips Norelco hybrid trimmer/vacuum cleaner to arrive. If that doesn't do the business it might not help convince my wife I'm not trying to look like Steve Earle but at least I'll be able to give the living room the once over. All I can do with the Braun is throw it away.
