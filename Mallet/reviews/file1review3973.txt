review/text: I bought it precisely because of the review which describes it as "too strong." And it is. It really increases your vitality and energy. I also bought it because it's made by Oregon's Wild Harvest, which is known for high quality control of its organic products. I would suggest start from 1 capsule, let your body get used to it, then 2, then 3 (the recommended dosage). Couple that with exercise and diet and you'd see results.
