review/text: If these things are different in any way, shape, or form from the store bought cartridges it probably requires inspection with a quality 10x loupe and more knowledge of Gillette manufacturing standards than I will ever bother picking up.Cuts perfectly smooth against the grain (the only reason I got caught up in the blade count frenzy), the first blade has been in every other day use for well over a month. Pretty much what I have come to expect from the Fusion cartridges.I expect nothing surprising when it gets warm enough to shave my head again.
