review/text: Read everything there was to read. Ordered this scale from Center Aisle, through Amazon, on 10-27-11. It arrived, UPS, in a perfect, strong, tight as a duck's butt box, on 11-3-11. Had it unpacked, set up, and zeroed out, in 10 minutes flat. It's very accurate, in repeatable, 1/4 lb. increments.Unless you maybe have wienie arms, just disregard any feedback that whines about a difficult assembly. Unless you think your cranking bolts on an M1 tank, disregard any feedback that suggests the screws strip easy. Just use your God given common sense.Regarding the instructions, as is common, they make the assembly seem more difficult than it is. So, in plain English ..... fully unpack, remove all protective packaging, don't forget the cardboard wedged into the lower housing. Put the base on the floor, stand the column into it, lay it, gently, on it's back, on a rug. From underneath, hook the rod's hook onto the mechanism. Grab that hook, gently, with needle nose pliers to do that. Stand your scale back up, gently. Install the 6 phillip screws, with their lock washers. Carefully place the scale in your desired place, zero it out with the adjustment screw on the read out head. Enjoy an accurate scale for the next few decades.
