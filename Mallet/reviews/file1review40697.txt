review/text: My wife uses one of these at night for neck pain, and she says it helps the pain a little, and the buzzing noise the vibrator makes puts her to sleep. If it works for her, it works for me.On a side note, we go through a ton of C-Cell batteries thanks to this little guy. It needs new batteries every 20 hours of use.
