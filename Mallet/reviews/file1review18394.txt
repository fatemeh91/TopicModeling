review/text: Acne sufferers listen up... Although this product is for psoriasis and does not mention using it for acne, the active ingredient is salicylic acid which is also the active ingredient in many, many overpriced OTC acne medications. What is great about this Dermarest product is that it has 3% salicylic acid - most acne medications only have 2%!! If your skin can tolerate salicylic acid alright, I would definitely give this product a try for acne. It will dry your skin out somewhat, but the product has other ingredients in it that seem to counteract the dryness. Also, I found it not to be irritating. Another big plus about this product is that one gets a lot of product (4oz) for a fairly cheap price. Most other salicylic acid acne medications come in tiny tubes and cost a heck of a lot more. This one will last you a long time.If your skin does get overly dry from using this, another Dermarest product (the Eczema treatment) will help with any itching and dryness. That is actually how I stumbled upon Dermarest products at the local drug store. I developed a horrible, red, peeling, itching rash on my face that continued to persist for several weeks from using an acne product containing benzoyl peroxide. The Dermarest Eczema product really helped with that!!! (Now I stay away from anything containing benzoyl peroxide!)
