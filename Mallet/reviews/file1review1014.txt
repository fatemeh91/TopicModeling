review/text: had twins. bought this when having trouble with one not nursing as well as my milk slowed down. did not really seem to make a difference in the amount of milk. tasted gross, I would take it in a shot of water. contains alcohol from the natural herbs. I think its better to nurse often to get better milk as that made a bigger difference on its own than when I used this in conjunction with more nursing, probablly from the alcohol?
