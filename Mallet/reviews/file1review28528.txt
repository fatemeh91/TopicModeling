review/text: I've been using this protein all summer and it has worked great. Two of my friends were on other protein brands and ended up switching over to Gold Standard after seeing what a value it is for what you get. Double Rich chocolate tastes great, and it contains everything you need in a good post-workout protein. Just add water or milk and you are good to go. Add some yogurt, peanut butter, and fruit and you have a suitable meal supplement as well!
