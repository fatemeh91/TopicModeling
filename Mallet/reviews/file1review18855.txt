review/text: Once a great product...now it is just a lot of work. Ispent two hours trying to get my glass table tops looking nice. But all this Windex does is leave streaks and film that will not come off by buffing or wiping. Stuck with three spray bottles and three gallons jugs of useless product! Uck!
