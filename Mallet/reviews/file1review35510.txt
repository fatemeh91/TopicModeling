review/text: I bought Jason Natural Tea Tree Oil because I have read from different websites that it is a good remedy for dandruff. I have suffered from severe dandruff for a while and have tried a lot of dandruff shampoos that have not worked. I applied Jason Natural Tea Tree Oil on my scalp and have left it to soak overnight. The oil gives off a strong odor so I would recommend that you open up your bathroom windows when applying. I like the minty tingling feeling on my scalp after a few minutes of working the oil and massaging it on my scalp. After soaking the oil on my scalp overnight, I washed my hair with Jason Natural Tea Tree Shampoo and also used the same brand conditioner. Believe it or not, after I blow dried my hair, I did not see trace of big chunks of dandruff like I used to have. This product truly works!!! I would use it every 2 to 3 weeks just to make sure I don't get the big chunks of dandruff again!
