review/text: I'd never taken primrose oil before but, since I have certain conditions that can potentially benefit from its use, I decided to give it a shot. I'm not able to tell if it does anything to help control inflammation. It does make me feel slightly relaxed. I take extra magnesium, B6, and omega 3 oil along with this. I have to say that I'll probably not order more when I'm done.
