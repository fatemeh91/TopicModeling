review/text: I bought this same eye mask for my boyfriend over a year ago and he wore it to shreds. He loves that this does not push up against his eyes like most eye masks but completely keeps light out. He is a very light sleeper and has found that this is so easy to sleep in that he wears it even when there isn't much to be concerned of in the way of lights. Unfortunately the two materials that make up the eye portion is held together with a light glue so the first one he owned fell apart and the new one I bought him started to do the same after just a couple months. This is the only eye mask that I have seen with this design and it works so well I doubt we'll ever buy a different brand. We will either continue buying this after the new one falls apart or we will just have to start gluing them back together!
