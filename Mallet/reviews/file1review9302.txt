review/text: Alright, I must admit that I am a little bit conflicted about these trays myself. I bought them for my grandmother, and her experience with them was mixed.Things she liked:1) She found the boxes easy to hold and open.2) The individual (separate) boxes were more convenient than a large, all-week box.3) The brightly-colored tray sat conveniently on a counter, helping to remind her to take her pills.Things she did not like:1) The fact that the AM & PM sides of the tray share a common lid meant that opening and pouring the AM pills into her hand really didn't work - it was too hard to keep the PM pills from spilling out at the same time.2) Bumping the weekly organizer too easily caused the days to fall out.3) While the product description says that it can "hold up to 25 tablets or pills," capsules quickly fill up the daily trays.So, that's it, it has its positives and negatives. In general, though, she does like it, and uses it every day for her medications.(Review of Apex Pocket Med Pack with 7 Day Tray)
