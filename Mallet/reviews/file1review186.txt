review/text: I have always had a normal menstral cycle until about a year ago when I stopped getting my period. I went to the doctor and they prescribed Provera for me to take for a week every four months to get my period. I wanted to get my period regulated again to having it every month like I had it before. I read in a book that Chaste Berry Extract could make that possible. It said it could take a few months but I thought I would give it a try. I have been taking it (one pill a day) for months now and for the first few months, the change was minimal but I could tell a little bit of a difference. Now it seems to be working, it is a lot more regulated than it was. I've only had to take the Provera one time during the first few months of taking this extract. Hopefully soon I won't need the Provera at all! I will continue to take this product for a long while. If you are having the same problem as me, I STRONGLY recommend this! I've also heard it helps improve inferility!
