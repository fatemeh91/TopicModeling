review/text: I have had heartburn since I was 13. This is a family thing. I wanted to get off the proton pump inhibitor because of the side effects. Unfortunately, Heartburn Free did not work for me, I had hoped it would. Perhaps it would work for someone who has not had heartburn for a very long time.
