review/text: Winter dryness made my finger tips dry and cracked, becoming extremely painful. Nothing would help until I told a pharmacist at Walmarts in Palmdale, CA. She suggested the cream "Acid Mantle" rubbed into the tips of my thumbs and any other finger tip that cracked. What a winner!! That was 15 years ago and I use it lightly on the ends of my thumbs every night when I go to bed in the winter, or any other time if needed. It's not easy to find and this last time I had to order it from the internet. I can't praise it enough!N. DanaOak Park, CA
