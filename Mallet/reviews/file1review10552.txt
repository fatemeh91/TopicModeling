review/text: Bought this can because I was having a total hip replacement and cannot bend over for to 6 weeks to pick up my cane if it falls on the floor. The only positive thing I can say about this junky cane is that if you are careful with it, it will sort of stand up on its own. There are 4 feet one the bottom that I measured with a level and none of them are level. So when you use it, it feels like you are wobbling. It's hard enough to have a hip replacement, but to sell a cane with 4 feel that are not level is unconscionable.
