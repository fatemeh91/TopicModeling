review/text: I HAVE USED THIS EXACT GLOVE FOR THE LAST 9 YEARS AT WORK AS A FIRE/MEDIC. THEY ARE GREAT! VERY DURABLE, DO NOT RIP EASILY LIKE NON LATEX GLOVES HAVE WHEN I NEEDED THEM MOST. GREAT FOR CHANGING OIL OR ANYTHING INVOLVING CHEMICALS/PAINT YOU DON'T WANT ON YOUR HANDS. IF I AM WORKING IN THE GARAGE, I THROW A PAIR ON AND GET TO WORK. I ALSO KEEP A FEW PAIRS IN MY TRUCK IN CASE I COME UPON AN ACCIDENT ON THE ROAD. THEY STRETCH VERY WELL. EVEN TO THE POINT SOME GUYS HAVE BLOWN THESE UP TO MAKE A INFLATABLE TOY FOR KIDDOS DURING DEMOS. THEY EASILY WILL BLOW UP 10X THEIR NORMAL SIZE WITH NO RIPPING OR TEARING.WORD OF CAUTION, RUBBER GLOVES DO NOT HANDLE SUN LIGHT WELL SO KEEP EM OUT OF DIRECT SUNLIGHT FOR LONG HOURS. WHEN I WAS IN EMS, IF WE LEFT THE BOXES ON THE DASH FACING UP, THE GLOVES WOULD TURN COLOR AND RIP EASIER.
