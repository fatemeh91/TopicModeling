review/text: MY INLAWS SMOKE HEAVILY INSIDE THEIR HOUSE. I TRIED WASHING THEIR WALLS FIRST WITH VINEGAR, BAKING SODA AND HOT WATER, THEN WATER AND DISH SOAP, AND EVEN WINDEX. THAT WORKED OK, BUT WHEN I USED INSTAGONE ON A WALL I HAD ALREADY WASHED, IT WAS LIKE I NEVER CLEANED IT BEFORE!!!INSTAGONE BLEW MY MIND WITH HOW EASILY IT REMOVED THE SMOKE STAINS. THE ONLY PROBLEM I AM HAVING IS IT REMOVES IT SOMEWHAT UNEVENLY, BUT THAT IS THE NATURE OF SMOKE STAINS WITH ANY REMOVAL METHOD. THIS IS FOR SURE THE BEST PRODUCT I'VE FOUND FOR SMOKE/TAR THUS FAR!!! WORTH EVERY PENNY
