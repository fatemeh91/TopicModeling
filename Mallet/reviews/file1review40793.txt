review/text: This is a very decent razor, which has it's cons and pros.Pros:- Handy for shower stalls in locker rooms, in particular, the gym. This razor avoids the problem of soap being washed off as soon as it's put on, since the soap is located around the actual blade.- Produces great &quot;look&quot; results. Skin looks smooth and clean.Cons:- Produces so-so &quot;feel&quot; results, as it doesn't shave as close as some of the other razors (for example, Gilette Mach3). Also, as a result of that, hair grows out faster, and the morning shave is not fresh by the evening.- Soap is not used evenly. The front is used up much faster. To use up the soap in the back, I slide the razor down on the leg (or any body part) before I shave using upward motion.- Can't touch up once you're out of the shower. Often, I miss spots. With a regular razor, I just touch up once I'm out of the shower. With this razor, touch up is not possible, since it will leave a soap on the skin, and the soap then needs to be washed off. (NOTE, there is no residue after washing the soap off, so this is not a problem if you're shaving in the shower)- I've cut myself with this razor several times. Though I must admit, I'm getting better at it.Overall, this product suits my needs. The speed and convenice are very important for me. I use it at the gym in the morning when I'm rushing to work, and this razor is definitely more time efficient than using a regular razor. The skin looks well enough to wear skirts. However, if you're planning for your skin to be touched, or you're shaving a bikini area, I'd recommend my all time favorite Gilette Mach3.
