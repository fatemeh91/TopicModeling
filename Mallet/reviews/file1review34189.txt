review/text: As a long distance runner, I suffer occasionally from hemorrhoids. And boy, I really hate when this happens since it impinges on my running. I can say, without hesitation, that this product is AWESOME. It provides relief when I could find none. I have tried other preparations and they are useless in comparison. If you are wondering if it is worth the investment I can tell you yes. I would not typically write a recommendation about something as personal as this unless I thought it was special. I am pain-free after days of suffering.
