review/text: I experienced whatever the "Tax Guy" did. The batteries were cheap, they work great, last long, and I can use them over and over. I'm sure that they have already paid for themselves.I got them quickly, there were what the seller said they were, and they worked as advertised. In my family, everyone takes a ton of pictures, and I'm constantly switching out the spent batteries for the recharged. It's totally worth it.
