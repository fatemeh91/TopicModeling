review/text: My 6 year old son takes both BrightSpark and Focus Formula. It does work, but it takes time to work. Herbal remedies take time to get into the system and can sometimes take up to 6-8 weeks to see a full effect. Prescription meds are effective in about 3-5 days. You need to be patient while waiting for the full effects of this product, but it is worth the wait and so much better than the prescription meds that can have horrible side effects.
