review/text: I have been using my Ionic toothbrush for about two months now and I am very impressed with the results. My teeth and whole mouth feel cleaner and my gums do not bleed any more. I am also pleased at how fresh my breath is after each use. This is a big improvement over my standard toothbrush and well worth the money in my opinion.
