review/text: I recently purchased these clippers for a trip to Australia.I already own a Wahl clipper set; however, the clippers in that set were not dual-voltage. The Conair clippers work great, I've tried them in both San Francisco, and Perth (Australia). Remember, you'll need a plug converter to use these overseas, also, it has to support polarized plugs (US plugs where one prong is bigger).A couple of things the description didn't mention: The set also comes with a big plastic sheet (which I didn't use), and the other end of the brush can be used to adjust the voltage and the power knob. Also, the zipper for my bag was white.The attachments it comes with are #1,2,3&4 (1/8th to 1/2 inch). So if you need longer ones, you'll have to find them somewhere else (I cannibalized my Wahl set, which fit perfectly).One other note: If the clippers are clacking loudly, you need to adjust the power down via the unmarked black screw above the on switch. See the instruction manual for how to do it. I had to adjust the power down when I used them in Perth.
