review/text: I've been using cheap razors, like the ones you get at the Dollar Store, for a few years now. I have a hard time plopping down $10 for a razor head. After mutilating my legs with the cheap blades I finally broke down and purchased the Intuition razor. All I can say is, Wow! What a difference a four blades instead of one makes! I've used my Intuition a few times now and can't imagine going back to the the cheapies...ever!As I mentioned before, the Intuition is a spendy little razor so I look out for the razor refills to go on sale. That doesn't happen too often in my area, but when it does I am one happy camper =)
