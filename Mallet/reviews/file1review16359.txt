review/text: All in all, my feelings about TOBS creams can best be summed up as "meh."They work fine, creating a lubricating lather with which to shave. However, the lather is not especially protective, the scents are not particularly wonderful, and the skin care properties are neutral.This works fine, but better shaving experiences can be had for similar cost.
