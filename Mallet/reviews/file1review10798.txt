review/text: The back wrap helped me with the pain I had from my lung surgery in 2008. I couldn't do any work that required repetitive motion. With the wrap over the surgery site I was able to do most everything I did before. At some point I found that I didn't need the support as much. Apparently the magnetics's cured some of my pain. A God send, thanks!
