review/text: Rare Excellent ProductMy wife and I live in the mountains of New Mexico between Albuquqerque and Santa Fe at about 7200ft; when we remodeled our house we made sure we had a tight house but rodents eventually find a way in. For those unfamiliar with country rodents (mice, squirrels, rats) and othe pests, they are far more agrressive than domestic rodents of the city due to the fact that they are not used to people. They eat gas lines, oil lines, seats, and different parts of vehicles as well as any and all of the normal prducts of the city mice/rats. I have tried multiple products including many forms of professional poisons over the years including costly bobcat and coyote urine in an effort to deter their aggression - all to no avail.We purchaced five of the five-in-one electronic Lentek Pest Repeller four years ago; one for each level of house and attic as well one for the barn (1700sf in size) and another for the garage and our well pump room. These units without exception are awesome!!!- and have been the singular most effective product we have tried in 18 years of living here. I just ordered two addition units tonight for the barn and pump room.Buy them - you will love them and thank me!! and Lentek fo course. They don't leave a lot of dead mich, bugs, critters laying around - the unwelcome guests just move out and on. Where there are rodents, there are typically snakes eating them as a food souce and when the rodents move out the snakes move out too.We have a Boxer rescue dog and a Great Pyrenees/Shepperd mix rescue dog that sleep in the garage and the units do not bother them; my wife and I have one in our bedroom with us and we have never heard them so apparanetly this brand doesn't make the offensive noise that bother pets and people that I have read about; although I have stayed in Alaskan hotels where they had electronic uits that were noisy and annoyning. Good Luck!!!Lentek 5 in 1 Pest Repeller PC51Lentek 5 in 1 Pest Repeller PC515 in 1 Pest Repeller
