review/text: I thought this would be perfect for my neck and shoulders. I would have preferred the rice sock I had previously. It was easier to wrap around and place it. I have terrible problems with my upper neck. I can barely keep this on up there.So, it's alright, but for the price, I should have stuck with the cheapy.
