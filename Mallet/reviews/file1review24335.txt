review/text: I bought this thinking it was like anouther product i perchased befour and the pills are so differint as well as the cream.was going to return it but thought about it more and thought i would give it a try.needless to say that i am alergic to the cream and have had cemical burn on my chest for a week or more. so this is why i only rated one star tho i should go with none but i have still taken the pills and have had no change yet.but i hope they will work without the cream.
