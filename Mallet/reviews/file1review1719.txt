review/text: When i was 13 i ended up with tinea versicolor,which is a fungal skin infection that changes the normal pigmentation of the skin and i ended up with discolored white patches of skin everywhere!. My skin was very severe, it looked like a frogs skin. The discolored white patches were everywhere,my back,chest,stomach,arms,butt,face and thighs. Doctors gave me many different lotions, pills and creams to try to get the pigmentation to go away and reduce the look of the white patches on my tan skin. Nothing worked that the doctor gave up, so i searched the internet desperate because i was sad everyone kept staring at me when summer comes. Then I heard about this funga soap.I didnt trust it but since i tried everything else I gave it a shot. I used it everyday for a week. And two weeks later the patches are fading and some areas dispeared! some are really small, some blended in with my regular skin. I was so happy. I cant wait to finish this bottle and see how my skin will look after. Nothing worked and this did, after many years of stuff i was given. How i used it: Everyday the first week as a body wash, 2 minutes, second week everyother day 5 minutes.
