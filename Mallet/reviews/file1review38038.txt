review/text: It seems too good to be true. The device seems great on the surface but looking close it does not offer a significant degree of water resistance.The FR2 or Zoll AED are units that are a bit better. But for a home unit where there is no chance of accidental exposure to water (swimming pool, rain or snow); it is a good unit.jim bock, Pres.Survivors Foundationaedsurvivors.org
