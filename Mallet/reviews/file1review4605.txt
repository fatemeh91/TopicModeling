review/text: I was a very, very happy Mach 3 (and Mach 3 Turbo) owner for a decade. Then I received the Fusion to try as a sample and am SO, SO glad I didn't waste the money buying it in-store! My first impression after lifting it from the package was the shoddy heft (or lack there-of) it had. I figured that 10 years ago the Mach3's were made of metal and this of plastic..something many companies are doing, so I guess its understandable (though not as environmentally-friendly). I moved on to using it and was in shock at how horribly it shaved! I got 4 nicks the first time! In all my years of using the Mach 3, I've had maybe 5 nicks-- IN A DECADE! I was horrified that the same company could be making these 2 shavers! I mistakenly thought that an 'upgrade' in the amount of blades would make this a lightning-fast, shaving machine. How sad that this is not so. I thought the lubricating strip would at least help the matter, but alas it seems to be nothing but a joke; merely a colored strip at the top of the blades and was worn out after the second use! Another thing I found was that it slipped out of my hand each and every time I used it in the shower. It looks like it has rubber hand grips, but in reality it does not. Your fingers grip slippery, wet, plastic; a big no-no when you're handling a shaver. Ever time I use it, 'What were they thinking?!' crosses my mind. I've discarded the disposable head and am now stuck with a cheap handle that I feel bad chucking into a landfill. Sigh.In all honesty, I gave this a good, fair run (used 6-7x), but this is a giant leap backward for a company that gave us so superb of a shaver like the Mach 3. I really expected more from them.
