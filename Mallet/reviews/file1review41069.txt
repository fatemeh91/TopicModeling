review/text: I did not realize until I received the candy that these were artificially sweetened. I have decided that non-sugar sweeteners have unpredictable effects on the human body: "better the devil I know than the devil I don't."That being said, these are excellent pick-me-ups for long meetings, long car rides, late afternoon droopy head. Three candies are the equivalent of one can of soda. The flavor is brilliant, a mix of cinnamon and peppermint, and they refresh the taste in your mouth. The tin is useful afterwards for storing odds and ends.
