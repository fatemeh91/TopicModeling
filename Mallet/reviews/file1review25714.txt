review/text: I have bought three of these -- I keep thinking I just got a dud. Apparently, they're all duds. They work okay (get the job done) when they work. But they only work a few months at most. The longest lasting one I've had lasted about 5 months. The one I just purchased stopped (just stopped) working in a matter of a few weeks. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
