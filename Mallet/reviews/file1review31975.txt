review/text: i usually do not write reviews on my purchases but i want to share my opinions on this product. i am 23 years old and like to live as healthy as possible. i think green drinks such as this are healthier than multivitamins and i actually feel healthier after drinking this. This is the best product i have ever bought for my health. I drink it every morning as soon as i wake up. this is not a miracle product but it's full of vitamins and other healthy stuff that i probably dont even know about. Fair warning-- this product does not taste good. Once you taste it you will be able to tell that it is very healthy ( honestly tastes like algea and broccoli ). if u r someone who cares about what your green drink tastes like go elsewhere. otherwise, if u r like me and care only about the health benefits and want the best product for the money you pay, this is what u want. there are green drinks cheaper but they're far less effective in my opinion. hope this helps.
