review/text: Fantastic water bottle brush. The Oxo brush is exactly what I hoped a brush made by this naufacturer would be, attractive, sturdy, and lexile enough to get into both small mouthed bottles and under the neck/shoulders of the bottle. Every time I use this, make water bottle, which I use to store freshly made juices, comes out like new clean. The briskes are not abrasive, so they leave no scratches on the bottle, something that I have experienced with other brushes. I highly recommend this product and will most definitely buy again the next time I'm in the market for a bottle brush.
