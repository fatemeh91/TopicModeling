review/text: Its so embarrassing to wonder if your breath smells fresh. Especially if you are constantly in close corners with other people. I was concerned about this and a friend rec. Therabreath. This product works great! It is tasteless and works instantly.I did find it hard at first to rinse for the full 60 seconds, because one of the active ingredients in the products causes the product to foam. After rinsing my mouth not only felt super clean, it smelled wonderful! I would rec. using this product twice a day at minimum.If you have chronic bad breath then this is the product for you. It instantly eliminates bad odor!
