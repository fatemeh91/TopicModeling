review/text: I have only used this product once so far, but it feels really good when it is on. It's like a cool and warm soothing feeling. And when you take it off, your skin is very smooth. I have acne prone and oily skin, and it didn't have a negative effect at all on my skin. My sisters skin is dry and acne prone, and she didn't have a negative effect, either.
