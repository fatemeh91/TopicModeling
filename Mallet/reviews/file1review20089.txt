review/text: I began taking Dim-plus because I did some research on reducing the size of fibroid tumors naturally. My gyno was concerned with the size of them in my uterus and they were causing me to have very heavy and irregular periods, a lot of discomfort in my back and frequent urge to urinate caused by the fibroids pushing on my organs. I had very acute PMS including sensitivity to sound, food cravings, intense and persistent hunger even after eating, anxiety, sadness and feeling very irritated by everything. My periods were getting closer and closer together and I was determined to do something besides begin to think about surgery to have the fibroids removed. The results that I have had with DIM were apparent within one month of taking four capsules a day, two in the morning and two at night. I now have, almost no bloating, less headaches, more manageable moods, better sleep, a regular cycle that you can set your watch by every 28 to 30 days, much lighter periods, less cramping, no breast tenderness, less hunger and best of all my fibroids have been shrinking steadily since I started taking DIM two years ago. I have recommended DIM to several friends with various female issues and they all report great results. One friend was scheduled for surgery and postponed it in order to try the DIM. It has been a year and she has still not had to resort to having the fibroids removed. I certainly believe in medical intervention when needed and I am not recommending ignoring medical advice, but there are changes you can make on your own to help yourself and possibly avoid medical intervention. DIM is definitely that option for me. I recommend it to anyone who has estrogen related issues. My doctors see no reason for me not to take the supplement if I am feeling good taking it. This price is also amazing. It's half what I pay in the vitamin stores. I'm gonna stock up! Without this product I truly believe I would have been a surgery candidate by now.
