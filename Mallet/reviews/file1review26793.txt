review/text: Out of everything I've tried and heard about from other people, this is the best whey on the market. It is the best tasting (at least the chocolate; strawberry is okay and I've not tried anything else), it mixes with water and milk very easily, it is quite inexpensive, and you can't find it cheaper than on Amazon. If you're into exercise nutrition and you know you're going to eventually use ten pounds, just get the big bag. You'll save money.
