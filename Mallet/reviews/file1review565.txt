review/text: I have used this solution for years because of my sensitive eyes. I believe that it is the only nonpreserved saline available. The problem is that the price has skyrocketed in the past several years for no apparent reason. When I first started using this you could buy a box (3 bottles) for $3 when it was on sale. Now it costs $6.50-$7.00! Even allowing for inflation this is outrageous. You can buy a 12oz (same total amount) bottle of lightly preserved saline for $2.50. It doesn't cost Alcon any more to manufacture the saline than other companies such as Walgreens. Sure, Alcon's comes in 3 bottles rather than one but the additional plastic used in the bottles still doesn't justify the inflated price. Alcon should be ashamed of itself. I don't understand why other companies don't manufacture preservative-free saline. I've now switched to the cheaper saline rather than pay Alcon's rip-off price.
