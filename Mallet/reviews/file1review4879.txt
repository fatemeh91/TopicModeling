review/text: I had the earlier version of the this broom and it still works well but not as well as it did when new so I bought the new one which is larger than my old broom but still a good size. Great for getting all the dirt. Only problem is that the handle has a tendency to unscrew itself. Will probably glue it soon if it continues. Otherwise one of the most efficient brooms made
