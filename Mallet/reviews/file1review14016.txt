review/text: The thermofitting teeth whitening trays work great. I have whitener from my dentist but didn't want to spend the $300 for the trays, so I decided to try these. Had never heard of them before ordering either.. Never knew that by putting the unmolded trays in boiling water that they could then inturn be fit to your teeth.I had to dip them in the boiling water about 4 times, to get the best fit. And I didn't let my water cool down for a few minutes either, just after the water breaks boil, i removed from heat, and put the trays in until I saw they became very bendable!I recommend these very much. The plastic material is a little bulky, but still great and fit well once you have them mastered!
