review/text: I am a part time registered nurse and i started having femoral nerve pain in my right leg with pins/needle feeling, stiffness, achiness, and a burning sensation as well with standing and walking. All this started at 16 weeks pregnant!I knew I had to find something to get by with work, life, and enjoying my 2 year old! This binder is AWESOME!! 90% of my pain is gone, and I wear this binder all day except with bathing and sleeping.Worth the buy!
