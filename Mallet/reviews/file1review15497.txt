review/text: 50 batteries for $10 seems like just too good of a deal, but everything seems to be in working order. I've been using them for weeks now and they're holding up really well. Plus, they aren't near expiration either! (Mar 2010) This was a really great buy for me because my wireless keyboard/mouse eats up batteries.
