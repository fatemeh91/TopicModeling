review/text: this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.
