review/text: Hands down, the Optimum Nutrition Coffee flavor is the best tasting protein I have ever had. I don't want to ramble about the positive points of ON Whey protein - if your drinking it, I'm sure you've done the research or read the thousands of other reviews.But, this was the first time I've ordered this flavor. I mixed about two scoops with Vanilla flavored almond milk. Have you ever had one of those Mocha Starbucks frappuccino drinks in the glass bottles? It tastes almost EXACTLY like it! It is so delicious!HIGHLY recommended and I will definitely be reordering. Plus, Amazon 2-day shipping and price was better than almost every other site.
