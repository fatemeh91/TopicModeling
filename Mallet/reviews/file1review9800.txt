review/text: To be totally honest, I decided on a more preventative approach than cure. I used a facial scrubber to (one of those facial washes with the grains) to lift the hairs after shaving. I did this twice a day. In order to prevent dryness, I had to use a moisturizer. Once I started to get rid of the in grown hairs, I started using the scrubber just once a day and continued to moisturize. When I just started however, this tweezer worked wonders in lifting those difficult hairs.
