review/text: I am ttc since September 2009. My period has been irregular ever since I had my 1st child (almost 4 years ago).I want to have a baby so bad and I started reading everything... About policystic ovary syndrome, vitex, irregularity, obesity when ttc.. Everything! Got thermometers, ovulation tests, early pregnancy test, started taking folic acid... All u name I did.So After reading about vitex I thought I should give a try to "fix up" my period situation. After reading from a reviewer that vitex gets you depressed, I decided to read about Fertilaid. (I am depressed enough for not getting pregnant)Bottom line is, NO, I AM NOT pregnant, YET (I will let you guys know soon), but I amso happy, I got my period right on time! 32 days after my last period, exactly how it used to be. And it's only ONE MONTH after I started to take this product.I am pretty confident about this product! I will write soon! ;) i think if you have irregular period and is ttc, Try it! ;)))UPDATE: on 25/November/2010, I did 3 pregnancy tests, all POSITIVE!!!!UPDATE: My Baby is today 6 Aug 2012: 1 year and 17 days! Check my review on FertiliTea: A Natural Fertility Tea Blend 3oz (Health and Beauty). I used these two products together. It works, don't give up!
