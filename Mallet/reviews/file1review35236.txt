review/text: I found these to be extremely tight and about one inch too long to be comfortable on my legs. They appear to be well made, but I'm not at all sure I'll be able to use them on a regular basis. I understood from the description that they would be 'light compression' but discovered them to be quite the opposite. (I'm 5'11" and weight less then 190#). Rubber gloves will be necessary to help put them on.Good luck.
