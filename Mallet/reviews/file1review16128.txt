review/text: Perfusia was recommended by my Naturopathic doctor. After months of use, I can say it has never given me an upset stomach even when taken right before sleeping. Perfusia seems to have been of great benefit in concert with other supplements prescribed by the doctor. I recommend this Perfusia above all others if your doctor recommends an L-Arginine supplement.
