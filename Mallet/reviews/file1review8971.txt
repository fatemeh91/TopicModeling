review/text: I've been using Green Vibrance with my family for a couple of years now and it is so energizing and feels so good in our bodies. It helps me be sure that we're getting enough real nourishment into us. I prepare it as a smoothie with apple juice, a banana and some ice. Even the kids drink it right up!
