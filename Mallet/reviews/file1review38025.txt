review/text: It is irresponsible for people that do not know about this, to post in your site any opinion about something as important as sudden death. There are two people in your site (both of them signing as EMTs), saying that an AED is not so important to prevent sudden death.I am a cardiologist and have been training people in Emergency Cardiac Care for years now and can say that they are absolutely wrong. I have no relation with any AED manufacturer and all of the FDA approved ones are good.VF and VT are the cause of most sudden cardiac deaths. About 80% of people who dies suddenly have this arrythmia as the main cause. Just in the US, every year die more people of VF or VT than of car accidents, house fires, breast cancer and prostate cancer together.This does not mean that to have a HeartStart AED in your home is as good as controling risk factors or going to a hospital if you have chest pain or shortness of breath. But, if someone in your home has a heart condition you can save them with an AED if you act in the first 8 minutes after cardiac arrest. The AED is a very effective device if used well. You should also learn CPR but, without defibrillation, the chance of surviving is a lot less.In places like O'Hare Airport in Chicago they save about one person every two weeks using defibrillators. No one can affirm that all AEDs WILL save lives. But they could. It is not indicated for everyone but, for someone who can spend $1500 and have a heart condition that make them prone to sudden death, this device can be a very justificable spending.
