review/text: Irish Spring Bath Bars are a great product. The smell is a real wake-me-up in the morning. It's like aromatherapy at its finest. The scent is lasting too, because I can smell it still, hours later. Another plus to Irish Spring is that there is no residue (you know, that sticky feeling) left on your skin. This is some quality soap, but at a real person's price. I couldn't recommend it enough.
