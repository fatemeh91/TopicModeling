review/text: I could never take multivitamins, even the gummy kind because they would make me so nauseous. So when I became pregnant I read reviews like crazy and decided on this one. I am not pregnant anymore yet I still take one everyday because it is the only kind I can stomach, literally! Hopefully I will conceive again soon!
