review/text: I got this scale primarily to help my wife with weight loss and an exercise regimen, but I was also curious about my own developing "tummy."Weight and fat measurements are very good for a consumer electronic item.Setup is not 100% intuitive, but instructions are clear. Also, I like the multiple pre-sets to allow several people to enter their body parameters (male/female, height, age) which allows several different users. There's also a "guest" mode, but I'd be impressed if any casual guest could figure out how to program this thing.
