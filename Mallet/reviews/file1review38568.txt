review/text: I've found Nature's Secret products to be a good value, and usuallywhat they'll do is blend herbs (proprietary blend). What this does isit gives the user a large spectum of nutritional support.The enzymes in this particular product are well-known, & help your systemabsorb nutrients from whatever foods and vitamins you're incorporatinginto your daily diet.I recommend this product, and suggest you look at some of the otherproducts in their line.
