review/text: Years ago this was recommended to me by a coworker when I worked outside at a local market. I had a terrible cold and she suggested I go buy this. I have used it ever since (that was 1997). At the first sign of a cold of any kind or flu like feelings, I take the recommended amount (six capsules- 3 times a day for several days) and drink lots of water and try to get as much sleep as possible. I also take 2 capsules a day during the winter cold/flu months. While everyone else has a cold that lasts for weeks, mine is gone in days. Try this stuff! It has worked very well for me over the years.
