review/text: Basically, you save about 2.50 if you purchase these on Amazon vs. the retail stores, I checked Walmart, Lowe's etc before I purchased from here, so Amazon offers the better price. They arrived on schedule and in good condition and have like a 5 year expiration, which I have a teenager and lots of remotes, so they will never last me that long before running out. Biggest thing though for me in this economy is the savings!!!. Thanks.
