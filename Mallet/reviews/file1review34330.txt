review/text: These lint traps work well enough. They catch the lint, to be sure, but they quickly look grodie and disgusting. And no, they are not very easy to clean, particularly when you're grossed out. The lint sticks in every crevice and you just can't get them clean. And leaving them in the sink is especially gross, since we use our kitchen sink to drain ourLG Washer/Dryer Combo. So in searching for a better alternative, we came up with the idea of using organza pouches instead. TheseOrganza Jewelry Pouches, 100pcwork like a charm, have their own tie-offs sewn right in, catch MORE lint than these real lint traps, and best of all -- they're so cheap, I just use them once or twice and then just toss 'em. Perfect! I got a pack of 100 which made them about 13 cents each. Waaaaaaay more economical than standard lint traps, which push $1 a piece, at the cheapest; often more. Just my 2 cents. Works great for us.
