review/text: These are great vitamins. I have been taking them for 3 years now; started taking them when we were trying to conceive, and all through my pregnancy and bfing our child. I love that they are 1-a-day vitamins, especially in the early months of pregnancy when I was very nauseous I was able to take just the one with lunch and be set on vitamins for the day. They are also very easy on the body since they are in the most easily digestible forms (chelated) for gentle absorbtion (not like a lot of prescriptions that have really hard forms of vitamins - especially the iron). I highly recommend them.
