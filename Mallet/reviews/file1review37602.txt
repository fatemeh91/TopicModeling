review/text: This is the best antiperspirant I've ever found. It goes on clear and stays that way. And it really works; I don't become &quot;moist&quot; when under stress or even after a workout. Sorry to sound so much like an ad for the product, but it's really that good. And the fact that it's unscented is a real plus. If/when I want to wear a fragrance, fine. I wear what I want to wear, not what my deodorant dictates. This really is the best stuff on the market. And if you don't believe me, just try one stick; it's so cheap, what can you lose?
