review/text: I paid $6 for this product, and that was too much.The beard trimmer has a flimsy trimmer guard. This can lead to inconsistent trimming of the beard/ goatee. The trimmer guard cannot be removed, so don't even think about straightening your sideburns with this device! This thing is made of cheap plastic and takes a single AA battery. It whines like it is running out of juice, and I tried two different new batteries.The nose/ear trimmer is unimaginably worse. The "light" on this guy might as be an "on/off" indicator light. It does *not* light up your nostril...or anything for that matter. This also takes a single AA battery. This device is also made of cheap plastic, but until its bigger beard trimmer brother, this nose trimmer has a *plastic* cutting "blade." That's right...plastic. It actually performed well when I used it on ear/nose hair, but I doubt it will last long with the plastic blade.The carrying bag is OK. Low quality, but it holds the pair nice and snug.In summary: cheap plastic, single AA battery each, few features, poor performance, OK bag.
