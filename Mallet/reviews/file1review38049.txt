review/text: While Philips makes an excellent AED device[...]. The repeated assertions and/or implications that training, preparation and ongoing support aren't needed to utilize an AED are not only erroneous, they are a gross disservice to the public. They are also contrary to the history of providing Initial Emergency Care and Life Support as well as to the science of Emergency Medicine.AEDs don't save lives...AED programs that are part of the fabric of a community EMS System do! Moreover, without an emergency mindset (i.e., the courage and confidence to act) most people simply don't and won't respond to a potential sudden death situation, regardless of how easy an AED device is to operate. Despite the simplicity and documented success of AEDs, this needed "mindset" does not come in the box with the new unit.It must also be noted that not all cardiac arrests are caused by the electric malfunction ("ventricular fibrillation") that requires defibrillation. The victim of sudden death may also need CPR and ultimately, will always need the care of EMS professionals and transport to an appropriate medical facility.The idea that people should buy an AED "just to have one" is a step in the wrong direction. It may well produce a false sense of security for buyers as well as hinder the growth of the AED movement and the effectiveness of community EMS Systems. Indeed, the protection "for hearts and brains too good to die" offered by AEDs should be available everywhere. But having an AED without people who are properly prepared and supported runs the very real risk of not giving the victims of sudden death with the 2nd chance at life that a properly utilized AED can help provide.[...]
