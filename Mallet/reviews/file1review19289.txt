review/text: I typically don't write reviews but on this product I feel that I should. My wife and I have been trying to have a baby for the past 6 months. With no success and some minor research, I decided to give fertility blend a try. After two months of taking the product (2 pills a day) my wife and I just found out that we are now pregnant!!! Maybe it was the pills...maybe it wasn't?! Either way, I feel that fertility blend helped to supply the extra nutrients that are needed for men! I would recommend this product to anyone that are trying to start a family.
