review/text: I really like Avent pads. After the wash they keep their shape (love the free mesh bag too!), there is no lint attached to the nipple like in some different brands and they stay in place due to the lace cover on the bra side. Also they absorb leakage well and the milk doesn't go through, unless pretty heavy one. I wear them with my bras and nursing tops and no one can tell I wear the pads.Only at night I have to adjust them due to laying on the side, but not a biggie. I wear them more often than disposable ones (I use Lansinoh and like them too, but they tend to roll when I fold my bra to breastfeed and adjusting is annoying because of the glue side).
