review/text: There is no denying that this can be pretty nasty stuff to take. But if you mix it into Crystal Light lemonade or a similar product, and use very cold water along with some ice, you hardly taste it, and it really is quite tolerable. If you mix in some L-Citrulline, that also helps to mask the taste, but using very cold water and a sugar free drink mix does work wonders.
