review/text: I bought this aide for my 51 year old brother recovering from a hip replacement. Putting on his shoes and socks were the final obstacles preventing him from independence following his surgery. Loafers solved the shoe problem and this gadget solved the sock issue. My brother couldn't wait to call me and let me know he had put on his own socks. He said the pictorial instructions were very easy to follow. My brother is 6'7" tall and found the straps for pulling to be plenty long enough. He wears a size 13 shoe. His XL socks work just fine with this handy tool. The price seems very reasonable for the independence this product provides.
