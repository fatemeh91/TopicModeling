review/text: I have used epilators for years. Its not painful as some expressed, but the usual pinch when you start off. Its very efficient and easy to clean. I hope it lasts me a long time. The last one I got was also a phillips one from UK.I am not giving it 5 stars as I dont know its longevity and havent tried the shaver part of it.
