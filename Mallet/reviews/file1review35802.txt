review/text: This brace was recommended to me by a physical therapist when I was having problems with the tendons on the bottom of my foot. This helped give me better support while the tendons healed. As other reviewers have said it is difficult to get off and on but for me this was a small price to pay to ensure that my foot healed properly.I am very disappointed in the material. I hadn't used the brace for a couple years. My foot started bothering me again so I tried to put it on and I discovered that the material that wraps around the front of the foot had degraded. It has some sort of rubber/stretchy material and it has turned into a gooey mess. I am disappointed that the brace now has to be thrown away.
