review/text: I researched and read reviews about sonic and oral B and finally decided on the above (after two years). I was using a cheaper version power toothbrush and I can't believe the difference. I LOVE this toothbrush and cannot recommend it highly enough. I enjoy it so much I usually end up brushing for 7 or more minutes.
