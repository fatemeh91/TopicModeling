review/text: There are .25g of fiber in one pill and the recommended dose is 4 to 8 pills a day. That is a lot of pills and it only adds up to a whopping 2g of fiber. I took these 8 pills a day for two weeks with no benefit. It was only then I examined the ingredients more carefully. .25g per pill?! Preposterous. This product did not help me to go or to become more regular and at $14 I am more than annoyed that the description did not include the amount of fiber that is actually in the product. If I had read the fiber content on the bottle when it arrived I would have just sent it back. Silly me. I skipped right over it to the other ingredients. If you eat a piece of flax bread and a cup of yogurt every day you will pretty much have achieved what this product does.
