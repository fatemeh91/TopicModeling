review/text: Product is great for boat, regular seafoam to pour in tank to keep gas fresh. Deep creep is great for fogging motors for storage. Pull plugs spray some through holes, advance the throttle to open butterflys spray some through. Now pull landyard switch to deactivate electrical in motor and turn fly wheel clockwise either by hand or hit starter. Failing to do this can ruin rectifier+ cdi and other parts so if in doubt ground out each plug to block. Put plugs back in and should be ready for next season. Also you can drain carbs of gas, spray product through needles you remove and or floats. Now your rings and pistons are protected and might even loosen up any carbon buildup.
