review/text: Finish Powerball Tablets work very well. I have noticed a definite improvement in the cleanliness of my dishes. I was used to rinsing and removing most of the soil on my dishes before I put them into the dishwasher, and now I have to do that a lot less. It says it will remove even stuck-on foods, but on things like potatoes or oatmeal, the results weren't as good. I had to rewash a bowl that had held mashed potatoes, and a pan that had cooked oatmeal. Other than that, it seems to remove food from dishes quite well, at least compared to the gel I was using. The tablets are individually wrapped and easy to use.
