review/text: They are comfortable, moderately thick, and the padding doesn't bunch up over multiple washings. I like not having to use disposables which seems wasteful since I'd have to go though a lot of them over all the months that I'm nursing. These nursing pads do have a bit to be desired. In the past, they have leaked to the point where I'd wake up in the middle of the night with milk soaked both through these nursing pads and my shirt. However, those were rare incidents and for the most part these have been reliable.
