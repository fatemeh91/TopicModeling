review/text: Bought these for my 3-1/2 year old who is potty training at night. I love that they are washable and dryable. The material is very durable - heavy, which lies flat on the bed and will not likely roll, the backing will stick to most sheets so it doesn't slide when she moves. She didn't even realize it was there the first night. She woke up telling us she wet her bed. Her pajamas were wet, but the bed was dry! Even the mattress protector! It absorbed the liquid, amazing!
