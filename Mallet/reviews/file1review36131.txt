review/text: I didn't see any effect on my skin I have a horrible acne and I saw in the internet to drink some Vitamins A and E for my skin but I dink this thing every day with Vitamin A and C but I didn't see any result. If you guys want your acne to be gone you guys should take a Phantotenic acid (Vitamins B5) because that is the only product in world made my acne gone.
