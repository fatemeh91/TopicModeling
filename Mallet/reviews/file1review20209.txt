review/text: I had heard about some kind of juice being good for relieving gout symptoms, but I didn't follow up on it. Now the FDA has given one, and only one, pharmaceutical company the monopoly on colchicine and so the price is going up something like fifty fold. Yep, a ten cent pill will now cost five bucks. Colchicine is made from the ground up stamens of Autumn Crocus flowers and was first developed by the ancient Egyptians. People have been taking it for gout for centuries. Fooking FDA. Well, it turns out that it is black cherry juice that is good at relieving gout symptoms.There are several choices at Amazon, I think this one, the pint of concentrate from Dynamic Health for $7.63 is the best deal. I have a Vitamin Shoppe nearby that sells their house brand for the same amount and I believe that their's is made by Dynamic Health too. It's good stuff and I do believe it is helping with the gout. I've been drinking black cherry juice for a couple of weeks. I use two table spoons in 8 oz of water to make a glass.The first week I was drinking a couple of glasses a day, by the second week I'm down to a glass every couple of days. I haven't had any gout flares since I started drinking black cherry juice and I'm convinced it has helped. I still have a few aches that I know are gout related, but no flares. Now if I could cut back on beer and get some exercise even the aches might go away but......beer, mmmmm beer.Some people have said that they don't like the taste of this particular brand. Taste like cherries to me but if you want something that taste "better" that pretty much leaves Knudsen and that brand cost considerably more. As I stated above, I think that The Vitamin Shoppe brand is actually made by Dynamic Health. I give it 5 stars, Knudsen may taste better, but at this price this is a fine choice.
