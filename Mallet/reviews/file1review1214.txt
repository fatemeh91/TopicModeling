review/text: I've been a perio patient for a few years and my dentist and I have been working on 1 specific problem pocket area. I used the Brush Picks for about 2 weeks before my last check up and the measurements my hygienist takes between my teeth and gums that were terrible (high) numbers are now 2s and 3s (very normal range) - a huge improvement. During the first 2 weeks using the Brush Picks I was pulling out a lot of blood and gooey-looking stuff but that completely cleared up and now the Brush Picks come out clean.I highly recommend using these Brush Picks even if you have great gums and take good care of your teeth to help prevent becoming a perio patient like me. And, at this price, it's completely a no-brainer since taking care of your teeth is one of the best things you can do to improve your overall health.
