review/text: I bought this for my wife, and it is the best vibrator that we have found so far. The best parts are that it is wireless, and only uses one battery. However, it became a problem that it is so noisy, especially with a new battery. We live in in an apartment building and the noise can be a cause of concern if you do not wish to be overheard. Other than that it is very nice.
