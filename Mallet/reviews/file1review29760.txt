review/text: I purchased these pads thinking I would save money over the disposable. How wrong was I. I was fully aware of the bulkiness (visable through clothing) prior to purchase, so that wasn't the issue with me. I planned to wear them indoors only.These things don't even stop a minimal leak. They do not contour properly around the breast & slide especially when lying down. They also soak through onto my clothing. Maybe my minimal leaks are as someone else's moderate leaks. In either case, they don't suit me.The disposable avent, though as bulky at least absorb. I shouldn't have to change pads 6 times a day.For outside use, the Lansinoh brand disposable pads are MUCH better. They have greater surface area & can withstand actual leaks.If anyone can recommend a re-usable pad that acts like the disposable Lansinoh brand, please post.
