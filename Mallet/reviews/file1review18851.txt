review/text: I got this product because I heard it gives energy and can make hair grow.I take it in the morning and I do stay more alert and awake.As for the hair growth, idk yet. I just got a hair cut so I'll have to see.I think it's upsetting my stomach though. The taste isn't fruity. Kinda like medicine, but it's not too bad.I ordered it on Thursday and got it Monday morning! I'll just continue to take it. Can't go wrong with minerals right?
