review/text: We had a really hard time finding a seat that actually fit our son. By no means is he a large child, but apparently it is too much to ask for him to be able to use the bathroom (#1 or #2) without having to move forward or backward on the seat.Thankfully, this seat has a large enough hole that my 2 year old can comfortably sit without having to adjust.
