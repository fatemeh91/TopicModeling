review/text: Back in 2007, I finally got serious about my 251 pounds and decided to lose weight. lost 31 pounds in 3 months. But the pills should only be used as a suppliment to regualr diet and exercise. you MUST exercise and you MUST still diet, there is no magic pill.I could of lost weight by myself but these pills really did speed it up. The intruction says to take 6 pills total. Heck no! I only take 2 in the morning and if I'm serious in losing weight i may take 2 more for lunch. These pills are powerful and you will feel the effects in 15 minutes. Lots of energy and it noticeably curves your appetite. lost another 20 pounds in 2008 using these pills while in college. once I hit 200 pounds i seem to have lost my will to lose weight,so for the next 4 years i only use these rarely when i need to lose a quick 5 pounds or if I end up doing an all nighter playing games or something and I need a shot of energy in the morning to get to work.I've been using them for 5 years and even though I occasionally use them as an energy spike (instead of losing weight) I did not grow a dependence on them.If it is the first time you use them, you will have a jittering sensation, even if you just ate. It goes away on your 3rd taking. or 2nd if you've used them like i have and your body is more used to it.I buy the 84 capsule bottles since if im losing weight i only use 2-4 pills a day. meaning that's a 21 to 42 day supply. and they are cheaper at walgreens for some reason, $20.00 - maybe they have struck a deal or something.I also noticed a another side effect, I always seem to be in a especially good mood when I take them. This is true with coffee, people are less cranky, if not happy, when they've had thier coffee, taking two pills is equivalent to drinking 3 cups of coffee just so you know.Overall, 5 stars - They worked for me - but again, you MUST diet and exercise if you plan to lose weight, these pills DO work when you do it right.
