review/text: We were happy with this product while it worked. It was inexpensive, picked up food our toddlers dropped on the carpet quite well, and was quiet and convenient to use. However, the fact that it broke after 3 months doesn't make it seem worth it. We are now considering getting a quiet vacuum cleaner or higher quality carpet sweeper instead.
