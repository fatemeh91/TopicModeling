review/text: Having broken both ankles (the left one twice) I now wear braces on both ankles when I play tennis. On the left ankle I wear an older brace without the heel locking straps, and have found this quite successful in stabilizing my ankle. Since a recent right ankle fracture, I have been wearing the brace I'm now reviewing (the one with heel locking straps) on my right ankle, and have found it much more supportive and comfortable. I can recommend this product without reservation to protect against inversion/eversion injuries.
