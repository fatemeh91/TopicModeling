review/text: I loathe perfumey or floral or cloying air fresheners that just add stink upon the stink you are trying to eliminate. While working in the medical field, I ran across this product and have used it ever since. Might be a bit more expensive than the obnoxius, cheap stuff you get at the store, but this stuff WORKS... one little squirt usually does it. Smells clean - like soap... and then you smell NOTHING - no bad odor, no overbearing air freshener smell. I have used in the litterbox area, after cooking fish, etc. and it is great. Weirdly enough, have given it as a GIFT and people rave. Seriously good stuff!
