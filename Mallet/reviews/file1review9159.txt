review/text: This is extremely large, and the next size down is too small. It also seems to open "backwards" which makes it a little awkward. The covers on the individual compartments seem to be flimsy and they open too easily. I've had to put my chest into a gallon freezer bag so I don't spill my pills all over when I put the chest in my carry-on when traveling. I'm afraid they won't withstand much opening and closings.I do like the fact that I can remove each days row individually.I'm slightly disappointed in this item, but am in need of something that is large enough to handle the size of the pills I take.[ASIN:B000EGN1AG Apex Medi Chest Large]]
