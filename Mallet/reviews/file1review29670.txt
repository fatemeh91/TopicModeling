review/text: I received these pads as a gift and they do not work. I am thrilled with all of the other Avent products but these pads are horrible! I am considered a light flow and these pads DO NOT provide any type of absorbency! I would not recommend the washable pads to anyone. The disposable ones will provide much better protection than these will.
