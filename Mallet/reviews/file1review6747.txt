review/text: I have knots in my neck, upper back and scapula area that I just can't get rid off and bought this after reading an article about trigger points...muscles that have been in spasm so long they form knots. I've been diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome and use this every evening or morning after taking a hot bath and it helps to relive the pain temporarily. I have just begun medical treatment and I need other care to deal with the knots, but the Back Buddy has been a great adjunct.
