review/text: I was looking for anything to ease my pregnancy nausea. I read good reviews about these candies, so I promptly ordered them. Although they don't really take the nausea away, they do provide a somewhat soothing relief and take the edge off a bit. I've found that with my pregnancy sickness, I often get a yucky taste in my mouth after I eat, but chewing gum makes me feel even worse for some reason. These at least leave a pleasant taste in my mouth.
