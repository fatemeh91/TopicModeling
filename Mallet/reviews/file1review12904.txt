review/text: This mask is worthless if you plan on using it as a cooling mask. You can put it in the freezer for weeks and it will only stay just barely above room temperature for about ten minutes. Save your money. Buy a bag of frozen peas and put that on your eyes. Frozen peas are dirt cheap and they actually work at cooling hot fatigued eyes.
