review/text: I keep one of these in my car, one near the keyboard, one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom.I don't really consider myself a clean freak, but I like keeping my hands clean from all the gunk that collects on keyboards and cutting boards. Not the same as washing my hands, but it works here and there.Good stuff.
