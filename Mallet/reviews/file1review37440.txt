review/text: If you are like me and have coarser hair on your legs, this is not a great product. It does hurt like crazy the first few times, but you do get used to it and then it is no longer painful. The big issue for me is that I do not get those weeks of hairless legs and so I end up using it often. Not much better than shaving in that regard.
