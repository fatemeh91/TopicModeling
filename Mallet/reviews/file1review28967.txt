review/text: After many years of searching, I finally have found a razor that meets most of my criteria for a great razor. It is reasonably priced (around $60), it is cordless, it fits the hand nicely, it is light, it is easy to clean, it has a single curved screen, it gives a pretty good shave if you are in a hurry and will give a blade close shave without irritation if you are willing to spend a litle more time, it has a well fitted protective cover with slots to allow the head to dry after cleaning, and the replacement cutter and screen that are good for over a year of shaving will cost you around $20 bucks. This is an extremely well designed razor.
