review/text: I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Raynauds Syndrome and was suffering terribly this winter. These gloves are GREAT. They keep my hands warm in cold weather, and now in warmer weather the light compression feels so good when my hands are hurting and sore. I recommend these to anyone whose hands hurt from arthritis. The compression took a little getting used to; I initially thought I needed a larger size. But perhaps they stretched out a bit because now they fit very well, but still snug, and my hands are still swollen just as much. Now I need the same type of thing for my feet!FYI, these gloves are similar to neoprene, with two layers of stretch fabric. There is no raveling at the edges and the seams are placed where they won't irritate tender knuckles or wrist joints. The outer fabric is covered with little gripper bumps that is very helpful when holding items such as cups - nonslip and doesn't take much pressure to hold onto things (for those of us with limited grip strength this is super).
