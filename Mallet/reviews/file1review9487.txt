review/text: I have been wet shaving for some time now. I thought I had the best shaving soap, I was wrong. This was a bit pricey but I thought I would give it a try due to reviews on other sights. I am sold!! WOW, Best lather, and shave I have ever had. I have never used an electric razer and this is the best product I have used in 25 years of shaving! Bite the bullet and buy some to try!
