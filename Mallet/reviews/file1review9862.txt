review/text: Might be a great product. I can't be sure. Because, uh...hello?...mine didn't come with any instructions whatsover.I opened it up and I was like, "ah...hello? Where are the instructions?" But the Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze did not answer my questions.If anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions, I would greatly appreciate it. Until then my Tweezerman Ingrown Hair Splintertweeze is just gonna sit there, not being used, like my box of floss, a bag of onions, and my heart.
