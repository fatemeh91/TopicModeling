review/text: I purchased this to replace one that my husband had for over 5 years. He not only used it to shave his beard & mustache, he also used it to cut his hair. We had another trimmer to trim his hair but he felt like this trimmer did it even better. The old one worked fine but it was no longer able to be charged so that's why I bought this new one and it works equally as good. My husband is very pleased with this product and for the money you can't beat it.
