review/text: Not for people who have high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, etc.Dumb me, should have researched this product before I purchased it. I have high blood pressure and am on medication for it. I couldn't figure out why I would start getting heart palpitations after about 30 minutes after I drank it. After going to the doctor, I was told, liquorice extract and high blood pressure don't mix.Some licorice that has the active ingredient of glycyrrhiza, which raises blood pressure (which this product must have,) because of my blood pressure rising, should never be taken. Now there is another type of licorice, called DGL or deglycyrrhizinated licorice, it doesn't seem to have the same side effects, then it might be okay, from what I've researched. Liquorice also makes you retain water, and lowers your potassium levels, which people with high blood pressure need.... potassium!Email me if you want the website link, I don't think Amazon allows it.I found this review from another website regarding this product, after coming back from the doctor, so do your own research.*************************************************************Smooth Move Tea, and other Smooth Move products, contain a dangerous combination of ingredients. When Senna and Licorice Root are taken together, dieters and consumers can experience heart problems, increase blood pressure, impaired kidney function, impaired function of muscles and nerves. No weight loss or laxative supplement is worth taking if the combination of ingredients can lead to serious health risks. Senna is also linked to dependence, which is another reason to stay away from Smooth Move Tea.
