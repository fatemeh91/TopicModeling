review/text: I have lupus, and cleaning is a challenge for me. Bending, scrubbing, elbow-greasing just doesn't happen that often for me. Even if I could still do it, I'm not sure I would want to anymore, because I'm pretty sure I'm also lazier than I used to be. But I still want things to be clean.I used to use another daily shower cleaner, but I stopped, because I didn't know what was in it. The stuff stays there until you get into the shower with it and turn on the water. Nowadays, there are corporate good citizen sites you can check to find out what's in that stuff and how well the company that makes it treats its employees, etc.It turns out that the stuff I was using was nontoxic after all. But the Method shower cleaner has nothing whatsoever that's problematic for the environment or for people. The good citizen score is stellar, both in terms of environmental performance and in terms of social performance. And it costs the same as the other stuff (which is made by a company that has a shockingly poor workplace record).However, because I am lazy and lie things clean, the other company's poor treatment of its employees would not be enough to make me use this stuff if this stuff didn't work. It works great. My husband is the soap scummiest showerer on the planet, and my son acts like it's his bounden duty to bring all of the dirt from outside the house to inside the bathtub.My tub is clean. It smells pretty good, too.
