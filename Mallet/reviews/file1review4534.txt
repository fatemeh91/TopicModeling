review/text: I always hated disposables and would just get whatever costco had when I needed a new razor since the replacement blades are so expensive. I have been using a mach 3 for years and liked it very much but when I tried this razor it gave me a better shave, no irritation on my very sensitive skin, and a quicker shave (especially than my merkur) it quickly became my favorite razor.
