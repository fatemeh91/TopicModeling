review/text: My old, brand X, water flosser died after about 5 years of near daily use. I bought this Waterpik to suppliment my daily routine of manual flossing + waterpik + brush after every meal. I love the way it pulses and cleans stuff out that is trapped between your teeth. My old flosser did not work very well, even when it was new - but I didn't know it until I bought this unit to replace it. It pays to stay with the name brand, Waterpik.
