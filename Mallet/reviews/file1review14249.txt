review/text: My husband was undergoing intensive inpatient rehab for quadriplegia and while at the rehab hospital was started on this product to give him extra calories (he's tall and skinny) to improve his weight and help prevent skin breakdown. He enjoyed the Peach flavored Enlive so much that when he came home we started ordering it for him and he drinks 2 a day and it helps him maintain his weight.
