review/text: We used their dish gel for a few years but I recently switched to the powder after reading what Consumer Reports said about gels not being as effective and they rated 7th Generations powder as excellent...it's awesome!! It rinses away really clean and it works wonders when used with vinegar in your rinse aid dispenser, no spots anywhere! No pollution indoors or out either. Terrific value here on amazon, we combine it with our baby wipe order to get the free shipping.
