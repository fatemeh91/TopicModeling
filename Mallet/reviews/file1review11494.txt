review/text: I have used this trimmer for about 3 years now. The motor continues to sound powerful but cutting capability definitely seems to have diminished. I am thinking that it is owing to the fact that there is build up of hair inside of the trimmer. There is no separate pouch that holds cut hair so you will need to clean up after you are done. I use it once or twice a week and, at that rate, it needs to be charged once every 3 to 4 months or so.
