review/text: This item is not for me. I am a small framed person expecting twins. I also work full time outside the home and was advised to purchase this product to help me make it to my due date and still work. I have been experiencing a lot of pressure in my tail bone and was anxious to receive this item. There were no directions as to how to put it on so I winged it. Once I latched the hooks together it kept sliding over belly and i was constantly pulling it back down. No relief was felt at all with this product and I ended up returning it. It wasn't for me.
