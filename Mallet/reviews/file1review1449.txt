review/text: The good thing about the shipping was it was fast... other than that...The column of the scale was pretty badly mangled when it arrived. The draft rod was bowed and rammed into the assembly of the balance arm. A few of the metal parts of the weighing mechanism seemed at odd angles and pretty torqued. A call to customer service wasn't answered so I tried to figure out how to fix it but ended up just horsing on it with pliers until it broke loose. The screw holes didn't quite match up (before the horsing too). I'm not sure if it could pass a US Standards and Measures inspection right now, but it appears to be functioning with unknown accuracy. I'll try to email to find out but I'm not expecting much help. It also had a slip that said it passed inspection by two individuals. I'm not sure how they inspect their product but it obviously didn't include making sure the balance arm/dectector rod moved freely. I don't think I would buy anything from this company again since I feel they goofed up the product by packaging. It must have taken lots of pressure to ram the rod into the assembly that deeply.
