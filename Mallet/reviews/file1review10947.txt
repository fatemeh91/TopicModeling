review/text: I'm an older guy with a light complexion living in the Sunshine state. My skin was getting pretty discolored by age and the sun. I gave this product a try and have been very impressed with the results. My skin has a smoother appearance, with significantly less sun coloration. It weird to say it, but there is a certain "glow" to my skin that I haven't seen in years. Now is maybe the right time to say I never write reviews of any product for a lot of reasons. However, I have been significantly impressed with this product. I'd like to say it makes me look younger, but I'm hoping not to be too vain. Let's live it that there is a definite improvement in my facial skin! It has changed my facial skin tone and I do feel better using this product.
