review/text: My dentist recommended this toothbrush for problems with my gums. Use of the Oral B Sonic Complete has improved the health of my gums and my teeth have never felt cleaner. I love the feature that tells you when to switch to the next quarter of your mouth. When I first used it, I used the mid setting but now use the high setting. The massage feature is also nice. My husband and I both use the toothbrush.
