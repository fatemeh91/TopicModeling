review/text: ON is one of the few brands that I am not afraid to buy from and I am very picky when it comes to buying supplements. The taste ranks higher on terms of &#34;drinkability&#34; however it can be bland time to time but nevertheless it tastes decent. You get a good percentage of whey which is always a good thing. Decent taste, cheaper than most brands, reliable.
