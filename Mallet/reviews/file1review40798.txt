review/text: When I first saw this product, I thought it was a waste; as shaving using cream isn't difficult as the advirtisements suggest. Just in late spring, however, my skin started to become very irritated by my Venus and normal sensitive skin shaving cream. I picked up this razor, and haven't had any problems since. It is gentle on the skin, and gives a smooth shave every time, and the cartridges last a long time.
