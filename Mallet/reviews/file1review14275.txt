review/text: I received the Scrubbing Bubbles Automatic Shower Cleaner as a Christmas Gift and have used it for about a month and a half now. However invented this machine was a genius. It works really well and I have already noticed a huge improvement in the cleanliness of our shower. It not only maintains a clean shower but it removes stains that wouldn't even come off with a normal scrubbing. No more mildew or soap residue. So far I have had no problem with the unit. If you use it once a day the solution should last about a month.
