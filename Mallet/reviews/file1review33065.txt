review/text: This seems to work if you start getting the scratchy throat & feel a cold coming on. I don't like the dosing- you have to take A LOT of capsules, even when you are doing "health maintenance". Then I burp the stuff up the rest of the day. As I said, I do feel like I've stopped a cold in its tracks with the Wellness Formula.
