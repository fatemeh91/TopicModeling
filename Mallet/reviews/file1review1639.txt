review/text: Our nurse practitioner at out Pede's office suggested this stick. It is the best wart remover ever. It does not stink! It is not messy! Use this with some duct tape twice a day and the warts are gone quickly. I had a wart on and off for two years. Nothing worked! I got the wart stick and duct tape and 2 week later it was gone and months later has never came back.
