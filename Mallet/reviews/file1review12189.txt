review/text: I'm new to this prenatal vitamin thing-- hubs and I are planning to start TTC this summer. So far, I'm loving that I can take these without food, the price is nice, and it's great not having to down 8 pills a day. I feel confident I'm getting the nutrients I need to create a nice little oven for whatever bun comes my way.
