review/text: You do not need to dissolve the powder. Just stir it around in just enough water to quickly suspend it, and chug it down. It goes down easy and, by NOT being dissolved, you get away from much of the bad taste. (After all, if you were taking a capsule, you'd be swallowing the dry powder encased in the capsule.)
