review/text: The Balance Bar seemed better than other nutrition/breakfast bars I have had in the past. The flavor wasn't over-powering and it didn't leave an aftertaste. The bar had 14 grams of protein and did seem to stave off my late afternoon hunger pains. There's not anything that I didn't like about the bar. I would probably pick this bar over others now that I have tried it.
