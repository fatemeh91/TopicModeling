review/text: We bought this because we lived in an apt. and needed something that wasn't bulky. The price was right at the time as well. Now that I will be using it for a second child, I am reconsidering the purchase. My first daughter was always frigid in the tub because the spongy stuff on the back got wet and cold. It doesn't really have any of the bells and whistles of the other tubs and no hammock for smaller newborns. My daughter didn't use it long before we gave up and I just bathed her with me. Spend the extra money and deal with the bulk.
