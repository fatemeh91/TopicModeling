review/text: I have been using this product every week. It is fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it. True...accuracy depends of the person taking the measurements. What is important is to be consistent in the way the measurements are taken.As far as the results shown, they can vary for other devices and you should always have in mind a +- 3% body fat range when looking at the fat % shown by the device.
