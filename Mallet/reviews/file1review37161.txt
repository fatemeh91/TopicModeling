review/text: So I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus and my hands are very badly swollen and ....well, let's just say jacked up. SO they hurt, and are starting to claw. I wanted something that wasn't the painful hard braces.My husband measured my hands according to the measuring chart. My was 7 inches which means I'm a small size. SO what did I do? I ordered a medium for some stupid reason. No biggie. Returned them and reordered the smaller size so if you do have to return them for different size then it is no hassle.What this did teach me though is that the size chart is true to fit. So follow it. You measure around your first knuckles *which are the knuckles that attach to your palm*. What you want is a nice snug fit, but you don't want it really tight so it is uncomfortable. You don't want it to hurt.Also, try to take your rings off if possible as it makes the gloves fit so much better. I know sometimes that's not possible with swollen fingers.So follow the size chart andI think you will find they are very comfortable and they look nice. They don't look like ace bandages.
