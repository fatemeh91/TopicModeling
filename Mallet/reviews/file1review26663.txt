review/text: What a disappointment. I followed instructions and used as directed, but it has a slow leak. I submerged it underwater to search for a puncture, but could not even find the leak--that's how slow the leak is. I reinflated about every 2-3 days at first, then it would not even stay inflated for a full day, so I'm returning it. I wish I knew why it's leaking air, but maybe it's the entire product.
