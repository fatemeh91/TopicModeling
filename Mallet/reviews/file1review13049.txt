review/text: I've owned my elasto gel cervical and lumbar pieces for 10 years and they are still as effective as they were when I purchased them. I'm disabled from failed spine surgery. I love the heat wraps sold in the stores but sometimes I don't need 8 hours of heat. I can toss these in the micro again and again. If I'm very stressed ( I also have FMS ) I can slip a scented fabric softener sheet between the cover and the gel and get a little aromatherapy along with the heat! Hats off to elasto gel for their fine product. My next purchase will be the cranial cap for my migraines.
