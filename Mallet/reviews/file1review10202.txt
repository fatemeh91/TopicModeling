review/text: I purchased this item as a daily special and got it for a great price. The batteries came in with an expiration date of 2013 so they have life in them for a few more years. So far so good :)We have little ones with toys that seem to all require batteries so it was nice to find this deal.Shipped fast and in good condition.Would recommend to others!
