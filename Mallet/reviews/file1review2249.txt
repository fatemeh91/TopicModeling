review/text: For years and years I used some variation of the Gillette Trac 2. These blades gave me a decent shave, and I had no real reason to complain.I don't remember when I first started using Gillette Mach 3, but I could definitely tell the difference from the first shave. My first impression was that this blade is amazing! I remember how the first time I dragged it across my face I could barely feel it. It was much smoother than any other razor I'd ever used before. Not only was it a smooth shave, but it cleanly took off all my whiskers and did so more perfectly than the Trac 2.I've noticed, however, that it doesn't take that long before the shave isn't quite as smooth and close as it was at first. And then the blades seem to go into a mode where they give a decent shave for a long time. And then, at some point, I realize it's just not doing the job anymore, and I put in a new blade.I've never had any problems with the handle, and I've been using the first one I got for years now with no complaints. I solve the price problem of the replacement blades by buying them in bulk on either Ebay or Amazon. I try to get them for under $2 per cartridge if I can.There may be better razors or blades out there, but I'm content enough with the Mach 3 that I've stocked up on enough to last me for years!
