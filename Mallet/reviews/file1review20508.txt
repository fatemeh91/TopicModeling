review/text: This pad fits perfectly into my daughters diaper bag. So when we're out and she needs her diaper to be changed, I just put this down ontop of the table to change her. Don't listen to the bad reviews given about how it leaks through. If you know how to change a diaper, your baby can't leak through the pad, because there is always a diaper underneath her.
