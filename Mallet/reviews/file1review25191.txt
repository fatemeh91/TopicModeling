review/text: Please be aware that this tooth powder contains no flouride which is essential to healthy teeth, and, is abrasive to the teeth. Each dental patient who uses this product is experiencing long term tooth and gum damage.My first question is: Why use a product which contains no flouride which is essential? The reviewer who said we get plenty of flouride from our "poisoned drinking water" is wrong. For example, here is Florida we have some of the finest, healthiest, and well-balanced drinking water in the country. Please do NOT trash our nation's drinking water which flows abundantly, cheaply, and is safe. Many countries have no such luxury while we just turn on the faucets in our homes! Be grateful for what our nation provides us--yes, even clean drinking water from the tap!!My second question is: WHO uses TOOTH POWDER anymore? These products go back to the turn of the 20th century! Get real and get modern. I am aware that people mix Eco-Dent with Arm & Hammer Baking Soda as their daily teeth and gum cleaning routine. It does NOT work, and the Eco-Dent works as an abrasive. Further, baking soda is not a healthy alternative for cleaning teeth as it also contains no flouride.You may want to stick to Arm & Hammer Baking Soda for just that, baking, or, it works very well in the refrigerator to absorb bad odors.
