review/text: I love tablets so I can break them into smaller dose and use as needed. Low zinc can cause high cholesterol so I take about 1/4-1/2 the tablet several times a week. I am diabetic and I have high cholesterol so I did some research on it. My skin looks and feels better because they were ashy, flaky and looked terribly unhealthy. You can also take hair and nail supplements and should do equavelant. Make sure you don't take it with some of the other supplements ( I can't remember which ones) so do your research, but it can hinder the zinc from absorbing. Good luck.
