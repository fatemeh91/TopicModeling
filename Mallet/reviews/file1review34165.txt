review/text: I don't know how to say it any other way: This stuff works in a way that seems impossible.I can tell you this.. Nothing, NOTHING works like this product! It soothes and it shrinks to the point where I can carry on with my life instead of my thoughts being so, well, anal-centric constantly. It was ruining my life. I've tried all the over-the-counter products, and even tried the "crystal-method" and none did a damn thing for me.I had never needed a product like this until recently, but I'm guessing that in the pre-Meth-Lab days, all butt-creams worked this well. But that was before they took out the good, effective chemicals (pseudoephedrine, etc.) I don't know.All I know is that THIS STUFF DOES THE JOB WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED. Buy it and get on with your life!Here's a tip: Cut the fingers off a disposable latex and you have five easy one-finger applicators. Putting it on directly is the very best way, and not too much of it...
