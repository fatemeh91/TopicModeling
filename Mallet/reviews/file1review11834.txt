review/text: When my doctor recommended a high protein drink to aid my recovery from a surgical incision which was slow in healing (I'm diabetic), a nurse friend sent me a whole jug of Chocolate flavored Champion Nutrition Pure Whey Stack from Amazon. It did the trick, healing my incision, and I continue to use it as a supplement to my food intake daily. I find it satisfies that need for something sweet in the middle of the afternoon, without going overboard. I found it to be easily dissolved in ice water, no mess--just shake in a shaker and drink from shaker--available in different flavors (I've used Cookies & Cream as well as Chocolate and like them both), and it's also available in individual packets from Amazon, so can be carried in your purse. I live alone and do little or no cooking. I find this product assures that I get some protein every day, no matter what else I do or do not eat. Thanks, Amazon, for a great product!
