review/text: The other reviewers here have either ingested large amounts of this deodorant or have been planted by the vendor. While this product is effective at keeping odor and sweat at bay, it still leaves behind an annoying white residue that looks bad when it dries on clothing. There is a method of avoiding the white streaks that I have devised, and it involves pulling the bottom portion of your shirt forward and deftly maneuvering the deodorant upward through the resulting shirt tunnel, finally making contact at one's armpits. Basically, applying it after--not before--equipping your shirt. I still use it consistently only because it is available at a store that is located minutes from my house and always has them on sale.
