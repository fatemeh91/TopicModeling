review/text: Pros: It seems to be fairy accurate. Much better than a wrist or finger monitor. It's easy to use - put it on then push one button. It takes arrithmia into account when it checks presssure.Cons: It's big and somewhat clumsy. There's no explanation as to why it should be worn differently on right arm vs. left arm.
