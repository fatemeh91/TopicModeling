review/text: I have been taking these vitamins for about 20 years. Several times I have tried others in an attempt to save money, but I always come back. They are pretty much the only ones I can take that don't give me nasty vitamin burps. They give me a huge amount of energy. I guess I will keep taking them unless I find something better but so far, I haven't found anything even close. I can definitely feel the difference when I stop taking them. Amazon offers them from several sellers, be sure you get them direct from Amazon (in spite of the fact that they may be a dollar or 2 more sometimes, the prices fluctuate). Once I ordered from a non-amazon source and they were extremely aged (the pills should be shiny, dark green, and tightly compacted. If they're dull, medium green and the outside coating is slightly flaky, they're old).
