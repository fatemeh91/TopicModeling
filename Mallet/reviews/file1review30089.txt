review/text: As compared to a neck pillow filled with loose buckwheat & the same scents mixed in, this pillow's heat lasts quite a long time (about 1.5 hrs when leaning on back, 45 min. when used on neck/shoulders/upper back). The buckwheat/rice are stuffed securely, so they don't slip & slide around when you want the heat in a certain place. The scents come from a small cloth sachet inside the smaller heart, which is good for when you don't want the aromatherapy on occasion. The cover is removable--good for lysol-ing or handwashing.
