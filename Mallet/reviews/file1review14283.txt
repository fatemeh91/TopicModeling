review/text: I am part of a promotional program called BZZ Agent where we try products and then tell people about them. I love this product. It is amazing. It cleans my shower, it takes no time, and it smells DIVINE. I went out and bought a second one for my other shower. I will gladly give someone the $5 it takes to buy a refill to clean my shower. Everyone in my house thinks it is amazing too. I hate cleaning my bathroom and this has made my chore-time so much easier. I wish they made a huge one for my kitchen!
