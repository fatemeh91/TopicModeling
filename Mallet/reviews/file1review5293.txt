review/text: I'm pregnant with my second baby and my friend sent me a bag of the Gin Gins hard candy as a gift. I was hesitant to try them, especially as my stomach was turning. But I did, and I'm SO glad I did! They worked almost instantly to settle my stomach and the nausea completely disappeared! WONDERFUL! I'm going to invest in cases of these for the next three months!!!
