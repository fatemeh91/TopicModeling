review/text: The only reason why this is not 5 stars is that I wish it lasted even longer. I am keeping little pebbles of this stuff just for the scent. It just makes me happy! My children both love getting massages with this as well as the Sleepy Head massage Bar and so do I. I also just use them for their amazingly effective aromatherapy. Lush is not a product that can be copied alas, so save your pennies and keep buying the stuff. I have never seen another massage bar besides this one that lives up to its name, and it is so good for your skin. Better than real therapy for sure.
