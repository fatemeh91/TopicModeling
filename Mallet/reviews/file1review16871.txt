review/text: My kids love Pampers Kandoo Foam Handsoap. It's easy to rinse off so save for little kids (2-3 year-old) to use. My kids are 6 and 8 now and they just don't want to quit this. I am so happy to find this refills on Amazon. I only saw Kandoo Foam Hansoap refills at Target but much pricier. It saves a lot of money than buying the regular bottle with pump.
