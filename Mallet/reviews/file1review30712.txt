review/text: Last year I finally got fed up with paying extortion prices to Gillette. I tried an electric razor for about a month and that sucked (Braun). So next step I decided to try wet shaving. Purchased this razor, some blades, a cheap badger brush, and some shaving cream (Taylor of Old Bond Street).Everything has worked out great. I have a giant beard that grows quickly. I often skip a week or so of shaving and have no problem cutting it down with this setup (cuts through the beard without pulling). Best shave I've every gotten and I wish I'd started this sooner.I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing all this stuff, but it has worked out great. Took about a week of shaving to get adjusted, and after that not much of a problem. Just take it slow and check out some of the sites online dedicated to wet shaving for tips.If you're contemplating make the jump, do it! You will save money in the long run at the expense of about 5 minutes per shave.I have dropped this razor without issue. I have used it exclusively since November 2009. I can only compare it to the cartridge razors I used before. This has a much heavier feel. I cannot compare to other safety razors though. This is the only one I've owned, and may be the only one I'll ever need.Only problem I have ever had was the occasional clog. Crank the water up or unscrew the bottom 1 turn and it's gone. This is probably not normal though. As I said earlier I sometimes skip a week or two of shaving and my nick name in high school was Teen Wolf.
