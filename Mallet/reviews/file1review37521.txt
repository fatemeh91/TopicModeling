review/text: POOR design has no padding on the tracks that support the massage mechanism. This actually makes the chair PAINFUL to sit in. Locks are poorly designed, causing the chair to lurch suddenly.the plastic tracks supporting the mechanism broke within 9 months. Spend a little more money and get a REAL massage chair! It literally fell apart.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
