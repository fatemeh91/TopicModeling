review/text: I read the reviews before purchasing this. I saw that some got relief and some did not. But, I was in such pain, I was willing to try anything.This product did nothing for me. It wasn't even as soothing as the lavender oil I had been using.'Makes me wonder if the people who wrote the positive reviews don't have something to gain from the sale of this product. It's unfortunate...but anyone can write a review.I used the entire 1.4 ounce container in four days. The only relief it provided was the coolness during application. I'm sure the aloe was somewhat beneficial. Save your money. Buy some lavender oil and some ranunculus bulbosus, which is a homeopathic remedy for shingles.If you're reading this, you're probably experiencing a lot of pain from shingles. This product does NOTHING to relieve the pain!
