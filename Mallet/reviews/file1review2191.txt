review/text: I bought this after looking at the description hoping that this will be the answer for ease my neck pain. Unfortunately, It did not. I tried both Hot & cold therapy using this. Neither is effective. First, the collar does not fit properly around your neck (for an average sized person).Second, Even after you strap the collar you cannot feel the Heat/Cold that much. Then i found out that the collar is not touching the skin on the sides of the neck. Also, the heat or cold lasts only very few minutes (Max. 5). Overall, I'm very disappointed. Definitely, not worth the money. My Drugstore Cold pack was much more effective.
