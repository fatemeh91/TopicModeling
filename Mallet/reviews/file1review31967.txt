review/text: The stuff is as good for you as it is bad to taste. You will not find it easy to swallow, unless you find a way to make it taste better. It's gross... Just a forewarning. But, seriously... how many people actually like what is good for them? Vegetables for instance... great for you, but only if you can manage to get it down in the first place. Otherwise, I'm tempted to feed this stuff to my guinea pigs... I'm sure, as herbivores they will find the stuff rather tasty!
