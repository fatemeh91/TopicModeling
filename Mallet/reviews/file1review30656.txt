review/text: this is the razor you should start with if you're new to double edge shaving. an inexpensive pack of merkur razors, and some good shave soap.a thing newcomers may find our quickly is that this razor absolutely devours facial hair. dont press down as you would a mach three, or disposable, as you're working with the sheer face of a real razor against your skin. i havent found a beard thick enough to clog it yet.blades are remarkably inexpensive, and extremely sharp!
