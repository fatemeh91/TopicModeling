review/text: I agree with the person who wrote the very long review about it. Try starting to lose weight with something else. I'll tell you why.I personally need to lose over 50 lbs, I started with this, and have lost NO WEIGHT!!! Maybe for some people it does work, but not for me. I didnt exercise with it so maybe thats why it didnt work, thats why I gave it two stars.But the REAL POINT of my review, is that they specifically say to take these and you dont need diet and exercise, well they are totally MISLEADING!! I guess I should have used COMMON SENSE to realize you always need diet and exercise to lose weight.But I might go try XENADRINE!! Cause I have used that in the past and lost over 35lbs, I will go with what I know works.
