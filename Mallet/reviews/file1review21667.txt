review/text: My son is approaching 40 lbs, and while he does fit into the tub easily, he is pretty rough. As a result, the last two of these tubs I ordered lasted about a week before they started leaking air. When he was smaller, and less rough, the tub lasted several months of daily use. A great product for small kids.
