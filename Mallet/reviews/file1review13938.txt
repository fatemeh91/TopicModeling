review/text: I have been using this since high school. I have about every flavor. This stuff is great because it has a fun scent and it keeps my lips from getting chapped. I also like the ones with sparkles because I can wear it when I'm dressed up or just in jeans and a t-shirt.This one is my friend's favorite flavor. Mine is vanilla.The rest of the Bonne Bell line of make-up is great, too. I use the foundation, Lip Flips and Roll-On Lip Gloss on a a daily basis.This made a great gift for my then 12-year-old sister. It is a great age appropriate make-up. It isn't to dark, so she is learning how less is more with putting on her make-up.
