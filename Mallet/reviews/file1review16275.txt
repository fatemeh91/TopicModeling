review/text: This is my detergent of choice for my Bosch dishwasher. They leave the dishes wonderfully clean without any spots or streaks at all. The smell is pleasant and undetectable to me after the cycle and I don't know why it would bother anyone. I have a Bosch dishwasher that ordinarily requires a separate rinse agent with regular Finish detergent and this Powerball does it all without the need for that extra rinse, which I found to be expensive and a pain as it would run out and I would have to refill all the time. I only buy Finish Powerballs now because they work perfectly. And you can get them in bulkier sizes on Amazon that are more cost effective than at the store. I have added them to my subscribe and save. Highly recommend.
