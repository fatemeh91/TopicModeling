review/text: My wife and I both use these razors, and we both love them (I for my face and she for her legs, in case you were wondering). Women's razor cartridges never seem to be very good, according to my wife, so she tried using mine and much preferrs it. She said it shaves smoother and the blades last longer.don't bother with the powered razor, this works just fine
