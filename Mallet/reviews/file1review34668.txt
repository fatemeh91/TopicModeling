review/text: Although I love coconut oil and know of all the benficial ways to use it, this coconut oil tastes too coconutty for me. I have to agree with other reviewers in that the smell is so strong it almost seems like an artificial scent. I dont mind coconut flavor and scents but this is almost too much. It almost makes me gag. I'll be going with Nutiva next time.
