review/text: This may cause some stomach upset at first. I drink it first thing in the morning and wait a good hour before I eat anything. Ideally if I wake before dawn I will shuffle into the kitchen for some and then go back to bed while it gurgles through my system. I definitely feel better in many ways after a few days on this. I am grateful for this product.
