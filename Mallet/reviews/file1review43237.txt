review/text: I have been using this product for almost a year. I drink it for breakfast almost every single day. Half of pack at the time (it tastes as good as the whole pack with half the calories and will last twice as much...) The following is the recipe I use every day: 1. Half of pack(4.5 tbs of mix) 2. One small Banana. 3. 1tbs of instant coffee. 4. One tbs. of "Naturally More" peanut butter. 5. Two handfuls of ice. 6. Fat Free skim milk (for a little thickness fill to 12oz on blender) 7. Water, fill to 24oz. 8. Blend on High for 1 min. 9. Enjoy. 10. Ad ice or water accordingly for thickness preference.The Vanilla one is also excellent. Mix some mixed berries or anything you like... Is delicious.The Vanilla one is also excellent. Mix some mixed berries or anything you like... Is delicious.
