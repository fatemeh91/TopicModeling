review/text: I have had this monitor for about a month now and I like it. It comes with a nice case and is easy to store beside my computer. I have compared the readings to other BP monitors and it is accurate. If you want convenience, I would recommend this monitor. I have a strong paulse so maybe that is why the readings are accurate. If you paulse is weak, perhaps it would not work quite as well but that is probably true for all electronic BP machines unless you purchase one of those expensive hospital kind. The numbers are easy to read and it also stores previous readings so you can go back and review you old reading.
