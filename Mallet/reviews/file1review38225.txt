review/text: I have been taking metamucil for years and got tired of taking the extra sugar, I bought both this powder and the whole husk. I was having the whole husk by popping a spoon full of husk in my mouth and drinking water. I take 6 spoons every night. I tried the same with this and nearly choked on the dry powder after the second spoon, this thing expands quite fast and also sticks to your mouth. It took me hours to partially clean my mouth off this sticky powder. I am going back to the whole husk till I figure out a better way to consume this.
