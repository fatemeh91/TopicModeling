review/text: I use this product all the time. I only gave 4 stars because a few years ago I noticed a change in the way it reacted with my body. Loud gurgles started happening that could be heard from across the room. Never did this before, so I looked at the bottle and noticed the lable was different. So I compared the ingredients with an older one I had and noticed they were not exactly the same. When I called Oxy-Powder they said nothing had changed. So now I try to live with the LOUD Gurgles from within me, and sometimes giggles of small children.....So, it works- Just liked it better without the noises.
