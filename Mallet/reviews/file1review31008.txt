review/text: My doctor recommened 2 brands for my osteoarthritis, this being one of them. It really does work for me, without it my fingers would be throbbing with pain and i would not be typing this review. I still need to take an occasional anti-inflammatory, but Osteo Biflex have really made a difference in my life.
