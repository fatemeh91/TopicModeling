review/text: I generally get Muscle Milk Chocolate, and thought I'd try something different. Its a much bigger box, lots more servings in the box, but I can't stand the taste..also the drink mix is very liquidy and leaves an almost aweful smell in the shaker sometime even after its washed.I used maybe 1/4th of it to make shakes, and now its just lying in storage and I'm back on muscle milk.Compared to 2-3 scoops in a serving when using muscle milk, this one is 1 scoop a serving. That makes the drink less thick.Just wanted to share what I thought about this product.
