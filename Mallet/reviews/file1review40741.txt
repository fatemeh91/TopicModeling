review/text: This gentle lotion with its pleasant aroma serves many purposes. It is good for smoothing skin; acting as a stress buster and softening your skin. It is ideal if you have corns and calluses. Just use a little bit and it will treat your skin as gently as a well fitted glove. Add to it is that it is reasonably priced and you will get your money's worth each time you use this.
