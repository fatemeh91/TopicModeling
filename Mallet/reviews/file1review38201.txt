review/text: This product works very well and I am very pleased. I have constanly had dry, rough heels for years. This extaordniary foot cream doesn't even require you to scrub your feet to notice smoother feet overnight. Make sure that your feet are clean then apply a generous amount of product and rub in well. I also suggest putting on a thick pair of socks to sleep in. When you wake up in the morning, your heels and feet are much softer. I will proudly recommend this product. (P.S. if u want post pedicure feet than purchase the entire Dr. Scholl's pedicre Essentials line that includes a foot soak, an electronic buffer, and cream. Talk about soft feet!!!)
