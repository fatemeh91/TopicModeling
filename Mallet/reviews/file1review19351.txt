review/text: I have twin boys who like to take their diapers off once in a while. They outgrew their crib so I got them a twin size bed, since they're so used to sleeping together. I needed something that would hold twice the accidents. This mattress cover is great! so great I bought another one. The mattress still looks like new. Washing it is not a problem. Although I recommend drying with no heat, it will last longer.
