review/text: I just bought these and have been using them for a few weeks. They work well for moderate leakage--too light and they stick, too heavy and they leak. This is comparable to other washable pads I've used, however. I like the lace--it does help prevent slipping. They pads show a bit more through tight clothing (like a nursing tank) but not terrible like bulkier pads. All in all, I prefer the Nuk washable ones simply because they are less expensive and do not show quite as much.
