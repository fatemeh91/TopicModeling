review/text: Heating for 2 minutes made this warm but not very warm. So i heated it for 3 minutes and it must have toasted the herbs inside. Now it stinks of burnt toast and the smell will not go away. I have other heat pads/bags which can be heated for this long and do not emit a burnt smell. Very disappointing.
