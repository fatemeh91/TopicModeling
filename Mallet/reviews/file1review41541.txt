review/text: This is my first real electronic brush. After purchasing it and using it for about a week, I can feel a significant improvement of my tooth cleanness and my gum health, it is definitely well worth the price. I bought a really cheap ($10) electronic tooth brush (more of a vibrating tooth brush) before, and that cheap piece of crap is no where close to the performance of Oral-B Triumph. My friend have an older oral-b electronic brush that lasted him for 4 years, I believe my Oral-B Triumph will last me as long. Highly recommended.
