review/text: I have found these to work extremely well. I am happy to have found them here as I can no longer find them in the stores. Just 2 days ago I had my brows waxed professionally and they didn't do nearly as good a job as I have done myself with these strips. I also still have bumps and redness from the professional job and none of that with these strips. These strips wisk off every single bit of hair that I want removed quickly and with no pain or bumps. Inexpensive beauty!Safe to say I adore this product and have never had an issue with them not working though one must know how to use them and a couple of tries will be needed if you've never used them to acquire your desired shape. Then, it's off and running to beautiful brows effortlessly, pain free, bumpless and bat those eyes!
