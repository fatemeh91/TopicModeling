review/text: At the first sign of a cough, I give my daughter about 1/2 tsp of the bronchial soothe. The dosage for her age is actually 1 tsp. I've found that 1/2 tsp for her is enough. By the next day the cough has gone away. We discovered that with my daughter that if we caught her cough early enough, it didn't have a chance to develop into something more serious. Bronchial soothe has been a great solution to stopping the cough before it has a chance to become something requiring stronger prescription medicine.The bronchial soothe did not work when my daughter had allergies and was coughing due to the hay fever.The taste and smell are not great, but my daughter is willing to take it anyways bc she knows it takes the cough away and bc the dosage is so little. I give it to her in a syringe so she doesn't have to smell it before she has it.
