review/text: These crayon bandages are sooo pretty and colorful too. They come in three colors...red, yellow and blue. And yes, there are 100 of them. The blue ones are rather dark, but that's okay, as they're still a nice novelty bandage. They are somewhat sturdy and a nice length. My box of bandages had the crayon name perfectly centered on them. The box is very cute also. My granddaughters love them, and they're always looking to get boo-boos so they can have one. I like them too (never had bandages like this when I was a child). My seller was excellent, MFASCO Health & Safety co, and shipped them with lightening speed. Glad I purchased this product. Thanks Amazon. ;)
