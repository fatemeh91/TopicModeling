review/text: I got rid of my Multi-Vitamin as soon as I tried Green Vibrance. I've tried several multi-vitamins without feeling any noticeable difference. But Green Vibrance just makes me feel great!There's research out there from multiple sources that show capsule multi-vitamins just aren't absorbed completely. Also, most of the store-brands contain artificially created versions of the different vitamins, the hazards of which range from poor absorption, not being used correctly by the body, or being possibly harmful. Go to the Vibrant Health website and you'll find the vast list of ingredients in this are mostly all natural or organic superfoods. Why is this important, you ask?... Ever think we were designed to eat food and not pills, and that's where we should get our nutrients?... hmm.And to top it all off this comes with a good dose of probiotics, good bacteria that can really help almost any digestive problem.I tried it with water at first, and it mixes ok--kind of clumpy like whey protein. I wound up blending it with a little fruit and veggies, coconut milk, eggs, and whey protein for a great breakfast shake.Try it, you'll love it!
