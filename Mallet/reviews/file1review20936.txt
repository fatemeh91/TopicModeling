review/text: I guess I was hoping for that "magic pill" that would get me jump-started on my weight loss. This product wasn't it. No noticeable weight loss, minimal boost of metabolism and energy. I'm on my second bottle and despite taking the product as directed, I'm not sure I'll reorder. It just doesn't seem worth it.
