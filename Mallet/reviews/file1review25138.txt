review/text: I have had this product for a year, and really like it, however you can no longer find the replacement odor filters. I called Graco and was told they no longer make them. Of course it works without the filter, but there is a BIG difference in containing the smell! My other complaint, now that I have a toddler, he loves to open & close this pail and put toys & other items in it!
