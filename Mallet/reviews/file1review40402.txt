review/text: I bought these for a typical sore throat. No other symptoms, just one of those sore throats where it hurts so bad you are dreading your next swallow.I took one lozenge. The lozenge was very effective at numbing whatever portion of my mouth was sucking on it, but provided little relief where it hurt on my throat. I even tried to direct the saliva as I swallowed so the numbing stuff would coat my throat. This was a little more effective, but not by much.Although it did numb the back of my throat a bit, the relief didn't last very long at all. And my mouth now felt icky and gross and numb.I'm sticking with oregano and cayenne, because while those may not take the pain away, they actually work!
