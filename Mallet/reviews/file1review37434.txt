review/text: Getting waxed all the time was getting too expensive, so I decided to try the route of an epilator. At first I epilated my legs, maybe once a month. It is a very long process, loud, and painful, though you get used to that part. I was rewarded maybe a week later with extremely itchy legs as my hair grew back under the skin. AAAAHHH! No more.Now, I use it for my arm pits, my upper lip, and my bikini area (with the help of the razor portion). I won't deny that its painful, but I will say you get used to it. I have to be in the mood to do my upper lip, but I will say I've definitely got my money's worth, and I'm not caught off guard needing a last minute trip to the waxer when they're not open. Get some cream to help prevent ingrowns.
