review/text: As a fan of most stuff from Good Grips, we picked up this dustpan & brush mainly because our current dustpan came with a broom so we wanted something a bit more "handheld." All I can say is WOW. The brush bristles are thick yet soft, so it manages to brush every little crumb into the pan. With most dustpans I have used in the past you can brush and brush all you want but you will still get that little line of dirt that stays on the floor next to the pan. Not this one! The brush and pan together leave little to no remnants of whatever you are sweeping up.We actually have ours in black, which I prefer over the lighter colors because it stays cleaner looking.
