review/text: I bought this item because the price was right, it looked really cozy and my feet are always cold. After receiving it though, I can only give it two stars though because first of all, it doesn't get very warm very quickly. You almost have to stand on the unit (at least apply pressure) to feel the warmth, which is difficult when you are sitting. Also, I frankly found the massage portion annoying, it just vibrates and it also cycles through two different speeds (It doesn't have two different speeds, it just switches back and forth occasionally while it's on). Most of the time I don't even turn it on. It does work as advertised, just don't expect too much.
