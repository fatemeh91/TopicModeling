review/text: I have used this product successfully for several years for poison ivy. I scrub it on and let it sit for at least five mins then rinse off. I find that it works. Well tonight the dog got skunked badly! I was desperate. I grabbed Tecnu because if it worked for poison ivy oil it should work for skunk oil. Boy it worked like a charm. I did not even have to use the whole bottle. I just rubbed it all over the dog. I let it sit for a few then rinsed him with the garden hose. He smelled much much better. Then it worked on my hands which were pretty skunky by then. Thank you God for this product!!!! It saved me tonight!
