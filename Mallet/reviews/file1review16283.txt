review/text: There is only one problem I have had with them, which is that sometimes they don't get dispensed. But I have had similar problems with powders and liquids and it happens much less frequently with these. The dishes come out clean, the product is incredibly easy to use (doesn't require multiple steps or products), and the dishes do not have spots. The scent is more or less irrelevant unless you find it offensive in some way.
