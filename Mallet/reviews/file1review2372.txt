review/text: I have suffered from dry eyes for the past two years and i have tried numerous products. I have tried supplements, eye drops, compresses,etc. The thera tears have been highly recommended by my eye doctor. My meibomian glands are not releasing the oily film effectively so it leaves my aqueous tears unprotected and so my eye dries up faster.Ever since I started taking thera tears I was able to feel and see a difference within 5-7 days. I don't wake up with my eyes dry shut anymore and my eyes aren't blurry anymore.Pros:1.Can tell a difference and my eyes aren't as dry as they were before2.It contains fish oil which is also great for your heart and vasculature3. Price is great and cheaper than store prices4.They don't SMELL like fish pills5.It's dosed once a day versus other products that are 2-3 times a dayCons: only 11.They tend to cause you to belch some fishy smell.I highly recommend this product!!
