review/text: I ordered this to help with symptoms of my chronic fatigue syndrome, particularly what seems to be a lame vascular system, crazy leg bruising, constipation and slight muscle pain. My order arrived midday and i was so excited i took two and promptly fell into the most blissful 2 hour nap, all my muscles just sighed and released and felt delightful. I was incredibly drowsy for the rest of the day and went to bed about 7pm! So it is a sedative! which is fantastic as it has replaced my sleeping pills at night. 2 pills makes me feel drowsy the next day so i just do one at night. Overall a lot more regular, not perfect but much better and my stomach is so flat! I couldnt believe it! Bruising is still rampant and i have dark circles under my eyes in the mornings, but they arent puffy and the whites of my eyes are brilliant white. Would recommend for sure, but take it at night!
