review/text: This trimmer has great battery life. I have used it for over 30 minutes out of the box and have not yet needed to charge it.The built-in adjustable trimmer is a nice feature, but I don't have a beard--I use it to trim my sideburns in between barber visits. However, I noticed that it is a bit difficult to adjust the wheel when my hands are damp. The rubberized wheel is great when your hands area dry, but impossible to adjust when damp.The power switch is also a bit difficult to use with damp hands. they should have added some bumps or ridges to the switch to make turning it on easier.Finally, if you're using this without the trimming guide, the clippers are not flush with each other, so you may not be able to achieve razor-sharp trims.Overall, a well-built trimmer, but it has a few flaws.
