review/text: I really liked the Infusium 23 Revitalizing Conditioner. My hair is very sensitive to different conditioners and most seem to weigh my hair down. However, the Infusium conditioner gave my hair much needed body and softness. It instantly removed tangles that some of my other conditioners haven't. I'd definitely continue to use this product and recommend it highly!
