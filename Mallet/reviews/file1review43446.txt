review/text: i ordered these as a birthday present for my boy friend. he moved here from michigan where they have a candy store that sells odd things & well he couldnt find them here any where. well we had ordered from another site & then they canceled cause they didnt even have any. so i ordered from here & im so glad i did the bars got here in plenty of time for his birthday. & he was so suprised. this was my first flake bar & WOW. they are amazing so if you havent ever had one then you have to try one.
