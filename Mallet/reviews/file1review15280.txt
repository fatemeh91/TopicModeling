review/text: Overall, I didn't like this product. It has a very thick and gooey center that's very hard to swallow unless I have a lot of water to wash it down with. The flavor wasn't too bad, but if they could just change it so wasn't so gummy... I wouldn't recommend this product to my family and friends.
