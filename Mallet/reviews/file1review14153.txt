review/text: I have been taking this brand of liver extract for 6 months now and it has done wonders! I was diagnosed with fatty liver and my enzymes were sky high around 180 and should be lower the 50 I believe but had my 6 months check up yesterday and what do you know my enzymes were at an all time low of 22. I swear by this product and will not use any other for my liver issues.Thanks
