review/text: A LIFE INVESTMENT.The chocolate whey is quite delicious. As a body builder who eats very little animal protein aside from egg whites and fish, I rely heavily on whey as a source of protein and nourishment. For those of you who don't have an appetite in the morning, you can mix this powder into a glass of milk or even water to start the day. You can even add it to things like whole wheat cereal and plain oatmeal to give a great taste in addition to protein. I consume about 1 gram of protein for every lb of body weight per day, which in my case is about 160 lbs. It was very important that I invested in a protein supplement that contained all natural ingredients. The FDA recently conducted a study that found no toxins or potentially harmful ingredients in Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey. In the past I have used BioChem EAS whey. Gold Standard not only lasts longer, it also has a much better taste in my opinion.Definitely one of the best decisions I have ever made for my body.
