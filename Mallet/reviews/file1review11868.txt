review/text: I bought a pair of these over 2 years ago and they work wonderfully. I could not be happier. They do grab even the tiniest hairs and it comes with batteries for the light and it is still just as bright as the first day I bought it. The built-in magnifier is very useful when doing eyebrows. The size of the handle is perfect for fitting in your hand as opposed to regular tweezers which eventually leave indentions in your fingertips. I recommend this product for everyone.
