review/text: Duro-Med Soft Foam Cervical Collar 2-1/2 Width, White, LargeMy neck was irritated by this collar. I solved my problem by cutting off a piece of the toe of a white cotton sock, and sliding it over the collar. It also helped to rub some A&D; ointment on my neck between the collar and my skin. It also was very uncomfortable sleeping with the collar on, OK to use when on the computer or reading a book.
