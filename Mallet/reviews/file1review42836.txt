review/text: Yes, it's expensive. But so are doctor's visits and prescriptions. Of all the things I've tried, this (along with garden of life's digestive enzymes) has almost completely eradicated my IBS issues. I'm not 100% yet, but I expect to be someday so long as I continue to use this product. Highly recommended!!
