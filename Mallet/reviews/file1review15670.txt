review/text: I bought this because I found out the previous brand I had was made from corn and not birch trees. I prefer to avoid corn products because of the pesticides used to grow them are toxic and some products are genetically modified. I read the other reviews and decided to try the Ultimate Life Sweetener. Like other xylitol products, the crystals are large and do not dissolve unless put in hot liquid. It has a great taste and I am very happy with it. I use it in herbal tea and on cereal. For dental use, I also found that you can put a piece of sugarless gum in your mouth and add a pinch of xylitol to turn your favorite gum into xylitol gum. It's a little crunchy at first, but I like it!
