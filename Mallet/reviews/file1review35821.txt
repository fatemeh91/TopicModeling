review/text: I bought this stuff because my wife hates stinky men's products and the can said it was "fragrance-neutral". Silly me. I figured "fragrance-neutral" meant that it was lightly-scented or not scented at all. I couldn't have been more wrong. If you're the kind of guy who likes to slap on about a quart of Brut before you walk out the door in the morning, this stuff will fit right in. Otherwise, avoid it. The effect is like smearing a big dab of cologne right under your nostrils and then having to live with the persistent stink for the rest of the day. I got a great shave from this stuff, but the fragrance was too strong, and it doesn't go away. A full day and a couple of face washes later, and I can still smell it.
