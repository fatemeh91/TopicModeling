review/text: This epilator pays for itself many, many times over. And actually improves the condition of your skin. I use it for everything - legs, underarms, bikini line...Sure, the first couple of times are agonizing, but with a few uses, the follicle roots get weaker, so the hair pulls out easily, and virtually painlessly. Also, it appears to have an exfoliant effect - pulls off dead, flaky skin on the legs. My legs have seriously never been in better shape.I've used this epilator for over 6 months now.
