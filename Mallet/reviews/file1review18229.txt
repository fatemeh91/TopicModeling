review/text: I had been having increasingly worse diarrhea type irritable bowel for a number of years. I am a new woman after only 2 days taking this. I need to only use one pill in the morning, and now I am no longer confined to home for the first 6 hours of every day. I was confident this would work because the more expensive prescription Lonox was also very effective for me.If you haven't tried this give it a try. It is better than having to live your life attached to the bathroom toilet.
