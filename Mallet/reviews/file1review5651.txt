review/text: This massager is not what I had expected. The motor is much less stronger than Dr Scholl's past models, doesn't hold a charge as long plus the head rotates making it difficult to hold a massage in one area. Additionally, if too much pressure is applied to the head area, the massager stops. I have a Dr Scholl's older model that I've had for several years that still runs alot stronger, holds a longer charge and does the job better. I think Dr.. Scholl's massagers have decreased in quality based on this and another model I recently purchased. What happened?
