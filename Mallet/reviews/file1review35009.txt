review/text: My physical therapist turned me on to the Serola belt. She loaned me one for a week...I was a fan after only two days and at that point I ordered one for myself. I am getting ready to order another one for my husband as we are competing for who is going to wear the one I already bought. This belt is wonderful...I can garden again; I can be on my feet longer than 10 minutes; and the pain is virtually nonexistent. I highly recommend the Serola belt.
