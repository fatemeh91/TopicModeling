review/text: The Sonic B Complete is a great toothbrush but the head refills are way overpriced coming up to 7 dollars for each refill head. These are not the upgraded motorized heads. They are just a regular brush that fits onto the motorized section. The price for these has never come down and there is nothing to warrant other than no one else provides a generic fit. The latest technology applies rotating heads and these are not compatable. So while the device itself provides good oral care you are forced to overpay dramatically for refills.
