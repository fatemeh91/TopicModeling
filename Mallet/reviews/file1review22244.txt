review/text: I resorted to ordering these from Amazon because for some reason local stores don't carry this size. These round Ziploc containers are the perfect size for a lunch entree leftover. We have been using the slightly different predecessor version of this container for over 5 years. After hundreds of individual uses and dishwasher trips, they are still going strong! (Unfortunately the previous version tops do not fit on these containers.) Even though the plastic is lightweight, it is surprisingly durable. As with many plastic containers, the bowl lip will catch water in the dishwasher, but no biggee. All in all an excellent leftover container.
