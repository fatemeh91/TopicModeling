review/text: The magnifier seems (I just received it) to be pretty durable. The magnifier is lightweight and has a nice flashlight feature. The lens is of decent quality with minimal distortion. It would be nice if the lens had an anti-glare coating to reduce the glare from overhead lighting. This is a problem if you wear glasses. I don't recommend using this for extended periods of time for reading. Good for travel.
