review/text: I've been researching Rhodiola a lot recently and sorry, but I agree with others who are accusing Bill Flemming of spamming other products. The product you think is so wonderful is offered by someone with BF as the first two letters in their name. Someone with the first two initial of BF is selling Mind, Body and Spirit Rhodiola and that same person is likely you, Bill Flemming (what a coincidence!). Then it seems you either created another identity - also from San Diego - hmmmmm - or its your wife/girlfriend/friend who slams this product in the same way. And I've noticed you've left similar comments on many other Rhodiola products. You even did a review on MB&S Rhodiola touting its greatness and saying "why doesnt amazon carry it?!?!" or something to that effect. your name is all over reviews of these products and all the coincidences combine to create suspicion. I dont know that this is the case with 100% certainty but it certainly smells fishy.
