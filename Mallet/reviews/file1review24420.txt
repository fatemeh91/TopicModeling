review/text: This item took me some getting use to. at first, it was uncomfortable because i was not use to wearing the item and it felt like I was walking on rocks, but once my feet got adjusted to them, I wont wear certain shoes without them. Keep in mind though that with certain shoes they are uncomfortable because certain shoes already have that extra support so you may not need them.
