review/text: It is nice to get a protein supplement that tastes like it is labeled. I drink one mix a day with a banana and 2%milk (4 cubes of ice)and it blends beautifully. I just hope they keep making it because usually when you find something you like, it is discontinued. I recommend it highly for people that love bananas.
