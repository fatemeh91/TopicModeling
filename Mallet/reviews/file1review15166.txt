review/text: I was really pleasantly surprised when I tried this product. For all the nutrients it contained I expected it to taste a bit like chocolate-flavored paneling or something comparable. It was actually great. Had a dense, yet rather moist consistency, with a very good flavor. The size is such that it's easy to carry with me on the go and could easily be slipped into a shirt or jacket pocket. I really liked to have one after a workout to give me a very nutritious boost. I imagine if one is looking for a quick, nutrition bar that in NO way skimps on flavor, this one is worth the money. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.
