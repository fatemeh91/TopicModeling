review/text: I wear this type of splint to bed at night due to my carpal tunnel, my old splints bought at a medical supply store were getting pretty yucky after 3 years of use, so I figured I'd replace them. Picture wise these looked identical to the ones I had. They are much lower quality.First, the metal splint is inserted into a slot that has no way of securing it at hte bottom, so it slips out. The velcro straps wrap around and adhere to the hook strip, but the strip is sewn all the way to the bottom edge and the hooks irritate my skin there as they poke through the edging. I applied medical tape over that section just to make the splint wearable. Lastly, the stretchy fabric inside the splint is rather tight, making the splint feel tight even if the straps aren't taught, however that part I've gotten fairly used to.After using these about a month, I'm going to have to go back to my old ones because they have worn a sore spot on my forearm from the hook and loop and I'll probably go to a medical supply store to buy my next pair.
