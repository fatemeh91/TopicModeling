review/text: Panthoderm cream is the best kept secret. It truly is a miracle cream. We have used it for over 30 years and will never be without it. It is used externally for skin irritation. After suffering with collitis for 30 years I learned first hand of Panthoderms greatest value. Wonderful for soothing irritated bottoms...like Diaper rash cream for adults. Must try to believe...worth every penny.Panthoderm Therapeutic Cream - 2 Oz
