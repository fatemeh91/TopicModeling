review/text: Don't buy this. It does pick up bitsies well. But it has one limitation and one fatal flaw that landed it in the garbage. The limitation is that it is ineffective along edges. The fatal flaw is that the three-piece pole falls into three pieces as you use it, after just a few strokes. I spent more time picking up the pole pieces and reassembling than I spent cleaning. And taping it only works temporarily. Didn't the manufacturer test this at all?!?!? To replace this darn thing, I bought the Dirt Devil SD20000RED Versa Power All-in-One Stick Vacuum Cleaner for $20 on Amazon. It is so much better for essentially the same money!
