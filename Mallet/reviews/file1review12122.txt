review/text: I've been taking these vitamins for a long time now, since several months before I was ready to try conceiving, through my current status as mom of a one-week-old. I attribute my ease at conceiving in part to being on these for several months beforehand, they were easy to take during my pregnancy because they did not upset my stomach, and I am continuing to take them now while I breastfeed. I am very happy with the value of buying this large bottle, because these vitamins are very expensive at my local stores.
