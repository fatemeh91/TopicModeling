review/text: FOR GASTRIC COMPLAINTS THIS IS THE TICKETCONSIDER THIS 'DGL' FORM [WITHOUT Glycyrrhizin]:If you are looking solely for relief from peptic ulcer symptoms and/or G.E.R.D., use DGL Licorice only, as it is safer and concentrates the factors that alleviate gastric symptoms such as indigestion and heartburn. Also in wafer form it is more effective as it combines with saliva to react positively in the gastric tract. [DGL Wafers]DGL VS. CIMETIDINE:Studies have shown that in comparison to 'Cimetidine', the DGL wafers worked slower but effected more of a healing action against peptic ulcers. They used 1 DGL wafer before each meal in the clinical trials.What is Glycyrrhizin?It is what makes Licorice incredibly beneficial and potentially dangerous. In a nutshell, it can aggravate hypertension and edema. If you are looking for gastric tract relief, forget about Glycyrrhizin.ABOUT BRANDS:I have used 'Now', 'Swanson', 'Enzymatic Therapy', 'Planetary' and 'Nature's Way' with roughly equal results. They all work, but the Swanson brand [when available - sometimes sold-out] usually costs less.[NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]
