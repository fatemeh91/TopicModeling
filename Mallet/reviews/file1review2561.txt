review/text: It's a great accessory to have. It's quick and not messy at all, plus I don't cut myself the way I do while shaving. I have an exceptionally quick growth of hair (or, so I feel!!). But when I used Satinelle the results lasted much longer. I simply love it...it's one of my more useful purchases in the recent past.
