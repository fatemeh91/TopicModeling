review/text: The Remingtomn was purchased at Amazon. It was shipped rapidly and as odered. The razor is an inexpensive model and does a good job. Model number SF-3 is a single ricipricating micro screen unit. This is the second one I've had. It gave good close shaves. The trimer extention never held up and couldn't be used after a short time. The replacement screens are exorbanently priced and not available in local stores. by.Remington MicroScreen SF-3 Electric Cordless Shaver
