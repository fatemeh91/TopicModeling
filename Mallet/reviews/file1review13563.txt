review/text: I wore these for the first time to work ( 12 hr shift...not so smart) ended up being on my feet all day, and my tush was killing me just 4 hours into my shift... and for several days later, I can tell you i felt the burn! I would recommend them for a little extra work to your step...couldn't hurt that's for sure.
