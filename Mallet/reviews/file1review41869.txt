review/text: I have used Braun electric toothbrushes for years, but there was a noticeable difference with this model - the 9400. My teeth felt cleaner from the first brush and the floss action head did wonders for my gums. Now, almost two months later, I am even happier with the product. It does not eliminate the need for flossing, but, in an odd way, encourages you to floss so that teeth and guns are really 100 percent. Can't recommend more highly.
