review/text: If you have hip pain, groin pain, your privates are swollen b/c of a vericose (spell?) vein, well this thing works well!! It is sized right. I got a small, but I was on the higher weight of the small. So don't buy bigger. You want it to be tighter to apply pressure to the groin area to stop the vein pain. Best of luck with this.... I can say it saved my sanity by lowering/stopping the pain!!
