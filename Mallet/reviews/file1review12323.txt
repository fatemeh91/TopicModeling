review/text: I go thru these quite a lot. Not because they are poor quality but because I have a house cleaning service and we use them.They are fantastic with reaching high places (and basebords, behind/under furniture etc.).I like that you can buy the heads only as that's what I need to replace from time to time as the handles last a lot longer than the heads.
