review/text: Reviewing the Peach, Passionfruit, and Mango Flavor: 500 mg vitamin C as sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid. I thought the flavors would be separate, but they're not- one pale color, and flavors blended into one. The taste is OK, and easy enough to chew through, and I won't throw them away. I probably won't reorder.Can't review separately once doing a review on one- SO :Blueberry, Raspberry, and Boysenberry Flavor- same vitamin C content and sources. Reminds me of the smell of fish food flakes- absolutely DISGUSTING, when expecting normally tasty berry flavors. Maybe the red cabbage that they use to color the tablets is what does it. I won't be able to choke these down. Wasted money. Really disgusting. I usually love anything berry flavored. Oy. Would make a good puke inducer if someone swallowed poison. :oEdit: 10-26-2012.... threw the berry disasters in the trash. They tasted THAT bad. To be fair, I've still got some residual taste/smell issues following extensive chemotherapy- but I generally have trouble with savory things- not berries. I'm still wondering if the red cabbage used to color them is the problem. Fish food flakes is the thing that immediately came to mind.Edit: later 10-26-2012... the Mixed Fruit flavor arrived today. These are separated into various flavors- the berry is the same nasty concoction as the Blueberry, Raspberry, and Boysenberry. There are supposed to be four flavors- I can't find but three- so who knows. One of them is tolerable- but I'm not going to spend time fishing through a pile of fish flake smelling stuff to find the odd tolerable one. Trash bin fodder. Really not happy.
