review/text: This cleaner smells so good that it makes you look forward to cleaning. It smells so fresh and clean. It smells as if you were chopping up fresh parsley for your favorite dish. I love to cook with fresh herbs, and what I enjoy most is the beautiful aroma of the herbs while I am chopping them. Just inhaling the smell makes me happy, so I was delighted to find this cleaner. I use it in the kitchen and the bathrooms and it works fabulously. This makes cleaning an aromatherapy experience that I look forward to. It is my favorite cleaning product by far.
