review/text: If your gut & pancreas don't talk nice to one another you probably lack enough acid to digest food & keep the bugs away. Betaine is essential for digestion as well as killing the assorted stomach bugs we encounter. Country Life makes quality products & this is one of them. The company I ordered it from seems good all around but is slow in shipping. Amazon spoils us for all others shipping speeds.
