review/text: I have always wanted one of these scales in my home. It is identical to the kind you will find in a doctor's office. It gives consistent readings from day to day. For some reason, other scales I have owned would vary in their readings up to 7 pounds from day to day, maybe because of the temperature or weather, or may be because they are just cheap. The $200 price was acceptable to me in exchange for an accurate reading. My recent beginning of a diet to lose weight was the primary reason for purchasing this scale. With my old scales it was imnpossible to know if I was gaining or losing weight until a change of 5 or 10 pounds had occurred.When selecting a Detecto scale there are many features to consider that may look confusing at first. After researching the Detecto web site I got all the data I needed then returned to Amazon to make the purchase. Basically there are two main groups which are BALANCE BEAM or DIGITAL. I went with BALANCE BEAM. Then there is METRIC(Kilograms) or ENGLISH(Pounds) or BOTH. Other features are HEIGHT ROD, HANDLES (to aid a person stepping on or off the scale) and WHEELS (to easily move the scale). The reason there are so many model numbers to choose from is because Detecto has provided nearly all combinations of these features.
