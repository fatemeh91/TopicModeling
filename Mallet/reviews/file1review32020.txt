review/text: I tried this after using Trader Joe's version a few times and there is definitely something more powerful about this one. Just opening the jar, you sense the potency and nutritional value by the smell and texture. I have it with kefir or with coconut milk and a scoop of GOL Perfect Meal of something like that. Yum. I feel so good on this.
