review/text: Ugh, I could smack myself for paying 2x the price and money IS an object. So for me to (up until now!!!) shell out a Ben Franklin for a container of powder-it is amazing. I used to be a regular juicer, but that involved hunting down quality organic produce, using a special wash, use plenty of the produce for decent amount of juice and then clean up the God-awful mess. With Green Vibrance, all the fuss is taken out and even more high impact special greens are involved. I mix it into almond or coconut milk with a sugar free protein powder(I like chocolate-Prograde carries a trustworthy product). It tastes great and covers the nutritional bases. An all around winner since trying to eat right with what is available is time-consuming AND expensive.
