review/text: I thought every zippo brand goods are made in the U.S, but this one had a sticker that said made in china. Kinda disappointed because I thought zippo was the only brand that took pride making their goods in the zippo factories in the U.S. In addition I don't trust things made in China because of their poor quality and the fact that they make counterfeits and claim it to be their own thing (for instance the iphone counterfeit in china is called the hiphone which is the same thing visually but with a slower processor and a bad touch screen. I also read an article about how a Chinese made office chair's part that does the declining function exploded and took away the guy's leg, he ended up dying from blood loss). But enough with criticism towards china, the ash tray is a very simple design which slides out and the tray would be located on the smaller half when pulled out (you'll see when you get the product). A small manual came with the package and another thing I'm disappointed at, the ashtray does not come with the famous zippo guarantee.Pros:-simple design-light weight-pretty sturdyCons:-made in China-doesn't some with "famous zippo guarantee"-Try not to pack it too much with cigarette butts because taking it out might be a difficulty from the trayBut overall a functional ash tray with a decent price, I only bought this because zippo is a brand I can trust.
