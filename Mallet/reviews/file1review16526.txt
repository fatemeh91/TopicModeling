review/text: KY Warming liquid does what it promises, it moderately warms up on contact with skin. However, what the manufacturers don't warn you is that it contains Honey. This makes it somewhat sweet tasting, but not good for women's very sensitive areas. Anything sugary can wreak havoc on the delicate chemical balance of the vagina. This can even lead to infections, so beware! It also gets quite sticky after prolonged use, so overall I give this product only 2 stars.
