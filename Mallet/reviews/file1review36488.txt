review/text: I bought this because of the good reviews and was not disappointed. I love it! I ran out of a natural deodorant that Lush made, and found they didn't make it any more, so I was forced to make another choice. It smells wonderful when you apply it, and then the scent fades so that you can wear other perfumes... just as other reviews said. It's mostly a rose smell with lemon, but the lemon is very subtle and definitely an undertone. It's not a FURNITURE POLISH SMELL AT ALL (like one review said). My husband loves the way it smells. :-) The best thing is that I think it works even better than the natural deodorant I had before which I was very satisfied with. I never have to reapply it during the day. And even if I don't shower in the morning the day after applying it, I don't worry about it not lasting through my work-out like I did with my past natural deodorant. I'd highly recommend it!
