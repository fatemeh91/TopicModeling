review/text: ...this stuff really helps! When I first began using this product on a full blown flare of Inverse Psoriasis it began to burn terribly. I put some Aveeno moisturizer over it and it calmed it down and to my amazement, the rash began to look better by the next day. Within two days, I was using it straight without the additional moisturizer and it actually cleared my rash within 5 days! (I often have flares that can last weeks or months). It has helped me get off of steroid lotion and I'm very thankful.
