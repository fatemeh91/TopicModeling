review/text: This is a waterproof, ultralight first aid kit by Adventure medical kits. They have a website, that shows contents. What most of think of as first aid is bandaging/bleeding first aid, and yes, this kit can do that sort, but You may need more specialized gear to treat that major injury, load up a 50 gram pack of pure stop leak, QUIKCLOT. THis keeps the resulting kit light, and improves it's use for hunting and outdoor purposes, tremendously. Preppers and survivalists, too.In fact. you can use this kit as the core of a kit similar to the Ultralight pro kit. More battle dressings, and such will fit easily. Mostly because if a little kit is good, a bigger kit has to be better. If you are on foot, that may not be true, and this kit is fine.If you are using motorized transport go for the larger kit. The only thing this kit gives you that is NOT included in every kit, is the organized waterproof inner and outr bags. So a gallon sized ziploc bag will do for the inner bag, and you simply need a cover/case for the rest. or throw a few of these kits in there so that when you want to go out for a hike or a day in the woods, you are equipped.The next thing is NON-prescription drugs. Triple antibiotic ointment with anesthetic, is a must, as is an antihistamine. The bare essentials are here, you need to decide what other things YOU need and put a supply in. These drugs expire, so check it out twice a year (change your clocks forward/back, put new batteries in your smoke alarms and update you first aid kit, too.)
