review/text: Alright, so before making the purchase I read all the reviews on here, and half of them are complaints about how this condom will make your penis numb, and you won't feel anything at all. With this climax control condom on, I can go three times longer than without it, that's how good it works for me. My girlfriend was pretty happy. Now about the issue of condom making your penis feel numb, it's suppose to do that! lol. But I can still feel the great sensation of the intercourse. Remember, this is meant to make you last longer, it DOES NOT make you stay hard longer, there's the difference! So if you have erectile dysfunction to begin with, obviously putting this numbing condom on will make your case even worse; you need something like viagra not a numbing condom. Again, this product is for normal healthy men who don't have problem staying fully erect, but just ejaulate early, so this condom will make you stay fullly erect longer.
