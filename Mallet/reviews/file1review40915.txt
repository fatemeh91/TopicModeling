review/text: I chose this product for its low price, and relatively good reviews. It's not quite the equivalent of a typical circular &#34;comb&#34; shaver costing 2 or 3 times as much. But for its price, this unit is an incredible deal, and nothing to be ashamed about.I regularly shift around among three different electric shavers I own, often using all three in one session of clean-shaving. I probably wouldn't feel comfortable with any one of them missing (the other two are: a Norelco7325XL and a Panasonic ES-SA40)
