review/text: This kit was purchased to replace a previous Wahl kit that had been used for over seven years. The wife had used our old unit to cut my son's and my hair since 1999, on the average of every six weeks. At a cost per haircut today of anywhere from $8 to $10 (that is about as inexpensive as you can get one), you can do the math as to how much money this original $22.00 +/- kit saved us. Rather than spend money to replace broken pieces, we decided to go with an all-new kit. This new one has performed in outstanding fashion, and it has more accessories than our old one. The main clipper has that solid, substantial feel of a quality piece of goods. The wife has become quite proficient in seven years of cutting her mens' hair. I also use it to trim my beard, and once again, it performs flawlessly. This unit defines quality and value, and even more, it makes me proud that it is MADE IN THE U.S.A. Wahl could get cute with their designs, but why? The classics never go out of fashion. You will not be disappointed with this product, and it will save you literally hundreds of dollars over its life cycle.
