review/text: After being diagnosed with tennis elbow, I decided to try this support (purchased locally) rather than more expensive units as I really didn't think it would do much. I am pleased to report that it did work; after a couple days of continuous use, the soreness in my elbow has decreased dramatically. I plan to continue wearing it most of the time, especially when doing physical activity. The fit is good and doesn't slip down my forearm provided I wear long sleeves. It has to be adjusted firmly but not so tight that it prevents proper blood circulation. All in all a good purchase.
