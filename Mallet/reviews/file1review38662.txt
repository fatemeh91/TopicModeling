review/text: Wonderfully moisturizing. It seems that the formula has been changed a bit, but it's still the best mask I've ever used. It is great for sensitive skin and works well even if you're rushing in the shower (like me) and can only leave it on for 5 mins. tops, rather than the 10-15 mins. they suggest.
