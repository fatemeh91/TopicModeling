review/text: I bought this for my mom, who hasn't had a bowl of ice cream or a slice of pizza in decades. This product is different than those that only provide "relief" for lactose intolerance. This product is a complete solution. You can enjoy food you never could with "relief" products. You will never know you consumed dairy with this stuff. 5-10 minutes before you eat, MAKE SURE IT IS BEFORE YOU EAT!, take 2. Enjoy whatever you eat. If you want to eat 4 slices of pizza take ANOTHER 2 pills. If you really pig out then take another pill. Remember it requires that you take pills based on the amount of dairy you eat. You can't overdose, so don't worry. I tried several and ate nothing just to test them first, no problems. ENJOY dairy again. It is not cheap, but based on how my Mom tells me everytime she eats something she couldn't have before; it is worth it. She goes through about 3-4 bottles a year. Happy to pay for it.
