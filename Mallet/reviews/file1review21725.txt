review/text: We used the infant bath tub initially but by the time my daughter turned 2 months we started using this inflatable tub. I put it in the tub and though my daughter doesn't sit up yet, she has plenty of room to move her legs and arms while I hold her. Yes, it is more strenuous for my back but it's good fun and exercise for my baby. Also, we don't have much room in my bathroom so we put up two extension rods (like those you use to hang a shower curtain) above the tub and store it on them. This keeps it out of the way though the tub does have a suction cup which works.I can't wait till my baby sits up - I envision putting the Snug Tub out on the porch for her to play in. O, by the way, I haven't reinflated it once since I bought it (about 2 months ago or so)- yes, some of the air escaped, as with all inflatables, but it's still sturdy enough. I also sometimes put a blanket in it and let my daughter 'sit' in it and play with her toys. I find it very versatile.
