review/text: I use my blood pressure unit several time a week; so I needed a cuff for my larger biceps that was easy to use. This cuff is better than the smaller original cuff that came with the unit. But the new cuff needed more adjustments of the strap than I expected. In a phrase: workable but not perfect.
