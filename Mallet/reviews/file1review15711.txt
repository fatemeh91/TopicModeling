review/text: I have had several Tech3's and have been very please with the writing quality and the workmanship of the pen. Regarding the order process, I found the user interface friendly and the processing of the order was prompt including the delivery of the pens within the estimated time of delivery. I am very satisfied with both the product and the electronic purchase.
