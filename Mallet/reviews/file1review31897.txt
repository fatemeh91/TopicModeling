review/text: I have been buying these for quite some time and was pleased with them until my most recent order. Alas, the formula appears to have changed and now there is a *very* strong ginger smell and taste to the caplets. I know ginger is good for me and I don't mind it as an ingredient but I absolutely do NOT want to taste it. Even if I gulp down an entire tall glass of water I can't escape the biting ginger flavor left in my mouth. Digestive enzymes don't do any good if you are reluctant to swallow them so I'm going to try "Doctor's Best" and hope it's a good product.
