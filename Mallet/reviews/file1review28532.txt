review/text: Great protein with a great taste. The only piece of advice I would give is that heavy coffee drinkers shouldn't purchase this because the flavor of coffee without caffeine can actually cause you to become sleepy(studies have shown this) - which is obviously bad for your workout and day. Other than that it was a smooth protein and I would definitely recommend getting some casein to mix with it.
