review/text: I took this on a small fishing boat trip since it was an inner bag which featured a leakproof, waterproof and airtight seal. My small fishing boat took on water and I was swimming for land. Fortunately the lightweight outer bag survived.Upon opening it, many items were out of date or just didn't work, like the band-aids, medical tape and oinkment. This Kit is also not fireproof as I found out when I fell asleep by my campfire and it caught fire.
