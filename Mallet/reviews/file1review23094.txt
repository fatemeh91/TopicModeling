review/text: I bought this for my wife so she doesn't have to carry the vacuum everyday and everywhere to clean the house. The price is affordable and the item itself is not too heavy, but it didn't pick up much dirt at all. My wife now use it to decrease the time that she vacuums, but still, it cannot completely replace a vacuum.
