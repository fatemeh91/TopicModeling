review/text: Cough drops never really completely suppress coughs for me, but they do make the itchy irritating type coughs or sore throats more tolerable. I try to stay away from some of the more flavorful drops because they're too much like candy and I don't suck long enough on them. But with Ricola Natural Herb Cough Drops, this doesn't happen. They definitely have an herbal flavor, but it's not too bitter, as it's tempered by the peppermint oil and sugar. Because they don't taste like candy, I let them slowly dissolve in my mouth so they coat my throat.Sometimes I like strong menthol drops when I'm really congested. These drops don't work for that as the menthol is very subtle. For people who don't like menthol, I'd say you'd probably be okay with these as it doesn't predominate like it does in Vicks Cough Drops.The soothing is relatively short-lived - I get maybe half an hour of relief. But it's pretty decent for most colds I get. So for temporary cough relief I give Ricola Natural Herb Cough Drops 4 stars.
