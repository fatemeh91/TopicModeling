review/text: If you've been reading any of the reviews here lately you will know the 8000 series foil/cutterblock combo has been replaced with a new combo now called the series 5 Combi 51S. You will receive this replacement even if the picture on the product page shows "8000 series" as it has been discontinued for over a year. Braun merged the replacement for the 8000 series (Activator) with the 360 Complete. This new foil/cutterblock is garbage! The cutterblock has wide blades, as opposed to the thinner blades of the original 8000 series, which pull your stubble and take MANY passes over your face to shave. They are prone to premature failure and I have gone through 3(THREE) of these in 6 months! (I bought one and two were free through Braun after complaining). All the free replacements in the world weren't making the shaving experience any better. I longed for the days when my Activator 8595 cut smooth, close, and comfortably. After all, this shaver had been my favorite for 6 years so far! I was very close to dumping the whole shaver and moving on when I happened across a reviewer on Amazon who suggested using the 7000 series replacement foil/cutterblock in his review. It worked PERFECTLY! The 7000 series replacement looks just like the much coveted original on my 8595 Activator - down to the thinner cutting blades! It didn't pull my stubble, it cut smooth as butter, and was comfortable: JUST LIKE NEW! I'd like to thank the original reviewer (James L. Walls "sixtoe") for the very good advice.
