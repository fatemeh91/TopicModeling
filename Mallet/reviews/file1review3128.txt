review/text: I think this is an absolute great deal on an absolutely great condom. Previously, my partner bought Durex down at the Pharmacy and spent way too much on way too little, and the condoms were rather thick.These ones are indeed pleasantly thin, and lasted perfectly well. Although I'm not worried about impregnating my partner(these are purely for cleanliness and safety), I would trust them for vaginal intercourse if I was into that sort of thing.I've recommended them to all my friends (and with 100 of them for [...] bucks I've given out free samples) and they're all pleased with them as well!Go Crown!
