review/text: I can't say enough good things about the Lil Goat products. We use the body wash/shampoo, the lotion and the diaper cream. My baby's skin feels like velvet! She smells so good and the diaper cream is the highest total % of zinc oxide I have found, plus it smells good which important when you are using diaper cream ;) Not to mention the multiple packs are such a good deal. I am ordering the diaper wipes today and I hope I love them as much as the body products.I used to use Mustela and liked it, but I LOVE LIL GOAT!
