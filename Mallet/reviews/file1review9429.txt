review/text: This product is clearly listed by amazon.com as the version with the screw-on cap, but I was sent the flip-top version. The manufacturer's box (holding 12 tubes) was clearly marked "flip cap", and that was what was inside. It was inconvenient and cumbersome to have to return it (but I did get credited with the purchase price when the return was received).
