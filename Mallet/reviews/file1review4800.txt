review/text: I have purchased this at Whole Foods in the past but when I saw the pricing here I jumped on it. No it is not inexpensive, but when you read the label and the array of superfoods, probiotics, enzymes and more, and realize it lasts you 90 days if you use daily it's a bargain.One's health is priceless, and in these times where so much of our food supply is suspect, to have something to add like these greens, makes one feel the immune system is getting extra protection and fortification.It had been awhile since I've taken it, but when I had two scoops in my smoothie yesterday (which also consisted of carrots, aloe juice, a little whey, and a few drops of Lugol's solution), I felt really sustained smooth energy all day, and no 'munchies', I feel it really kept my appetite in check.I have experienced that when one is really fulfilling the body's needs, nutrient wise, that appetite for empty calories really goes down. I'm going to keep taking this and hope to enjoy the energy benefits and a reduced waistline.
