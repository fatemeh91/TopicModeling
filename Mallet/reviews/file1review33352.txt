review/text: I purchased these along with a Merkur 180 long handled DE razor.Merkur blades set the standard for the industry and I would gladly purchase them again.These aren't the thinnest or sharpest blades, but they cut my coarse beard with ease.However, blade manufacturers abound. Every one has a slightly different feel during a shave.I would suggest buying a sample pack of blades made by several companies to determine what is best for your shave.Since I have used a DE razor and blades, I have not had razor burn or ingrown hairs. The few additional nicks that occur are far more acceptable than the day-long irritation that I received after using cartridge systems like the Mach series from Gilette.As long as you use shave soaps and creams, not canned shave foam, with this product, you will be very pleased with the results.
