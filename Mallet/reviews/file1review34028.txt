review/text: I have tried those peel off 'sticky' rollers, but those are basically useless. Only removing surface lint, nothing embedded such as pet hair.The cloth material that has a one way 'grain' with the right amount of pressure removes most of the pet hair, far better than most anything else. BUT, the cheap plastic handle will eventually crack due to it's poor design. It's not the fact it's plastic, it's the fact it is not reinforced properly. Before anyone says I'm using excessive pressure, if you don't if won't pick up enough. Mind you, I'm not bending the handle in the process, just being 'assertive'.My other gripe is, there are arrows on the handle next to the cloth, but one can't easily see which way they point since the handle is black. They need to be painted and recessed, not raised. Brush the wrong way and the lint & hair returns from the surface you are trying to clean.
