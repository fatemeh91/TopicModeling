review/text: I've never had knee problems and usually squat a couple times a week but all the sudden I had sharp pain in my knees whenever I bent them. I thought I had somehow developed tendonitis but realized I ran out of my four month supply of Triple Flex I purchased for my shoulder just a couple weeks ago. I'm not certain if there is a connection but I got a couple more bottles and will find out soon.
