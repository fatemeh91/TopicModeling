review/text: This product serves as a good friend whenever you need one. The product description says that it's "flexible," which it is indeed. The dildo isn't stiff and painful and it isn't like puddy either, it can stand up on its own but has the ability to move and bend as you [more often than not] will it to do so...He's a pretty fat sucker though, which I'm guessing might take some getting used to for other consumers out there that aren't used to that much pink power. But whether you love the soft and flexible curviture of him for vaginal or anal techniques it's all good.The only downsides include the fact that the product description doesn't tell you (nor does the packaging) what it is literally made out of. Which can be troubling as to whether you intend to use water-based or silicon-based lubricants for anal entry... If you aren't aware of what the product is made out of, your libricant might end up corroding the product.Another downside is the fact that because this is bright pink, it has the potential to lose its luster after a few uses. While washing it a few times obviously restores its color a bit; after anal a few times, you'll notice the "pink" begin to turn more into a "salmon"-like color. But as far as functionability goes, its a winner.
