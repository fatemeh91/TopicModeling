review/text: If you're new to green powder formulas, they will all taste alittle strange but I can say that after awhile, your palate adjust to them. They've added a small amt of stevia which helps w/the taste. Stevia is plant based and not a chemical sweetener like splenda is and many others. This is such a wonderful product. I have stomach and colon problems but since using this product, it has helped alot and I have no problems digesting it at all. This company has put more emphasis on bioavailability. They've created a patented production process called Poten-Zyme fermentation, which actually predigest some of the nutrients to help the digestive system absorb more, since green powder compounds are hard to digest. I don't think anyone really gets all of the nutrition we need from the food we eat daily and this product makes such a difference. I take the powder w/just water and my husband takes the tablets w/water daily because of his busy schedule.
