review/text: I saw this product at the store and thought it was an awesome solution for saving space. It was the last one on the shelf, and I walked out of there feeling so lucky to have bought it. I love finding ways to organize anything and so I couldn't wait to get home and try it out. Munchkin, you disappoint me! It's a great concept, but awful in execution. The whole thing tips forward, the diapers don't stack well, the fabric started to fray, and I hadn't even used the thing yet. I thought mounting it to the wall would be a good solution for the tipping issue, but it didn't help, and it's quite the eyesore. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst product I've bought for my baby so far. In short, don't waste your money or time on this product, it doesn't even deserve one star.
