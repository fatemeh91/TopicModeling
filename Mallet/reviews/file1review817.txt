review/text: I bought this kit for the same reason a few others have mentioned: I had expensive sunglasses that lost the small bolt one of the screws goes into. I looked at many different kits and none seemed to have these small bolts. Finally found this one, and the fit was perfect. Totally saved me from having to buy new sunglasses.
