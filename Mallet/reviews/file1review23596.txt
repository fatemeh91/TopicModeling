review/text: I have sensitive skin, but immediately upon applying this mask, my skin started to burn. Not tingle, burn. I may have had an allergic reaction, but I highly recommend that people start with a sample. Obviously, my skin reaction meant that I can't use the product, but even if that wasn't a factor, the smell was putrid. It smells like decaying fruit. Quite nasty. Bottom line: Before potentially wasting your money on this, try to find a sample somewhere.
