review/text: I tend to slouch quite badly, and was just looking a quick, inexpensive fix to that problem. This solved it.I will say, as a preamble, if you tend hunch over as well, this product probably won't help as much as others - it obviously only focuses on shoulders). I began wearing this in the winter, so I wore a thin vest, then the brace, then a t-shirt and I didn't get the sore armpits many people complained about - EXCEPT for one day when I accidently wore the thing upside down. If you look carefully at the product, you'll realize there is a right side up, and a wrong side up, though it is NOT clearly marked. Wearing it the wrong way round makes it sit quite high, and then it does hurt to wear. Overall, in terms of interaction with clothes, it's a bit thicker and wider than a bra-strap, and sits in the same general area so figure out how that would work with your clothing style. The first several days I did get sore shoulders, but that passed- I really do believe that it is more a case of my using muscles to sit upright that I didn't use before, rather the brace. As one reviewer mentioned, you are constantly aware of the brace being there - if you weren't, then you're probably sitting slouched over.
