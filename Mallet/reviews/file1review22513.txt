review/text: People...please don't get ripped off. I went to Walgreens and got a large 50 count of underlayment pads that fit perfectly on our changing table for 3.99 Please don't fall victim to the cute designs and baby marketing gimmicks. These work...but you can get the exact same thing at your pharmacy for much much less.
