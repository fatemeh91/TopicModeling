review/text: This is one of the best Magnesium supplements I've tried. Very absorbable. I need to take far less of this than other brands in order for it to be effective. I haven't found one better than this other than powder mix. Peter Gillham's Natural Calm is EXCELLENT powder mix if you want to drink your magnesium supplement Natural Calm 16 Oz by Peter Gillham's Natural Vitality. It tastes great and doesn't have any sugar in it, how cool is that?! But for a pill/capsule form of magnesium, this is excellent.
