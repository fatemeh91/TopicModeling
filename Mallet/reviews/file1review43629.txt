review/text: So far this product has been great with the exception of the arm cuff. This BPM arrived with a normal sized arm cuff, which is fine, but it doesn't fit my arm size. I wish a choice could be given when purchasing the product as to what size arm cuff you need. This is so you don't have to wait for the product to arrive only to find out you need to order something else before you can use it.
