review/text: I've used a couple different kinds of mouthguards over the years, and this is the only one I have downright hated. It fit awkwardly, it felt flimsy, it moved while I slept, and then after only a week of using it, I chomped it right in half while I was sleeping. Do not buy this product unless it is a last resort.
