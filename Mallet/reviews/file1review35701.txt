review/text: This brand is the best for eye drops. My eyes are very sensitive and Visine felt like I was pouring bleach into them. Similasan feels so good. Whenever I have allergies (which is often), it affects my eyes first and I look like I've been watching Terms of Endearment. I have one in my bathroom and I don't leave home without my second bottle. I also stock pile these in my closet and recommend them to everyone who will listen.
