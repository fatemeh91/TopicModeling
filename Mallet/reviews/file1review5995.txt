review/text: I love this wrist monitor. After struggling for a year with the cuff type, this is so easy to use I can check my pressure throughout the day without any effort at all. A relative had this same one and she works in a hospital setting where she could check the quality of the readings against what the old fashioned nurses type cuffs read and the readings were in line with those of the hospital cuff. I highly recommend.
