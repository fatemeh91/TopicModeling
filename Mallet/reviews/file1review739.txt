review/text: I believe this product received a very unfair review strictly based on taste. I just received this bottle this week and I have to say, the Blueberry is much better than the banana! It's also important to keep this in the fridge after you open it.My naturopath doctor has me on this and about 3 other probiotic/flora supplements along with colostrum to treat both acid reflux and IBS. I'm grateful to have found this on Amazon because his markup is at least 50%. The important thing about taking a probiotic in liquid form is that sometimes it is important to have the beneficial bacteria colonize in the stomach and even esophagus. Capsules are meant to become available further down the GI tract to make your colon happy. I'm finding that with the use of a good digestive enzyme and this liquid probiotic, I've been able to go off my proton pump inhibitor (PPI's like Prilosec and Nexium) which has given me stomach polyps from prolonged use.The theory is that regular use of anti-biotics, the stomach and intestines can become out of balance and unable to function naturally due to a lack of good bacteria.It's important to take aloe vera juice regularly(3x/day in between meals) to heal the esophagus and stomach. That in conjunction with a product like this can get you on the path to healing. I no longer have chest pain and I can also digest dairy. Amazing!A final thing about this. Some probiotics are designed so that you rely on them. The bacteria in them will not live longer than a day. I believe that this product is designed to actually grow and colonize to the point where you will not need it again after 3-4 months of use. The only time you would need it again is after taking an anti-biotic.Good luck and keep an open mind.
