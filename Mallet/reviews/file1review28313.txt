review/text: I have been using this for 4 mos. now. I really enjoy the double chocolate flavor. The sugar to protein ratio was one of the things that attracted me to this mix. I usually have a shake a breakfast and one after workouts. Using subscribe and save is great, 2 pounds last me right at 1mo.
