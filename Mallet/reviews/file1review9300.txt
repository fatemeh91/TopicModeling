review/text: How wonderful this is! Being able to sort all of my supplements at the beginning of the week and having to carry only one small, individual case is so convenient and has kept me from skipping doses. Unlike other weekly pill sorters that tend to be large, the small size of the individual daily cases allows it to fit anywhere, including a pants pocket, and makes it easy to grab when I'm on the go! Another great feature for me is the AM/PM designations because I don't have to try to remember which pills I have taken and when. If you want to simplify and ensure your dosing schedule, do not pass on this item!
