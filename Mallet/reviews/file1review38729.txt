review/text: I really wanted this to work. In fact I took it faithfully for 2 years waiting for it to work. Unfortunately it never took my BP down at all. In fact I wound up in the hospital with a blood pressure of 300/120. Let's just say I'm on 5 blood pressure meds now and I promised my doctor I'd throw this stuff out.I'm not saying this won't work on some people. I imagine it does. But if you're having hypertensive numbers consistently consult your doctor and take care of yourself.
