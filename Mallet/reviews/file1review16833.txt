review/text: Bought these for the hubby in hopes he'd lay off my Luna bars a bit, but these are GR8!!! It back fired! Now I've become the nutrition bar caper;-) I plan to try several more flavors. This is my 1st flavor & I chose the BLACK CHERRY ALMOND as I figured it would be his favorite & boy we both LOVE these!!! I think it's the fig/ and or dates in all of them from what I've read in way of ingredients. The BEST consistency & VERY fresh! I am waiting for 2 more 24-packs to be delivered today of "Cool Mint Chocolate" & "Blueberry Crisp" Oh, I'm so tempted to hide them & tell hubby they never arrived.....LOL, but the guilt would ruin the Clif Bar high I so enjoy:-)
