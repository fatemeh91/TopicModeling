review/text: I bought this because I wanted to find a non anti perspirant deodorant (it doesn't seem like a good idea to add these chemicals to your body every single day). I have used both the aloe and the lavender. Both of the scents didn't really impress me. They worked well enough (I didn't have BO), but I found Degree Women's Nature Effects Solid Deodorant Stick-Honeysuckle-2.2 oz (Pack of 5) which is a mainstream deodorant without anti-perspirant. I think it's pretty ridiculous that there are about 100 different anti perspirants available for women, but hardly any deodorants without anti perspirants. Hopefully in the future the market will grow for this type of item.
