review/text: The main purpose for taking this pill was to relieve dry eyes that I was having only while I'm wearing contacts. I'm not a big fan of taking pills. I'd rather avoid them as much as possible and I only take vitamin c supplements or ibuprofens from time to time when I feel like I need them.When I took these for the first time, I was quite disgusted by the fish burp. I HATE FISH. I hate any kind of fish smell plus taste whatsoever. However, I kept on taking them for few days cause it seemed to help me in making my eyes less dry. I skipped taking them for few days and yesterday, I had one of the worst experience ever. I had a cup of coffee with a muffin in the morning like I usually do, but this time I decided to taking these supplements after an hour. I began to feel extreme urge to vomit and a headache. What made it worse was that I was at WORK. I was nauseous for hours and the fish burp made things unbearable.I have found that some people are susceptible to fish oils. Also, it made me wonder whether unpleasant fish taste is the outcome from lacking in molecular distillation during manufacturing process meaning it has contaminants. I won'ttake this supplement anymore even though they work. I will look for other brands without nasty after taste or switch to flax seed oil.
