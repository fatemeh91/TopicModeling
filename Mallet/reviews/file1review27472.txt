review/text: I could barely tolerate the vanilla.. but the extreme milk chocolate is pretty decent. GNC's stuff still ways WAY better (and every flavor of theirs is good), but Optimum Nutrition is a bit cheaper and works very well. Taste should be pretty much the last factor on your list when choosing supplements anyway. This stuff makes a noticeable difference and performs on bar with, if not slightly better than, GNC's whey. Also as shown in some of the customer pics, its purity is very good as well. Some people don't care, but I do think it's important to pay attention to all the contaminants and keep them at levels as low as possible. I would rather not be consuming a bunch of heavy metals and other toxins multiple times per day in my supplements. So in that respect, for the most part, more expensive IS better.. do NOT go with the super cheap stuff from other brands.. stick with the well-respected ones like GNC and Optimum Nutrition.
