review/text: Many years ago, I read a book about the health benefits of taking apple pectin, a soluble fiber, to supplement the diet, since many people don't consume enough fruits and vegetables to get an adequate amount of pectin. It was believed that pectin binds to cholesterol in the gastrointestinal tract, slows glucose absorption by trapping carbohydrates, and acts to block the absorption of some fats. Ever since, I've taken several apple pectin tablets or capsules a day. The most noticeable benefit is to help prevent constipation, and at my age, that's a big deal.I've used three or four brands of apple pectin, and the Nature's Plus brand has always been reliable and competitively priced. The serving size is listed as one 500mg tablet, which is the equivalent of 20.5 grams of whole apples (about ounce). Interestingly enough, the bottle comes with a laboratory assay by an FDA-approved testing laboratory.
