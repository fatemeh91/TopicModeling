review/text: I was afraid to start the oxy powder because I had never done a cleanse before, but it was just as the product stated. Take 4 capsules and 8 oz of water before bed. The next day it worked just as stated - (liquified stools). After a few days I had to increase the dosage to get the same amount of "movements" a day. After I finished my cleanse, I continued to be regular.Make sure you get up early so you have enough time to take care of business- you get warning but not too much.I will use to keep regular- I would recommend to people with regularity issues.
