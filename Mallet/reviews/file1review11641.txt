review/text: Just as described. This is one of the best fish oils/omega3 for kids. Especially good for premature babies who have weak nervous system and other motor/psychological challenges.For people who are complaining about fishy taste - well, it's a fish oil. You can't have chocolate chip cake! It is supposed to have a fishy taste. The strawberry tries to mask the flavour and that's ok but there's no way on earth that you could eliminate it completely. Children usually do not complain about it.
