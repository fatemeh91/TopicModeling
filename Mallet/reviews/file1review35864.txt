review/text: If you have rashes or blemishes and burning on your face after a shave, this is your stuff. I've been using it for... over 2 years now. Like another reviewer stated, if you forget it, you'll know it. It removes the rash in like 5 minutes. It makes your face feel great immediately and lasts for a long time. The best thing I've noticed is that it won't clog your pores.OK so the bottle is glass and heavy, I happen to like it. Just be sure your hands are not dripping wet and don't use it while standing over the sink - (carpet will absorb it if you can predict when it will fall). If you still don't like glass in the bathroom, transfer it to another container because this is the best it gets.
