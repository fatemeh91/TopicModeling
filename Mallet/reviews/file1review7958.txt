review/text: I ordered these Tuffsak 15 Count 55 Gallon Contractor Drum Liners but instead I received black Ruffies Pro brand 55 Gallon Contractor Drum Liners.The dimensions, thickness and quantity were the same as the Tuffsak bags and according to the box the Ruffies bags are made in the USA. So far they seem very durable, as you would expect from a 3 mil (0.0762 mm) thick bag. Long, paper-coated twist ties were included.
