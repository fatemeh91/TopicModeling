review/text: I carry this with me when I am mountain biking. I have only had to use it once when I went over my handle bars 15mi from home. I hurt my wrist pretty badly and between this and some self adherent wrap I was fine getting home. I couldn't ride the trail with it, but after I got back to the road it worked well enough to ride. and was comfortable enough to sleep in before I went to urgent care the next day. After this experience I always make sure I have it when I leave home.My one complaint about it was that with only one good hand it was very difficult to get the plastic wrap off of it to use it, so you may want to open it as soon as you get it.
