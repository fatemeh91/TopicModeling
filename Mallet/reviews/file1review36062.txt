review/text: ArrrginineThis product supplies arginine for a good value. I have been using this brand of arginine for several months as a supplement to my protein intake and to ensure that appropriate ammonia excretion is taking place. There are numerous other reasons or at least speculated reasons why arginine is metabolically beneficial.As for my experiences with the product, I find it to add a somewhat alkali texture when added to a whey protein drink, muscle milk,... whatever. There is a noticeable (but slight) difference in taste. Doesn't bother me.Good product.
