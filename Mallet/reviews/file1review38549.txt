review/text: I use this mirror on a daily basis and have been using the same one for several years. I recently dropped it about 10 feet onto a tile floor and cracked the mirror so it's time to get another (no fault of the mirror). This is an excellent, large diameter mirror which is ideal for inspections and is large enough to allow taking photographs of the item being inspected. The ball coupler, which allows the head to articulate is tension adjustable. Unlike the previous reviewer, I have never had any issue with inadequate tension at the joint. If I could change one thing about this mirror, I would add about two more telescopic sections to the handle to allow for longer reach. Because of the large head size, this is not the mirror to use in tight spaces.
