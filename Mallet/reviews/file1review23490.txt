review/text: I originally bought this product when my daughter was struggling with IBS-C as a teenager, after reading about it on the "Help for IBS" website. Not only was it a godsend for her, but also for others in my family who suffer from digestive problems. My elderly, sedentary mother has experienced tremendous relief from a problem with slow motility, and my cousin has achieved complete remission from diverticulosis, narrowly avoiding the surgery recommended by his doctor (he thanks me every time he sees me). I have no idea why the medical profession hasn't figured this out yet - they recommend "fiber" for constipation, but don't understand that *soluble* fiber is the key to bowel regulation in both constipation and diarrhea. We refer to it as our "magic powder," which I know sounds silly but the relief this has given my family is deadly serious. Note: the powder takes a bit of time to dissolve in hot liquids. My mom uses a tiny cappuccino "stick mixer" to blend it into her coffee - I find it easier just to sprinkle it onto soup, salads, etc., making sure to drink plenty of liquids in addition.
