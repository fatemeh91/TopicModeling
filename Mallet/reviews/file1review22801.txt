review/text: Animal Cuts is not rocket science.1. When used properly, with a healthy diet, this will work. If anyone believes in a miracle pill, stay wishing.2. Heartburn was a side effect for me, BUT, there is a pill to take for that also.3. If you want six-pack abs, research online for the truth. Hugo Rivera, "How to Get Nice Abs" gives the average for men at around 6-8 percent body fat. That means diet and exercise.4. Green Tea, YEAH!5. One months supply for a reasonable price.6. I have completed 10 cycles of Animal Cuts. I can lose the abdominal fat I gained from bulking with this product.7. Stay away from stimulants while cycling on this product(i.e. caffeine, other diet pills, and/ or energy drinks).8. Stay hydrated.4 stars for a 4 star product.[&#8230;]
