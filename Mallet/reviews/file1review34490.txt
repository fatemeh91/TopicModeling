review/text: The previous reviewer is correct. Twin Labs is a blend of Krill and other stuff so you get less than the other brands. Be sure you get NKO Krill, the quality of other sources is quite variable at this point. The name brands, such as Jarrow, Now, all use NKO Krill, which is a patented process. The only concern is how old it is. Check the expiration date.
