review/text: I like these little pocket sized pill holders. But, there always is a but somewhere I guess, they are dicey to keep in their trays when you move them and filling them is a pain. Also, If you take a lot of meds the holders may be too small. I just about fill them up with 3 calcium and one chewable Centrum multi vite plus my 4 little medications. Almost is the key here. I could put more in if the more were small. But it would push the limits to say double my calcium.But at long last I have a ready container I can pop in my pocket as I head out the door and know the pills will stay in their holder. Very handy! I would recommend them and did so to my wife who likes hers.
