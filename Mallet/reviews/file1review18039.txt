review/text: I cannot sleep without my 40 blinks eye mask! They are the best eye masks I've found. They don't break off your eyelashes, they don't move around too much, and they really do block out light. This one was invaluable to me when my mother was in ICU for a week, I was able to sleep in the waiting rooms without trouble. I also love it when I have a migraine, as any little stray light beam feels like a knife stab. I highly recommend this product!
