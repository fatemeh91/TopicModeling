review/text: I had been on the pill for five years, and when I stopped taking it to start trying to conceive I experienced really irregular cycles. It had been almost three months since having my period when I found this product and read reviews about it. I have to say that I was a little skeptical about it working for me, but I thought it would be worth a try. I have now been taking Fertilaid for one week, and I got my period (after three months without it!)!I am giving this product four stars due to the fact that I don't know if it will help me ovulate yet, but I am very pleased that it has helped put my body back on track. If you are experiencing irregular cycles, I would highly recommend this product. It can be a little hard to remember to take three times a day, but the pills are easy to swallow and don't upset my stomach.
