review/text: this stuff is awesome--if you have athletes in your family this is what you need---we tried everything including prescriptions to get rid of athletes foot fungus and rashes to legs---kept getting reinfected every time they went back to the tumbling mats and gym......UNTIL we started using this---washed all equipment in this soap, and our athletes use it daily in the shower on all exposed skin surfaces year round......it only took about a week of consistent use and the fungus was completely cleared up and has not been back............I even used it on my dogs feet and it cleared up the rusty looking stains on his feet that he chewed constantly despite Rx from our vet.........we are on the auto delivery program for this stuff and never want to give it up
