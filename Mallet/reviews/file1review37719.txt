review/text: I like the convenience of hair removal without the mess of shaving. It wasn't as painful as I thought it might be. It takes a bit of practice to remove the hair completely. You have to pull it off very quickly and at the correct angle for the wax not to remain on the skin. Overall, I liked the product and would buy it again, although I need a bit more practice with it.
