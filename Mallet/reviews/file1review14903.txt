review/text: I absolutely love this set! The knife is very easy to use. I mainly use it for chopping up fruits or vegetables, but it's great to use on fish and other meat as well. The bowl is perfect for the shape of the ulu knife and keeps everything from falling out. I make guacamole in it all of the time and it makes it so easy. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.
