review/text: I bought this kit because I wanted to save money with haircuts. The WAHL clipper does the job and is easy to use. My wife cuts my hair with them and my dad now comes over for haircuts too. I do recommend getting a separate pair of close-shave clippers for cleaning up the hair on the neck - this particular unit does not trim close enough for me. Great product, not loud, and trims great.
