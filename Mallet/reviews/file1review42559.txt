review/text: i've ordered this after reading the reviews... it mixes really well and the butter cream toffee flavor mixed with ice coffee is unbelievable (one scoop for 28 oz of coffee, no sweetner or milk)! 24 grams of protein, 0 sugar and 1.5 grams of fat is all i needed after my morning work out!cant go wrong!
