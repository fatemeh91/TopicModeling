review/text: First of all, I'm a woman. I've been using Venus razors for years, with okay results. I've tried the Mach 3, which didn't really impress me. I decided to try the Fusion since my husband uses one, and that way we could buy one kind of blade instead of two. I was blown away with the shave the Fusion gave me! Super close with no nicks, and today's day two and my legs feel just as smooth as yesterday, something the Venus never did. The only gripe I have is that I miss my Venus handle--I'm finding the Fusion handle to be pretty slippery in the shower, and harder to hold onto.
