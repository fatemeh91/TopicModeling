review/text: The first few days of taking it, there were some side-effects. Perhaps they were cleansing side-effects. They mostly happened at night. I had headaches and even though this may sound disgusting, anal itch. This was for the first four or five days of use, then I didn't notice anything. I still take it. A little more oxygen can't be bad for your body.
