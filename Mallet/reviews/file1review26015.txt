review/text: I already had been using a Mind Fold for a couple of years and figured it was time to replace it with new ones since I had dragged that one around for so long! I wanted to have one to keep in my car for when I relax on my lunch breaks and another one for home. They are a great product. I like to use them for when my eyes feel tired and when I do my deep breathing exercises. They definitely are great and worth the money.
