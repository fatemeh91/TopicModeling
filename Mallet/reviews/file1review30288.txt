review/text: This replaces my old cordless dust buster that used hard-to-find filters. I was concerned about having one with a cord but I absolutely love this one! It has *very* powerful suction and a relatively long cord. I'm happy that the power doesn't start to peter out after a few minutes like the cordless one. I haven't cleaned it out yet (yuck) but at least I don't have to worry about running out of filters!
