review/text: I ordered these to use as cleaning cloths, for drying wine glasses and for dusting. After reading some of the reviews, I was concerned as it seemed that some were not happy with the quality. All I can say is that I found these diapers to be extremely soft and washed well. As for whether or not these make good diapers, I haven't put them to that use so I can't comment, but for cleaning, I give these 5 stars!
