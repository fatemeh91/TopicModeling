review/text: The nutrients and health benefit is outstanding in all the regular Emergen-c but I remember from a few years ago that the super orange tasted half like real orange and half like a good artificial orange, like Tang or orange soda pop. It used to be my favorite by far but the orange flavor is now pure chemical orange and there is a strong off flavor that distracts from the main flavor. I'm giving it 2 stars only because the lemon-lime is definitely worse.I must admit that the super orange still produces the least fizz when mixing so you can mix a larger batch without overflowing the container with foam.The only flavor I can recommend now is the pink lemonade, which tastes good with no off flavor or aftertaste, though I hesitate to call it natural tasting.6 Jan 2013 update:My mom actually still had a bunch of the old formula emergen-C flavors. The old super orange was fine - 3 stars. The new super orange is really awful - 1 star. The only difference I found in the ingredients on the packages was that the old one listed malic acid, orange juice powder, natural flavors. The new one listed natural orange flavors, malic acid, orange juice powder.The new acai berry is still good - 3 stars. The old black cherry heart health was very good - 4 stars - so I'll try the new one and report back in that product if the new one is also good.
