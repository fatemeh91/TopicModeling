review/text: I am 35 (just about 36) and have been trying to get pregnant for the past several months. Ladies you know that when you go off the Pill that your cycle goes wacky right? Well, when I saw this product, I was a sceptic but after looking at the other reviews I thought I would give it a try. If it only helped regulate my cycle I would have been happy with my purchase, but ladies after taking this product for only a month and a half, I am pregnant!!It was a challenge to remember to take it three times each day, but once you get into the habit of taking it at certain times it is not so bad. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to get pregnant.
