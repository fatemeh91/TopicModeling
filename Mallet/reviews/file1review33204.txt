review/text: I bougth these with some expectations to dodge a cold. My two kids need a healthy mom to care for them when they are sick. However, I'm sick with a cold now and had another one last week. I take the recommended dose and I'm a healthy eater. SO? I guess my colds were too hard for this to work.They also repeat on me something awful for a hour after taking them. Burping this is not pleasant. I will stick to tylenol and get back to work.
