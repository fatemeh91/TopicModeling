review/text: This pill crusher works easily and quickly. The design includes storage for a number of pills (3 compartments, 1 small, 2 smaller) which is a neat extra. One good feature about the crusher is that the crusher and its bowl are half-sphere shaped, so there aren't any crevices in which the resulting powder can get stuck. (I tried another model whose crusher is cone shaped and the powder gets stuck in the tip.)The down-side of this product is that the splitter opens readily. This is probably useful for people who have limited hand-strength, but I don't like it. I would like to be able to toss the crusher in my handbag and take it with me, but because the splitter opens so easily I need to be careful where I put it, so I don't accidentally cut myself on the splitter's razor. Also, I've seen better splitters on the market. I would prefer if the product were designed so I could take off the splitter entirely.We use this for crushing only. For that it is excellent.
