review/text: I had been looking forward to this product until I plugged it in and turned it on. As I leaned forward to look in the mirror, I was so close I was almost touching it to see myself and that was distorted. When I leaned back a little, forget it, I could not discern my face at all. The light was very dim on the highest setting compared to my old makeup mirror. I irritably packed the mirror up and shipped it back for a refund.I don't understand why someone can't make a pretty makeup mirror that doesn't distort your face severely. It would also be nice to have a light setting that is more powerful and useful.My desk mirror I intended on replacing (a Clairol), is 25 years old and have not had to replace the lights, yet. (knock on wood) I suppose as ugly and space consuming as it is, I should stick with what still works and forget esthetics.
