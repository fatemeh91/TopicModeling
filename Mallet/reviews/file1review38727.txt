review/text: This product is thick, protective, and stands up to sweat better than just about anything. And it's a great value compared to others that have additional, non-essential ingredients such as for fungus control. Also a plus is that it completely comes out of your athletic gear in the wash, unlike for example, zinc oxide ointment.
