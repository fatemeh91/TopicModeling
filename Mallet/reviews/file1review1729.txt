review/text: I purchased this product after a need for it developed in my armpits. I had been using Terbinafine Hydrochloride 1% for a few wks to no avail. I didn't (and haven't) seen a doctor due to no insurance and costly dr visits, but am about 99% sure its a fungus. What makes this product so effective is the Tea Tree oil. I have been using this which has keep the fungus in check and prevented it from spreading, in combination with 91% rubbing alcohol and a switch over to Butenafine hydrochloride 1%. I like to wash n rinse with the soap 2-3 times in the shower, then when I get out take some toilet paper w/ the alcohol and just hold it over the rash for a good 2-5 mins (longer in the beginning stages) then dry off the area and apply the cream. I have also been using this soap all over and have notice that the bottoms of my feet have softened up tremedously, and the acne on my face has cleared up along with its complexion. I will be replacing my normal body wash with this and using it on a daily basis.You have to help your body fight off these things just not rely on creams and soaps. There are foods out there, such as garlic, onions, coconut shreds etc. that aid your body in clearing it up quicker. Do your research! Usually what your see externally is just a piece of whats happening internally!Funguses are growing more prevailant in our ever growing sterilization efforts as a society due to their mutations to adapt. I attribute my inability to iradicate the fungus in a timely fashion to this. Ppl don't be afraid of a little dirt and grime it makes us stronger in the long run.
