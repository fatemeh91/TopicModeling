review/text: The bars were pretty good. Not too chemical-tasting, but a typical sports bar nonetheless. Bland. Texture of cardboard but better than most in consistency. Not sticky like Power Bars. I'd recommend them if you can accept that all sports bars invariably taste like packing material. Good protein content.
