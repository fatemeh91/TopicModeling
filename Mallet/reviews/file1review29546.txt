review/text: This is my first bombilla so I can't compare to any others; but this is what I have experienced:* It never clogs and it is always easy to sip from. This is a good thing as this bombilla does not allow for internal cleaning.* It gets extremely hot in newly prepared brews. The plus is that it forces you to wait for the tea to cool. There have been reports of mouth cancer from drinking very hot liquids through a straw. Nevertheless, my next bombilla purchase will definitely be wood unless there are metal bombillas that offer some insulating properties* It is exactly one inch too short for the vessels that we drink our tea from so we have to 'fish' the bombilla out before drinking. If you use a tall glass you might want to measure the height before ordering.
