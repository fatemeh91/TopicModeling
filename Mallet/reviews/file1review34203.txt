review/text: First of all I want to say that this product in AMAZING! It did miracles for me. I was suffering from internal hemorrhoids. It was EXTREMELY painful to use the restroom! I did my research and after some trial and error I FINALLY got rid of them. I know that everybody is different but this is what worked for me. First, buy this product. Use it everytime that you take a shower morning and night. Secondly buy some Tucks Hemorrhoidal Pads WITH Witch Hazel (Very Important!) Must have witch Hazel. Wipe yourself with toilet paper first then use the pads to clean that area entirely. Look up Witch Hazel if you want to know what it does. Thirdly, buy Metamucil Sugar Free Psyllium Fiber. Instead of drinking plain water or soda. Drink Metamucil with water with everything. After about a week and a half I was able to use the restroom normally. Metamucil helped to soften my stool and regulate my bowel movements. Tucks helped relieve, sooth, and clean that area. And this product helped me to cool, sooth, and alleviate the internal hemorroids. I no longer have any pain and I can continue with my life. I can assure you that this product works. This is my first time posting something on Amazon about a product. I feel that I owe it to myself to tell others who suffer from internal hemorroids about my experience. I know that it can be very painful and sometimes you don't know where to turn to. Please follow my advice and I wish everything goes well. Thanks and I hope this works for you!
