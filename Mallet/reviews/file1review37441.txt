review/text: The Braun 3370 was my first foray into the wonderful world of epilating and I must say it was an easy transition from shaving. At first, I thought it would be too difficult to do around the ankles but then I went back and read the instructions a little more closely and realized that there was a better way of doing it. So, read the instructions and enjoy more than one or two days of hairless legs!It gets a four and not a five because I think it may have also contributed to a higher number of ingrown hairs at first, but I am learning to deal with that as well and it has tapered off.
