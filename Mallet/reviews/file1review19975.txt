review/text: This is one of those silly things to do that is hilarious and kinda/sorta sexy at the same time. the stencils really do not work that well, but then that is not the fun of the game. My friend and I found that finding imaginative places to place the tattoos was a blast...we each tried to out do each other. As one reviewer has pointed out, the stuff sort of runs together and sort of makes a blob but in our case that was okay. It was fun applying it to each other and it was even more fun licking it of and even more fun having it licked off. I would suggest you have some nice damp towels handy and I would suggest you use old sheets on the bed.
