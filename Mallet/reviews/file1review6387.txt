review/text: This thing sure looks strange, but whoever figured it out did a fabulous job. It is easy to hold on to and apply pressure wherever you need it.If one end doesn't work, just turn it around and the other end will.You don't have to apply all the pressure with your hands either, you can use your arms to push on it.It is hard to describe, but after you have use it and tried it at different angles and directions, you will find that it is very effective at applying pressure on any tense or knotted up muscles just about anywhere in your body.
