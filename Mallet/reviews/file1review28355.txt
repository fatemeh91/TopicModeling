review/text: I love Optimum Nutrition gold standard whey protein. My favorite flavor is milk chocolate. I enjoy changing the flavor and sometimes buy two pound containers of mocha cappucino, cookies and cream. Right now I have an unopened new two-pound tub of caramel toffee fudge -- we'll see how that goes.But I am working my way through a two pound tub of banana cream. I bought the banana cream because of favorable comments here on Amazon.All I can say is the banana flavor tastes like chemicals. And I paid a premium price. The banana, for no good reason, costs significantly more than my favorite flavors. 99 cents an ounce is a lot more than 66 cents an ounce, right?I will eat all the banana protein powder, cause no way would I waste thirty+ bucks worth of protein powder, but it is an unpleasant, chemical taste. I can't figure out a way to doctor it up. If I add real frozen banana, the chemical taste still dominates. If I add cinnamon, which I enjoy in all other shakes, the chemical taste still dominates.Yuck yuck yuck on the banana.But I still love ON whey protein powder.
