review/text: At the beginning of the year I purchased a wrist worn Oximeter that uses the Saft LS 14250 battery. The original battery lasted 25 days. I then purchased three batteries from MyBatterySupplier. These three batteries lasted 34, 35 & 26 days. I subsequently purchased four batteries from Beiter Battery and Auto Electric. I have replaced three of these batteries so far. I am currently running on the third one. The first two replacements lasted 10 and 13 days. I paid over four dollars each for these two batteries and have obtained one-half to one-third of usage from them. The remaining two batteries from my four battery order have yet to be evaluated. One is in the Oximeter and the fourth one is queued up.I am giving MyBatterySupplier another try. I just ordered six batteries from them and two from Value Twist. MyBatterySupplier charges over four dollars each for the batteries and zero shipping. My out of pocket per battery was $4.65. Value Twist charges around two dollars for the battery and over four dollars shipping. My out of pocket per battery was $6.96.There you have it.Rod
