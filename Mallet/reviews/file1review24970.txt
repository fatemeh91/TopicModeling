review/text: I have been ttc for over a year. My periods are somewhat normal, but I do not ovulate regularly. I have read so many wonderful reviews about Fertilitea, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the tea last week and just received it Friday. I started taking the tea on last Saturday. I drink 3 cups a day. Hopefully, soon I will have great news to share with you all.
