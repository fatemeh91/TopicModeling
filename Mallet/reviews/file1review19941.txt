review/text: After 3 weeks of use maybe 1-2x/day, the rubber handle is separating from the rest of the potty. I just began hanging it from a hook, so maybe that had something to do with it. This isn't a problem that I read in any of the reviews I perused, and the instructions on the box say to hang it on a hook. I am returning it and hoping for better luck with the replacement.Other than that, my daughter loves this. She's 18 mo old, 21 lbs, and fit it quite well. We only managed to catch her doing her business using it once though. The product fit very well on my elongated toilet seat and was easy to adjust.
