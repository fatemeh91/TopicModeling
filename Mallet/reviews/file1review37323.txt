review/text: My 15-year-old Wahl clippers were recently dropped on the floor, and one of the blades became broken. I ordered this new set of blades and my clippers are like new again! The blades fit perfectly and they're very, very sharp. They even came with a little tube of oil. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
