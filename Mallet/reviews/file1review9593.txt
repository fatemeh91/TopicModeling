review/text: Before I purchased a box of this I looked up what Mud Pie is and it sounded good. Upon trying one the strongest taste was coffee and sure enough in the ingredients is "Instant Coffee". No one I spoke to has never heard of Mud Pie being inclusive of coffee. Unless you want a java protein bar avoid this.
