review/text: If you've ever seen a 'normal' packet of 200 count gauze, you'd be surprised to see these packets which are half the size of a normal packet of gauze. I was looking for a thin, unfilled gauze to apply a facial toner that came in a small bottle and was quite pricey. Cotton balls used too much product so I was looking for a product like this. Thin it was, but density was thinner than cheesecloth requiring you to use two. I work in healtcare and prob should have ordered from our supplier because the filled and unfilled gauze is a much higher quality. Disappointed. It does the job using two pieces but wasn't quite what I was looking for.
