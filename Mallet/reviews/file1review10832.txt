review/text: Unless you really want to know your body fat percentage on a daily (or weekly) basis, it's not worth the trouble to use that function on the scale. It will take programming for more than one person, and each user, even the primary one, has to go through a few steps to activate the body fat % feature. Too much trouble! It's also fairly lightweight, and moves around on the floor easily. I have a big dog, and when she bumps against the scale, which is in my bedroom, she turns it on. That will run the batteries down a little quicker.
