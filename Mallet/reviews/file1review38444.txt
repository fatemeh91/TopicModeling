review/text: I owned the Emjoi gently gold caress for about a year before upgrading to this model. It is much faster to use than the single rotating tweezer model. Of course that means it's pulling out hairs faster, so I found it a bit more uncomfortable. Still, the time saved was worth it. I recommend this for anyone who wants to use this type of hair removal.
