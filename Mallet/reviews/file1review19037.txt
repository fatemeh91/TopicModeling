review/text: I have Celiac Disease, so was naturally sceptical when I saw the ingredient is "wheat dextrin", under that on the label states"gluten free, less than 10ppm". The Fda says 5ppm is considered GF. I loved the convenience of putting it in coffee in the AM. However part of my disease includes osteo arthritis. Out of desperation I stopped the Benefiber a seek ago & my pain has improved by 50%. I will not try it again.
