review/text: I bought this trio for a friend's baby shower. Once I smelled how mild and pleasant the products were, I had to have a travel trio for myself. I love it! The lotion is great to pack in my purse and the shampoo works wonders on my baby-fine hair, not to mention the light and non-sticky gel. I would definitely recommend The Original Sprout products to anyone.
