review/text: This blades are by far the best I 've ever used...I have very sensitive skin and since using these magic blades, my girl cannot get her hands of my face. Also I used to get a lot of razor bumps in the neck area...however Gillette have taken care of this problem for me. Absolutely the best!!!
