review/text: I bought these pills completely unsure about whether or not they would work. After taking them for about 12 days, I lost 6 pounds! It all came from my mid-section. INCHES were gone! I have had to deal with some extremely stressful events over the last 2 years and had acquired inches of fat JUST around my stomach, to the point where I looked completely disproportional. It was beginning to get to the point where I knew this was no longer healty. NOTHING had made me lose a pound before this. I actually cut down to 700 calories per day and went to the gym 3 times a week and I lost maybe 2 pounds over a month. I have been taking these pills a couple times a day and not even changed my normal routine. I have been having 3 sensible meals per day and been active at least twice a week, which is normal for me. It is like day and night. The pounds still seem to be coming off and I hope to reach my target wait in a couple months! :)
