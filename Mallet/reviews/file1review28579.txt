review/text: I have been using this the ON Gold Standard Whey protein for a few years now. It's the best tasting one I've used. I have tried the double chocolate, Cappuccino, Mint Chocolate and now the Coffee flavors. I like them all, and until I got the Coffee flavor, chocolate mint had been my favorite. The Coffee flavor is the best one I've had so far. Its really really good. Taste like coffee ice cream. Very smooth and creamy. I highly recommend the mint chocolate and coffee flavors.
