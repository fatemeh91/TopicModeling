review/text: I was skeptical on ordering the cartridges online-thought maybe there was a reason they were so cheap. They arrived within a week of ordering and they work great! Same cartridges as found in the store and for half the price! I read in a previous review that the customer received older/dusty packages, but mine were fine. I highly recommend them! Plus, this razor saves a lot of time shaving-and no need for shaving gels/creams.
