review/text: We use Aubrey's shampoo, conditioner, straightener, facial wash, shaving cream, lotion, hair gel, and now we both use their deodorant, although she uses the rose-smelling one from Aubrey Organics. All of their products are amazing, and we use them in any category they sell them in.The smell is superb, and strong enough to be there at the end of an 8-hour workday. LOVE IT!
