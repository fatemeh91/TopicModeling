review/text: This brush is the only one I use and everyday on everything! They last forever, take lots of use and do the job on cat and dog hair. They are far superior to the sticky rollers and cheaper too. I give them as gifts to my friends who have animals and deal with the fine clingy hair of our furry loved ones. I carry one in the car for a final touch to good clothing before attending events as cat hair goes where I go! Buy them in multiples for every room in the house.
