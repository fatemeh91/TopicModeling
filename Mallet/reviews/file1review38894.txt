review/text: For me shaving is always an adventure. I have four kids who bang on the door while I'm in the shower or tub. I was impressed with this razor because even though I have only five seconds to shave, it did a great job, and I didn't get any cuts. I think I'd buy them again because I was very satisfied with how they worked.
