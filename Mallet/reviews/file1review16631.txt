review/summary: Excellent Product, Awesome design/texture! review/text: It came quick and easy along with my Black Matte One. I prefer the textured designed ones just because they don't leave fingerprints but don't be mistaken, Its Brand New and very smooth and shiny. I could've gotten a Black Ebony instead of Matte but that would leave fingerprints. I want to start a collection of non shiny/plain Zippos. Candy Apple Red, Meadow, Cerulean, and Gold Dust. These all have textured designs so they all fit in together.I would recommend any zippo for any reason. It's a hassle always buying disposable lighters over and over and they're not even flashy.Anyways once I received it, I did a few tricks, put in some fluid and done! All working and in one piece, Easy!Camping, Smoking, Casual use, doesn't matter. It doesn't hurt to have one.(Please Purchase Fluid! it does not come with fluid and DON'T COMPLAIN! And fluid is also subject to evaporation so you probably need to refill it once or twice a month depending on how much you use it.)
