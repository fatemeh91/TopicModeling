review/text: This soap made me break out in a rash everywhere I used it. I do not have insurance and I thought I would try to get around going to the dermatologist, but in the end it cost me more because I had to go to the doctor for the rash this soap caused and the original problem. It was $96 for an office visit(the dr. actually gave me a discount believe it or not) and I got 3 different kinds of meds that cost me $76 total. Just be careful if you use this stuff. Not sure what I had the reaction to because there's alot of stuff in it.
