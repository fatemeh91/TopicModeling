review/text: Re: the July 9, 2009, review that says "the opening where you put the pill is unusually large so that you can put multiple pills in at the same time" --- The 3/16 inch (5 mm) opening between the four "fingers" at the tip is too large to hold in place single small oblong pills parallel to the shaft. And such pills tend to pop out too easily if they are placed in the tip's "fingers" perpendicular to the shaft. So your best option is to put the pill inside the body of the shaft and to keep the dispenser pointed upwards or level to the ground just before pushing in the plunger (which can be difficult to do as your pet is squirming). If your pet needs small oblong pills, a piller / pill gun with a rubbery tip such as Pill Gun orPet Piller Single For Small Petsmay be better for your needs.Otherwise, however, the item is very good. You can put your thumb and forefinger between the two diamond-shaped plastic pieces encircling the shaft, which gives a secure grip. It's sturdy and should last a long time. I don't agree with the June 26, 2009, review that says "it will only work if your knock your cat unconscious before trying to administer the pill."
