review/text: I thought this stuff was pretty nasty at first. Even after shaking it up well and diluting 1 scoop with 10 oz skim milk, it still had a bad aftertaste and I had to gulp it all down at once. After a couple of weeks, this stuff started to taste great, like real chocolate milk, which I know a lot about since that's one of my favorite drinks. It's creamy and delicious, I love it. The only thing is that you can't just shake it up and pour it into a glass. You have to keep shaking it every time you take a sip. If you choose to spoon stir it, it's even worse - you have to stir like crazy, take a sip, and then stir again, otherwise it comes out of solution.I was once out of milk and had to drink this stuff in water. I've never drank out of the toilet, but there is not a doubt in my mind that toilet water would be tastier than this stuff in water. Make sure your fridge is always stocked with milk.
