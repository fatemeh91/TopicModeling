review/text: great product, best protein powder for the price. as for the banana flavor it got to become a chore to drink it. I had the chocolate before and i drank it everyday without any problem. I would recomend getting vanilla and maybe adding a banana to it. the banana flavoring just wasn't very appealing day after day.
