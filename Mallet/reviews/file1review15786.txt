review/text: The Cross Tech3 series pen is one of the best multi-functional pens I have ever used. The pen is incredibly affordable due to Amazon and the money is well worth it. I have used it for about 3 weeks now I am not disappointed at all with the device.Pros -Multi-FunctionalWrites Nice and Smooth(Fine Tip Pens)(Smoothest Pencil I Ever USed)AffordableElegant DesignCons -Thin, gets uncomfortable after a while.Twist Dial, while it is nice and spins freely I found it a little too unstable when writing.
