review/text: I'm not sure what I was expecting from this 'rescue' spray after seeing Dr. Oz endorse how wonderful it was to help ease anxiety (which I do suffer from) - and that this is what his family uses. Happy to hear that this was an all natural spray that is discreet to use, I thought I would try it. I can't say that it doesn't work, but I'm not sure I feel any different after taking it. I can't define if the spray is actually helping to calm the anxiety, or that simply by knowing that I've had some is 'calming' in itself. The only suggestion I can make it to try it...it might work better for you than it has for me!
