review/text: I had three corns in different areas under my feet. Tried many, many things (including Dr. Scholls' liquid, patches etc) but none would actually take work till the end to remove the corns. Pedifix is actually quite strong, but its very convenient to use since its a stick and thats why I could use it even on the one corn that was in between my toes. None of the other patches, liquids or stuff could be applied there. I absolutely love this thing. As a matter of fact I still have 80-90% of the stick unused (even after removing 3 corns).
