review/text: Purchased along with some quality earplugs - travel this year includes Costa Rica and Iceland, so between the sound of monkeys and 24/7 sunlight in Iceland (in summer), it was time to upgrade my travel sleep system.As a travel mask this is excellent, as it's lightweight and super packable. Most importantly, it doesn't interfere with my sleep by putting pressure on the face... you don't really know it's there. As others have mentioned, a small amount of light can come in around the nose area but I adjusted it and don't have this problem.I don't use an eyemask at home, so this is just for sleeping in an unfamiliar situation. Recommended.
