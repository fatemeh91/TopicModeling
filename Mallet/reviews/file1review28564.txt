review/text: I have been taking optimum nutritions whey protein for a couple of years now. I love this product and works miracles for the body. I have tried, double chocolate, rocky road and cookies and cream. I loved the dc and cc so i decided to try the rocky road. This flavor is not as good as the other two. I bought a 5 lb tub of it and am now regretting this flavor. stick to the flavors you like.
