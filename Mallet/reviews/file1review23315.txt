review/text: Works great. I don't honestly understand people reviewing this product here and complaining about the handle. The handle works fine if you follow the directions, meaning you have to put the handle on a hard surface vertically after assemblage and knock on it a few times with a hammer to really have them firmly attached together. Really easy and simple, people are just too lazy or not paying attention to the assembly instructions.Great price and works as advertised.
