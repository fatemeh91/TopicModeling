review/text: All of the toothbrushes I received were in working order.My daughter loves the glitter inside, and loves the blinking mechanism (we've used Firefly toothbrushes for a while now.) The characters inside the little "snow globe" are a little odd looking (I wish it were a more gender-neutral, plain firefly!) The wide handles are very easy to hold onto.Each toothbrush comes w/ its own stand...a pair of cartoon-style feet! The stand is cheap plastic, but its adorable and does its job.I still think I prefer the plain Firefly brushes as they are less gendered.
