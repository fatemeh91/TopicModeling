review/text: I could not be happier at the overall performance of every Sennheiser product ive ever tried, but ofcourse its Sennheiser. Ive had a pair of HDR 85 headsets for over 2 years now, and ive been through about 15-16 batteries now ! . If Sennheiser didnt make such a great headset i would have gone to a new company more than a year ago.
