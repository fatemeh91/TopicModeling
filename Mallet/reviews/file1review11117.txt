review/text: I'm a vitamin C believer and try a lot of kinds. A friend recommended this, so I tried it. It's really easy to drink and as far as I can tell, it works. When i feel a cold coming on, or feel worn down, it seems to perk me up. Of course it's very subjective, but I now drink one every day. I prefer it to tablets, because it seems more &#34;real&#34; and I get a refreshing drink at the same time.
