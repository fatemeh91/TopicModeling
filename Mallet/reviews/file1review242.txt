review/text: This is a good toy. It has powerful vibrations and the speed and intensity of the rotating beads are equally as strong. This vibe is made of a kind of hard rubber (not so hard that it would hurt you). I was hoping it was jelly instead but it's still worth the money. Other than that my only complaint is that I wish it had the pulsating feature, but I can't really complain because for the amount of money you spend on this toy you will def be satisfied.
