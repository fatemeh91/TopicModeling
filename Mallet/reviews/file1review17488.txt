review/text: Does its job in terms of actually trimming the beard for the most part.Pros- Cheap price- Mostly does its jobCons- Does not shave close at all, leaving a lot of stubble even if you remove the attachment.- Only 1 attachment type.- Does not hold a charge at all...can charge it all night and it will run out of power after the next use or so.- Also does not use power from the outlet if you leave it plugged in. Will run out of power as usual, forcing you to delay your shave or use another method.- Cheaply made...it slipped off my counter top, not much more than 4 feet, and the head snapped off, which ended its life.I'd go with another option that at least FEELS less cheaply made but for around the same price.
