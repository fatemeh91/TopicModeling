review/text: This is a brilliant little trimmer. The scroll wheel is excellent, I keep my beard at a 3 and my mustache at a 2, which is plenty long/short (depending on how you look at it) enough for a well-maintained beard very appropriate for the workplace. I've been using it for almost an entire year now, and the blades are still very sharp, no pinching whatsoever. Also, I think I've only had to charge it a handful of times - the battery life is tremendous. It feels very sturdy and almost waterproof, when I go on trips I just throw it in my backpack and fish it out later. My only complaint is that it doesn't work very well with the guard removed. I can't get the shave I want on my neckline, but then again no electric shaver I've ever used has done that, so it's not really a knock. Very efficient as well - I find I only have to make one pass, two at most to get an even trim, which means it takes about two minutes to complete my facial grooming in the mornings.
