review/text: I don't know if this product works or not. I didn't notice anything, but I let my daughter use it when she has trouble sleeping (she's six and has nightmares) and it works like a charm, but maybe it's a placebo. I'll most likely get more if only to help her sleep (which in turn helps me sleep).
