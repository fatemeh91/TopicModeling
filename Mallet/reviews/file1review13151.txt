review/text: I put this under my elderly cat's litter box because she was peeing on the floor. It perfectly protected the floor and was easy to clean and dried quickly in the drier. It was slow to dry hanging on the line, due to the plastic liner. I can't imagine sleeping on it but it was great for my wood floors.
