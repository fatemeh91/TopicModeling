review/text: My old one got some danish oil leaked all over it, gluing the bristles together on one side.I looked around at other alternatives and decided in the end to repurchase the same thing. This one has a sharp cylindrical shape to the bristles, to get over into the corners of a cylindrically shaped glass. The blue colored bristles are a little stiffer than the white ones.The skinny neck and soft bristles mean that you can fit this brush down into a variety of bottles and vases.
