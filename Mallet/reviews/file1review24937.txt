review/text: After trying to get pregnant for 5 months (my first child took 2) I got impatient and decided to give Fertilaid a try. I had completely normal cycles before and was ovulating every month ( I have the Clear Blue Easy Ovulation monitor). Three months into using fertilaid and although my cycle is about the same, I haven't ovulated in 2 months! I should have believed the people who said that if your cycles were normal that you shoudln't use it. I am so bummed about the time and money that I have wasted on this!
