review/text: Love this protein powder. I've had a hard time finding a protein powder that didn't taste way too artificial, chalky or too sweet. This double chocolate is fantastic. I mix with regular milk or with almond milk in a shaker ball bottle, and it gets mixed easily. The extra protein has made my hunger/blood sugar levels so much better in the afternoon. Highly recommended!
