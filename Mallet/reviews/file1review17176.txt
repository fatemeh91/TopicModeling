review/text: Compact and pretty light trimmer. I've only started growing a beard the past couple of months but this trimmer makes it easy for a novice. Nine ( 9! ) different trimming levels means you can customize to whatever size you want.Battery lasts a good while too, wish it lasted longer (my only complaint).
