review/text: I usually use the Soft-Picks, but purchased Brushpicks because the pricing is much better. First time I used one, I poked my gum. Ouch!So I'm more careful now and they do work well. I have a broken tooth waiting to be fixed in a month. It collects whatever I eat and the Brushpicks do a great job of cleaning it out.I do like the case. They do not spill and dispense easily.
