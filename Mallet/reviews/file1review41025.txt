review/text: All I can say is wow! This stuff really is potent. If you workout, had a long night or just feel tired, pop a bottle and have half of it and you will no what I am talking about. Having said that, this is definitely NOT for everyone! If regular energy drinks (Red buu, Rockstar etc et) work for you then just have quarter of a bottle and see how you feel, it is VERY IMPORTANT you don't drink the entire bottle at once, this is no Redbull people! This is strong stuff so BE AWARE! It's a great pre workout drink as it really gives you the energy to get a great workout! Also time yourself so if you go to bed normal sleep hour I would not drink this after mid afternoon! It will guaranteed to keep you up!Pros:Works extremely well.Gives you the energy you need.the MOST effective energy supplement out there!Con:Side affects like faster heartbeat and shakes (if you drink the entire thing).Taste is OK nothing to write home about.
