review/text: I check my number every day and this little ph strip is a wonder. It really lets me know from day to day or morning to evening how my alkaline diet is doing or not doing. I can tell what foods really work and what foods really need to be avoided. I just put it into my mouth for a second or two and check. I know websites say you need a blood test or such to be 100% accurate on one's ph but this little gauge does a good job from a day to day level in giving me a good idea how good I am doing or how poorly I am doing. If I eat something strong in corn syrup sweetener (example pumpkin pie or some fruit juices) my number the next day or later that evening has dropped. This is an excellent way to help anyone realize how they are doing with the alkaline diet or how badly they are acid. Cancer cannot live in an alkaline body so I am really interested in making sure I keep a strong alkaline body with my veggies, fruit, and beans--the natural diet. The processed diet of packaged "foods", high processed juices, and strong corn based diets is a one way ticket to the acid body and acid reflux problems and a future life heading toward cancer, the end product of an acid diet. So I will continue to buy these strips. I'm always elated to see my numbers in the 8 and higher colors; those cultures with alkaline water as a lifestyle have body ph's of 8+ and have no cancer and live healthy lifestyles well into their 90's disease free. So that is my goal. This summer marks my first year of being strong alkaline and my body behaves so much different than other years of my life. It is an amazing difference from the high acid diet I used to life on. These strips have made it very clear what works and what doesn't and cued me when I didn't eat right and what the price tag was or would be eventually. The differences in how my body works and behaves now is incredible for the diet changes made.
