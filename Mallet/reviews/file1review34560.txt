review/text: I bought these in Ivory. For the 20-30mmHg compression they claim to be, they're not. PLUS that silicone band that they have for the thigh is a joke. My stockings ended up at my knees half way into my shift. They're expensive but they look and feel cheap. The worst is that the medical supply (Surgical World, Hollywood, FL) where I bought them from, said that they have never heard any complaits. Well, there's a first time for everything. I do not recommend these. I should've followed my gut instinct and spend my money on another pair of Truform surgical weight.
