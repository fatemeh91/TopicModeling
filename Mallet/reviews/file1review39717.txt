review/text: I've been using men's shaving gels for a few years and this product does very well. My skin is sensitive and this does the trick for me. I loved the results! It went on very smooth and thick. It kept me from nicks and cuts that I usually get when I use a woman's shaving gel. My hair on my legs is very coarse and requires a product that will allow me to shave without any problems. The only thing I didn't care for was the scent, but I understand that the product is for men. I like it and I will purchase it in the future!
