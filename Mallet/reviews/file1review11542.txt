review/text: I bought these batteries as replacements for a set of NiMH batteries I had bought a few years ago at Radio Shack which had finally reached end of life. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the batteries I had just retired held a charge longer than these! I cannot understand why any company would manufacture a product as worthless as this. I first thought that my digital camera had developed a defect which caused the batteries to drain within only 3-5 days. However, the same effect occurs in other devices or even if I just store them. I was impressed by the claimed capacity of 2650 mAh but what good is that capacity if you have to use it all within a few days? Don't waste your money on these!
