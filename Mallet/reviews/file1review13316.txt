review/text: After numerous others this product takes the "cake"! It actually stays put (on a twin & king) with out the need for the available "tuck-in" versions. It's waterproof & washes & dries easily. I FINALLY don't have to change my son's sheets or ours (he always ends up in our bed at some point)! I'm extremely happy with this purchase! Get 2, one to wash-one to "wear".
