review/text: We had great hopes for this -- because my wife's belly was hurting toward the end of the day. We waited anxiously for the mail delivery and kicked ourselves for not shipping it overnight.Upon trying it out, the belt was too tight to be comfortable sitting (even though my wife was in the lower end of the weight range for the size she ordered). This presented the problem -- when going out shopping, do you wear it or not?? It can't be easily removed. so we ended up not using it, and wish we never had purchased it. It helped somewhat when standing -- if that is all you do all day. But for the average person, there must be a better designed belt.
