review/text: I thought this was working really well since when I pumped I was getting a lot more very easily. After the first week my 3 week old gained 4 oz which was good since she hadn't gained any. But then we went at 5 weeks and she only gained 4oz again after 2 weeks. So now I supplement each feeding with 2 oz of formula.
