review/text: These pills along with mastic gum have freed me of reflux almost completely. I have been using them for 3 weeks and from the 1st day I noticed a difference, then on week 2 I added the mastic gum and that made all the difference. I went from eating very little because everything gave me that horrible feeling that something was stuck in my throat to eating normal again. Im very thankful for this product.I take 1 or 2 before each meal.Oh and the taste is great. Ive read that some of the other dgl products taste bad but this one taste like a smooth chocolate.
