review/text: I've had GERD for about 25 years. I've been on every prescription med available and am currently taking Aciphex which barely helps. I tried this because of the favorable reviews and because I'd done some on-line research and found that the active ingredient in "Heartburn Free" has been subjected to scientific testing and found to be beneficial to sufferers of GERD.It has not helped me. The recommendation is to take one pill every other day. When I do I get very painful flare up about one half hour after taking. I have been taking, and continue to take, a probiotic supplement. The probiotic did not work, either- alone or with this product. I will discontinue both once the supply runs out.As other sufferer's have gotten relief, I hope that I am in the minority and that you will get relief, too.
