review/text: Omni solutions sent us " Essesntial Cleansing Solution" instead of " Special Cleansing gel" and then they sent the replacement via regular First Class mail and it reached us after like 3 weeks because of postal delays. I would have thought they would send it through a faster service sinc eit was their fault. I would avoid them in the future.
