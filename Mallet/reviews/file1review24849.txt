review/text: I decided to order Fertilaid and bought three bottles (three months) worth. My cycles can be very long, so I was hoping that Fertilaid would help me regulate my cycles and ovulate earlier (I've had a cycle that was 124 days!!!). I decided to order it amongst the good reviews I saw on the Fertility Friend community circle.I took it for 55 days with no regulation of my period. I haven't even really felt different taking it, or felt like it was doing anything worthwhile to me. I'm on cycle day 58 now (started Fertilaid on cycle day 3 and stopped on cycle day 57). My prior cycle was only 47 days, so Fertilaid isn't really helping me all that much for having shorter cycles.I'm going back onto my regular prenatal vitamins in hopes that my cycle will become "normal".I hate to make this a low review, as I had high hopes that it would help regulate my cycles and assist with TTC. I really shouldn't have to spend loads of money on each bottle for it to take many months to actually do anything for me.I plan on trying some other ways of assisting with regulating my cycles. I hope anyone who takes this sees their cycles improve. Baby dust to all.
