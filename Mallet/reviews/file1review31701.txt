review/text: Somehow this product is not well known here as I think is not marketed well by the german manufacturer.I first bought this great product in Singapore when I was on a holiday as I ran out of my Gilette deodrant.I was astonished to see the quality and genteless and longivity as it stays 24h as stated.I wish these are available like in WalMart, K-Mart etc., someday as they are available only thru some online retailers like Amazon.com, Drugstore.com and a few others.Buy it if you see this product an you wil not be dissapointed!
