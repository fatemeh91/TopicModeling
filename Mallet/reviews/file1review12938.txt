review/text: I bought 2 of these and I love them. They are absolutley great and sure saves time on having to wash the sheets and mattress pad over and over again. When there is an accident, it does not leak through the pad, it is soaked up! The only con, which is not that big of deal, is that they do move but because I got the bigger ones there is rarely an accident that gets on the sheets. I was going to get the ones that tucked it, but I thought that would be just as annoying as have to change the sheets because you had to tuck them in on both sides and when the bed is against the wall, it makes it more difficult. I would 100% recommend this sheet protector.
