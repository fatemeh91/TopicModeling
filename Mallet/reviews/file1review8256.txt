review/text: This brush, is so much nicer then many we have owned before for cleaning our Coffee Thermos and Air Pot thermal containers. Getting down to the area of a confined space, is never what anyone wants to tackle without the proper reach and design of a kitchen tool, made to do the work better, faster, and last longer.I and the Wife, can recommend this brush over many we have had or used before. We now have one for both the camper and our home.
