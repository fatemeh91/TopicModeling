review/text: Benefiber is the best fiber supplement product I've ever tried out (and believe me, I've tried most of them!). Not only is it lightweight and easy to use, I love that it dissolves completely in all liquids. You might need to stir it a little more if using cold water, but it will dissolve. I like that it has no flavor, no scent and does not alter the texture of the water/liquid that you dissolve it in.I have it every morning in my green tea and it certainly helps to maintain my GI system for those days that I don't get enough fiber from food.
