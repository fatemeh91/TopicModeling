review/text: When I first got this mirror I was so disappointed that it would not stick to my mirror without feeling like it was going to take the mirror down with it. (I have a mirror that hangs on the wall like a picture). I thought how am I going to use this? Then I realized that I could stick it down onto my vanity top (counter) and adjust it so I could see the back of my head. It can become a bit heavy if you hang it on a wall mirror and plan to telescope it far out. This solves that problem and it works wonderfully. It's a bit expensive but I can't find anything else like it. If you need to see the back of your head or need a magnifying mirror this is a great item.
