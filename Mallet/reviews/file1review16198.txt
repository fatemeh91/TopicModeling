review/text: This is a very good quality light weight brace that provides good steel spring side support to the knee while keeping the knee cap in place and maintaining front and back flexibility. It is better than those custom knee braces which cost several hundred dollars and are so heavy - almost unwearable. Slip resistent inner lining is very nice and straps can be tightened to your personal comfort level. And the brace is washable.Definitely worth a try before you go for those several hundred dollar custom braces. This brace can be used by people with chondromalacia patella, ligament and meniscus injuries and some with painful knee implants.
