review/text: Before I bought this, I was resorting to squirting a little shaving cream out of a tube, and loading the brush on the palm of my hand. I felt like I was wasting a lot of soap this way. Now, I feel like I'm much more in control of the amount of soap I'm using. I would have liked to have had a choice of the fragrance, but considering how cheap these bars of soap are, it's not really a big deal to buy a different one.
