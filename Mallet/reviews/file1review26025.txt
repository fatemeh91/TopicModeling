review/text: I purchased a bottle 100 Vcaps, and the vitamin E was in the form of d-alpha tocopherol succinate, a pure ALPHA form and NOT the much superior mixed forms of vitamin E. The various products listed here are NOT all the same.Look at the zoomed labels for each before you buy. I am a college professor who teaches an upper level nutrition course, and I PERSONALLY feel the evidence to date suggests that the only the MIXED should be used as a supplement. The Dr. Weil brand is one such product, as are SOME of these options on this page. Order with care! Amazon, check into this.
