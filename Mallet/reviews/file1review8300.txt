review/text: Finally a sturdy brush that does the job. Went with the previous reviews and am very satisfied. Obviously it doesn't take much to make me happy. I use tall 1/2 gallon bottles all the time and this brush gets all the nooks and crannies. Always throw in a little baking soda for starters.Another one of life's little problems solved. It's the little things that count the most.
