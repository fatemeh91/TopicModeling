review/text: This is "the big guns" support contraption needed if you have a big baby or twins in the works. I had two kids in 13 months at the age of 41. On top of that, I work as a chef and am on my feet a lot. Both my babies were almost 10 pounds at birth. My back and pelvis were killing me during the last couple of months with my second pregnancy. In fact, I was in agony every day the last few weeks before birth with every step with shooting pain.This belt did not solve all my problems but it did make life a little easier to live. As far as women complaining about the straps, yes they are hard to hide under clothes. BUT, I do not know about you, I would wear a clown costume out in public everyday if it made my pregnancy a little more bearable.
