review/text: It has 4 legs and that creats stability (even in all weather conditions) which is how a cane should be. Also the metal is strong and it is easy to adjust to the height. The handle/grip is ergonomically correct and made of good material. This cane will last for a generation (or two). I got this for my grandmother and uncle and they both approve.
