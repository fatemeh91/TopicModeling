review/text: After surgery and in response to some meds, my husband had some episodic "leakage," and used these guards as necessary. He found them to be very effective re absorbency and comfort. The "glue" should cover a larger area..The only problem was with them not sticking as well as they should have. These are not to be used instead of actual incontinence aids because of the limited amount of absorbency..could be used in addition for increased protection.
