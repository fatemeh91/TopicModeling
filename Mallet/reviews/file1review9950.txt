review/text: About two weeks ago I got a very small metal splinter embedded in one of my fingers when I picked up an old office magnifying glass that had a corroded metal trim piece.I used my conventional tweezers and managed to break off a piece, leaving an even smaller piece that I could hardly see still in my finger. My conventional tweezers could only push it further into my flesh, so I quit trying to get it out.It wasn't doing any harm, surrounded by upper skin layers, so I looked for the best tweezers I could find and ordered these.I got them a few days ago at work and within a few minutes I had that teeny tiny splinter out of my finger. These are great!
