review/text: The body back buddy works just as advertised. It's good for working out those tight spots and also if you just need to scratch in those hard to reach places. The one piece of advise that I'd offer would be to get the Trigger point therapy book. It helps show you exactly where that tension in your body comes from and exactly how to alleviate it. Great product (although it does look an erotic toy, something which the Marines I work with have let me know on more than one occasion).
