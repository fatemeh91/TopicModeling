review/text: Reviewer's primary use is female (self) to male contact.Pros: Made with medical grade platinum silicone (hypoallergenic);DISHWASHER SAFE and boil-able;No plastic taste;Bulb fits and stays pretty well (but better with practice);Ridges on bottom of shaft stimulate cl*t during intercourse;Also fun for one person play, although dp with bulb & shaft is nearly impossible;Shaft was stiff enough to make an*l penetration easy & enjoyable;Removable vibrator is great little bullet, fun in & out of toy, by self or with partner;Feels good for wearer and receiver;100% Made in America.Cons: I prefer a softer toy for vaginal use (but that isn't my primary use);Seam along the middle of the silicone from the mold (but again another thing only noticed during vaginal use);Wish it was longer- with bulb inserted, max insertable shaft length is aprox. 7.5 inches.Overall, definitely worth the money. Easy to clean, fun to use- what can I say, I love my surrogate penis!
