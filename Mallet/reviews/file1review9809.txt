review/text: These are simply the highest quality tweezers I have ever seen or used. This particular model has precision ground sharp points, which are designed to penetrate the skin's surface and pull out ingrown hairs. With a little practice, you will find that these work excellent. This item is well constructed, cleans up easily and should last a very long time. Tweezerman includes a lifetime sharpening deal in the package. Tweezers like these should be kept away from little ones, as the points are needle sharp. They come with a protective cover for the end, which is good to prevent accidental impalement, especially if you put them in a pocket. If you need regular tweezers, look into the other Tweezerman products, such as the slant end type, which have the same high quality and excellent warranty. A great item at a fair price - definitely recommended.
