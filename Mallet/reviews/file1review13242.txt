review/text: I love this product because it's big enough to fit the wideth of both a full and a queen bed. It's easy to wash and stays in place on the bed.The only compliant I have is that it's makes the bed a little hot for the kids..so in the summer time they get a little sweaty from this pad,but it's great for the winter and cold months.
