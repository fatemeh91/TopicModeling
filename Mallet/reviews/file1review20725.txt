review/text: These are the best I can find since Amazon no longer distributes the conveen 4 oz pads (where you insert your entire junk into the pouch - but it worked). These are more comfortable, absorb light drips, can sometimes get folded in on themselves depending how you sit/move around and how they were positioned - but the biggest issue is thye can leak. Reaason is look on the inside and there is a separation between the pad halves right down the middle starting at about the center. I thought it was a defective batch, but all the boxes had them. But, like I said, these are the best I have found far and for me are better than dual pills or a medtronic implant. Much better than explaining to your dry cleaner to treat extra the inside of your suit pants.
