review/text: The Oral B Hummingbird is completely useless as a floss or toothpick replacement. The picks and flosser heads are better used without the hummingbird if anything. If you purchase this item you will simply be recieve a device with a "cute" appearance that vibrates like a pager but does nothing to help clean your teeth. Honestly, I do not recommend anyone purchasing this product unless they want to use it as a display item on your desk.
