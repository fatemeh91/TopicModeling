review/text: I LOVE this stuff, and am soo disappointed that it's discontinued. I can't imagine why, because it is so rich, emollient, moisturizing, and has a very subtle, warm honey and bee's wax fragrance. It is technically "fragrance-free", but it still smells so healthy and natural. I love it.If you have the change to buy it, you must! It's a winner.
