review/text: I used less to do the same amount of shaving. It lathered up well -- and it protected and allowed for a closer shave. It doesn't have a perfume smell or dry out my skin. The can's hard to open if your hands are wet, and the spout will sometimes dispense a little more shaving cream after you've finished using it.
