review/text: I really enjoyed the Balance Bar 40-30-30, Naturally, Yogurt Honey Peanut flavor. They were better than I expected and I will definitely buy them again. I especially enjoyed the fact that much of the protein was from soy, which has many health benefits. It was an easy, delicious, and quick way for me to integrate more soy into my diet. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick, healthy snack.
