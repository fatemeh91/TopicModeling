review/text: I've been a Braun customer for some time, using their electric toothbrushes, updating as new products come along. The new Oral-B Triumph is just that...a triumph of design and engineering. I feel, when finished brushing, that my teeth are cleaner than even previous Braun products have managed. The signaling every so many seconds (to move to a different quadrant of the mouth) is really neat...and the larger brush head has been no problem at all. There may be those who disagree, but I've felt, but never more than with this new product, that the electric toothbrush does so much more for the maintenance of my teeth and gums than the standard toothbrush...the Triumph hopefully will allow me to keep my own teeth in my mouth for an even longer period of time.
