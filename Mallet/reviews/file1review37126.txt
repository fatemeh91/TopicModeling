review/text: I used to use only Johnson & Johnson Easy Access Flossers, but they don't produce these anymore. Thus, I tried to find similar ones and found this Humming Bird. I don't even use the base unit. I use it just for molar teeth; due to its angle, it's easy to access them. I also use G-U-M Eez-Thru Flossers (strong like Humming Bird) that are flat thus easy to access front teeth, and DenTek Floss Picks, Silk Easy Angle (weak, angled and soft) for wisdom teeth. I don't throw them away after using only once. I use them like a tooth brush because as long as they are dry, almost no microbs can live on them.
