review/text: Unless your foot and leg are equal to or less than the diameter of the compession stocking (which would defeat the purpose of compression stockings and provide no compression) do not purchase this item. The stocking is stronger than the stocking aid and shrinks the opening to the smallest diameter of the stocking opening, making it impossible to slip your foot into the opening, let alone insert your lower leg. If you can insert your foot, pulling the stocking aid results in the removal of the aid without pulling up the stocking. Exhausting work and not returnable. The label says: Due to health and sanitary issues, this item may not be returned, exchanged. What a racket!
