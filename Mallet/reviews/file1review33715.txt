review/text: I bought this lotion (from another website) because it contains alpha lipoic acid, one of my favorite anti-aging skincare ingredients. The lotion is lightweight, refreshing, neither oily nor overly dry after it absorbs into the skin, & the light citrusy scent is uplifting & enjoyable. I like the good ingredients in this lotion (except for the parabens!). Two ounces lasts a really long time for me because I use this primarily as a hand lotion at work rather than for my face, though sometimes I use it on my face too if it feels particularly parched.The bottle is great packaging too - frosted glass pump bottle that can be reused, & the dispenser swivels open/closed so there's no extra cap needed. I got this for $22 just 3 months ago & suddenly I see that the price jumped $5-$6 at the place from where I bought this - that's disappointing! But I like the lotion enough to likely repurchase even at the higher price (though unhappily).
