review/text: We are using this for baby bottle brush. The bristles are just perfect in stiffness. It is easy to use as it slides smoothly in and out of the bottle. From what I read from other reviews, this brush is also great on Nalgene water bottles. The handle is made of rubber and very comfortable. It is a little long compared to other brush bottles we tried before but that doesn't pose a problem at all.Overall, it is a well made brush.
