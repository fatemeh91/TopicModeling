review/text: Like most things Panasonic, this thing broke down after about a year. Even when it worked, it was uncomfortable to use because even with fresh batteries it pulled hairs as much as cut them. It's cheaply made, and in spite of its premium price, it's a lousy product. Don't waste your money.
