review/text: I ordered this product, but I have read in more than one book that these drops have been proved ineffective. The control group was given water and it worked just as well. It makes you feel so much better as a parent to be doing something... but check out the studies. Unfortunately this product does not work.The saline drops sold by the same company are good, however.
