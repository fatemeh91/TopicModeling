review/text: I was disappointed to find that i received what appears to be a used broom. Is this what companies do? They take advantage that we as online customers do not have access to seeing the actual product and so they send used/not-as-new products that cannot be sold on the floors??The broom works like it should. But looking at the bristles and the dustpan, it is apparent the broom was used. There is dust/lint on the bristles and the dustpan has scratch marks. The broom box itself shows signs of tear, like it was used again.
