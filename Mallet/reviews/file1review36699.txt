review/text: Although I ordered this product, I was sent the Mentadent with baking soda instead. I don't really care. I've used Mentadent for years and like it very much, although this is the first time I've had this variety. I like it, too. The toothpaste is very good, IMO, however what I really love is the delivery system. If I could buy refillable dispensers like this I certainly would. Since I've been unable to buy any Mentadent toothpaste locally, I'm pleased to have found some on Amazon.
