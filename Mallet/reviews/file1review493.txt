review/text: What would you like to know? LOL does it get the job done? YES!!!!!!!!!! The vibration is amazing. Pretty intense!!! I love the material as well. Very soft. It just glides in so there is no need for lubrication. In case you dont have any or lost it, if you know what i mean lol Sorry, i dont know how graphic we can be so? All i can tell you is that it is a veryyyy good toy specially for the price. Easy to clean. The beads aren't as strong as I thought they would be (like my other roy) but they definitely work! The size is just perfect! I loved the color too. I got it in blue. Cutest thing ever haha. Not too loud either. Easy to operate, the lights turn on in a row setting so you can see what speed is on. I recommend this for sure. You wont be disappointed! ALSO! LADIES: dont forget that we are all different. It's called anatomy. Keep that in mind. So what might work for some, might not work for you. Don't just go by reviews. Get whatever works for your own body!
