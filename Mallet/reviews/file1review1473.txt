review/text: It is all in the title. It is nothing more than applying chapstick to the affected area a few times a day. Yes, it may take a few weeks depending on the stage of your wart; however, the painless procedure is worth the results. Plus look at the price! cheapest stuff on the market. No Pain. No Wart. I'll take it!!!
