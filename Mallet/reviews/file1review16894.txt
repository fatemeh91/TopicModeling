review/text: This potty does the job, and my son likes it, but it has the following shortcomings:1 - The bottom of the receptacle is high enough that if a big poopy occurs, it touches your kids bottom, meaning more to wipe later on.2- It's easy to take apart, but awkward to clean, and there are bits that get bent when re-assembling, that if bent once all further reassemblies become annoying.3 - The electronics don't like water, so it's awkward to clean without ruining them. To make matters worse, if you have a boy that sometimes misses (even when sitting down), the miss tends to go right onto Elmo's hand, which is the button that you press to make Elmo talk, and is the thing that does not like moisture when you wash it.So, if your kid is a Sesame Street fan, go ahead and get this, but otherwise I would look for something more practical.
