review/text: the product was here fast but there was something weird about it.the bottle is just like the ones i have bought before around town.but it does not taste the same way (compared to the others).maybe its just my imagination but it just taste like bottled water.is there a bottle water like herbalife aloe product?i am sorry for the review if i am wrong.
