review/text: While pregnant, my job required for me to stand on my feet 12-16 hours a day. Ultimately, I had a lot of lower back pain. I was relatively small, so I purchased the small prenatal cradle. It did help a lot with my back, but after about 8 hours it became uncomfortable (tight), where I would take it off. I think for most pregnant women who aren't on their feet for as long as I would, this would be great. It offered a lot of support in the abdomen as well as my back. It is probably unrealistic for a product like this to be comfortable wearing 12-16 hours a day. The best shoes get uncomfortable if you are on your feet for that long. Therefore, I gave it 4 stars overall
