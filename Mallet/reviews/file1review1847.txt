review/text: I have bought A LOT of great things on Amazon. I am very busy and never have the time to write a review. For Fungasoap I am making the time. This was my situation:- 20 month old son had ringworm on his bottom- 2 weeks in (because I didn't really know what it was at first) I started using Lotrimin- 1 week went by with no improvement but didn't get worse either- 2 weeks in it suddenly spread all over his other cheek and was WAY more red- Tried Tea tree oil, rubbing alcohol, vinegar (which bothered him alot) and nothing was helping- kinda made it worseAfter researching OTC creams and home remedies and reading how they almost all failed I was in panic mode. Ringworm researching CONSUMED ME! I found this on Amazon and the reviews sounded promising. Ended up finding a drugstore that carried it about an hour away in my sister in law's city and she was kind of enough to pick up for me. Gave him a salt bath (lots of bath salts and regular table salt)- read that salt takes out the moisture, rinsed him off, scrubbed his butt with fungasoap and rinsed it off, repeated a couple more times before I took him out the tub and BEFORE MY EYES it was getting better!!!! Had a doc appointment the next day that had already been scheduled- his butt was so much better by the next day that when the doctor saw it she thought it was eczema! After less than a week his ringworm was gone completely!!!To all the parents who might be going thru what I just went thru- this stuff is amazing!!! I have already purchased 2 more here to always have it on hand. The seller shipped it out very quickly.
