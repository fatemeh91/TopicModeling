review/text: As my title says, there are a lot better "green foods" type products on the market. Taste is not near as good as Now Foods Phytofoods, Magma Plus or the Green Vibrance I tried.Ingredient list does not hold a candle to any of the three products I mentioned above, and the prices for the three are actually lower per ounce. After multiple trial and errors I decided the Green Vibrance (approx 1 dollar a serving) is the best quality for the money, if you are on a budget the Now Foods Phytofoods has a 2 pound bottle that knocks the price per serving around .50 cents.Still shaking my head why Daily Greens wants almost $30 for 10 ounces for an inferior product.
