review/text: I bought this baby last March, right from the get-go I was shocked with how well it worked. I have a pretty thick beard and it was smoother than any of the last trimmers I've used and I have gone through dozens. I really like that the charger is just a plug into the trimmer and not some base that always breaks. Today I noticed that it didn't charge anymore. 8 months it lasted which doesn't sound like long but honestly that is more than most of the more expensive trimmers lasted as well so I just bought a new one. Can't beat it in terms of value.
