review/text: I bought one of these here over a year ago and really had not much need of it until last week when I burned one of my fingers on a really hot pot. So..I went searching(and hard)for this salve, put it on my aching finger and it took the ache and there is a small scar but not one that is noticeable, so I am grateful for Herbal Ed's for that. I feel this should be in everyone's purse because there is always a need for it.
