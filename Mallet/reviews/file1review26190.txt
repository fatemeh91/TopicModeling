review/text: I have to admit thought that I was looking for a non- sil-a-gel dildo and this one said it was purely latex... unfortunately it is sil-a-gel so in order to play with it I have to use condoms, does smell strongly of its materials when you first open box, just wash it thoroughly and all is well... have fun!
