review/text: I bought this broom online because I am busy and didn't have the time to buy one. However,it arrived tightly wrapped in about three layers of plastic. In the time it took me to unwrap the thing, I could have bought one at the store! So, if you buy one from this company make sure your muscles are flexed and energy is a must!
