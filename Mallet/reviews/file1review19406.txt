review/text: I've never taken a multi-vit but after just a few days I'm feeling more energetic so I think that's a good sign. The pills smell and taste absolutely vile but if you man up and take them with something with a lot of flavor it's not so bad. They don't make my stomach hurt, even if I take them without food, so I think that's a good sign. A mildly entertaining (and kind of gross) thing I noticed is that even a few hours after taking these for the first time they will turn your urine an almost glowing yellow. (It's harmless, but that immature part of me thinks it's funny)
