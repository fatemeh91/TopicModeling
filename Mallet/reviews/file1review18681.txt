review/text: Bought this for my Mom. She had a stroke last summer and has some mobility problems. She fell out of bed recently so I bought this for her so that there would be something that would break a fall. It is most useful though for her having something to hold onto to pull up. With weakness on one side this has made getting in and out of bed so much easier for her. Now she goes to sleep feeling much more secure too with the rail there. It's just the perfect size. A long bed rail would make it more difficult to get in and out of bed. This is perfect because you don't have to take it on and off. Also, the legs that extend to the floor as well as going under the mattress make it very sturdy. If you need one, this is the one to buy!
