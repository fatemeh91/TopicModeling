review/text: I have a bedroom with blinds, but there's a light on in the courtyard of my apartment complex that shines right onto them all night! I purchased this sleep mark instead of spending a lot of money on drapes, etc. When I first put the mask on, I was very impressed! No light came in around or under the edges and it was pitch black. It was also extremely comfortable. The issue came when I tried to sleep with it on--I sleep on my sides. The mask is too thick, and sleeping on my side caused a "lump" where the thickness of the mask came into play. I was up all night readjusting the thing because the band also has a tendency to work its way up. What's more, all night I kept feeling "tickling" from what I thought was a stray hair but turned out to be the bottom of the mask already fraying and a string was the tickle. It's not going to last very long and I've only used it 4 times! $19.99 wasted.
