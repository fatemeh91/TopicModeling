review/text: My husband had a bad hand injury with a broken bone for added discomfort ealier this fall. His hand and fingers kept swelling after the wound healed. While doing physical therapy it was suggested he try a light compression glove to wear throughout the day. I selected this glove after many product reviews. The glove fit well for a large hand. It has a light amount of compression that my husband says is comfortable. He says it is not too warm (note: we live in a cold climate with plenty of cold days & snow). It keeps the swelling down while wearing it. He'd recommend others try this glove. He's worn it every day since getting it and it seems very durable so far. He would recommend others try this product.
