review/text: I ordered this product to help increase my ferritin levels and help with anemia. These are great for that. One caution I would give is to make sure you drink plenty of water if you take these. Beets contain oxalic acid, which in some people can be hard for their kidneys to process as well. So... drink plenty of water.
