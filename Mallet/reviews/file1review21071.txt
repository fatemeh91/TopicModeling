review/text: If your aim to get back to the old school heating pads - this is your pack! I ordered the large size of which covers my whole back from shoulders to waist - I'm 5'3" and weight proportionate. Also my model has the switch which is operated by holding it down - Easy Comfort Switch. A little jerry rigging can give you hours of continuous, intense heat, which is what I'm looking for, for the Edgar Cayce Liver Cleanse. The moist pad (included) works great - even in the bone dry desert, where I live! I gave this five stars - because it IS all that the manufacturers claim it is and therefore worth the money. I have recommended this unit to my friends and it would make a great gift too.
