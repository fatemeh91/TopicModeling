review/text: When I first took the samples of this vitamin given by my nutritionest I felt really energized and good.. then after buying my own and taking it for over a year, I noticed Its just not that good as it use to be. strange thing I noticed, there is no clear plastic seal wrapping for tamper proof on the bottle I purchased from shops or through internet and the opening thats suppose to have the black lettered "Quality seal for your protection" with a seal holding up a ball symbol is on most of all of Nature's Plus tablet vitamins except for the Multi-Vitamin and Mineral for adult and kids and few more. The seal is replaced by red lettered "Sealed for your protection" wich is found in many other vitamins that are not by Natur's Plus. This is very bothersome. I emailed the company and left phone messages about this and have not gotten a response. Should we have to worry about our good multivitamin being tampered with?
