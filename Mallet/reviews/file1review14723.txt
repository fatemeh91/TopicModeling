review/text: My wife and I both have problems with our blood sugar levels. Mine tends to run hihg and her's tends to drop shortly after eating. Fenugreek has helped us keep our blood sugar levels more even. They don't drop quickly or rise too much. There have been several studies done that show this to be true. We have tesetd our levls using a glucometer taking and not taking fenugreek. We take 1000mg in the morning and 1000mg before bed.
