review/text: I've been comparing supplements quite a bit recently, but I'm glad to say that this one is still on my daily consumption list. If you compare the ingredients, you'll notice that there are more than 40 different components. Granted, the amounts and proportions of the non-filler ingredients is lacking, but variety is also very important in a supplement. If you take a look at the Amazing Grass superfood supplement, you'll notice a much higher proportion of non-filler ingredients, but it lacks in diversity. I feel like if you combine those two and perhaps switch off, then you can have the best of both worlds. I've written a nice little supplement article below in my signature if anyone cares to take a look.--------------------------------------------------[...]"Here, have some awesome."
