review/text: Six years ago I bought an earlier model of Omrom blood pressure monitor for my mother (I cannot recall the model number). That model did not have IntelliSense. If my mother did not adjust the cuff properly, then the old model would give an error message. Once the cuff was adjusted exactly in accordance with instructions, the monitor would show the correct readings. The new Omron HEM-711AC monitor with IntelliSense takes the readings in any case, however, if the cuff is not properly adjusted, then the numbers can be awfully wrong. I tried it on myself. First I palced the cuff 1 inch above the elbow (rather than the required 1/2 inch above the elbow), and it displayed a systolic pressure of 159 (this one really scared me - I almost called my doctor). Then I placed the cuff 1/2 inch lower (where it should be), and this time it read 118, which is my normal systolic pressure.Bottomline: if you see a very high systolic reading - don't panic. Maybe your blood pressure is OK, it's just IntelliSense. If you carefully adjust the cuff, then in most cases you would get accurate readings.
