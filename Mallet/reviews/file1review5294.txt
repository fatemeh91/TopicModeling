review/text: My mom gave me these ginger candies during my first trimester when I was pregnant with my second baby and I liked them. The taste was pleasant and although they never totally quelled the nausea, they seemed to at least take the edge off the nausea. And on the times they didn't seem to help, they at least took that horrible pregnancy taste out of my mouth. (Yuck!) I would recommend at least trying them for morning sickness; if it's bad like mine was, try anything you can!
