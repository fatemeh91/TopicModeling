review/text: I have tried darn near every protein supplement on the market. The only ones I can stomach are the Champion Products. I mix mine with cold coffee, ice cubes and truvia and enjoy a smooth chocolaty treat that is good for me. No one in Omaha, Nebraska carries the product so I purchase mine from Amazon. The great taste outweighs the shipping fees that I incur by ordering it on line. I would recommend this to anyone!
