review/text: Well, it does a great job and and my wife's loving it. She likes this better than the older norelco one and the disposable razers. I am a big fan of Norelco shavers... I guess since my wife has no experience with what ever the latest & greatest Norelco epilator she thinks the braun is the greatest.On major flaw though is that it does not have a rechargable battery like the men's shavers. Need to have it plugged in to use it.
