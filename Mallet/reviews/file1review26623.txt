review/text: The Back Booster provides Fantastic support for the lumbar. I have a herniated disk in my lower back and require firm back support whenever I sit for long periods of time. The Back Booster back support feels similar to the lumbar support in the high end cars. You can adjust the firmness simply by adding or reducing air. It fills with a couple of breaths. It packs down so you can carry it in cargo pants pockets. CAUTION. If you use it for flying, do not inflate it until you get to altitude. Pressure changes in the plane may cause the Back Booster to overinflate and pop.
