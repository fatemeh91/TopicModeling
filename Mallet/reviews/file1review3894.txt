review/text: I just bought this product and have been using it for 3 days and already I see a difference. I purposely only did my top teeth at first because I wanted to see if there was a true noticeable difference. I truly see a difference (not glowing white, mind you)so this morning I decided to put the strips on my bottom teeth. After trying to install the strip on my lower teeth is when I also decided to write a review. Before purchasing the strips I read the reviews and I noticed that a few of the reviews said that the strips were hard to place on the teeth. I decided to go forth and purchase them anyhow because the resounding tone was that the strips really did work. Since I only started with my top teeth I felt lucky that they worked and I found that they were not hard to place on my teeth. The strip went on and stayed in one place. However, when i started my lower teeth this morning, I found that I have the same problem as many others...............the friggin strip moves all around your teeth and just when you think you have it right where you want it, you move your tongue and it has rearranged itself. My solution.......use the strips on your upper teeth and use the paste on the lower teeth. I can not imagine fighting with the strips on my lower teeth for 6 more days!Final review...............buy the strips, they really work!
