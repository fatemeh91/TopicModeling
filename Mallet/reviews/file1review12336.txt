review/text: This product (vanilla flavor) does what it's supposed to: provide a very calorie-dense food that's natural (insofar as powdered mass gainers are ever natural--you don't exactly seem them growing in the garden) and tastes good (albeit very sweet). My only caveat is just that it tends to clump a lot when mixed by hand in a Blender Bottle. You can partially circumvent that problem by shaking vigorously and then letting it sit for 15 minutes or so to dissolve further.
