review/text: I wrote all of this in the &#34;packaging question&#34; but it should have been here I suppose. I need instructions. I ordered a mop from Quickie Mfg because I had a quickie mop for 5 or more years and loved it. Unfortunately, it rusted and broke. The mop I had could be rung out by pulling it through a circular ringer. This new mop looks like it should be able to do something like that, but I haven't figured out how. I'm not very technically astute. Now, I can only use it by hand ringing it or just plopping a bunch of water on the floor. Does it have a ringer mechanism and how does it work?
