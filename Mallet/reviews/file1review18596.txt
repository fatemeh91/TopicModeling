review/text: OMRON H003D Large Adult Accessory CuffBought this in 2008 as the blood pressure cuff I previously had was a bit snug on my arm as I was a bit overweight. I purchased this cuff as it said it would work with 13" to 17" arms & I was about 13". Being on the smaller end of the scale I found it to be a tad big for me as. Although I am a larger woman for my height (I'm 5' 2"), I am still petite in arm length, although not in arm diameter.Due to my petite length arm the cuff sits a bit high on my upper arm and doesn't seem to fit well. I just don't have enough shoulder to crook of arm length. I think anyone purchasing this needs to be aware of their arm length before buying. Anyone who needs to purchase petite length shirts or sweaters will probably find this cuff too tall to sit properly on their arms.
