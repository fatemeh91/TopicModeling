review/text: I have used this product when needed for almost 15 years. After a round of antibiotic use or for general cleansing, this product puts back the good bacteria that antibiotics destroy in the digestive track. For some reason the label information is only showing the vitamins also included. On the package itself it shows the pro-biotics that are in it.I just threw out the box I ordered a few weeks ago or I'd list the ingredients. I have ordered 2 more to keep on hand, just in case.It really makes your stomach feel great. And if you use, like I did, 5 scoops in warm water 3 times a day, it will take about 4-5 days to complete the treatment.At one time I used this product for a full month, using less scoops and using more than one box. But at that time I could not eat dairy products at all and my doctor recommended I try this to see if taking this would fix my lactose intolerance. It did. Have been eating dairy with no problems for over 15 years now.
