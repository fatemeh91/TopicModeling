review/text: I have only been taking it for a few days. At first i felt very hyper and became shaky. I wasn't hungry for a while, which is unusual for me, but good nonetheless. I did feel nauseated throughout the day but nothing unbearable. Yes, i was uncomfortable but considering the benefit of losing weight- the light nausea is worth it. My shakiness was rather awkward but that wore off. I had a mild headache a few hours after my second pill of the day but some Tylenol made it go away. Nonetheless, i like it. Some of these side affects from the first few days might just be me adjusting. I have a high tolerance for caffeine and have no health conditions. I think my previous addiction to sodas before i quit helped the tolerance for this high caffeinated pill. I recommend it to any healthy person who is looking for a boost for weight loss. I usually feel sluggish at the gym, but i was bouncing around! Though the nausea did get mildly worse after laying in bed doing nothing for a while. So be careful and enjoy! I cant say anything about weight loss because its only been a few days.
