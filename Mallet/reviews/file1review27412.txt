review/text: I switched from protein plus (jillian's recommended) that i bought at Target to Optimum Nutrition based on a friend's recommendation. He claims it is better, higher in protein isolates. I'm not sure. it has 5.5 grams of BCAAs; PPlus had 5. It has 24 grams of protein vs. 25 of PPlus.I had my first shake tonight. I can say, using the exact same ingrediants, this tastes much better. Seemed to blend better, but that might just be appearances. However, I do like the tastes. Seems to cost about the same also. Not enough of a difference to dicker over.
