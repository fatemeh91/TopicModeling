review/text: I had been suffering from pain in my elbow brought about by a fall. I eventually went to see a doctor, by which time it was too late, as arthritis had set in, due to not treating the elbow early enough. I could not do barbell or dumbbell curls without considerable pain and discomfort, until I bought this just yesterday, despite my wife's skepticism. I have just gotten back from the gym, where I did my standing barbell curl (55lbs) and hammer curls (35lb) and no pain or discomfort. I am very happy, and I am back!
