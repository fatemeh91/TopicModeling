review/text: In my experience with this "NOW" Magnesium Citrate, I have found that if you have any form of inflamatory bowel disease, a little too much of this stuff [amount varies for the individual] will give you a very loose stool. While it is still best absorbed by people with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns compared to other magnesium forms, small doses are indicated, or else you will be staying very near the restroom. That having been said this is the best magnesium product for most people and you get alot for a reasonable price.On the other hand, people with chronic constipation get nothing but good from this product as it makes them very regular very fast.If you need Magnesium in the Citrate form, this "NOW" product is an excellent and reasonably priced choice.While we are still pleased with this product my husband no longer plans to continue using it having Crohns, though I will still be taking it, having enjoyed excellent results for over a year.
