review/text: The Oxo Good Grips Kitchen Brush beats all others that I've ever tried. I've bought it for years at my local Fred Meyer store, but suddenly the only Oxo Good Grips kitchen dish brush they're carrying is the kind that has soap stored in the handle. Since I already have something like that, and don't prefer to do a sinkload of dishes with a soapy brush like that, I prefer this one.When I couldn't find this dish brush at my local store in December, I purchased the "next best thing" I could find. Within one week of normal use, almost all of the bristles were smashed down. Ugh! Since there are no other options in our local stores to find this Oxo Good Grips Kitchen Brush I'm reviewing here, I found the brush on Amazon.com and ordered it through them.Two months later, this Oxo Good Grips brush shown here is still in excellent, brand-new looking condition, with no bristles smashed down from use.I hope I can find this brush here for years to come; I usually buy a new one of these about every 10 months. Oh, and something else I shouldn't forget: this particular Oxo Good Grips Kitchen Brush has a unique angle on the handle that is such a natural feel; it really enables me to scrub inside bottles and tall jars with wide enough mouths. With all other dish brushes I've tried, the angle was "wrong" and really forced me to work harder to scrub things out. This is a great product!
