review/text: Priva's products have stood the test of time in this household. The bed pads that are 8-10 years old look as good (and have worn as well) as the ones I bought about a year ago and I do rotate them, using 3 to 5 each day. The colored pads for the cushioned chairs likewise are attractive and fit unobtrusively in my chairs. Enough said!!
