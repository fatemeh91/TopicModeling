review/text: These are the absolute best inserts for me. My doctor suggested I try arch supports and see if I could find some that helped, and these are perfect (on the red, most firm insert). I have large feet for a woman (size 10 wide), so I get the Men's insoles. Some shoes won't fit well with the inserts in place (as is the case with any insert), but for me it's well worth it. I can't find these in stores anymore, so I'm ordering them off Amazon as long as I can. These are also nice because they weigh less than the gel arch supports, which is helpful with some shoes.
