review/text: I purchased two of these because they were so marked down and because they are organic and that means soft, and they really are. The color is not bright, very creamy since organic is never bleached which is a good thing.After I washed these they shrunk a bit especially the mitt, but I guess that is expected. They are made well, so I think they will hold up well through many baths. Would repurchase but not at full price.
