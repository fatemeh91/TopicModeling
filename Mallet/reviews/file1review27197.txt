review/text: This is the second tub of whey that I've bought from Optimum Nutrition. The first was theOptimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Natural Whey, Chocolate, 5.13-Pound Tub. In the future I'll go back to buying the 100% Natural version because this one is just too sweet. The 100% Natural had just the right amount of sweetness but was not overwhelming. The first time I tried this one I almost gagged because it was so much sweeter. Now, this is coming from a person who thinks most of today's popular cereals are too sweet. It still tastes very good and packs the same amount of protein. Strictly as a protein I'd rate it a 5, but, with the 100% Natural tasting better, I'm only giving this version 4 stars.
