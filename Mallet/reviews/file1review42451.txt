review/text: Fantastik Lemon is a staple cleaning supply in my household. It's a great all purpose cleaner with a scent that I like. I do not use this on granite or marble, but find its very good at cleaning up miscellaneous messes on floors, table tops, etc.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.
