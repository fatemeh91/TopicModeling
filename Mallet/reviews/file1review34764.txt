review/text: I have been using this product for over 10 years now. It has a great scent--clean and masculine, not too strong, a touch of pine. Older people say the scent is reminiscent of English Leather (but not identical), and virtually everybody is complimentary about it. It does work to inhibit underarm odor, but it is not an antiperspirant, and it is not a powerhouse--so if you are very smelly, it might not work for you. It also makes a good everyday cologne. It is a truly naturally derived product, with no synthetic ingredients.
