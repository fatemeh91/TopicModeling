review/text: This product was recommended to me by my lactation consultant and was said to be much stronger than drinking the Mother's Milk tea and more effect than using the More Milk Plus capsules. I followed the directions exactly as followed in terms of not drinking fluids 15 minutes before/after taking this and tried it for a over a week. I barely saw any increases in my milk supply at all. Maybe this just didn't work for me.
