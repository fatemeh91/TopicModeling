review/text: Well never left feedback on something so personal, but this is something my wife and I really enjoy using so this should be easy. These condoms have great sensitivity. I give these condoms a 5 for quality and a 10 for price. The sensitivity is fairly good to others that I have had, and on a scale of 10 I would say and easy 8. I have had condoms that were better as far as sensitivity, but for the price it was just right. The one positive thing about decreases sensitivity, is that you can definitely last longer which my wife appreciates.
