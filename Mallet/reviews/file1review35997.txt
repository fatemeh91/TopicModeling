review/text: I have only been taking this amino acid for a short time, so I am only giving a 3 star rating since the results I've had so far have not been clear and definite. Maybe later I will come back and change that. I am taking l-arginine to boost my human growth hormone level, so it is too soon to tell about that, but it does seem like I have had some increased energy the next day after taking 4 teaspoons at bedtime the night before on an empty stomach. That is about 10 grams because I am not leveling my teaspoons. Taking it hasn't really given me diarrhea, but there are definitely some borderline results that I wouldn't want to have be any worse.I put the powder in a small coffee cup and add refrigerator-chilled water to not quite half, then chug it after stirring, trying to throw the mixture to the back of my mouth so that it touches the front of my tongue as little as possible. If you keep it to the back of your throat as much as you can, you'll find that you won't get nearly as much of that awful taste lingering. After chugging the water & amino acid mixture, I continute drinking the refrigerator-chilled water as fast as I can until I have washed the taste from the back of my throat as much as I can. It will never taste OK, but this is a quick-&-dirty way to just toss it down and keep the flavor off the front of the tongue where you would taste it more.
