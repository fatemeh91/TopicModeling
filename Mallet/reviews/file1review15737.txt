review/text: This pen is quite useful, and it has been quite reliable. I work in a job that requires me to carry a red pen and a blue or black pen, so this fits the bill well. The only problem is the small amount of ink in the refills and the difficulty in obtaining more refills. The erasers have been easy to find at the local office store, and it takes standard .5mm leads, such as Pentel hi-polymers, so those are also easy to buy. If not for the difficulty in finding replacements for the tiny, quickly depleted refills, this pen would be right up there with my Pilot Knights as one of my favorite pens. In answer to the refill problem, I found out today to my surprise that Staedtler multi-action ball point refills work perfectly well of Cross refills are not available. Another good thing about this pen is it is immune to the quality drop in Cross pens since they began mass manufacturing them in China rather than producing them in the classic handmade style in the USA. This pen is Japanese made, and it has the quality of a Pilot.
