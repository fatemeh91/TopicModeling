review/text: Wish I had waited to order this at the current sale price of $8.79 instead of the $12 I paid. It is worth it if you need a lawn sprinkler. It is sturdily made; Melnor typically produces acceptable products. You can use this in full rotation as well as only half, depending upon the ground you are covering. I expect this item to give several seasons of use.
