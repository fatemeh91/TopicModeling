review/text: Had this for nearly a year and am about to throw it away and purchase a wahl, here's why:1. Even at full charge, the motor lacks power. This means it actually slows down, nearly to a stop, when trimming thick areas.2. It trims unevenly, requiring multiple (and i mean more than five) passes in the same area to get the hairs somewhat the same length.3. If you remove the length setter to get the closest shave possible, i.e. as a sideburn trimmer (like most electric razers come with), the blades are set so far apart that they actually pinch the skin - painful and slightly bloody.Avoid this one at all costs.
