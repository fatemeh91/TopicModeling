review/text: I recently started using Gold Standard Whey after only using budget brands from superstores. At first, I thought it was all basically the same, but this stuff is great! It dissolves much more easily and doesn't leave tons of gritty stuff at the bottom of your glass. The flavors are also excellent. I've tried the Double Chocolate and Chocolate Malt and enjoyed them both. I'm looking forward to trying new flavors and doubt that I'll ever use another brand.
