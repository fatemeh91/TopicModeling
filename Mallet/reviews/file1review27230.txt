review/text: I bought this protein powder in the double rich chocolate flavor upon receiving a raving review from a friend of mine. I haven't used protein powder in a while because the ones I've had in the past tasted awful, but I decided it was time to give something new a try. This is THE best tasting protein powder I've ever had! After a run yesterday I mixed a scoop with a little bit of soy milk and I thought it tasted even better than traditional chocolate milk. I can't wait to try it in other smoothies and snacks. If you are on the fence about what flavor to get or what brand of protein powder is for you, I can tell you that this stuff tastes great and the stats are really good as well. It's very low in fat (only 1g per scoop) and high in protein (24g per scoop) with fairly minimal calories (120 kcal per scoop). Also, I ordered mine through The Vitamin Shoppe and they provided a great price and free shipping for any order over $25. I figured since it was free shipping I may have to wait the 3-5 days to recieve it, but was pleasantly surprised when I came home the day after ordering it and it was on my door step. So thank you Vitamin Shoppe for your great service and great product - I can't wait to try some of the other flavors!
