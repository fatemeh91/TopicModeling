review/text: I bought the Thermoskin gloves for my partner who has arthritis. She loved the gloves but within two weeks the material began to tear. I e-mailed the company and they promptly sendt a second pair for just the shipping charge. Waiting to see how these last. They really do work on relieving hand pain so I have hope!
