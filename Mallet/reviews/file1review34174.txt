review/text: This is the only cream I've tried that actually works. All day.With other OTC creams and even prescription strength, there is not sufficient relief. This cream actually makes the situation bearable and prevents further damage.The only downside is somewhat metallic - mint odour, which others around you can smell. It is also somewhat difficult to take off, even from hands/fingers. However, I feel it's totally worth it.One ointment tube is quite small - get the 3 pack.
