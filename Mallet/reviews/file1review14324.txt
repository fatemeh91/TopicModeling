review/text: I was originally given the Norelco razor as a gift. I kept it for a couple of years, enough to warrant the purchase of these replacement blades. Ultimately, the blade are fine, but as some men might experience, (especially those with coarse facial hair) will find electric razors/blades such as these to be uncomfortable. Additionally, I often had to reshave some areas with a manual razor to achieve the close shave I desired. Ultimately, electric razors are for some, but not all.
