review/text: My friends all laugh when I show them this thing. I ask them to guess what it is and I get things like 'a yard ornament?', or 'um...a sex toy?'. When I tell them what it actually does, they are dubious for sure. At least until I show them how it works. It really does work (at least for me). I think the hardest part is learning how to hold it. But one you get that down (it comes with a little book to show you how), it like having a LMT at my disposal. I was going twice a months, at $140 a pop (my co-pay was $15). Not anymore!The only complaint (and what holds back 5-stars) is there are a few spots where the plastic molding seam creates a sharp edge. It can make those areas unusable. I can sand them down, but that should have been done before shipping.
