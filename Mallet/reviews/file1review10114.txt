review/text: I am a celiac sufferer. No matter what I eat, I seem to hurt from the intake of food. Unless, of course, I am absolutely certain, beyond certain, no doubts, no question ... that there is NO gluten in my food. Yet, all it takes is one slip of cross contamination and I am suffering for weeks. Sound familiar?Well, this product is Mighty Mouse to me! Here HE comes to save the DAY!Usually, after a meal, I feel like someone has blown me up, much like a balloon. I refer not to the stomach, but to an overall fullness, bloated, blown up balloon.NOW, I take one of these with each meal and WOW ... let me just say it again WOW!!!!! What a difference fellow celiac sufferers. I don't know that it will work for everyone, but it has worked for me.Here is my new regimen that seems to work with each meal: 1 Digest Gold with each meal. PLUS:If cheese is involved, I now include 2 lactase (generic) tablets (lactose intolerant)If beans are involved, I take 2 Beano's.This works really well for me, and I highly recommend it for celiac/gluten sufferers. It is so incredibly hard to live with this, and for me it is worth the price.
