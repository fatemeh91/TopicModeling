review/text: I was really really hoping I would like these - I have been using disposable pads, and it just seems like so much garbage to generate. When I first put these on, they were REALLY obvious under my clothes. The disposable pads get thin at the edges, but these are pretty thick at the edges and make an obvious circle under my shirt. But, I was wearing a few layers, so I figured I could deal with it. When I went to pump for the first time, I realized that my shirt was wet, but not where it normally would be. It turns out that the pads had blocked my milk from leaking out directly, but they hadn't actually absorbed it, so the milk had just run down the pad and off the bottom edge. Instead of having a wet spot in the middle of my boob, I had a wet spot at the bottom of it. Different, but not better. I have used these a few times since then, but only if I am wearing a sweater over another shirt so that if I leak it doesn't show anyways. On days when it actually matters, I use my disposable pads instead. I don't end up wet every time I wear them, but that might be because I'm not leaking anyways on those days.
