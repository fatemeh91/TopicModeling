review/text: My husband's SA came back on the very low end of normal. He did not want to pursue further treatment of this. He did agree to try this vitamin blend though.I'll give you some numbers to show you how this works:first SA (post wash): 5 million sperm, 8% motilitysecond SA (post wash): 6.5 million sperm, 15% motilitythird SA (post wash) 7 million sperm,40% motilityfourth SA (post wash) 25 million sperm, 82% motilityThose numbers are four months in a row. He started taking the vitamins when he did that first SA. It took four months but his numbers just keep going up! This won't work for every man's issues but if a guy just has low numbers this is worth a shot for sure!
