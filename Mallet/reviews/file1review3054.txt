review/text: These condoms are the thinnest on the market. Let me first say, these condoms are definitely NOT too small. These are the condoms that are used by most adult film stars, so anyone who says these condoms are "too small" must be in the 90% percentile of men who are much bigger than 8", or they just have a complex. I'm above average in girth and length, and these condoms are great. They almost feel like you're wearing nothing at all. Compared to other brands like Trojan, which I feel are a little on the thick side, these are equally as durable and are made of latex, and although they are latex, they lack the rubber smell that most condoms possess. Give them a try, they're surprisingly different, and they make a HUGE difference in the experience of both partners. I enjoy them highly. Cheers.
