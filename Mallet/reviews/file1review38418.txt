review/text: I read so many reviews before buying this product and there wasn't many out there about sensitive skin. I decided to give it a try and if it didn't work I'd send it back. I'M IN LOVE. I works wonderfully. The first couple times I used it I only did small sections, I wanted to see if I would break out in rashes, which I do when shaving(no matter what I've tried). I had the red bumps at first but they were gone within a hour. With shaving I would have to shave every two days or the hair would irritate my skin. I actually got lazy an went two weeks, and it did not bother me!!!
