review/text: I rarely write reviews of products, but was prompted to do so for this one. I'll start of by simply saying that it's a great product. If you don't read any more of this, that's all you need to know. If you're like me and really don't like shaving, then go out and by some of it and you'll figure out why it makes an otherwise tedious and potentially painful task, smooth and easy. I have sensitive skin and was prone to in-grown hairs due to those 'lift-and-cut' style razors with ten thousand blades. Sure they give you a smooth and easy shave, but they also can be terrible for your skin. After switching to an old school safety razor with a single blade, I was having trouble finding a good shaving cream that gave the same smooth, easy shave. I tried several products and finally settled on this one after receiving a shave from my barber. This is what she used and it was great. Haven't looked back since. Sure it's only 4 oz, but you really don't need much to get that painless, smooth shave you're looking for. Notice how many times I've said 'smooth' in this review? Hint, hint.
