review/text: I've been a nurse for 33 years, and presently focus in wound care for homecare. I have a patient who had a massive bed sore. We used wound vacs with some sucess but he kept going back into the hospital with re-infections. Eventually he left one wound care center and found another, who ordered Anasept spray. Within 2 months this, I believe, has made more improvement in his healing than any previous method used. Though it obviously isn't the ONLY thing I attribute to his healing, (diet and pressure prevention impetitive) this product is the best for cleaning and staving off infection. I now have it in my bag and recommend it to any MD who asks for wound cleanser as a treatment. So many other wound cleansers are mild and do NOT aid in the prevention of sepsis. I am sold. As well as my patient.
