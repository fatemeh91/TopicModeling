review/text: I did not receive my order in a timely manner. I ordered the product at the same time as the Arnica pills. It looked like I was ordering both together. The pill order arrived within a week. The gel, did not arrive until 3 weeks later. I live 45 minutes from the postal facility. I also pay to pick up parcels. So, I had to pay extra fees as well as make an additional trip to pick up the gel. In the long run, it was not financially beneficial to order online.
