review/text: My wife's Nalgene bottle has that narrow opening that's impossible to clean without this brush. The brush itself has some great firm bristles, and the stem has some slight flexibility, but will stay firm and doesn't seem it'll break unless you're deliberately trying.We also have the baby bottle brush from OXO that we plan on using for bottles, so if it's anything like this bottle brush, I know it'll work splendidly.
