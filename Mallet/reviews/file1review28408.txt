review/text: this protien powder tastes good and can last a long time. if you use the cup they give you and take a cup a day it lasts about 4 months. i don't know how effective it is in building muscle/ gaining weight. i consumed 2 tubs over a 8 month period combined with lifting weights and did not see any significant changes. i stopped taking this because i did not feel it was worth the money. if you eat a balanced diet you should already be getting enough protien and should not need supplements. if you can afford it it would not hurt to try it but keep in mind it might just be an expensive chocolate drink.
