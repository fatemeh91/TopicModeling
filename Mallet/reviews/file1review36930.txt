review/text: This is not the best dental tape and, for the money, not that much better than regular floss, in my experience. The best dental tape I've tried is Jason Tea Tree Oil dental tape, which is available in health food stores but can be hard to find.If you do decide to buy any of the dental tapes offered on Amazon, you might do better to order them directly from drugstore.com, where (at this writing) they cost less.
