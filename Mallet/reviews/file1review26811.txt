review/text: It was OK after removing the lumps in the bag harder chocolate lumps we were not sure of so rather then take a chance we took them out of the product. It seems OK but could not get response on product from maker if we should be concern or not. They are rated well on bodybuilders dot com etc. Maybe got a bag exposed to moisture is all we can assume since we got no response other wise to date
