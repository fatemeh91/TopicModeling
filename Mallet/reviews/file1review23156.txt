review/text: You have to put the handle of the sweeper together as part of assembling the sweeper. However, there is nothing to hold the pieces of the handle together... so it falls apart frequently! I read a review about the defective handle before I bought the product. I thought that it might be a "one time" thing with the reviewer that mentioned it. Well, low and behold, it happened to me as well. Its difficult to use when the handle falls apart all the time. And I even tried to duct tape it! It didn't help.
