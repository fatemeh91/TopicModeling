review/text: I had tried other whey protiens from my local grocery stores and GNC. After seeing all the great reviews for this product I decided to give it a try. It mixes much better than other proteins I tried and the flavor is awesome. The vanilla ice cream tastes really good mixed with milk on my morning cereal I have since tried the double rich chocolate and it tastes so much better than store bought chocolate milk. All around a great product without all the extra junk found in other whey proteins. Amazon and Optimum Nutrition are now my goto source for my future suppliment needs.
