review/text: DDS PROBIOTICS-100 Acidophilus was a life saver for me. I had IBS for years and happen to see this adverised. So I thought, why not, I have nothing more to loose.It straightened my system out in a matter of 1 week. I will never be without it! No more embarrassing moments. Easy to take 2 capsules, in the morning, on an empty stomach. DDS PROBIOTICS does the job they say it does. I have no more worries about eating out in restaurants anymore, catching a bacterial infection. DDS PROBIOTICS have helped me in so many ways. Thank you U.A.S. Laboratories for finding this therapy.
