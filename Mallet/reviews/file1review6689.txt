review/text: I brought this little guy (actually, it is quite large) with me when I went on vacation to Montana. It was an 8 hour drive and by the time we got there I had developed a pain in my left shoulder blade. I couldn't even pick up my kid. I got out my trigger point manual and went to work on several trigger points with my Body Back Buddy. Within 20 minutes my pain was barely noticeable. The next day it was gone.Since then I've used this on many occasions to work on the adhesions around my shoulder blades and mid-back. Sometimes I think it would be better if there were little removable rubber pads on the ends of the knobs as sometimes it can be a bit painful. But all-in-all, it works just fine. I'm considering getting the smaller version so I can use it while at my desk at work.
