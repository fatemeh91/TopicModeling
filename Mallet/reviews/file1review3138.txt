review/text: These are by far the best condoms I have ever used (previous brands/products trojan, lifestyle, durex, magnum, and iron grip. After things get a little warmed up these condoms feel unbelievably natural. It took me a few times to get comfortable with them because you begin to feel like they are coming off because things feel so natural but these condoms aren't going anywhere until you rip them off. We ALL know that feeling where we are into it but we know the condom is one and then things feel a little TOO good and we pull out and look down to see if the condom came off. Not the case with these. If you put them on correctly and unroll them all the way down, they stay on and suck and stick to your skin. I pulled out on more than one occasion and saw that the condom was still on, tried to pull it off because I thought it leaked or broke and the condom was like a suction cup and was not coming off, period. Didn't do much for the mood but it gave me confidence that these puppies are not coming off in the heat of the a moment. We all know the infamous position that makes most condoms traditionally slide off. This one stayed on no matter how hard, fast, deep or slow the action got. Again, the key is to put it on CORRECTLY. If you do that it's not going anywhere. I'm buying a larger pack and will stick with this brand going forward.
