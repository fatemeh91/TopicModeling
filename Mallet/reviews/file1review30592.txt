review/text: I scrap my tongue regularly. I've been doing it since...I don't know, since I was 12? This product is very effective at helping me keep my tongue clean. Believe me, tongue scraping really works. My last tongue scraper broke, and I had to go a few weeks without scraping my tongue. My breathe started smelling foul after shorter periods of time! Cuh-raaaaaaaazy! Good stuff! This is a fairly good price. This is the best tongue scraper I've ever used!
