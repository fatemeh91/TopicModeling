review/text: Like other reviewers mention, this product works really well if you follow the instructions. The main one being the amount of water to drink while on these supplements (I carry a little half gallon jug of water with me through out the day). I'm didn't really notice the effects when looking in the mirror but after wk 4, my scale showed that I had dropped 4 lbs. I'm not sure how much of this was due to Animal cuts but I do believe it helped.As far as the actual pills go... they are a little larger than average. As others have mentioned, they do contain caffeine and as such, did kind of make me a little jittery at first but my body adjusted after a week or so. Also, I love it's thermal effects. After a week, it feel like my internal temp. was a furnace, working away. I've recently cycled off these (as is suggested) but am about ready to get back on. I got 4 star rating for the size of the pills (one in particular is the size of a horse pill :/.
