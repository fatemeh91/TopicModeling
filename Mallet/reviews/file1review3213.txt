review/text: I had a Vibratex Bear for years and loved it. But the dual action broke...and it was just slightly too short...I was always wishing for just a half-inch more. The Doc Johnson iVibe I replaced it with was long enough, but not quite thick enough; then the gears and motor started grinding and screaming.Great King is the perfect size, at least for me. The clitoral stimulator is -- well -- amazingly stimulating -- better than any of the ones I've used before. Only thing is the "skin". It is very smooth, too smooth. I sorta miss the subtle raised patterns on the iVibe. Other than that, this product gives a great internal workout. Insertable length is 6", diameter: Body 1-1/2" and head is just under 2". Soft enough to give a little, hard enough to do the job."Personal product" marketers please take this to heart--Publish insertable length and diameter, please. You will sell lots more stuff.Edit - Removed a star. The battery pack stopped making contact with the battery power, so it no longer turns on, and of course these things have no warranty. Except for Jimmyjane's Iconic Rabbit, which I purchased next -- one year warranty!
