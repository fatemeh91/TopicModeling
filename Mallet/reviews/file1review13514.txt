review/text: My husband and I only use natural bodycare products.Unfortunately, every natural deoderant (from Tom's of Maine, Jason, Nature's Gate, Crystal, etc.) we tried was either ineffective or led to extreme itching and eczema-like sypmtoms -- very uncomfortable to say the least.Happy Me Pit Guard is the most effective product ever. It stops odor, wetness and has no annoying scent. Despite its cool, quirky packaging, it is a no-nonsense product. It is worth the money.Users need to wait a few moments after applying to let it dry in order to reduce possible white stains on clothing.
