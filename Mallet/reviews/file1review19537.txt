review/text: This is the right size hole and shape for our extra long toilet seat. It is also adjustable so it fits on any seat.The length of the hole was the most important factor, as my 3 year-old-son is 37" tall and tends to go long. That being said, he does not like the hardness of the seat as he is coming from a foam cushy seat, however, it does the trick most of the time. Product arrived on time, new and packaged well.
