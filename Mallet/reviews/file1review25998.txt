review/text: I've been using Mindfold sleep masks for probably 15 years. It's morphed over time. The earlier masks only lasted about 3-6 months, as the plastic would crack. I've had my last mask for at least 3 years. I find them incredibly comfortable. If you're the kind of person who wakes up at the first sign of sunlight, this is the only mask I ever tried that completely blocks out the light.
