review/text: what more can I say? these little guys fit my water jet, and parts are hard to come by since I bought it back in '06.very happy since the piece with the more narrow head breaks easily. I wish I could have just bought the one attachment I needed, but now I believe I will have no need to replace it in the foreseeable future since I basically have 2 of every piece that came with the little guy.
