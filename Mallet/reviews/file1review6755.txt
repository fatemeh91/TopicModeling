review/text: I cannot compare this to the TheraCane which I have never used but both the Body Back Buddy I gave as a gift and the one I first tried out at home seems to have pleased everyone who has used it - and it was not a flash in the pan but continues weeks after arrival to be used. It not only is a great help for reaching points in one's back and neck or in places in front of the torso where it can give good leverage compared to when one attempts to use their hands on themselves, but it also is very convenient for trigger points on the legs, including difficult ones on the sides of the thighs (where one can 'hook' it over the other leg using one of the little perpendicular 'handles' and by slightly spreading one's legs apart generate a surprisingly effective amount of pressure).The only question I have is how it would work for someone who was much larger than average (especially in terms of thickness). While I can imagine it as still very useful for certain trigger points anyway, I wonder if it might be difficult to use it as conveniently for a really big person (like some big football linemen, say, or heavy weight powerlifters, or even someone built a bit that way). If someone is that size and wonders about it, it might be good to try one out first before ordering one to see if it works for the points they had hoped to reach with it.
