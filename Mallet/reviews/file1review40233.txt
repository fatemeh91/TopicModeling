review/text: Umm yeah - I did buy toothpaste on Amazon.com. Got sick and tired of paying for a membership for the pleasure of buying goods at a store, only to have to stand in line to exit the place so someone could check my receipt to "ensure I received what I bought", and I only typically bought a few items in bulk so I wouldn't have to go so much. So, one Saturday I walked into a local Wal-Mart, looked around and asked myself, "Why am I putting myself through this nonsense". So, I turned around, went home, fired up my computer and voila - order razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste for several months. No big stores with 35 checkout lanes and 2 clerks working, no waiting behind 6 dozen angry customers, no road rage, no gas, no hassle. I told my 70+ year old neighbor what I bought and they thought it was fantastic. I'm never paying for a membership to shop or standing in line again!
