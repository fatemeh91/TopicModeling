review/text: Love it! I put it right on top of my daughter's full size bed sheet. It will move around if you are a restless sleeper. I put one under my son's twin sheets. I purchased 3 already. Have a spare one incase of accident. Put it right in washing machine. I line dry it mostly hoping it would last longer. Still in good condition.
