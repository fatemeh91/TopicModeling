review/text: Being of Mediterranean stock, i've been more than amply endowed with (get your mind out of the gutter) lots of unwanted BODY HAIR. When the shirt comes off at the beach, i've been called everything from 'The Missing Link' to 'Bigfoot' to having comments like "nice sweater dude!!" yelled in my direction while taking a stroll on the boardwalk! This hair clipper is thus a godsend that I use solely to shave my back, neck, chest, and arms (OK, my wife helps me with my back), since i'm too chicken to endure the pain of waxing. This Wahl clipper cuts flawlessly and efficiently, and I need to exercise some caution lest I slice off my nipples someday!
