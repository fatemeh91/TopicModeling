review/text: I tried a number of natural deodorants before discovering Men's Stock, and since then I haven't looked back! A few years back I started developing a rash from the mainstream deodorants / antiperspirants (Old Spice, et al.). My wife began looking for a natural alternative and eventually discovered Men's Stock. It works far better than the salt crystal types, and I even like it better than the Jason brand natural stick. I sweat a lot and Men's Stock keeps me smelling fresh all day. It does help keep me dryer than I would be without anything, but it isn't as effective an antiperspirant. On days that I have a client meeting I will often use Men's Stock with the Jason stick and that seems to be a very effective duet.
