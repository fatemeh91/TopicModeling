review/text: Lumiscope 1134 Deluxe Fully Automatic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor is an excellent product. I was looking for something that was accurate when reading blood pressure, so my doctor suggested that I bring in my Lumiscope to the office at my next appointment so she could compare the readings from the Lumiscope and her professional blood pressure monitor. The doctor stated that the readings were fairly equal. I was very impressed that I was getting accurate readings from a piece of medical equipment I purchased for a reasonable sum of money. The Lumiscope is easy to use and reliable. You can't beat that!
