review/text: The only problem with this product is that the bite pads fell apart after six months of use. One day they were fine. The next they both fell apart. Other than that this was a good solution for me. I have a persistent problem with teeth grinding. In the past I've used a sports mouth guard which worked alright but was difficult to clean and hard on my front teeth and mouth. I decided to try this product and have been satisfied. It leaves a nice gap between your teeth and stays in all night. It's very comfortable. The price for this product is very reasonable. The product was shipped and delivered promptly. The Splintek company makes a product called the Advanced that they say is more durable. If you go with this one (the Select) I recommend you buy two in case the first one wears out.
