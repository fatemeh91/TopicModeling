review/text: I would highly recommend this product. I have tried many different massage devices and none of them have compard to this one. The knobs on this item give you a very deep massage that really opens up the muscles and takes the knots away. You only need to apply a slight pressure for a deep massage. And since there are so many knobs, it is very easy to get every part of your body. My mother has very tights knots in her shoulders and this was a lifesaver for her.
