review/text: I have been using the Animal Cuts for about 2 months now and as a part of my regiment attending the gym 4 times weekly, I am seeing great results, especially in regards to my body's water weight. I have energy from the product and take it twice daily, not hesitating to take it on an empty stomach because the pills are small and never upset my stomach whatsoever. I would recommend the product to any person looking to lose weight as part of a workout/diet regiment.
