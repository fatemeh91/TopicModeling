review/text: I generally love Method products, but the smell of this spray is just sickening. The only way I can stand to use it is if I spray the shower area, immediately leave the bathroom and shut the door (and make sure I've used the bathroom beforehand so I don't have to go in it for another couple of hours). The spray appears to *work* just fine, but the smell of it shouldn't be so noxious that I can't casually spray it on and do things in the bathroom at the same time.
