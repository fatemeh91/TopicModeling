review/text: This is a fantastic razor. And a great beginner razor for those exploring DE wet shaving. Note this is really the Merkur 34C Heavy Duty. The #178 is just some random number assigned by the distributor.For a great shave, unlearn your Mach3/Fusion holds. Hold the razor as if you're holding a dart (i.e. playing darts at a bar). Let the razors own weight do the shaving. To learn more on how to get a great shave from this razor, watch Mantic59's series of videos on safety razor wet shaving techniques on YouTube.
