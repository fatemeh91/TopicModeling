review/text: The first day I tried Slim Coffee, I was bouncing off of the walls. I got on a bike and rode for 3 hours, then walked for 2. I didnt ONCE think about food. Wether or not I lost weight between then and now, I do not know. Do I doubt it? Not a chance. It tastes TERRIBLE. Thats the only thing I dont like. I dont like that there are no directions...accept drink 2-3 cups a day. I recomend drinking two. If you feel the need for a 3rd one, then drink a 3rd one. No more though. You won't go to sleep.
