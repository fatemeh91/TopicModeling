review/text: After so many products haven't helped me any, I was a little susceptible to try this, but my face has been in so much pain lately that I decided to give it one more go. Boy am I glad that I did. This stuff is fantastic! My rosacea tends to feel (and look) like somebody is setting my face on fire, but as soon as I put this cream on, it instantly felt better. It took a few more uses before the redness and swelling really started to go away, but my face has been feeling and looking better ever since!
