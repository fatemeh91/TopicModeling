review/text: The product works for me. My personal experience includes daily doses of various brands including the Optimum Nutrition Glucosamine Plus CSA, 120 capsule product during the last six years, except during twice yearly 2-week periods when I take no supplements. When taking the supplement routinely, I experience little to no joint discomfort in my hands, knees and hips. Within two or three days after cessation of dosage, my joint aches and pains resume to a moderate level. Within a week to ten days after resuming daily dosage, I become symptom free or nearly so. Although many studies have tried to evaluate the efficacy of glucosamine with chondroitin for the relief of symptoms of joint ache and pain, the literature reveals conflicting conclusions and does not reveal a definitive study that reaches a clear positive or negative conclusion. Anecdotal reports suggest daily doses of the combination have resulted in relief from mild to moderate joint ache and pain for a wide spectrum of consumers. However, other consumers report no effect. I should disclose that as a 60-year-old, I include in my daily regime vitamin supplements, a healthy diet and moderate to intense exercise from one to three hours, six days a week.
