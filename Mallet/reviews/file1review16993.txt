review/text: If you want a good trimmer, prepare to spend a lot more than $30. This thing barely cuts, it can't hold a charge, and it's loud. To give you an idea of what to expect - two weeks ago the battery died mid-shave, which was probably only the second or third time I'd used it. Today I needed a little trim and guess what, I couldn't finish this time either. Never had such problems with my $100+ Norelco. This thing is absolutely USELESS.
