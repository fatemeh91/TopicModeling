review/text: I really really like them. they fit in my ballet flats, flat boots, and trainers. I can feel the support if I must walk for hours. My first pair was the light blue full length insoles for my low/mid arch and i won't hike without them. this is just as fantastic!I also got the version for heels but don't like them much. nothing can make walking in a pair of high heels comfortable.
