review/text: This crazy looking tool is wonderfully effective in relieving sore, knotted muscle pain in my back and neck. I lift weights, and occasionally over do it. This thing saves me having to go to a chiropractor. I would suggest to anyone thinking about this thing to do a little research (internet) on trigger point therapy. Knowing how to "dig in" to a sore spot is helpful. I'd also recommend you take it light the first few times that you use it, as it can make you sore if you over do it. I'd also stay away from the video that goes for about five bucks on amazon. It's worthless. If you or someone you know wants or needs frequent deep tissue massage, particularly in the back and neck, this is the ticket.
