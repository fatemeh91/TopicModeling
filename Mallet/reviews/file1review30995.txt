review/text: Arthritis flared up in my knees this winter & this was suggested. I take it every other day (& a generic brand on the other days). Besides the large size of the pills, I hate the aftertaste it leaves in my mouth no matter how fast I swallow it. The generic brand doesn't have the aftertaste, so probably won't continue w/ these once I finish the bottle. My knees are feeling a little better after 2 weeks, but I'm also doing exercises my PT recommended.
