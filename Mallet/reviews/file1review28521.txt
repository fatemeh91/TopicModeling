review/text: The ON Gold Protein is pretty good. Its not horrible sweet and doesnt smell bad, I like it mixed with soy milk. It is a little clumpy to mix and have to stir or blend good. So far I will stay with the ON Gold Whey Protein for the taste, cost, flavors. just got the strawberry banana and it really good to
