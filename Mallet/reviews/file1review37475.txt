review/text: I believe it kept me dry similar to other products, but there were two things that I found I disliked. First, the odor of the product was overpowering, even after an hour or two. I don't like the girly smell. Also, after applying the product, it would get on any pullover shirt. Beyond these two dislikes, I believe the product was very good and did what it was supposed to do.
