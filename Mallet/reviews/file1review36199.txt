review/text: i get acne around my chin area and jaw line - seems to be hormonal, because it doesn't respond to anything topical and it comes heavy in waves throughout the month. I've tried everything, including going completely vegan and nothing has stopped these deep and kind of painful pimples from surfacing. I found Acne relief made a very significant difference. I get 90% less break outs than I did before. I found that if I pair this with a quality zinc supplement, then I am almost acne free - very rarely do I get a pimple and if I do, it is much less severe than what I used to get.
