review/text: These should be worked on and set up for easy use. You waste a lot of money trying to get it exactly right... the strip that is inserted is a pain does not connect all the time and then you have to put in a new one .. it is not working with my computer the way it should.. it just quit working-- and now does not recognize it at all. It has been trouble from the word go.. out of 6 strips 2 worked like it said it should. Costly and is Cheaply made with software that does not deliver.
