review/text: Other reviews state this item is very quiet. Mine makes a very loud grinding noise. If the windows were open, I think the neighbors would hear it. The noise is totally distracting, thus I cannot use this product. If it was quiet as stated by others, I think I might be very satisfied with it. Did I get a "lemon?"
