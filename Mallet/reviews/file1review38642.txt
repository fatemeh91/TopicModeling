review/text: I waited until I used this product for 32 years before I would leave a comment. Well the 32 years of testing this product on my face everyday [ 11,680 days, but who's counting ]..this product should only be used by men who shave and would rather not have a nice red rash on there face. This product cools the face, and about the smell being loved by women...well I have 4 children...enough said...just buy it...the end
