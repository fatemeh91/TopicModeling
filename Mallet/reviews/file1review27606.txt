review/text: This was my first protein powder purchase, I'm a 31 year old male that just wants to add some bulk to my muscles. I tasted it today for the first time after my morning workout and was very pleasantly surprised that it tasted kind of like rich chocolatey Ovaltine. It had a bit of an aftertaste, but nothing bad. Very pleased with the taste, now just hoping that it does it's job. We'll see!
