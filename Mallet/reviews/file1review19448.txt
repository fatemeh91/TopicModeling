review/text: I had to search really hard to find out about ADDITIONAL LAB FEES. I was able (from customer reviews only) to determine that there are indeed additional fees (charged by the lab you send your specimen to). So in other words, you have to pay more money to get your results. I won;t be buying this as there are other products out there that charge upfront for everything (no additional/hidden costs). And they seem to be CHEAPER. Hope this helps someone else!
