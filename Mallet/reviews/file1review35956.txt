review/text: Ok, so I've been using the electric Oral-B toothbrush for years. A visit to my hygienist this year made me realize I've been using the wrong toothbrush for years. She said my gums were starting to recede especially around my crowns because I may be brushing too hard. After much research I found this toothbrush. It has done wonders. A month after using it, I've noticed a difference in the appearance of my gums. Mind you, it forewarns you to brush properly. Between the bristles (I think they're extra soft and made to go in between teeth/gums well) and the "ionic stuff", something is working. Try it-I'm buying another one for my husband.
