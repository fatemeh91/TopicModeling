review/text: There are two unique features that make this disposable the best.1. It has a rubber blade between the two metal blades that clears out debris with the push of a button.2. It has a plastic blade cover that protects the blades from nicking when you put it away. This keeps the blades very sharp, I get at least two weeks daily use from most of them.It's also very light and balanced and comes in about five colors.Since this is the best disposal made, it will no doubt be discontinued soon.
