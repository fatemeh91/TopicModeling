review/text: Disclaimer: I'm not a medical professional.. yet.This is a $8 stethoscope. You can't expect good quality from it, but it does work. The sounds are muffled, but audible. I can hear breathing pretty well, but I can easily imagine getting a clearer heartbeat from a more expensive scope.It seems to be built from quality materials. I say this because the metal has a weight to it and the tube is thick. The white plastic ear pieces are very hard, but you can replace them with the black ones. They're a little better, but will still make your ears hurt after 5-10 minutes of continuous use. I doubt you'll be using your stethoscope for that long though.The one and two star reviews were probably written by people who have no idea how a stethoscope is made nor any idea of how they work. The instructions are written plainly on the box - securely slide the tube onto the metal ear tubes and the chest piece, then turn the head until it clicks to change the side you're listening to (bell is the small one, diaphragm is the big one) The bell is for deep sounds and the diaphragm is for light sounds.All in all, I'm satisfied with the purchase.
