review/text: With 8 people in the family, this Wahl hair clipper kit is saving us a bundle! The video is a bit outdated, but clear in showing us what to do. The clipper works great, and is very easy to use. The kit has all the accessories I'll ever need to cut my family's hair. Excellent value for the quality! The only thing I might improve is to get a professional quality cape, as the one that came with it is a bit thin, and on the small side for some of the bigger guys in my family. But that aside, you can't go wrong buying this clipper set if you're looking to save money on hair cuts.
