review/text: After reading all the reviews, I thought this was worth a try for my 8 year old. However, it's no big enough to keep her entire bed dry, mostly because she moves around in her sleep. Also, her covers and blankets still get soaked, so only if I'm really lucky do I just have to wash the pad.
