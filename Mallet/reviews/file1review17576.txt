review/text: well made,no there is no stand,and I don't have a problem with that,I knew that I read what it comes with.Charges easy overnight.Was easy to handle,no matter how hard you push it on your face,there still was a nice even cut.Cut,trimmed mine done in about 2 minutes,no doubt the best one I have ever owned,and for 25 bucks!!If I had one small gripe,the numbers on the little dial to set the length are very small and hard to read,but I have had a beard for 40 years maybe its just weak eyes!
