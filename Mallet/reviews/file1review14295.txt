review/text: This is a fantastic, easy to take and digest, product that I wouldn't be without.My physician recommended this product. He said most Americans are magnesium deficient, due to their high intake of junk foods; which depleats magensium from the body and causes to much acidity.This calcium, Potassium (without sodium or other salts) and magnesium mix does a good job on helping your body lean to the alkaline side and get the nutrients your body needs to function properly.The powdered calcium in this product absorbs more easily and gives support to the muscles and heart.I Just love it!
