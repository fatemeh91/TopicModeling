review/text: To me it's the only product that works without hurting the stomach... I have gastritis and I have tried a thousand pills, diets, shots, everything you can think of to lose weight... this is the only thing that works. You do feel sick but it does MELT the fat away. You can help the side effects with lots of water and exercise. This is for people truly committed to lose weight and with a good exercise program on the side. I recommend to just follow the instructions and let a few days go by, you do feel better after a while (a week or so) and do not take in the afternoon or for dinner at all or you won't sleep. When you take it you have to eat or it won't work. It does not matter what you eat you will still lose weight. DO NOT DRINK ANY CAFFEINATED BEVERAGES WHILE ON IT!
