review/text: I recently started the Slim-fast routine, and I have to say I love the Chocolate Royale shake mix. My preferred shake recipe is as follows:1 cup skim milk1 tablespoon creamy, natural peanut butter1 scoop powderabout 1/4 cup nonfat vanilla greek yogurt (I use half of an individual container)1 1/4 cup iceBlend all of the above in blender, and voila! :o)Tastes EXACTLY like a chocolate peanut butter ice cream shake. SO GOOD! Enjoy! :o)
