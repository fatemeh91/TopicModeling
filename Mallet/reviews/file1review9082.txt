review/text: First of all the Bad. The taste, which i don't mind actually, is like eating your lawn ground up, no pain no gain right? I actually prefer the taste than knowing i'm downing more sugar or artificial sweeteners which i don't need. This thing is high in fiber, and will make you regular, but not an emergency run to the bathroom. It will also make you lose weight. I assume this is from the fiber, and detox effects of having so much good stuff in your body. The miracle. I have had this weird foot fungus forever on my foot, and the only thing i have changed recently is adding this to my diet, and it's getting better!!! I just noticed it the other day. I have been on the product for two weeks at this point and can already tell its working. Everyone around me at work is sick. EVERYBODY. I haven't even caught a hint of a sniffle. I hope they don't ever get rid of this product or change it in any way. I don't know if I could find something like this elsewhere. I can verify that it does give you a slight energy boost also. If you can stay away from fast food, soda, and drink this every day you will probably be doing more than 98 percent of American's out there for your health. Make it your sacred three food rules. I have.
