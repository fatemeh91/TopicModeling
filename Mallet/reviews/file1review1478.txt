review/text: Like many others, I struggled for MONTHS with an inconveniently located wart on my finger. I tried three (3) other kinds of retail removal products, and I was thinking that perhaps I was just out of luck. Then, I read through the reviews for this PediFix Wart STICK and was encouraged enough to try one more time. The product arrived quickly, AND MY WART FRIEND IS ALMOST GONE! Excellent.
