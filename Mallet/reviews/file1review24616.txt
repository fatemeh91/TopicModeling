review/text: This was terrible. Took 2 pills with tons of water before first meal, felt light headed and a little shaky. My day goes on. I decide to take one more capsule, the bottle says you can have up to six. I felt like my stomach was ripping apart inside. My entire body shook, andy husband was convinced I was on cocaine. After hours of the most uncomfortable nausea and shakes I finally managed to sleep. Worst of all I was not smart enoug to think those pills could possibly have had this much of an effect so I took them the next day. Same miserable side effects. Never again. The only way you will lose weight wit this pill is from throwing up or being too cracked out to eat sleep or drink. Spend the $20 on a workout DVD instead.
