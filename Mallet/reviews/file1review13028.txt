review/text: Just like the other reviewers - I agree - it will not stay Hot or Cold for very long.However I seem to have a different problem. I have A SHORT NECK! I am heavy set - so I am sure that contributes to the "problem."Well having a short neck causes it to raise up off my shoulders and won't close properly around my neck.As you can see, it is very high around the collar/chin area. My ear lobes are pushed up and it is very uncomfortable shoved up behind my ears.Also, the back sides and back is raised up ALMOST HALF WAY UP the back of my head!Look at the picture closely, and picture that on a "squatty neck person." Having a short neck really does lift the whole thing OFF your shoulders, smash your earlobe up and UP the backside of your head!!!It does not lay flat on the back of a short necked persons bsck. Only the very lower portion of the Gel Pack touches the back AT ALL.Isn't this supposed to be for the neck and down the back area?While shoved up like it does, it creates a "HOLLOW" all around inside and underneath. Therefore, no gel pack or what little heat it has is touching the skin on or around the neck of "a SHORT NECKED PERSON!"One is also aware of the front closure choking and strangling them!Also the Velcro tab is sewed up so high on the front of the collar that the edge STABS and IRRITATES under the chin.This product has too many design flaws to make it worth the asking price for a neck therapy product.HOWEVER: If you Heat it (I do 60 seconds on EACH SIDE)- lay it on the bed and then YOU LAY ON IT JUST RIGHT - it is a nice - but short lived Heat Therapy for between the shoulder Blades.SQUATTY NECK PEOPLE - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.
