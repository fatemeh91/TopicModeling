review/text: ON is always the brand to beat in whey protein. It has the best performance, tasting, and amount of protein in each serving.Since ON has introduced 2 more options in this category, I'll add in my comparisons. The cheaper alternative being Performance Whey, the standard being 100% Whey Gold Standard, and Platinum Hydro Whey.Performance Whey does it's job. It does deliver a good amount of protein per serving. However I notice that it does perform differently. It feels like I'm absorbing weak ingredients and much more slowly. It definitely tastes sweeter than the other two. If you want cheap powder, I would still recommend this over any other brand. Also by far it is much better than any generic GNC or Vitamin Shoppe Whey. However, for that money I would invest in 2 boxes of protein bars.100% Whey Gold Standard is the most reliable for me. If you can afford to buy performance whey, I suggest paying a little more for this. Compared to the others, Gold Standard Whey is more versatile. Since it is somewhat fast absorbing, but not too fast, I can drink it anytime during the day. This one I've used it to get "cut" and also to gain mass (with added ingredients of course.I must say the Platinum Hydro Whey is my favorite. It is much finer and absorbs much quicker than the rest. It is the best IMO for post workout only. I see most results for 2 months of Hydro Whey.
