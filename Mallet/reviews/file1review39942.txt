review/text: I've tried other protein powders, but can't get over the artificial flavors in the others. This is a drink that I could have multiple times in the day, and still tastes great! I do add one tsp of organic sugar to each scoop of powder. It's delicious! I don't think I will ever find anything I like as well, though I do continue to try...just to give myself a variety!
