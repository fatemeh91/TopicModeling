review/text: I ordered a two-pack of this item since my 13 year old daughter had a wart on her finger. When I first read in the directions that it may take up to 12 weeks of use, I was thinking a trip to the doctor's office might be a quicker solution. We gave it a try anyway applying it twice a day and covering the area with a band-aid; her wart practically disappeared within 5 days. Great little product and does what it promises.
