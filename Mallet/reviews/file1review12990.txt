review/text: This is the perfect solution for a sore neck. As I get older it seems I have lost a bit of flexibility in my neck - I work out all the time and this is the best neck device that I have found. Only bad thing is that you will get hot when using heat in summer. But for the relief anyone can stand it for five - ten minutes.Highly recommend
