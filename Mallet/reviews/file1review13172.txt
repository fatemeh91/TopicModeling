review/text: This sheet protector is big enough to not move around overnight. I use one underneath my son's bed sheets and use one on the top. MUCH less laundry with this system and his mattress is always protected. I am buying a 3rd one for use when the top one needs to be laundered or for use as an easy one to grab when we travel to hotels or Grandma's house. A GREAT product and I have 4 other kinds and none work as well!
