review/text: Folks, amino acid supplements are NOT gonna give you muscle mass or weight gain by itself. Calorie intake gives you weight gain and working your muscles give you muscle mass growth. Amino Acid supplements are primarily for people on vegetarian diets who don't get enough protien because they don't eat meat. If someone is on a diet and trying to burn fat, the fat is used and broken down into glucose (carbs). The body cannot manufacture the 8 essential amino acids produced by breaking the peptide bond in proteins. Thus, people who don't eat food rich in protein, need protein supplements. After the body recieves an adequate supply of amino acids, more amino acids won't help any. The body cannot store excess amino acids - thus the daily intake. IF you want massive muscle growth, inject steroids. I don't recommend it, though.
