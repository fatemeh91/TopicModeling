review/text: After one shave, it is immediately apparent, the five smaller blades beat the 3 or 2 blade models, hands down. A move comfortable, smoother shave for me. I could hardly feel the silky way it removes hair. I had to check some of the strokes to see if anything was happening. I was a recent upgrade to Mach 3 and liked it a great deal. Fushion is quite a bit better. I was surprised. I like the reverse side feature of one blade for under the nose. All Gillette razors give you a shave, but if you are going to shave every day, this is the most comfortable and nicest feeling one.
