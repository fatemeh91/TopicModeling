review/text: I had 2 warts on my hands for months which wouldn't go away, and plantars warts on my foot for over a year and a half. I tried freezing, the liquids, duct tape, and vinegar but nothing worked. I liked the 40% salicylic acid strength so I decided to try the Wart Stick. I used it on my hands first (everyone sees those). It took 6-8 weeks, but this did the trick! It is the same consistency as lip balm, so application is very easy (just don't mix it up with your chap stick!). The warts have been gone for 3 months now, no sign of returning.I am now using it on those stubborn plantars warts on my foot. It's taking a little longer, but two are gone and one is on its way out. This stuff is great!
