review/text: This sweeper is exactly what one would expect for $24. It does a fairly good job of picking up pieces of things, though isn't a choice option for things like pet hair (unless you really want a workout.) Also, it's best for smoother rug textures.Why do I own this? My toddler is scared of the vacuum, yet scatters Cheerios liberally across the carpet. This lets me get the worst of the mess while she's awake so less gets ground in. Also, the handle comes in 4 slide-together sections. We're currently using only 2 sections so that my daughter can "help" as the mood hits. So far, so good! I give this 4 stars because, like most things, it works ~slightly~ less well than one might wish.
