review/text: I used to eat Vanilla Almond bars for a long time and I obviously liked them, because I wasn't sure if I was ready to try a combination of citrus lemon and chocolate. But when I made the jump, boy, I LOVE this one. I ordered 3 packets now, and that's the only one I eat now! Awesome taste, couldn't believe it was a protein bar, and feels so light. You can't tell you're having a meal. Amazing one more gem from Herbalife!! :-)
