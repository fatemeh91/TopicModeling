review/text: Looked specifically for an elevated seat to fit an ordinary-height, round toilet seat; I had recently replaced the seat and lid so I knew I had a ROUND bowl, not an ELONGATED bowl. Speaking with the nurses at the rehab hospital, I learned the difference between a standard height toilet (16", I think) and the newer, higher toilets (again, 19" if I recall). So I knew exactly what I needed, and this product fit the bill perfectly. Yeah, I had to trim the handle padding to allow the legs to hit the floor, no big deal, and that makes it super-stable. You do need to have a seat and lid that get screwed into the rear of the toilet, so the tab on the back of the elevated seat can go into the space between the toilet and the tank. It goes on with a nice, tight, stable "click" into the bowl, and comes off easy as pie. On when you need it, off when you don't. Couldn't be better.
