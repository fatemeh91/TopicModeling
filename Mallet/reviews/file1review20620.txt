review/text: I shave once in 2 days on average and I have a medium amount of surface area to cover. I emptied and cleaned the razor on a regular basis. I replaced the blade after 18 months exactly and it made a little bit of a difference...cuts a bit faster and quicker. I could've easily used the razor for 6 months more without replacement, but it does cut a tad bit better now.
