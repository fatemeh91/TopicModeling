review/text: I bought this pen after trying out several much more expensive pens, including the Visconti lava pen and a couple of Mont Blancs. It has an 18k gold nib, which typically means little flexibility, but this nib is actually moderately flexible (I bought the Fine nib). The pen writes VERY smoothly, and took no getting used to at all. The pen comes with a converter if you want to fill from a bottle, but also takes cartridges. All-in-all, I think this is a great pen for the money.
