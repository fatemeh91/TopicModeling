review/text: These things have changed my life. I have extremely wide and flat feet. This has helped support my feet. I never knew a product like this could do so much to help me. I no longer have pain when I walk from my plantar fister and def less pain from my bunion. I def feel a difference when i for get to put these insoles Into my shoes. I think these will also help my knees and fix my gait. I notice my knees hurt more when I don't use them. Thank you Superfeet. Now I need a few more pairs so that I don't have to keep switching it out.
