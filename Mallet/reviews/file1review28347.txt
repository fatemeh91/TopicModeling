review/text: Optimum Nutrition Whey Gold Standard is always my go to for protein however I wanted to switch it up with the flavor and I couldn't resist trying Cake Batter. This protein flavor does cost more than others but it's very tasty! I do mix other things with my drink so sometimes I completely block out the flavor. Next time I will purchase the normal go to and cheaper option, French Vanilla. Cake Batter is good for a switch up.
