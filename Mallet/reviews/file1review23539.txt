review/text: Heather's Tummy Fiber CAN ~ Organic Acacia 16 oz. CANISTERI have tried this product several times. I doesn't seem to help regulate me and in fact several times after taking it I've had several cramps and gas pains the following day. The peppermint tabs don't seem to help much either. I do better with Metamucil.
