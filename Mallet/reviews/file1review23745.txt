review/text: These inserts are just great. Purchased a pair of these at a local store for much more. These are way cheaper then I found anywhere else. These feel great in my sneakers and other shoes I have. I like the idea that you can change the shape of the arch if you need to do so. Put them in an old pair of sneakers and they felt fantastic on my feet. Some people say they need the full length but I feel I only needed the 3/4.P.S. My Doctor recommended these (it's what she uses).
