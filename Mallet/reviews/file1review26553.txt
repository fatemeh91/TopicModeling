review/text: I love this back pillow, but my first 2 or 3 had leaks over a very short period of time. Why would I even try it multiple times? Because it's really a great product:-Easily Inflatable and Deflatable-Folds up so you can travel with it easily-Tremendously comfortable - better to have it inflatable so you can &#34;customize it&#34;. Make it right for your needs. Also, if you're flying, as cabin pressure changes, you can alter the pillow so it stays the way that you need it.Now...I had this air leak issue. I contacted the company and they sent me several for free...just in case it happens again.The first of that batch they sent me is still the one I use...meaning the issue is solved!
