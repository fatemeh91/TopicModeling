review/text: I recently visited the tropics and my Lady Speed Stick did not hold up. I tried my husband's Speed Stick. It is completely scent free and it worked wonders. I never feared the sweaty armpits with this antiperspirant. If I weren't such a sucker for marketing (I like the womanly scents and pretty packaging), I'd buy men's Speed Stick. It's definitely a winner.
