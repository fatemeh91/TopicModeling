review/text: Hi everyone, I'm a 25-year-old female resident of Virginia. I have pale, Elizabethan skin, and very black hair. Before I bought this epilator, the hair on my legs was very coarse, very thick, and quite noticable. It grew so quickly that shaving was necessary once every other day. Needless to say, this made me feel so unfeminine! So I did a lot of research on hair removal. I read the rave customer reviews for this item and decided to give it a try. The first time I used it, it did hurt. But my leg hair was gone for 3-4 weeks! When it finally did grow back, it grew back sparser and thinner. Now my legs are smooth and require only weekly touch ups to remove the thin hairs that do pop up. The pain diminishes drastically with continued use. (The only problem I encountered was ingrown hairs; I recommend using St. Ives Apricot Scrub to help with these.) In short, this product is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Do not think your hair is too coarse and stubbly for this to work. It is wonderful to be able to put on something that shows the legs and go out of the house on the spur of the moment, without having to stop, stoop over the bathtub, and shave. One less thing to fret about! I'm impressed with this product!
