review/text: When I received my order, the bottles arrived empty and the whole carton was wet with liquid. I contacted AmericaRX and they demanded a picture, and gave no apology. Unfortunately, I had thrown the carton away. It would have dried by then, anyway. I would not order this product from this company, or any other product, for that matter! No customer service!
