review/text: This is the best lube out there for women with sensitive parts. Sillicone-free so it's safe for condoms, and glycerine-free so it's safe for women who are prone to yeast infections. It's so gentle and natural-feeling, it feels like we aren't using anything artificial, which is a BIG thing! Keeps things nice and slippery, not thick and sticky, for a good long time, which amounts to LOTS of fun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
