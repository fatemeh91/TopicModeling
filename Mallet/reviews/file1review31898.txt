review/text: After I did an ALLNIGHTER on BLACK FRIDAY to do shopping, something happened to my heart, I damaged it somehow after a full year of burning the candle at both ends. I ran hard and staying up all night on BLACK FRIDAY broken something in my body so that ----> I had racing heart, irregular heartbeat, heart beating so hard, every beat was painful, was dizzy and the room was spinning due to lightheadedness, and diastolic pressure of 40!!!! I was sure I was a goner and the ER could find NOTHING WRONG, ekg good, bloodwork excellent, triglycerides normal range, etc. etc. etc. I was eating raw dandelion juices, raw goatsmilk, you name it and NOTHING would help me. I called my parents to alert them I was not going to make it. Then I took OMEGA ZYME in my raw dandelion juice and my heart beat calmed in TEN MINUTES!!! I then took the OMEGA ZYME in water only to besure this was the "fix" to the heart rate and it IS. ******* I honestly don't know why this works -- I know there is a HEART / ENZYME connection but I don't really know HOW *****. On a business trip I ran out of the OMEGAZYME and used ABSORBAID and I was right back in the TRASHER again. So not just any enzyme powder will do. I had to rush to buy some MORE OMEGA ZYME POWDER to halt the irregular heartbeat and rapid heart rate, combined with the SUPER LOW DIASTOLIC. AFter 8 hours after the OMEGA ZYME (and I now add GARDEN OF LIFE RAW GREENS) and THE RAW GREENS, my diastolic goes back up to 70+ and I feel the strength of a LION. Back to my TYPEA lifestyle. ANYWAY -- THANK GOD FOR GARDEN OF LIFE. I'd be 6 feet under if I didn't THINK to TRY THIS enzyme I had bought earlier in the year but only took on occasion. I'm glad it was in my kitchen during my time of extreme need. AND I HAD NO IDEA AN COMPLEX ENZYME POWDER to STOP IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT, PULL MY HEART RATE BACK TO NORMAL in the 70 range and pull my DIASTOLIC back to normal in 70 range, and blood pressure from 135 to 103. And ....there's a brain benefit too, faster brain speed. Wow. All that in an ENZYME.
