review/text: I really should have listened to other reviewer complaints of the chemical/plastic smell. I tried it once and couldn't bear to use it again after. I have had it laid out for a week now and the smell has yet to diminish. I will try washing it in the machine next, as recommended by some user. Can't use it until I get rid of that smell as it really distracts from the class. That being said, the blocks, strap, and bag (somewhat lame, but still useful) are worth the $20 alone, so the 3stars are really for that part of the package. Not a bad beginners set if the mat eventually loses the smell
