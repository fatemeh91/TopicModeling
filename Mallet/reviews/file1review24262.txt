review/text: I wouldn't waste your money. I used them for over a month and had absoultely no change. Not only that but the company is underhanded. When they charge you almost as much for shipping as they do for the product something is wrong. I paid 34.90 for the inserts (one for my wife and one for me) and they charged me 24.85 for the shipping and I just used regular shipping, nothing like overnight or 2 day. Ridicules considering it only cost 5.00 dollars to ship.
