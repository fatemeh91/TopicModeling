review/text: It delivers the needed daily fiber with the most ease of any, while being invisible to the eye, like a ghost, and tasteless to the palate. My advice: you decide what dose is right for you by experimentation; what they recommend is far to little unless you're already eating the equivilent of 2 cans of beans a day. Do the math; divide the number of servings, 150, into the ounces, 20.2. You get 1/13 of an ounce (works out the same no matter what size you buy). Come on now ... there's no way you get as many servings as they claim on the package. Not if you want it to work.Jess Duboy. Google me.
