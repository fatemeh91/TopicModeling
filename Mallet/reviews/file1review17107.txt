review/text: I was looking for a new trimmer because the one I had's battery finally wouldn't hold a charge (even when plugged in) so naturally I went on to Amazon to find another.The same day it arrived in I opened it up and started using it. It was great and felt like a professional trim. The picture posted makes it look like its straight but its got some curve to it like a banana. It takes a little to get used to but I'm sure I will get the hang of it.I also like that it is simple and does the job. The previous trimmer I had, has all these different hookups and attachments that I either loose them or never use them and comes in a display case that I don't care to keep out on the counter. Its just one trimmer, comb and brush.
