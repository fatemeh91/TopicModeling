review/text: I don't have fungus, but after reading the product description decided to buy this product anyway. It's a refreshing, non-drying foot soap. As a diabetic, I have to be careful about how a bath leaves my skin, especially in winter. This allows for a gentle, antibiotic cleansing. Revives the tired toes and soothes hard working feet.
