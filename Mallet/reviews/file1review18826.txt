review/text: I used this product throughout my sixth pregnancy and can easily say this is the best pregnancy I've had. It has helped TREMENDOUSLY with night leg cramps. I think the magic is the 4:1 ratio of magnesium and calcium. I ran out and tried to substitute with magnesium pills taken with a glass of milk. No way -- back to bad leg cramps every night until my Mineral Rich arrived. Needless to say, I'm making sure I won't be running out again!
