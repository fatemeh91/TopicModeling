review/text: I have very mild acne and incipient rosacea; this sulfur soap helped with both. Of course it smells like sulfur, but it's bearable; it also dries the skin a little bit, but I applied a moisturizer immediately after washing with the soap and had no problems with the dryness. All these are minor cons, compared with the pros.However, there is quite a significant promise the manufacturer profess, but doesn't accomplish: it does NOT dissolve and remove blackheads.
