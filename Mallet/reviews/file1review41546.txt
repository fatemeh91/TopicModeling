review/text: My teeth are now really clean and the gums get a good workout. I think my dentist will be happy, especially with the back sides of the teeth which the hygenist usually has to really pick at during the cleanings. My only problem is that the button which changes the speed/mode of the brush is easily pressed accidentally while brushing. To make sure I don't press it, I have to consciously move my hand farther down on the handle than I would naturally grab it. But that's not really a big problem.
