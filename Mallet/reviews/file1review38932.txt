review/text: These are the best blades for sensitive skin. This isn't the first type of razor/blades I've used but is the best I've used. The smooth action of the blades minimizes the risk of bad cuts. The aloe strip on the blades leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized after shaving.However, I can find the blades a few dollars cheaper at Target or Wal-Mart than on-line.
