review/text: My vet recommended putting my German shepherd puppy, Pongo, on probiotic supplements to help with his irritable bowels. If Pongo gets into any food that isn't his dry food he has abnormal stools for several days. I started Pongo on Probios about a month ago and have begun seeing improvements. He used to have issues about once a week. Since using the product, he has only had one week of abnormal stools, opposed to about 3-4. I would definitely recommend giving this a try if your pet has IBS/abnormal stools/etc.
