review/text: As a personal trainer, I bought this accessory to go with the OMRON Blood Pressure Monitor HEM-712C. The large cuff fits arms from 13" to 17" which can accommodate those who may be a bit overweight or large like bodybuilders. It works fine.Although I couldn't say that about the OMRON HEM-712C Blood Pressure Monitor, which runs on batteries. It didn't always give me a reliable reading with or without this large cuff because of using batteries. I eventually opted to buy another brand blood pressure monitor that runs on electricity. It was more reliable. I tried to use this cuff with it but it was a different brand and didn't fit.I eventually achieved good results using a wrist blood pressure monitor.This cuff works good, but, I recommend using it with an OMRON monitor that runs on electricity. It needs more power to inflate than batteries can supply.
