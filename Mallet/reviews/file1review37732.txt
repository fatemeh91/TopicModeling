review/text: I was amazed at how well this product worked. I've tried depilatories in the past with very little success, so expected similar performance from this product. But it worked remarkably well. I still needed to touch up a few patches with a razor, but I'll try to put the lotion on thicker next time and leave it on just a little longer. I had to use a lot of this lotion in order to get decent coverage: don't expect a 6-oz. bottle to last for more than two applications for your legs. An added bonus is that this particular product has moisturizers to help keep your skin soft. I tested a small patch of skin on my face, and it didn't have the typical redness and swelling, although it did sting and leave it a little numb afterwards. I wouldn't recommend using this product on your face, but for legs, it has worked wonderfully!
