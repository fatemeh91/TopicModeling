review/text: I am constantly battling knots in my shoulders, and the Body Back Buddy is just what I need to get relief at the end of the day. The BBB is sturdy and well designed to allow you to work over most tight spots that are out of reach. The curved hook for shoulders alone is worth the price! I use it everyday, and I'm always finding new ways to apply it to different muscle groups. I am a triathlete and I use the BBB for post-workout recovery from longer or intense exercise. If you buy this product and a foam roller, you are going to be in great shape.
