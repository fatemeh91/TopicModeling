review/text: I keep reading reviews about how this product makes people want to crawl out of their skin or get really paranoid. I WISH! Unfortunately, I'm one of those odd people that caffeine has the opposite effect. Instead of getting cranked and jittery, it makes me amazingly tired. Yay for adult ADD!? I thought that Zantrex 3 would work like coffee or Red Bull on me, and it did. I took 2 before a meal and 20 minutes later I was ready for a nap. But on the other hand, Benadryl helps me to wake up. Yes, inverse reaction to that too. So I started taking half a Benadryl or one Unisom Sleepmelt to curb the sleepy effects of the Zantrex and voila! Four months later I am 60 lbs lighter and I haven't been happier in years. If you think this product won't work for you because you get tired off caffeine, try combining with a low dose of some kind of antihistamine and it should work just fine... as long as diphenhydramine doesn't knock you out cold. You might want to try this combo on an afternoon where you have no plans and can have the kids out of the house for a couple hours just in case.
