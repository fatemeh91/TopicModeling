review/text: I shave my head to the skin about twice a week, and I had been using a VS clipper for about two years, the old clipper died so I bought this one. In the last two years they must have changed who manufactures their equipment because this one was a hunk of junk. It felt cheep as soon as I took it out of the box and when I attempted to cut my hair IT WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH! It would get bound up in about two strokes and then yank my hair. Not a very pleasant feeling.
