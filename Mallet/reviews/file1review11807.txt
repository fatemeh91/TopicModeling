review/text: I've been using Champion Nutrition Pure Whey Protein Stack for years. I like the chocolate or coca-mochaccino powder mixed in a blender with choclate soy milk, ice, sugar free da vinci syrup and espresso... beats the heck out of Starbucks anyday. I also like the vanilla powder blended with vanilla soy milk, soy yogurt or fatfree yogurt, ice, and sugar free da vinci syrup. Amazon seems to have the best price on the product when you factor in the free shipping.
