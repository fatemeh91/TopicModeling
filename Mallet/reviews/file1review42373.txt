review/text: I was at first a little suspicious of how well this could work, but I received it today and after emptying my Ileostomy bag, I added 4 or 5 drops, fingers crossed. The next time I needed to empty a full bag, absolutely no smell whatsoever. I was pleasantly surprised and couldn't believe my nose. This product is an absolute life-saver when it comes to the self-consciousness of a bag.
