review/text: I buy these primarily as protein snacks for use during all day matches. Since I have hypoglycemia, it's important to have very low sugar content. The taste is pretty good, but there is an after taste.There is 32 grams of sugar alcohols, but sugar alcohols are supposed to be NOT seen as sugar by the body. I do feel quite good for some time after eating it. This is a good sign that the sugar alcohol is not being seen as sugar by my body.
