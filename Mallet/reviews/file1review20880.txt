review/text: Just got this razor for Christmas. Have been using a Norelco for about 10 years and it was a good razor, but this shaver gives me alot closer shave. Doesn't take as long to shave and my face feels as good as a blade. As mentioned in earlier posts the cleaning system may be a little over the top but it wouldn't keep me from owning this razor.
