review/text: This is a nice moisturizing lotion but the smell is a little overwhelming. It triggered a migraine for me. I would not suggest this lotion to anyone who is sensitive to strong scents. Other than that I liked the lotion. May even buy again. I have to use it at night when my body will be under the covers to tone down the scent a little.
