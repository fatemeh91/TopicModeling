review/text: I have tried so many things - including but not limited to .. a vibrating hand held back massager, I bought a chair pad with a massager on it, used creams and back patches trying to release the knots in my back and while these things gave temporary relief.... This Back Buddy has been the only thing that has worked in getting right into the knots and work them out. I don't think that I will need to dole out any more money to pay for a back massage!
