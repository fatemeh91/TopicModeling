review/text: This is a very nice product, but the description says that this product is 100% cotton. Upon receipt the tag said 80% cotton and 20% polyester. We have sensitive skin in our family and I would never have purchased this product if I had known that it was only 80% cotton as opposed to the 100% advertised.If you have no concerns about polyester then this is a nice product.
