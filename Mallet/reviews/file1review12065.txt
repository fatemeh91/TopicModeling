review/text: i took these while pregnant and am now nursing. i love them! i even did the dissolve test from dr oz with these and they passed! great product. they never gave me gut or "bathroom" issues from the iron and they never gave me headaches from the calcium (took others that gave me wicked headaches from the different calcium in them). plus love the fact that the vitamins are actually from food and also that there are no preservatives or food dyes like the target brand that my midwife suggested i buy when pregnant
