review/text: I bought this item only a few days ago. I did not expect it for several days. The only problem about that is I have to pretend to be health and start working out sooner. Also, thanks for the additional product sample.This Met-Rx stuff is the only health-thing I like, and Extreme Chocolate is the flavor I like the best. I like it the best because I am a sweet tooth. I like adding some banana in the blender and pig out; this way I can tell myself that I eat fruit.
