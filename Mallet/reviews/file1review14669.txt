review/text: I was taking a multi-vitamin and an anti-inflammatory medication. I started with 3000 mg of spirulina (now foods) and the first day I took two 10 mg of tablets of the vinpocetine (source naturals, 1 in the morning and 1 at lunch). I didn&#8217;t go to sleep until after 3 a.m. that night, attributing this to the vinpocetine. I decreased the vinpocetine to just one 10 mg tablet in the morning after that and had no more difficulties going to sleep. The vinpocetine definitely made me more focused and it seems to have helped my memory. I didn&#8217;t expect such a quick reaction to the vinpocetine. I did not notice any reduction in my tinnitus symptoms though.
