review/text: Have relied on this product to both prevent and fight illness many times -- it works great. Packed with every immune-boosting substance known, from megadoses of vitamins, to garlic, to propolis and zinc. I personally found the tablets (stronger) preferable to the capsules (less potent, so you have to take more), though the latter is cheaper.
