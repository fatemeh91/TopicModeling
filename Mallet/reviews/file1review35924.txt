review/text: On Sunday, Sep 5th 2010, I use the ionic toothbrush for the very first time (without toothpaste or water). As I brushed, the amount of saliva in my mouth increased. I had to spit out when there is too much saliva. As the saliva flowed out, I can feel bits and pieces of plaques over my lips. The second time I use it was on Wednesday, Sep 8th.I had my regular dental appointment (3 times a year) on Sep 9th for general cleaning. My dentist confirmed that my teeth have much less plaque. What a great product!Thanks for reading.
