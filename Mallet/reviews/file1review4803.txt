review/text: Love this product. This is my second purchase of Miracle Greens 30oz. Having tried at least three other products I can say that this is by far the best of the group... mixes easily, the taste is mild or non-existent mixed into a smoothie, is GF and certified organic. Here is the recipe for my favorite smoothie:1 Cup of Almond Milk1 Scoop of Miracle Greens1 Scoop of Miracle Reds1 Scoop of Bioplex WPI (Whey Protein)1 Tb Fit Flax1 Tb Fish Oil or Flax Oil1 Cup or more of Fresh-Frozen Strawberries (or other fruit)Mix in a Vitamix or blender and enjoy.Have one of these in the morning and you'll start the day out with the nutrient equivalent of 5 servings of vegetables and 5 servings of fruits and berries from the Miracle products alone.Read the label. If you like the idea of 'real' food supplementation over vitamin pills, I highly recommend this product.
