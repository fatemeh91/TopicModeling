review/text: This product is amazing. After a spring camping trip this year I couldn't get my eyes under control. They were itching so much I had constant mornings where they'd wake up nearly shut. Trips to the doctor for special drops did absolutely nothing. I finally decided to try to &#34;ice&#34; my eyes at night, as it just felt like the only thing that would provide relief. We got this mask and I put it in the freezer right away. The next morning, for the first time I woke up without my eyes swollen shut, and I could breathe. I don't know if it's an intended use, but my stuffy nose even felt better! This has become my go-to for summer nights when those allergies are just kicking me down.There are some downfalls. The first mask I got tore the outer seam (there are multiple layers to the fabric) within days. It was a little annoying, but didn't effect the use. It got wet while camping again (it stressed on instructions not to do this) and quickly got ruined. I ordered a second one which came, and has ripped in the same spot again. It doesn't stay put all night, although honestly I wouldn't expect it to - it stays put while I go to sleep, which is most important to me. Lastly, it doesn't stay cool long, maybe 20-25 minutes at most. This can be a huge downfall, but I love the product SO much that to me it's worth it to just buy another, and have two or three on hand at all times. I only use it right before going to sleep or as relief, so that time table works for me.This is such a great product; I wouldn't live without it.
