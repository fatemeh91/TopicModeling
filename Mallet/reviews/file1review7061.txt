review/text: I truly hate this shaver. This thing is 1970's technology. It can't cut longer hairs so I am constantly scouring my face for missed hairs. The trimmer can cut a maximum of one or maybe two hairs at a time. If you try to trim your sideburns, it tries to yank them out for you. The head doesn't pivot, so you have to concentrate to keep both blades on your face at a time. It doesn't even cut the hair that close either. I don't consider my beard that heavy so I would hate for someone with a heavy beard to use it. If I skip a day, I dread using it because it will start to get jammed by the longer hair and start to yank them out (ouch!).It is also noisy. My last Braun was far quieter than this thing. I just hate it. The plastic is very cheap looking as well.Overall, there are no redeeming features to this thing. My theory is that other people have made the purchase and regret it. They provide good reviews because they want you to endure the agony of using it as well. I am toying with replacing it, but I am cheap and it does work albeit not well. I also don't have any clue of what to replace it with. The new generation of shavers are expensive and will only last as long as their batteries. AAARRRRGGGHHH!
