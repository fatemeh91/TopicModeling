review/text: My husband only uses Wahl! He has a tough heavy beard, and has struggled for years to find a good electric razor to cut his beard instead of pull it out! He was listening to NPR a couple years back and Paul Harvey was talking and recommended Wahl. My husband tried it and has not been more pleased! He is working on wearing out razor #2.
