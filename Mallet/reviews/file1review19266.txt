review/text: My husband and I were given &lt; 1% chance of conceiving naturally after he was diagnosed with cancer in his early 20s. We were told that IVF with ICSI was our only option. After hearing this, we took a break from our RE to discuss the options in private. I purchased this product for my husband to take in the mean time. 6 months later, we returned to the RE for another analysis. His SA showed an improved count from ~2 million to ~15 million! We conceived naturally shortly there after! When we try for #2, we will definitely be back for more.
