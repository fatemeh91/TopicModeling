review/text: The stuff inside seems to work great, but after the heavy smooth jar slipped from my damp fingers ( hey, it's an after shave?) hit my sink on it's tumble to the floor, each impact producing a thin, sharp,sliver, one of which I found the hard way, I have to say that the marketing genius who designed this bottle ought to be dope slapped with a cow liver.This is the first glass jar product I ever bought from Nivea, and I guess my last, at least for an after shave.
