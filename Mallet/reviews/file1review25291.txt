review/text: I didn't know if this would help my pain or not, since I had tried willow bark before and it had upset my stomach. I take this every pm(1 tablet) and have stopped taking the extra strength tylenol I was taking before. I am so glad to not be taking the other due to taking it for so many years and not wanting to harm my liver or kidneys! I take when I feel achy too. It has not upset my stomach either. I have fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue, this seems to help(as many other products recommended by Dr Teitelbaum do).
