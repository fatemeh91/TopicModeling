review/text: I've been using Relora for two weeks, and have lost 4.2 lbs so far. I was reluctant to try this product, but a friend recommended it, and based on that (and the fact that the prices here on Amazon are so reasonable) I decided to order it and give it a try. I've been on points-based eating plan for awhile, and I'd lost over 50 lbs until I re-started college last fall (after retiring from a 32-yr career in high tech). I hadn't been inside a classroom since 1978, and the high stress of classes, papers, exams, etc. caused my weight loss to halt, and the increased exercise (stairs, hills, etc. and carrying around 20+ lbs of books) led to a gradual weight gain, despite religiously continuing my diet/exercise routine. Combine that with the fact that I'm past 50, and the old metabolism just isn't what she used to be.I wasn't expecting much, but almost immediately I noticed that I was sleeping better and within a week I was feeling less &quot;edgy&quot; during the day. My eating habits haven't really changed much -- I was already eating pretty sensibly following the diet plan guidelines, points, etc. -- but some of the cravings have definitely disappeared. I used to crave a sweet snack in the afternoon and evening, and I find I just don't think about it anymore. This actually leaves me with more points to &quot;spend&quot; on healthier fruits, veggies, and protien.I'm really not easily impressed, and tend to be HIGHLY skeptical of claims made for supplements. There's no such thing as a magic pill, at least not yet. Relora is NOT a magic pill, but if you're already watching what you eat, exercising regularly, and have hit a plateau, this just might help. I would never have believed it if I hadn't tried it myself, but I'm convinced there's something to Relora, and I intend to continue taking it as long as I continue to see results.
