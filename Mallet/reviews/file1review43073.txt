review/text: I have two sets of twins and used this with my second pregnancy. It looks complicated, but it isn't. The straps on the shoulders did show if I wore a shirt with a really wide neck, but I didn't care. It did make my back hurt a little at first, but I think it was because I have crappy posture and this helped me with that. After those first couple days, it helped my back instead of hurting it. I wish I would have had this the first time around too.
