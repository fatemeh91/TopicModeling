review/text: I need to floss my teeth to keep them clean, but flossing never really cleaned in between my teeth. I tried this brand of Brushpicks and was blown away by how great they work and leave your mouth feeling so clean. This product is one of those produced that after you start using it you will never stop using it. It will be a staple in your life. They are hard to find in the stores for some reason and similar products are NOT as good as this brand!
