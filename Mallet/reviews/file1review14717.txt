review/text: I started taking this herb when I first started nursing because I was determined to be able to meet the needs of my hungry little boy, and it certainly did help increase my milk supply noticeably. At first I was taking 2 capsules 3 times a day, but it seemed like I had an oversupply, so I cut down to 1 capsule 3 times a day. All was fine until my son hit about 12 weeks, and my normally mellow infant starting having screaming fits and became very gassy and fussy. I was also very gassy but thought this was a normal part of postpartum recovery.I tried eliminating the usual culprits from my diet, and never thought to consider that fenugreek was causing the gas in both myself and the baby. It's been about 4 days since I stopped taking fenugreek and my gas is gone, and the baby is much happier.I know fenugreek helped me establish my milk supply and has helped a lot of others boost theirs, but it just didn't agree with me or my baby. I've gone to mother's milk tea (which has a lot less fenugreek and many of the other herbs that support healthy lactation). Here's to hoping for more milk and less gas!
