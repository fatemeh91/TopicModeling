review/text: First of all let me say I have only used this brush for water bottles. We have purchased many bottle brushes just to get them home and not work for all our water bottles. This one does! It is long, thin and it's bristles aren't so hard they won't budge. This is also a high quality brush. Overall, it actually did the job of a bottle brush and did it well! You won't regret purchasing this!
