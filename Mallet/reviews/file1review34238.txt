review/text: I tried everything. This stuff and others on amazon is good for temporary relief. Mine usually comes back from drinking the day before. The only thing that work regardless of drinking or not is hemclear. Although it's stop for 2 weeks as of today, I'll update if it comes back but the longest so far. I'm very hopeful and very excited that I had to do a review for anyone who doesn't know about this product.
