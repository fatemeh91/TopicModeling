review/text: Unbelievably rich and luxurious. Truefitt & Hill shaving creams whip up thick, creamy lather in no time flat. This is true of all their creams, but I decided to stick with this unscented one so that afterwards, I can choose an aftershave balm to suit my fancy for that day without risking a clash of fragrances. I like Proraso cream a lot, but Truefitt & Hill is in a league by itself.
