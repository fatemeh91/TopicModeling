review/text: Hello All,I've read many reviews on this product along with the tea as well. My first day on the pills was yesterday (8/14/12) and today I'm starting the tea as well. So far the pills aren't so bad to be honest and the tea tastes fine (taste like Jasmine tea).Like most comments on here, I am too irregular and have been trying for 7 months. I was on the birth control pills for 10 years as well. I am in my early thirties. My husband and I had two ectopic pregnancy within the last 4 months and we are not giving up! I do hope FertilAid will help my cycle back on track let alone have a healthy reproductive and mostly importantly help me concieve a healthy baby. Best of luck to us!P.S. I will be sure to keep those updated if I see any difference and hopefully concieved within the next month or so. (I normally do not write reviews or yet do blogs or any of those stuff).Best.V.P.
