review/text: Dreading shaving your legs because of dry, sensitive skin?I have used this for the last year and especially like this particular gel over the previous shaving creams and other gels. It lathers up well. Moisturizes and protects my legs from machette cuts by my manual razor and has a very light scent. As an asthmatic I really can't use strongly scented products and I have never had a problem with this gel. I've never experienced a problem with skin sensitivity using it either.It leaves my legs feeling soft and smooth but not greasy. Granted, I still have to use moisturizer, but definitely not as much.Happy legs!
