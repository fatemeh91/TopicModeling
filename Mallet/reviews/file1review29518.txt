review/text: In general, this combo served me well on neuro rotation. I gave it 4 starts short of 5 because the rubber percussion piece is a nightmare on the white coat, it constantly left black marks on my coat. Also, if it could have been designed to be a tad shorter, it would have been a perfect fit in my white coat pocket.
