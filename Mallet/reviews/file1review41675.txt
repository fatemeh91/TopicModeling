review/text: This is my second Oral-B Triumph. The first was recommended by my dentist...and had used it for two years...but unfortunately it was stolen from a motel room. I couldn't wait for this replacement toothbrush to arrive. My teeth and mouth simply did not feel as clean using a manual toothbrush.
