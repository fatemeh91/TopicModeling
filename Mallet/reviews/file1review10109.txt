review/text: I have asthma, and we are currently in the midst of a long spell of freezing temperatures with sub-zero wind chills, and periods of snow every day. It's been brutal. I bought this some time ago, and since my scarf keeps falling off my nose, I decided to give it a try. It works real well. Mind you, it's not fashionable. I look like I'm going to rob the bank. (I don't wear it into stores), but it's kept me breathing warm air, while I'm trying to scrape ice off my windshield. The elastic keeps it in place, and that's a plus. I've been wearing it, even after the car warms up. It's turned out to be a good buy; I'm going to pick up a spare.
