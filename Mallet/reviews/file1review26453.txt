review/text: Actually, the Pocket Rocket has been a round quite a while. What's new is the seven interchangeable massage heads. This handy little gadget is useful as a small massager, though as its one AA battery suggests, it's not too powerful. It is just right, though, for taking with you, wherever you go, and quickly and effectively massaging sore or tense spots.Even better, though, is using it as a vibrator! The pocket rocket is small enough to hide in a nightstand, and it's nice and quiet. It is definitely of the "outie" variety, though, so please do not even consider inserting it in any opening.So, if you want a small and quiet "outie" vibrator, one that's light on the battery requirements, then get the Pocket Rocket. It's a great piece of vacation gear!(Review of Doc Johnson The Original Pocket Rocket 4-Inch Ivory Vibrator)
