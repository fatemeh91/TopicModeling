review/text: This product had a refreshing scent. The gel produced a thick lather and spread evenly on my legs. I was able to get a clean shave -- I was amazed with the results. I didn't even have to use lotion on my legs after shaving, because the aloe left my legs smooth and moisturized. I would highly recommend this product for a clean, smooth shave.
