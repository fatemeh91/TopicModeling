review/text: This lube remains one of the best, if not the best lube i have used.I cannot write enough about it. All that it says it lives up to, it does.For a higher price but resonable when you know where to buy (amazon)this lube is healthest ingredients sold for a lube, TASTLESS AND ODERLESS, moisterizing, can be used underwater, water resistant, silky, smooth, long lasting, made of longer lasting silicone, latex friendly, good for vaginal and anal and even massages if you are in to any of that lol. Its even been featured on a music video "sex room". an intresting fact for you. When compaired to its sticker and less long lasting counter part ky jelly, there is no compairision. By the way this stuff really lasts a long time. I once wasted it on the floor a little bit of it. Two weeks later its still there. Transparent but there! If i was you id watch the spills, for you might end up falling for the stuff does not evaporate!!! If not this lube, i do reccommend other silicone lubes like this one. Maybe even astroglide(may stain some fabrics and cannot be used with some sex toys for fear of breaking down the material. stick with latex when using)
