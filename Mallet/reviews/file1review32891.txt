review/text: I concur with most of the reviews in regards to steeping time and dosage. As everyone's body makeup/chemistry is different, I would certainly be judicious in your first cup and brew it for only 5-6 minutes. In less than 2 hours I was definitely feeling nature call; however I had no cramping or pain. I likely would have though if I had steeped it any longer. Also, be reminded that ANY type of laxative (medicinal or herbal) can make the intestine lazy and dependent, so use only when a diet high in fiber and liquid (along with exercise) isn't enough to keep you "regular".
