review/text: Wwell...I had been really psyched to try this out. All about the natural toothpastes, and I tried this specifically for the xylitol. Plus I like apricots...Now, I use it and Im like...ok there is some non reg. toothpastey taste...ok.Teeth getting cleaned.Ok feeling refreshed afterwards.All good right?But the stuff also leaves a unpleasant just because its weird chalky taste in my mouth. And when I wake in the morning, its a weird feeling.I suppose my mouth wasn't as dry, anymore...even though Ive gone back to not drinking much during the day at all. But it always had this weird thing to it. Maybe this is too much 'nature' for me. Too natural. Perhaps Im too used to regular aqua fresh or any of the other leading brands.I like getting brushed and not being chalky however slightly.And the taste of the tooth paste is more haunting than the outright blast of flavors for other pastes...Well...Ive stopped using this one, only after using it for 3 days.I probably will switch back and forth iwth my reg. toothpaste though, since I paid for it.
