review/text: I have been using this prenatal since i was 12 weeks pregnant. My dd is now 10 months old and i still take it (nursing mother). I highly recommend this prenatal because i have found it to be of great value for a high quality vitamin. much cheaper to buy online than in my local grocery store. also, the fact that i only need to take one a day was key to chosing it. But the main reason for chosing this one is because the form of iron in this particular supplement is NOT ferrous fumarate, which can be a very constipating form of iron. Amino acid chelated iron does not constipate and the addition of spirulena in the ingredient helps digestion as well. during pregnancy and first 9 months of nursing, i also took the DHA supplement that rainbow light offers. i never got sick, constipated or nausiated from these pills. i find it best to take them before bed, because i keep them by my bedside so i remember before i sleep. also these vits are odorless and dye free. I have noticed a my skin has been really soft since taking them too and my nails are really strong and grow beautifully. i cannot say enough about them!
