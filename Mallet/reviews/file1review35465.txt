review/text: We have an eight-year-old Bosch dishwasher. The stainless steel inside of dishwasher become stained with soap and spot rinse residue. Normal cleaning with soap and water never completely remove the residue it would always reappear after the next wash cycle. I saw an advertisement on TV for a dishwasher cleaner and thought why not give it a try.The directions were easy to follow. Open the lid on the bottle, place the bottle upside down in the silverware basket, close the dishwasher and run the machines on the hottest cycle which is usually the pots and pans setting. I didn't believe it would clean the inside of the dishwasher. To my amazement, it looks brand new.I tell people how dishwasher magic can make their dishwasher look brand-new. Buy it today and prove to yourself it actually works.
