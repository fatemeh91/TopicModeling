review/text: This product did not make me breakout, unlike a lot of antiperspirants. I also anticipated that the product would be cold and was happily surprised when it was not! Also the dial-up applicator worked very well, though I think people would have to be careful about dialing up only the proper amount. I would buy this product. I suggest something be done about the label -- the packaging was not eye grabbing. Almay has a fresh, clean, pure image that wasn't well promoted on the label.
