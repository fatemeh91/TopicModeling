review/text: These flossbushes make it much easier for my kids to floss themselves. They're somehow just the right size and angle - my 7 and 9 year olds have a hard time with regular floss, and with most disposables. These work great for them - I wish they were more broadly distributed (e.g. our local drugstore doesn't carry them).
