review/text: As a diabetic, I need sugar-free products. All other cough drops seem to contain Isomalt. Isomalt (and sometimes Malitol) can create huge, very painful (and embarassing) amounts of intestinal gas in people sensitive to Isomalt or Malitol. GoLightly does not use either Isomalt or Malitol. I have used these cough drops for years. A case might sound like a lot, but they are in 30 individual bags. And they go quick - especially when co-workers stop by, to "borrow" a cough drop or two.
