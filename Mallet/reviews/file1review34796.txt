review/text: I have tried all kinds of natural and organic deodorants and this one really works:) I also like the smell...not too essential oily. I have used this one for years and was completely heart broke when my health food store stopped carrying it. My only complaint may be it has a twinge of red and the armpits of my white shirts get slightly pink...guess that is better than yellow:)
