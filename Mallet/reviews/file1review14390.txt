review/text: I bought this product because I was told that you HAVE to use it to clean the type of floor I have, you can use nothing else. I did a part of the floor side by side with my old standby that I use for everything - Mr. Clean and honestly, there is no difference. Well, unless you consider the difference in price. I am just careful to not let the mop be too wet because supposedly too much water can damage the floor, or make the tiles come up. For my money, I'll stick with what's worked for years and costs a lot less.
