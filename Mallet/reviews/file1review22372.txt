review/text: My husband and I bought two of these covers in preparation for the birth of our son. The first time I washed both covers (according to the instructions), neither survived. Both covers emerged from the wash frayed and with holes. Considering that these are items that will require plenty of washing in the future, we were very disappointed with the quality. Also, at $12.99 a pop, we expected better quality.
