review/text: i bought this stethoscope while in nursing school as my first stethoscope purchase because i liked the appearance and other reviews i read. heart sounds can be heard well on this product but lung sounds are not as easily distinguished. they are very muffled and i find it difficult to hear. i would rather have bought a littman from the start.
