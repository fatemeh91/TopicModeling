review/text: I love this product. I find it takes out almost any fresh food stain. It's already saved several favorite items of clothing from the trash bin. It does take a bit of rubbing with the absorbent tip to remove tomato based stains, but remove them it does. I think those folks who have been disatisfied don't get that the tip is the key.
