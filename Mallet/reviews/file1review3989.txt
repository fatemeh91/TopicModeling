review/text: The Fusion does truly gives me the best shave ever, and I have a very thick beard, and I have to agree the blade on the back is useless. One thing though, you have to be very careful. One slip of the hand and BAM! I've cut my lips 3 times now, twice bleeding profusely. So be careful...
