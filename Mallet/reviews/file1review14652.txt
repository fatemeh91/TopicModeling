review/text: I like many others have been looking for a supplement that reduces brain fog and increase alertness without the side effects of caffeine. Vinpocetine 10mg achieved those benefits without increasing the heart beat rate or nervousness. It also had an overall calming effect, which was a pleasant surprise.For me, the effects of Vinpocetine 10mg was not felt until two hours after taking the tablet and lasting about eight hours. After six months of use, I can report no improvement with my memory or any other miraculous effects except for increased alertness.There have been times I still needed to take a caffeinated product in order to get my body in motion along with my mind. Because of this, athletes may not find Vinpocetine the most ideal supplement when preparing for a physical workout.10mg daily did not give me headaches; on the other hand, Vinpocetine did not get rid of morning headaches when they infrequently occurred. Caffeine plus 500mg of Tylenol got rid of a headache, so there's still a role for caffeine to play, but at a much reduced rate thanks to Vinpocetine.
