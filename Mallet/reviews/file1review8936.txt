review/text: I read someplace that the Queen of England uses this stuff and even has it given to her pets and horses. Well, if the Queen can hang in there as long as she has with this stuff, it's good enough for me. Really, I love the good health feeling I get from this - shiny hair, bright eyes - no, not a cold wet nose, but just plain old vibrant health. I don't mess around with fancy shakes, but just mix a scoop into a half cup of water, stir it up and chug. If I have to thrash around in the kitchen making some special drink, it just ain't gonna happen. This way, I get all the benefits with no fuss, no muss. Also with all the pesticides and waste water on our produce fields, I think it's wise to look for safe, healthy alternatives.
