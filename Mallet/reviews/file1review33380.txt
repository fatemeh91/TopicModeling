review/text: I recently purchased a Merkur Long handeled razor, and the single blade that was enclosed, was of course the first blade used. For whatever reason, that blade in reality, did not impress me. I tried a few other brands (Derby, Shark, Personna) and then went back to try another Merkur. This blade was much better than the one that came with the razor.....it will usually last me 5 shaves, no nicks or cuts......this is the blade I will stay with.
