review/text: We decided to try these cloth diapers as burp clothes since friends told us it's not worth paying the premium on burp cloths. I just washed these Gerber ones for the first time and they came out of the washer/dryer wrinkled, tattered looking. The fabric/yarn from all four corners pulled out so I had to take a scissor to trim them off. I imagine the next time we put them in the washer, the fabric will just keep pulling out. What a disappointment! The material is extermely, key word, extremely thin. I don't see how these could hold up anything if used as a diaper. The material feels really rough. When we use it as a burp cloths I have to fold it 3 times to make it a little thicker and absorbant otherwise it just leaks right through.Unfortunately I already washed all 12 and can't return them. I am going to just pay the higher premium for real thicker, softer burp cloths.
