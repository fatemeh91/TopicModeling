review/text: These clippers kind of worked the first time, but not really that well. And the more I use them, the worse they become. They will cut some pieces of your hair, but you have to go over the same spot several times before it looks decent, and even then there are some pieces that don't get cut. I would have expected more out of a Wahl, but I was greatly disappointed it how the clippers cut.
