review/text: This dishwashing detergent doesn't wash dishes very well. We've had to run the dishes through the washer twice! It's terrible. The bottle says it's "2X Ultra--High Performance", but I'd say 1/4X. It does smell really good before you put it in the dishwasher, but no smell after the wash.I've used ECOVER products and they're great so far! They have lots of environmentally friendly cleaning products that work wonderfully.I don't expect that a cleaning product without harsh ultra-ly processed and petroleum-filled ingredients to clean as well or with as few extra steps as a product with these. However, I don't like to be lied to on the label. Just tell me, "use three times as much" or "pre-soak for 2 hours prior to attempting using an automatic washer to wash". :) You get the gist.... Furthermore, I would forgo a nice smelling product for one that works well.
