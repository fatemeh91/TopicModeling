review/text: I wasn't so sure that I'd like this product, and may not have liked it after trying only one, but an almost empty box is proof that my husband and I really enjoyed them. You need to eat only one to satisfy your hunger for quite a few hours. This is different from a number of granola-type bars that I have tried that still leave you hungry. My husband also thought they were great -- a quick bite for people who don't have time to eat breakfast. We will definitely be buying these in the future.
