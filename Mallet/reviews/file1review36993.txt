review/text: I, surprisingly, enjoyed using Dry Idea Roll-On. I say surprisingly because in the past I've never liked roll-ons and always used solids. Dry Idea, however, was different. All other roll-ons seemed to stay wet and sticky and never made me feel protected, but Dry Idea worked very well to protect me against perspiration. I would use Dry Idea again and would recommend others using it as well.
