review/text: This was a the best thing I have ever bought!I started walking more without knee and thigh braces.I was taking naproxen due to the factI could not take prescription pain killers.I am taking less and less of naproxen.It has helped a great deal to take this item.It has also helped a freind with arthristis.Thankyou so much.
