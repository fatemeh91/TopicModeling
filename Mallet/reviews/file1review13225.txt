review/text: My 13 daughter has only one kidney and has issues with bladder control. When I purchased her a new bed, she was worried that she would soil her mattress and stain it. I purchased 2 of the Preva pads initally just to see how well they would stand up. I must say these are by far the best pads ever! She does not have bunching problems that you hear about from other pads. They are very durable and wash well. We even use regular bleach in the wash with them and it is no problem! I purchased 2 in April 2009 and I just made another purchase and got her 3 more! Now she has enough to last her 5 days should the laundry get backed up, lol! She feels very safe and comfortable every night! I highly recommend this product!
