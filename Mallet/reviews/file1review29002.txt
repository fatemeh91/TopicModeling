review/text: This shaver did not live up to my expectations from reading other reviews.I have used a remington microscreen foil shaver for over 20 years (2 different units) and thought I would try something different. Big mistake! This Braun looks nice, feels nice but that's it. It takes at least 5 minutes to repeatedly go over my face to finally cut all the hair down to a decent close shave. My old razor would do it in under 2 minutes. Hopefully my regret will not be yours also.
