review/text: I like this product, but i got tired of having to re-apply it, and it drips. It is a great natural product though... The only thing is that depending on what I ate, I felt stinkier with this on, I think it may be the aloe that can smell a bit like onion which us gross. I now use the crystal rock, although I find myself having to find out how much water to rub on its top in order for it to work, and I also must reapply it.I now carry a little soap bar, wet and soap up a tissue, dry, and re-apply. It doesn't take much time if you're quick I guess, and I'm glad to have switched to natural products as much as I can both for myself, the workers who make these products, and for our environment.I guess, that depending on what you eat, and how much water you do or do not drink, you will be a bit stinky no matter what you put on- but it's not as bad as I think, I know (I hope : other's can't tell... ? ;)
