review/text: I love this protein! It is the best protein for the price that I have found (including bodybuilding.com). With my Amazon Prime account I get free 2 day shipping and you can't beat that. This protein tastes pretty good and even with 1.5 scoops after a workout it's lasted me more than a month.
