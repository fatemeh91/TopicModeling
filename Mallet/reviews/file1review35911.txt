review/text: I got a ProClean IONIC toothbrush.(Not Dr. Lung's) I will say my teeth have never been cleaner except right after a cleaning.I didn't use any toothpaste ,just water. However the light on my brush quit working after 3 days. The light is suppose to be an indicator that the process is working. So?? If that is so make sure you stick with a trusted brand. I would get another brush but not the brand I got.
