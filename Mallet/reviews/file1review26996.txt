review/text: This is probably the best tasting protein powder I have used. I have only tried one flavor, double rich chocolate, and don't think I'll be switching to another any time soon, since this tastes exactly like chocolate milk! I use 1 scoop of this + 16oz of whole milk after working out. If you prefer sweeter, you can mix it with 8oz of milk. Either way, delicious. It also doesn't feel very filling. Although you won't be too hungry right after drinking this, you can still eat plenty. And you will get very hungry around 2 hours later.
