review/text: I have an Olympus E510, and I prefer to use accessories specifically made for the camera I have. This purchase will allow me to have an additional (backup) battery, something I think is very important. This battery comes in the original Olympus package, assuring that it is new and authentic. And it would be very hard to find a better price anywhere else and still have the assurance you will get what you actually ordered.
