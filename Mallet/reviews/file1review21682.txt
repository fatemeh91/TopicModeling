review/text: For starters this tub is rather wide on the narrowest end and I was unable to get it under our faucet in the bathtub to fill it with water. This seems a little ridiculous since I'd rather not fill it using a cup. Our bathtubs is a regular size (at least I thought). My child also seemed to slide a lot when I would lean her back to wash her hair, she would slide down into the tub.We decided to send this one back. The biggest drawback was the fact that I could not fill this tub easily.
