review/text: My mother bought me these a few year ago. I had very very thin hair and I hated it. I have been taking different brands of these vitamins for about three years. These are the ones I am taking right now. After 3 months of taking these everybody could notice how much thicker hair had gotten. My nails also never break any more. This product really works. My hair is so thick now and shiny and healthy. I can say myself now that I finally have beautiful hair. If you have the same problem as me take these. They really do work.
