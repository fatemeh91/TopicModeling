review/text: Very nice trimmer. Get's the job done well with adjustable settings.But the battery is a serious problem. I purchased mine about a year ago (Aug 7, 2011) and now I only get a few uses before it dies. And when it dies, it goes quickly without warning so you may have a half-trimmed beard. It will not run off of wall power, so once the battery dies, you're out of luck. So I imagine if you use this frequently, you may need to replace it every year or two.I've had far better luck with my Philips Norelco shaver (Speed XL). Seems to last months on a charge even 3 years later. After this trimmer finally dies, I won't be buy the next one from Remington.
