review/text: I'm 61, and have been working out in the gym at McConnell AFB as part of a program that includes low fat dieting. Working out makes me want steak, and since I need to cut down on my cholesterol, steak is not good right now. Instead, I mix this powder with skim milk, and drink about two cups as soon as I finish working out. It gives me the protein I need, and helps me avoid steak, fish and other sources of protein than come with cholesterol. It is also the best tasting powder mix i have ever tried.
