review/text: This tape is awesome! It's easy to tear, but sturdy when used for a tape job. You can tape about 1 1/2 ankles with a single roll, and the tape doesn't come undone in middle of athletic activities. The stickiness is easy on the skin, and doesn't get stuck to your fingers when you're trying to tape. The tape can be cut with ease after you're done with it.I'm definitely going to keep this product in mind whenever I need tape! Great deal, too.Overall: This tape is great!
