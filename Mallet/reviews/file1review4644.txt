review/text: I wanted to lose 15 lbs so i used this shake with 1 scoop of the herbalife protein, and 3 weeks later, still no weight loss. I would not recommend this product for weight loss, but rather breakfast. It filled me up when i drank it, but I decided to go back to eating chicken twice a day for weight loss and yogurt for b'fast. This definitely works. I just wanted something simpler, but this product is definitely not it for me. I was even doing cardio while using herbalife and it didn't work. I will not be repurchasing this product.
