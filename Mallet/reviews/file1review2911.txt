review/text: I've done a lot of searching for a multivitamin that doesn't make me nauseous and almost throw up soon after I take it. This one is AMAZING. No nausea/upset stomach, even when taken on an empty stomach. Plus all the vitamins and minerals from whole foods? Yes, please! I can't say enough good things about this brand and product.
