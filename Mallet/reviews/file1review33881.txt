review/text: You'll see, feel and hear the quality. These are comfortable and allows me to hear the faintest sounds. These come in a nice box with a replacement diaphragm, different sized ear pieces and the ADC clip to mark your name on the back. I also noticed that the price tends to fluctuate so you can also save a little by putting it in your wish list and watch for the price to drop even more. I purchased the burgundy to match my favorite college team...GO HOKIES! I'm keeping an eye on the price for the stealth black as well, you never know when you'll need to sneak up on someone and listen to their lungs ;p
