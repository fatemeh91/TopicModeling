review/text: Bought this to go with myUltimate Direction Gel Flask Clip-on. The taste is pretty good. I've been usingGu Energy Gel, Chocolate Outrage, 24-Countfor a while since I started running. It's easier to fill the gel flask using the Hammer Gel but I'd like it more if it were not as thick. The GU's are just not as think and are easier to get a serving. I'll probably buy this product again but maybe try warming it up in the microwave or under some warm water before heading out.
