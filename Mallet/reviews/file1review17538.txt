review/text: I have had the trimmer for about a month now and couldn't be happier with the performance and battery life. The construction feels solid, adjusting knob works great. It cuts very well, head opens easily for cleaning. Charged it initially and haven't yet had to charge it again after using it approx 3-4 times a week x 4 weeks. It's a great trimmer, so much better than the Norelco it replaced and for the money it's a steal.
