review/text: The Black Cherry Almond Clif Bar is my favorite, but each member of my family has their own favorite. Whether I bring home the carrot cake, the chocolate chip, or the brownie, I am one popular mom when I announce that I bought more Clif Bars. I've been a Clif Bar consumer for years now. In fact, Clif is frequently a breakfast (with a yogurt), or lunch (with a salad). My kids enjoy them as after school snacks. And now, Clif has come out with their delicious MoJo bars (honey roasted peanut....yum!). Anybody out there that has a crazy hectic life will appreciate the quality and convenience of this great tasting bar.
