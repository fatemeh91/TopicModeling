review/text: This cover is actually light blue--not lavender. I registered for this cover because I wanted light blue. When it was added to my registry, it came up as lavender. I went back to Babies R US to confirm that the SKU number matched the light blue cover and it did. For some reason, there must be a glitch in the online system because even the description of this cover says it is made out of blue terry cloth. In any event, I got the light blue one as I had wanted. Just wanted to post this so everyone knew what color they were getting!
