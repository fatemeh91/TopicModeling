review/text: This was my fifth tub and I have been pleased with it until I learned of what is actually in it. Along with almost all others, it contains arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury!!! Why? Is it made in China!? Check it out online or in the July 2010 issue of Consumer Reports. The powder with the least of these was Solgar. That is what I will most likely be switching to.
