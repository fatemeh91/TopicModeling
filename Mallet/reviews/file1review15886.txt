review/text: For some reason, I thought this would be a nude color (as it looked in the photo), but it's actually white. Wish it came in a more neutral color. In any case, it did help with my back pains as my belly grew bigger. I had to loosen the belt when I sat down since I didn't need the support and it was a bit tight. But when I walked around, I would tighten it. It's true to size.The downside is that the care instructions say to hand wash instead of machine wash. It also was a bit irritating if I wore it on my skin, so I would wear it over my pants, which allowed me to loosen it easily. Other than some minor complaints, I say this was worth the purchase.
