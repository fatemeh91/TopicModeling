review/text: First a little about me. I am almost 23 yr old. Iv been weight lifting for 6 years and playing basketball occasionally. Im 5'9 and am currently about 165 lb. Most of that weight is upper body as i've had a few knee injury that prevented me from doing hard leg workouts. With that said i have skinny legs and small weak knees.my right knees started hurting during the past month so i bought this item in size medium. At first it was a little too tight even on my skinny legs. After the first run i had with them, they loosened up a bit and fitted perfectly. They don't slide down like the other cheaper ones i own and they feel great. at first they feel kinda stiff but I got used to it and forgot it was even there. There is almost no irritations from wearing these.Another great thing about these is that they keep your knees warm. The fact that it keeps my knee warm makes a HUGE difference for me as it drastically reduces the pain during my lift or run or jumps. Doesn't seem like they make a selling point out of this but this really makes a big difference.
