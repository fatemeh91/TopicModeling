review/text: I rate these razors at the top of them all. I've used them all, and simply cannot complain about them. I used to use the Shick quattro and thought it was the best, four blades, right? Wow, what a difference. But it's not just the 5th blade that does it; they use MUCH higher quality metal for the blades, and what really makes a huge difference is that on the fusion, the BACK of the cartridge is OPEN, so that each time you dunk it for a rinse, all of the hairs come right out, and it's 100% clean for the next stroke. Those were the two major weak points on the 4 blade razors, they are closed off mostly on the back, so when you do a fair stroke, it fills with small hairs, and tapping or shaking it around in water just doesnt get it out, and it just gets worse, and worse, and worse...Best razor ever. Make sure you wet your face at least 1 min beforehand, use a thin cream, rinse the blade often, and dry it after shaving. I've never had a cartridge last me less than 2 or 3 weeks, usually a month is the norm. I bought 2 8 packs, and they lasted me 14 months..Anyhow, that's my 2 cents; the open back makes a HUGE difference, along with the ultra high quality blades. I have SUPER sensitive skin, and tried every blade razor but avoided shaving until this one came along. The only thing I think should change is a slight price drop, but as long as they don't go UP in price I'll keep using them for life.
