review/text: I didn't really like the Mitchum Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant. I prefer the traditional stick anti-perspirant/deodorants. I found this product to be oilier than a traditional stick. If I wasn't careful the oil would get on my hands and onto other things such as my contact lenses. The protection that this product provided against odor and wetness was acceptable and comparable to other similar products. I probably wouldn't recommend this product because I didn't like its oily nature, however it does an adequate job as a deodorant.
