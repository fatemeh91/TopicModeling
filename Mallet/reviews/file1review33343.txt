review/text: I have found the merkur blades to be far inferior to the quality of their razors. My merkur 180 came with 10 of these blades, and frankly, they have been actually painful to use. At first I thought it was my technique as I was new to safety razor shaving, but even with practice, different shave creams, pre-shave oil, and a variety of stubble preps, I can say these things are barely usable with my skin type.The pre-shave oil did actually help and make a difference, but not enough to make me even consider staying with these blades. Also they do not hold an edge very well. Maybe my 10 were from a bad batch, but these blades are basically single use. I've tried several times to get multiple shaves out of them, but it just rips my face up too much to continue trying with these things.If they work with your skin type, great. I have fairly sensitive skin and I really don't have very thick beard growth. I'm not sure who these things are made for, but my experience makes me think they are intended for leather faced persons with no facial hair.
