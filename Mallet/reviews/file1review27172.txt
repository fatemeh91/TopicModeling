review/text: I mix 2 scoops with a cup of chocolate Silk and a frozen banana. The soy protein by ON makes a much better shake, both in taste and consistency, but this stuff ain't bad. There's a faintly bitter taste, but it's still pretty darn good, and it doesn't upset my stomach after a hard workout.
