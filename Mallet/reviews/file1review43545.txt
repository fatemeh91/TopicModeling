review/text: Okay, I think I must have joked too many times with potential dates and amours about their heart and blood pressure...So what popped up at Christmas a blood pressure monitor.I must say it works great!!! It comes with a nifty little booklet on Managing High Blood Pressure. It explains the basics: What it is, What it does to your body, and What you can do about it.It is very easy to use: pretty much just put the cuff on like the directions, relax, press the on button, wait for the heart symbol, and then press start. Easy as can be, until the cuff starts feeling like your arm is being squeezed off.This monitor gives the systolic and diastolic pressure along with the pulse rate. This monitor even keeps memory of your readings. Kewl, huh!!!So if you want something simple and easy buy this one I have found it fun to take my blood pressure during the day after all kinds of activities:)I can absolutely say I am in great health, blood pressure health that is, 110 over 70. So take care of your heart and blood pressure.girldiver:)
