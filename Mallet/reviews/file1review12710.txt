review/text: We first tried this product when it was available and a near by health food store. It was for our children who were not old enough to swallow pills and worked great. Great orange taste too. Recently we ran out when we felt a cold coming on. Not wanting to get sick we went to the health food store to buy more and they didn't have this brand anymore. We tried Eclectic Kids brand - it even says "super tasty". I should have known!!! It is TERRIBLE tasting. My kids only tried it once and ran for water to wash it down. From then on we had to highly dilute it with juice to get them to take it until we could get this from Amazon. It was a good price for a 3 pack around $7-8 a bottle in the store I believe it was closer to $10-12. Again we love the taste and now mom and dad use this too because the pills sometimes upset our stomachs. This liquid kind doesn't.
