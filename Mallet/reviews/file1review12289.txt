review/text: There's a lot of talk lately about NOS based benefits to men. I have found for myself that adjusting the amount taken and the rate of frequency taking it does change the results. Yet not everything happens as fast as microwave food. This path is a slow and gentle restoration to health. Allow it the time it needs to bring you back to center.
