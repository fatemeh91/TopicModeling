review/text: This product is worth your consideration. Honestly it does work and it is easy to use. It dissolves in water and tastes like water. Amazon had it delivered to me here in Australia in such a short time I was amazed. For most of my life I have suffered from IBS and other tummy discomforts. I have struggled to make sure I take in enough soluable fiber but not anymore. I strongly recommend this product to anyone considering it.
