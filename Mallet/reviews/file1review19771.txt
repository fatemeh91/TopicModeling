review/text: I think this is the best potty because it does not slip off. I have a five year old too so I can just take it off and put back on whenever or you can lock it down but you do not need to. My baby feels safe on it and he likes sitting on it! Baby Bjorn is a great company with quality products so you will be happy with it!
