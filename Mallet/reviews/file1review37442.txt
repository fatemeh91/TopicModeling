review/text: The reason I gave this five stars is because it really exceeded my expectations. It works really well and doesn't hurt like I thought it would. I remember the epilators from about 10 years ago and they killed.I had done my research with this product and this brand and model got really good reviews on other sites too.I'm really happy because I hate to shave and this is easier and the hair doesn't grow back for so much longer. I don't have to deal with the messy wax any more either. I only wish I had bought it sooner before my waxer.
