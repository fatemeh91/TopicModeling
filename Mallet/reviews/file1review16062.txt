review/text: Herbal Ed's is the most amazing healing salve you could ever find. It works most effectively for anything that is skin related. I have had a severe burn and put Herbal Ed's on it immediately and the burning pain stopped. Then I sealed the salve on the burn with a bandage that I left on for 3 days. When I removed the bandage, the burn was just a mild pink area. This works great on baby's diaper rash. It will heal it in one or two days. It also helped heal a surgical incision on my foot, since this will not dissolve surgical skin glue like petroleum based ointments do. I won't be without it in my medicine cabinet.
