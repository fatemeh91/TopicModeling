review/text: Due to my disability, I really struggle to open the caps of my medication bottles and I always end up having to ask someone to help me. I like to be independent, so thought this product would be good for me. Unfortunately, it was not. I had problems with opening the compartments in order to get my tablets out and had to ask someone to help me. Since this defeated the point of me buying this product - so that I could be more independent - I returned it back to Amazon. If I had not had this problem with being able to open the compartments, this product would have been ideal. The compartments are very large, and the text is large and easy to read (even for me with my visual impairment).
