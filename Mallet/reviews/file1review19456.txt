review/text: I was looking for something I could take with me to use in public restrooms or at other people's homes since my son is afraid of big toilets. I ended up returning this and getting the Fisher Price Travel Potty that comes with a case for around $17.00 from Wal-Mart. It works much better than this toilet trainer.
