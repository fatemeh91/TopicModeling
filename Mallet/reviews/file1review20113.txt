review/text: I had to take this for 4 weeks before I noticed any benefits. For the first week my skin seemed to have a better glow. Then the second week a had a mild headache and my stomach felt bloated. My skin continued to improve, breakouts ceased. Through the third week, the headaches stopped but I still seemed bloated. Then by the fourth week, it seemed I'd lost some weight on my stomach and my skin is completely cleared. That was the main reason I purchased this. I will continue to use.
