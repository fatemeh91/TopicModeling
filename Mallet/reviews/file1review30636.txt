review/text: I've been using this razor for about a year and a half. This is the same razor as the 34C (not sure why they use two model numbers for the same razor).When I first started shaving in the 1970's I used a Gillette adjustable safety razor. When I went off to college I was given a Gillette cartridge razor and was told this was "new and better". It's too bad that it's taken me all these years to figure out that the "old" safety razors are better in virtually all respects to the "modern" expensive cartridge razors.A few things to keep in mind. After using something like a Mach 3, switching to the Merkur HD will take a week or so to get used to. You must be more careful using a classic razor as it is easier to cut your face by accident. However, with a little bit of practice you will get shaves so close you won't believe it's possible with this circa 1904 technology. Trust me, it's true. You will get the best shave of your life.Here are some tips. Use a good razor blade. I recommend the "Derby Extra". They are very, very good; not too aggressive, just right. I find that one out of 40 blades or thereabouts I get a lousy shave. Probably a manufacturing glitch. Each blade lasts me about 6 shaves. You can buy a pack of 100 blades for about $14 or $15 on Amazon.com. So your total cost in blades for a whole year is about $7 to $8.Also, buy yourself a good "super badger" shaving brush and some Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream. After you finish shaving rinse your face with cold water and finish by running an Alum Block (Bloc Osma is great) on your face. After a month or so of using these products your skin will look fantastic.
