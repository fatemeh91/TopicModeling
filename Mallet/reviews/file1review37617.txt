review/text: I was pleased with the Sure Clear Dry Antiperspirant & Deodorant, Clear Gel Solid, Unscented. First of all, I have sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised to find out that this product didn't irritate my skin. There are a couple of other name brand products that did irritate, so I'm very pleased to find a product I can use. This formula went on very smoothly and didn't leave any of those annoying white marks or flecks. I felt dry and comfortable all day and there was no scent to mix with my perfume. I will use this product again. I highly recommend it.
