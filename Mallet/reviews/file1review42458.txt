review/text: I purchased the Body Wrap Elastic Bandages after receiving a mineral body wrap at a local spa. I figured I could duplicate the treatment at home, not knowing that I would be so frustrated with trying to purchase the supplies necessary for the treatment. The bandages that I ordered were so narrow and flimsy...they rolled every time I attempted to wrap them. I was very disappointed with the width of these bandages and would like a full refund!!!
