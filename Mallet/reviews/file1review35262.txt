review/text: Children's ear aches are a nightmare, and this remedy is a Godsend for parents caring for a screaming baby that is pulling at his ears. It contains a combination of homeopathic remedies that help with restlessness, irritability, fever, inflammation, congestion in the ears, and for throbbing, pulsing, burning pain in the ears. It even includes a remedy for ear pain that is worse at night, which isn't that always the case?If you are new to homeopathy, do not touch the tablets. Simply tip them over into the lid, then tip the lid into the baby's mouth or their drinking water. It is also important that they not eat or drink anything besides water for 15 minutes before or after taking the remedy as that can affect it.
