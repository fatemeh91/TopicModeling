review/text: I was really excited to try Vinpocetine, as I heard it was good for increasing focus and clarity. It does work, and it's very noticeable, but the side effects are too much.When I tried it, it took quite a while to kick in, maybe 30-45 minutes or so. I took 20mg a day (Two 10mg pills spaced apart by about an hour) Once it started to work, it was quite noticeable. I noticed that I was able to focus significantly better, but only on less complex tasks. In fact, I feel as if more complex tasks become a bit harder with it. It does get rid of the brain fog quite effectively, overall. However, after a while I started noticing some bad, bad, bad side effects. I became very depressed for no particular/tangible reason over the next few days, and after waking up after my first day on it, I was in a rage that lasted a couple hours that made me cause trouble. Normally, I have very good self control and have a stable mood, so I'd think the vinpocetine was to blame for all that, especially given that depression can be a side effect.So yeah, it works great as a nootropic, but the VERY noticeable depression and anger that came with it was just too much. Perhaps someday I'll try it again at a lower dose (5mg) and use it with another noot that doesn't destroy dopamine like this does. Perhaps the combination would would wonders, but who knows?
