review/text: I bought this product because I wanted to check my blood pressure in the privacy & comfort of my home. I wanted something that was simple to use, yet accurate. I think this product fulfilled my expectations. I like the fact that it stores my previous readings and that they're so simple to access. When I went in for my yearly physical, I told my doctor I had purchased a blood pressure monitor. She asked me if it was an 'Omron' brand because they're supposed to be highly accurate. I told her it was. The price was fair -- and cheaper than Wal-Mart's price. All in all, a good deal!
