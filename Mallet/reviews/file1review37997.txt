review/text: Hi there,My name's Steve & I'm an EMT student. I took & passed my CPR training within the last seven days (96% on the written, I missed the gastric inflation question if you have to know). The best chance that CPR (& for that matter an AED) has is within THE FIRST 3-5 MINUTES. PERIOD. I would definitely agree with the other person who posted that training is definitely required along with this purchase, but I find it hard to believe that there's someone out there who's willing to spend almost 2 grand on this product & not be bothered to learn how to use it. I'm serious! if you have the cash, buy yourself one of these bad boys & make sure that every person who walks through your door gets a hands on lesson on how to use an AED. ( and make sure they know how to switch out the paddles for the lil' folks also!)
