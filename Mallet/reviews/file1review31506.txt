review/text: I was on a hike with my friend, and our sons, and one of the boys hurt himself, nothing serious, but it was a reminder of what could happen, and how I was not prepared. So, I did a little research, and looked at first aid kits, and got an idea of what a basic one should include. With the exception of a couple items (space blanket, and clotting pad, which I bought separately) this kit had the basic needs met, in a good watertight bag, at a good size to fit in my packs. I got two, one for my hydration pack, and one for my large day pack. Not my amended kits just live in my packs, and I don't have to think about it again, unless I need them.
