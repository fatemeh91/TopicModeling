review/text: The Epilator is very easy to use, but annoying to clean after use. Not only is it painful to use... but I also got a rash on my legs from using it. My doctor says its very common and he does not recommend me using it again, because obviously my skin was too sensitive. My sister, however, uses one and has not had a problem.
