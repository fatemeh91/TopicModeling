review/text: If you are looking for something that will give you a buzz, this is not it. What it did do for me was provide a steady level of energy. It was also helpful in more personal areas of life. The energy effects took about 10 days. The other effects took a little longer (3-4 weeks), but made me feel 15 years younger (I am 36) in that area.Disclaimer - This is one dudes opinion.
