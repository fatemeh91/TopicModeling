review/text: Our kids love it! We've had it for a year. I find the cover to be a little too thick to get all of the cooling through, but it makes the kids happy and seems to help them. I haven't used it for warming as of yet. I did find the cover difficult to put on when frozen so once I got it on, I left the cover on. It lives in our freezer, ready for boo-boos.
