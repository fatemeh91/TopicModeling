review/text: I didn't expect this item to be so LARGE, and the vibrations are not as strong as I had hoped. Although, the overall quality is terrific. It's very jelly-like, and it's unlikely to break at all because the beads are metal and not just thrown in there. I still haven't been able to use it yet because it's sooooo thick, I'm hoping I'll be able to with some help from my fiancee.
