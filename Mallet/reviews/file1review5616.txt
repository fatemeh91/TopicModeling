review/text: The first time I got this it didn't work. Amazon was really good about replacing it for me so hopefully that's the only problem I have. The design of the product is pretty bad, there's no way to sit down with this on that's for sure. But if you take the actual vibrator out and wrap it in something you can get away with it. The range on the remote is great and even though there's only one setting, it's not bad. Overall: Whoever designed this is great with electronics (sometimes) and knows nothing about the female body...
