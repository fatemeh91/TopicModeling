review/text: I had two Big factors in choosing a seat: it had to fit an elongated bowl and it needed a splash guard my son couldn't drop into the toilet! This meets both plus some. It fits securely on any toilet seat, is easy to take on and off, seems very comfortable for small bottoms, travels well and is a snap to clean or disenfect. The price wasn't too bad versus trying half a dozen other seats and potties to find one that made both my son and me happy. Considering getting a second for the upstairs bath and won't settle for anything else.
