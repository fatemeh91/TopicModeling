review/text: I have terrifically bad right shoulder pain - around the scapula. This area is hard to reach and other than going to a chiropractor or a massage therapist, there was just no relief available at home - that is, until I tried the Body Back Buddy. My daughter, who is a rock-climber, has a similar product that she swears by, so I decided to order one for myself. I use the rounded knob end to massage and press along the scapula area and also to massage around the back of my neck. Within minutes, literally, I have relief and by the end of the day, I have full range of motion in my arm and shoulder area. Works for me!!!
