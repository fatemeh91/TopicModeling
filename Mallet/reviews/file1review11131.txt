review/text: All too often, when I go to bed, I woulddevelope a sensation of something being inmy throat, having to swallow often tryingto relieve the feeling. I searched for agargle product to help alleviate this situ-ation.I came upon a new product called ChlorasepticSalt Water Gargle. I tried it the night itarrived in the mail, and have been using itever since. It tends to fizz when you startto gargle. I usually spit it out and do itonce more. I presume it's the nature of thesolution. For those who tend to experiencethe same problem I had, I recommend this gar-gle solution to you.
