review/text: This grout brush sure beats using a toothbrush!! It has firm bristles, a comfortable handle and it sure cuts down on the back breaking labor of cleaning grout. Wish is had a handle that you could screw an extension into so that you wouldn't have to get on your hands and knees to clean the grout on tile floors. I guess that's just my "old age" and "bad back" talking....but it would sure help! Maybe Oxo is listening...lol.
