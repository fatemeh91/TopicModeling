review/text: My acupuncturist recommended this tea to me, and along with other TCM and in conjunction with acupuncture, increased activity and healthy eating, I think it helps. Mainly, I've noticed better digestion, decreased bloating, and decreased constipation when I drink at least two cups a day.
