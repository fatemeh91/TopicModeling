review/text: The purchase of this product all began when my blood pressure was taken at work. Advice to all, never get your blood pressure taken at work, unless you are a yoga instructor ;) And especially while at work right after walking up 2 flights of stairs.I love this product so far. The battery/ac option is great. It is very easy to use and understand.
