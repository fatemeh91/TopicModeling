review/text: My mom used these to wash her dishes and now I do. These squares of scrubbers are easy to hold and are the perfect tool to wash your dishes with. These scrubbers don't hold a scent and aren't too harsh to you on your dishes. I love using these on pots and pans to get them really clean. They also work well for household cleaning to scrub at stains around the house.
