review/text: Smells fabulous and is this deliciously rich raspberry color... Did the patch test as my skin tends towards sensitivity and followed directions... This is a speedy peel- just 5 minutes... Even though the patch test did not feel warm/tingly when it was all over my face I definitely felt the "peel" effect... Rinsed it off and followed with toner and Mychelle's Pumpkin Renew Cream (best. ever.) and wow- my skin was a little rosy for a little while after (an hour at most) but it glowed and was smooth, soft, and renewed as baby skin. I've tried a few OTC peels and plenty of gritty exfoliating products this really did the job beautifully. I am really impressed with this peel.
