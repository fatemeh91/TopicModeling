review/text: I ordered one of these to help my posture. It definitely pulls your shoulders back which does, in fact, help your posture. The problem is that the straps cut off the blood flow to your arms. Your arms start tingling and that's just the start of its uncomfortableness. After a while, the straps bruised my arms. My posture was corrected wearing it but the price on my physical comfortableness was too high to pay.
