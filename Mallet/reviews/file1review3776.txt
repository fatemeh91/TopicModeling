review/text: I purchased this a couple years ago & only used it a few times because it made my stool very watery (of course was drinking lots of water at the time). The end of last year I was doing some heavy duty studying so I was drinking lots of coffee, caffeine energy drinks, diet sodas, taking Excedrin almost every day, etc. My eating was atrocious...lots of fast foods, processed foods, and sugary sweets and to top it off I was barely drinking any water. This went on for about 3 months.When I decided to start eating healthy & lose some weight, although I rehydrated myself (drinking at least a gallon of water a day), I still wasn't losing the weight I should have, my stomach was constantly bloated, & I was barely going to the bathroom. I tried metamucil bars which worked a little, then I tried psyllium husks which also worked a little. I tried senna capsules & that barely worked, even an enema barely produced results. At first I thought "maybe I'm not backed up" but I wasn't going hardly at all...I would get the urge but then...nothing.I then began taking 3 Mag 07 in the evening & let me tell you...things are REALLY moving now! Not just water either like before! This is a stool softener so don't expect your stool to come out formed, but this worked when NOTHING else did. I'm going to keep taking 3-4 every evening for the next 5-7 days as recommended on the bottle as a cleanse. HIGHLY recommend this...no cramping & very predictable. I've been taking it at 11pm & by 4 or 5am I have to go.UPDATE- MARCH 17, 2012: After taking 3-4 each night for 7 days and then 1 or 2 for seven days, don't want to gross anyone out but my stool went from very dark (the color of strong coffee)for several days & finally it got to where I could see through it. I'm happy to say I'm now all cleaned out & REGULAR. I only take a couple on occasion now. I've also lost about 15 lbs. since with diet & exercise of course, but my weight loss is steady now unlike before.
