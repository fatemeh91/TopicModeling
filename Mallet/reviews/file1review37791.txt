review/text: The ad for these CoQ10 softgels specifically says that they are soy free, which is why I putchased them. Unfortunately, it was only after getting them, opening them that I read the label which says they have soy as an ingredient. For someone who cannot have soy, this was a true eye opener. Never, ever go by what you read about a product listed on Amazon. Make sure to check the label.
