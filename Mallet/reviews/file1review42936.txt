review/text: This stuff smells sooooooooooooo good - everytime I glance over at it sitting there next to the facet, I am suddenly inspired to scrub my sink! I hate cleaning, but the whole line of Mrs. Meyer's products eases the cleaning pain. I sprinkle a little in the sink and inhale the fresh, wonderfully clean fragrance. I actually look forward to using these products. My favorite scent is the lemon verbena, but they all smell amazing. For anyone who loves fragrance...this one's a keeper!
