review/text: Seriously, all I was looking for was a trimmer, NOT A SHAVER, I use a razor for that. This works perfectly to keep your beard at the right length. I personally don't have a thick beard, which is perfect as I am able to maintain that 5'clock shadow look pretty easily. Just like everyone else said, no lubricant needed, one charge seems to last forever! Easy to use, and great price.
