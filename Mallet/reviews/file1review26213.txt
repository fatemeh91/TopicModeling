review/text: This would be so much nicer for me if it was smaller! I'm not a petite little thing either - I'm 5'8" but this was huge. I've thought bigger was better, but I learned it the hard way that's not always the case. Ouchie.It actually smelled good, contrary to previous reviews (maybe they changed up the smell) - lightly scented with something...I'm bummed this was too big for me, but it would be great for ladies (or gentlemen) who can handle bigger widths. It was about 5.3" at the head and 5" at the shaft.
