review/text: The individual bristles are finer and softer, more flexible than a scrub brush making it easy to push the brush into smaller openings in bottles. Also the finer size bristles allow more in each hole so it cleans the inside surface much more thoroughly than the plastic bristle in twisted wire type brush. ...My only drawback is the grip part of the handle goes about a quarter of the way into my 24oz sip top bottles I use for work. (-1 star) I would like the stem part of the handle to be 2 or 3 inches longer.
