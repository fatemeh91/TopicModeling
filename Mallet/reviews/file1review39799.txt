review/text: I bought Crest Glide "Comfort Plus" unflavored floss at a local drugstore, and it is worth the extra money!!PROS:1. SHRED RESISTANT like no other brand I've ever tried, including Johnson & Johnson waxed floss & other dental tape brands.2. STURDY. I've tried other expensive dental tape, and they usually stretch out & become so weak in the middle that they are hard to handle. This is true of the Glide brand 5 years ago, but they've fixed the problem! This stays sturdy while flossing3. EASY MOVEMENT. It moves between teeth with ease. Flossing is faster and creates less of a mess with saliva-- which may sound gross, but is a real annoyance when I clean my mouth.Having good floss encourages me to do my post-brushing routine on a more regular basis, for cleaner teeth.
