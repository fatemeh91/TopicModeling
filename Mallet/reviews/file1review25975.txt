review/text: I assumed that for $15, plus shipping, that this would be a very nice mask. It turned out to be extremely uncomfortable though. The mask itself is black pastic (which is fine), but it has foam around the outside that is cut for a person with a very small head - it never felt quite right since the foam would be really close to my eyes. In order to keep it tight enough to keep it on correctly it would crush my nose so that I couldnt breathe. The strap is made out of velcro, which always rubbed/scratched my ears. I havent been able to fall asleep with this mask on.
