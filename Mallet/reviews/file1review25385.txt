review/text: I have purchased numerous different brands of nose trimmers through the years, but never have I found one that can match the Panasonic ER112BC. I have given these as gifts to others and their comments are that this thing really works well, with very little ripping of the hairs in the nose. I have six or seven different nose trimmers that I bought on the cuff, just to see if they would work as good as this, and none compare. I could not find this model anywhere, after my last one finally died after about eight years and Amazon was the only place I could find it. Highly recommend this product over any other.
