review/text: Got this after reading the great reviews. Also picked up some shave cream, a badger brush and some after shave balm. Been using the cream and brush with my Gillete Fusion with good results. I received this razor (merkur) and I lathered up. Since its been 3 days since I had a shave, I was excited to experience this close smooth nick free shave.Took my time, shaved with one stroke, re-lathered and shaved again. No pressure as I let the weight of the razor do the job. After rinsing and drying my neck was tore up something awful to the point I am embarrassed to go out. My whole neck is cut up and red. I look awful. My face is OK, just one nick on my chin. But the neck is burning, sore and bloody.I had hot lather all over my neck, went slow and this is what I get? My Gillette NEVER did this!Not happy so far with this experience. Hopefully I will heal quick. I give 3 stars for the sturdy build and quality, not for the shave. I wanted os much to enjoy this product as I invested in the other accessories. ALl I can say is OUCH!BTW, my face shave was no closer than with my gillette. I have a little irritation on my cheeks, like a slight burn but no rash or cuts.
