review/text: This product does exactly what it says it will do! My husband takes a stainless steal thermos to work every day and I have tried many methods to get the stains off, to no avail.... I used this product with the boiling water and I could not believe the stuff that was floating to the top while I let it sit for about a half hour ... I also used in my electric percolator and once again it worked like a charm , I love it and have found a new? (not so new , but new to me) product that I will be using on a regular basis.
