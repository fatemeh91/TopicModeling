review/text: Handy little brush that really does help you get into all the crevices. We have sliding shower doors, and this brush let us get into and between the frame and the top of the tub where the frame sits. Obviously we've used this for other purposes, too - anyplace we need to get into itty bitty nooks. It really does help and do the job well.My only complaint - and it's minor - is that the bristles aren't as stiff as I'd have liked. I can see already that over time, the bristles will become splayed out and "warped" due to the pressure applied when scrubbing. But this is a very minor nit, as it'll probably be a year (or more) before the bristles reach this level and the brush needs to be replaced. It's not like you use this kind of brush every day (unless you're a REAL clean freak...we like clean, but we don't scrub down nooks and crevices every day!).For the price, a great, handy, quality little brush that has already made our cleaning routine easier. Don't hesitate to get this if you need to get into tight places.
