review/text: I ordered this product to help me hold playing cards since I have poor hand strength. The product works very well and it does the trick. My only reservations is that this product looks homemade. The black stand part is made out of a thick foam-core type material. It works and it looks like it will hold up with continued use, but it doesn't look very slick. I just use this card holder with family and friends, so it is not too big of a deal that it looks homemade. I'd rather have that than not be able to hold my cards or have my hands cramp up from trying to hold the cards. But I do have to say that I feel slightly embarrassed to pull out a device at a card game that is so large and obtrusive because of the black color - and it looks homemade which makes people think I put it together myself. But it works and I haven't seen another product quite like it that looks more refined or stylish. I would not want to return the product because it does do the job. I will only give it 4 stars, though, because the construction is a little amateur.
