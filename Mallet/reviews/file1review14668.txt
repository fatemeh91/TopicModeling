review/text: From wikipedia on vinpocetine:Vinpocetine increases in neuronal levels of DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, have been shown to occur in striatal isolated nerve endings as a result of exposure to vinpocetine.[15] Such an effect is consistent with the biogenic pharmacology of reserpine, a structural relative of vinpocetine, which depletes catecholamine levels and causes depression as a side effect of the cardiovascular and anti-psychotic effects.[15] However, this effect tends to be reversible upon cessation of Vinpocetine administration, with full remission typically occurring within 3-4 weeks.Basically, it can lower dopamine, serotonin and norepinepherine all of which are essential neurotransmitters involved in mood and cognition.
