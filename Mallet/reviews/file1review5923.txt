review/text: I bought this product and I'm very happy with it. It seals great and the fins with the chiller are a nice plus. The fins makes shaking and mixing a breeze. It cost about as much to ship it as it does to buy it which is a bummer. The only real down side is the container could've been bigger. It also has a cup at the bottom to store powder if you want to mix it later.
