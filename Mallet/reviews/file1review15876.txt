review/text: I am an avid runner and was concerned when I started having muscle pain in my abdomen during my work-outs. I decided to try a support belt and I couldn't be happier with the result! This belt provides wonderful support and keeps my belly very steady while jogging. I have had no muscle pain in the weeks since I've been using it. I'm 32 weeks pregnant now and this belt has allowed me to continue running as normal. I recommend it for any mother-to-be who would like to continue jogging in comfort through the end of pregnancy.
