review/text: This product has to be the best supplement me and my wife have tried. Both of us suffer from stomach conditions. I have IBS and she has Crohn's disease. We take 2 pills after every meal and it has helped us be able to digest things much better. My wife had a hard time before eating vegetables or ruffage because the body doesn't break them down well. With the help of this supplement we have been able to eat anything without much trouble.
