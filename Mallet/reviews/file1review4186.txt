review/text: I was nervous buying this because I thought that maybe I was not getting the real deal with this. I was encouraged knowing that with Amazon this would not of been a problem so I went ahead and ordered (since I knew I could return easily with Amazon). I got my razors and they work great. I have used the same razor for 3 weeks now and still do not need to replace the blade. They do not fall apart like someone else mentioned. They do not go dull very fast either; I shave at least 5 times a week and still am using the first blade after 3 weeks. I recommend this to anyone who is trying to get the best deal for blades. Feel free to ignore the other reviews that say this product is fake or defective... I agree with another reviewer who said that they believed those reviews to be miss leading.
