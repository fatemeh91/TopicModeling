review/text: When I moved into my current house the tub was looking pretty bad. I did scrub it and actually thought about replacing it because it never looked really clean. After 3 weeks of using the method daily shower spray it looked better than ever before. I admit I used about 2 to 3 bottles during the first three weeks but my tub has been looking good ever since. I use about one bottle every 3 weeks now. A lot cheaper than getting a new tub, too! :) (I have to say that house cleaning is not my strong side, too busy ... but I do like a clean house and appreciate shortcuts and products that work.)I've been using this product for a while now and I sure hope they won't stop making it. I DO use it daily, and yes, an unscented version of it would be awesome. However, I'd rather sniff Ylang Ylang for 10 seconds a day instead of scrubbing the bathroom.I tried a different product that was cheaper. I went back to Method for two reasons: the other product did not work and the smell was truly rank. So ... I love the results of Method and in comparison it smells rather decent.
