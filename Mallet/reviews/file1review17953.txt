review/text: If you are in need of fiber this is the best way to get your fiber needs since provides soluble fiber (for those who have no idea what this means it is a type of fiber that is found in fruits and vegetables and is the type that is easily digested, insoluble is found in breads and grains which is more difficult to digest so for those who neglected to take their fiber soluble is the best way to go). The tablets taste fine, it's like candy though don't expect to be the best tasting candy, think of it as the best tasting supplement you've taken so far. Also, it will leave your mouth on the dry side so make sure you drink water afterwards. Other than that this provides you with 4g per serving. Highly recommended for everyone since everyone needs fiber daily.
