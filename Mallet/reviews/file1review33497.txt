review/text: Think you teeth are clean after brushing? This little gadget quickly gets rid of in between bits no tooth brush can reach. The WaterPik also cleans out sinus congestion when you're stuffy. We had the WaterPik WP-70 before but could only find the WP-65 this time. We still don't know what the differences are between the two models. Our previous WaterPik, used daily, lasted about three years before the high pressure hose sprung a leak. This item is well worth the price but plan to replace it every three or so years.
