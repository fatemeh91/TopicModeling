review/text: I was so impressed with the claims on the box and the scientific knowledge they seemed to indicate that I bought this for $36 instead of what I usually buy (Solar Ray Super Digest Away for ~$16--I am also using Betaine HCL routinely now) but so far I can't detect if this product helps at all.I was feeling similarly confused about the Super Digest Away--which was a turning point product for me it seemed for a time, compared to the more powerful but maybe a little scary Betaine, the Digest Away seemed neglible in it's effects. But this product seems very neglible given the claims the labels make. I am disappointed. It was a big purchase for me.Maybe I'm just going thru a bad digestion phase and not feeling the benefit?? I note that two others here had outright BAD experiences, so I'm dubious about this product. And the claims had really given me hope! :(
