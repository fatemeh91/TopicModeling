review/text: My husband and I have taken Wellness Formula for several years now and recommend it to all of our friends. In the past two years, I have only taken two sick days at work and I blame it on not being as diligent with taking this supplement. I work at a public library, where all kinds of illnesses circulate--especially since the library seems to be a favourite place for people to go when they are unwell, wanting to stock up on media. I am very confident that this product has helped ward off a number of nasty viruses and illnesses that go around.I would give it five stars, but, admittedly, it can be off-putting. like most herbal remedies, I find it can be upsetting on an empty stomach and sometimes I feel slightly nausous after taking a few if I haven't had enough to eat and drink with the pills. Also, the tablets are *very* smelly and difficult to swallow. The capsules work fairly well.Great stuff! I swear by it and even force it upon good friends when they are unwell.
