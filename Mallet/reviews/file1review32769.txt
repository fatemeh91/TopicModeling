review/text: I use the Slim-Fast Optima chocolate royale and milk chocolate flavors to make ice-cold smoothies -- 1 c. skim milk, SF powder, a lot of crushed ice -- process in a smoothie maker or blender. The shakes help me get milk into my diet, satisfy my sweet tooth, get some protein, and resist high-calorie, high-fat ice cream treats. The flavor is great, and when prepared this way, the shake is thick and cold. I keep this product on-hand all the time.
