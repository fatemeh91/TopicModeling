review/text: I was disappointed the first time I tried Reve de Miel Lip Balm. I thought the texture was very thick, that it could be gritty, that it looked cakey. All of these things are true to some degree, but it is still the best lip balm available, IF you're actually looking for a real balm, and you're willing to take a little time with it!It's necessary to really work it into your lips in order to avoid that "toothpaste in the corner of your mouth" look, and the gritty bits are there for exfoliation. The texture is thick but in a luxurious way, and it feels amazing. After a day exposed to wind and cold, I put a layer on at night, and my lips still feel wonderfully soft and moisturized the next morning. It imparts a plumping effect, because it hydrates so well. I love the scent, but it's very subtle. It goes on matte, which I like. I hate the super-slick look that balms like carmex gives.I've used practically every lip balm out there, from the inexpensive Labello, Burts Bees, etc., to the expensive Ren, La Mer, etc. NONE of them hold a candle to Nuxe. This is the only beauty product that I'm loyal to; one that when I finish the pot, I immediately buy another. Value is decent--one pot lasts me 8-12 months, and it beats buying a ton of cheaper products that don't truly moisturize, soften, or give the illusion of plumping.
