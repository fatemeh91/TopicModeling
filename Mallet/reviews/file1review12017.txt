review/text: I have been using these pills for over 7 months now and have not had a single day of discomfort. I am 5 months pregnant right now, with no morning sickness and the "once a day" formula makes this so much better.Pros: One a day is the key for me. I hate popping pills and the fact that I need to take this only once works well for me. I never forget. For me, I hardly find any taste... perhaps because I take it with some warm milk in night. Have had no obvious side effects so far and no noticeable changes in my body from taking these pillsCons: The pills are a bit big in size, but I would take a bigger size once any day over taking a few more pills.
