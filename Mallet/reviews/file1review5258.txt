review/text: I use the carpet powder and cone fresheners in the Glade Hawaiian Breeze scent line. They're beyond awesome. Fruity and sweet without gaggy perfume smell. With that said, the aerosol room spray in the same scent line does NOT smell like the rest of the Hawaiian Breeze products. It smells coconuty and gross, not like the others. I'm not sure if I got a bad can or what but I won't be doing the aerosol spray. Definitely pick up the cones or carpet powder in Hawaiian Breeze though.
