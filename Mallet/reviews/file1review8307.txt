review/text: I bought this brush after my walmart baby bottle brush quickly fell apart. I like that it doesn't have the sponge end, which just gets torn up. But I can't agree with all the reviews saying this brush doesn't spray water on you, I still have that problem. So, I'm a little disappointed, but it's a good brush. Works well for my standard-neck baby bottles.
