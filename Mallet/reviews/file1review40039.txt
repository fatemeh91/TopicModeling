review/text: This is a very simple, no frills toothbrush that gets the job done, especially for people who aren't worried about fancy grips and such. The handle is very flat, straight, and has molded-in thumb grips just before the gently angled neck. The head is a diamond shape with regular nylon bristles that are all the same length.
