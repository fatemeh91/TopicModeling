review/text: I've tried a handful of flavors and I've been pleased with just about all of them. So far, I've found that the chocolate mint tastes the best if you're mixing with water, but that cookies and cream does a better job at getting really thick and frothy like an actual shake. Either way, throwing this in a blender bottle (with the wire whisk ball) and shaking for ~15 seconds is all I've needed to get it mixed up enough to drink. This is definitely my go-to protein of choice.
