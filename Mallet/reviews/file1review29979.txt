review/text: I LOVE NOW PRODUCTS BUT THIS ONE SHOCKED ME, WELL, PERHAPS ITS more THE SELLER NOT PUTTING ALL THE INFORMATION HERE SO YOU CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON BUYING IT.I ORDERED THIS AND WHEN IT ARRIVED IT STATED THE AMINO ACIDS WERE DERIVED FROM SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE !!!ON ANOTHER PART OF THE BOTTLE IT STATES THE AVERAGE DOSE OF AMINO ACIDS IS- THEN STATES THE AMINOS LISTED HERE.I HAVE READ THAT SOY PROTIEN ISOLATE WILL NOT AFFECT YOU LIKE MSG BUT TRY TELLing THAT TO MY BODY. ESPECIALLY MY MIGRAINE, IF I CONSUME ANY.I AM SUPER SENSITIVE TO IT, BUT, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT BOTHER MY SISTER, I GAVE THEM TO HER AND SHE LOVES THEM. SHE SAYS THEY HELP HER CHRONIC PAIN AND REALLY HELP HER ENERGY. SO IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE I WILL SAY THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT THE COMPANY SELLING THESE SHOULD MENTION THIS.AS MUCH AS I TRUST NOW PRODUCTS I ALMOST TOOK ONE WITHOUT READING THE INGREDIANTS. AFTER ALL I HAD READ THEM HERE, SO GLAD I DIDN'T.NOW I AM TRYING TO FIND AN AMINO ACID BLEND NOT FROM SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE .IF ANYONE KNOWS OF ONE PLEASE LET ME KNOW, GOD WILL BLESS YOU REAL GOOD AND I WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL.I AM USING A FEW SINGLE AMINOS BUT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK BETER , OR SHOULD I SAY ALLOW YOUR BODY TO FUNCTION AS IT SHOULD, WHEN YOU HAVE A BALANCED BLEND . THANK YOUUPDATE. I FOUND AN AMINO ACID BLEND ON AMAZON BY SOLGAR,NO SOY, VEGETARIAN, GOOD OLE SOLGAR ANOTHER FAVORITE BRAND OF MINE.I MUST SAY THAT I VERY QUICKLY NOTICED IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL OVERALL FEELING.ALSO AFTER A COUPLE DAYS I COULD TELL THE AMINO SINGLES I AM USING SEEM TO BE DOING MORE OF WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.I BELIEVE THAT NUTRICIAN SHOULD BE IN EARLY SCHOOL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CALL IT ANY MORE. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND NOT THE NUTRICIAN WE WERE TAUGHT,I AM STILL LEARNING.I WILL ALSO ADD THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN EATING HEALTHY AS I CAN FOR SEVERAL YRS NOW, LOTS OF GOOD WATER, ORGANIC VEGETABLES AND FRUITS ,CLEANEST CHICKEN BREASTS, SALMON, FRUITS, ECT. I HAVE LOST WEIGHT BUT NOT FELT THAT MUCH BETTER.SOME TO BE SURE BUT NOT ENOUGH. THEN I STARTED READING REMARKS ABOUT "THE DIET CURE" BOOK HERE, GOT IT. GREAT BOOK!I AM SURE IT CAN BE FOUND AT A LIBRARY IF U DON'T WANNA BUY IT, AMAZON WILL LOVE THAT REMARK, LOL.ALSO LISTENIN TO DR BECKER ON DAYSTAR RECENTLY "DISCOVERED" HIM. LOTS OF GOOD INFO.HAVE A HEALTHY YEAR!!
