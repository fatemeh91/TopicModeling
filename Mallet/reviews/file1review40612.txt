review/text: This was on sale at my local high end grocery store so I bought 2 bottles. It's worthless. I might as well run my dishwasher with no detergent whatsoever. I can't count how many times I've had to rewash things by hand after "washing" them.I've followed the directions, use the hottest water setting, pre-rinsed, used a vinegar rinse, etc. Nothing will make this stuff work.Save your money and get a different product. You might as well put money in the detergent cup for as effective as this stuff is.
