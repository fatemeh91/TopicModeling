review/text: This pad has had zero leak throughs. I had previously only bought these pads for my kids and plastic sheets at box stores. None of those worked and after 2-3 washes they would leak through and my kids' beds would smell. Also it doesn't my young son hot or sweaty like the others did. Good product, reasonably priced.
