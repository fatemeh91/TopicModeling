review/text: so, following some research, i'm persuaded that:* i should be taking vitamin D3 & calcium, as i cruise in the vicinity of middle-age.* the ratio present in this product of the vitamin D3 with the calcium & magnesium, in the form it comes in, is the most appropriate to properly absorb the maximum benefits of taking vitamin D3.* this pleasantly thick, yet liquid, texture is the best choicewell, folks, there are plenty of products that do all the above. we are left to find the best flavor.here it is - bluebonnet's blueberry.i like it straight up. it can be stirred in any yogurt. it can be added to milk/soy & poured over cereal - works great with grape-nutsPost Grape-Nuts Cereal, 24-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4). it could probably be frozen with milk/soy/yogurt/jello into a tasty creamsicle.
