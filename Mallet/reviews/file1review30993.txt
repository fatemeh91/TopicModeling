review/text: This is an expensive supplement. I got this on a lightning deal for 15 bucks (and free prime shipping). Normally this supplement runs 30-40 dollar range for this size and strength. An option to save money. Rite Aid pharmacy does a buy one get one sale monthly (give or take). You can get 2 bottles for about $18-22 each that way.I have been using this for years. When I run out, or have a few crazy days and forget to take it, I can tell a big difference.I also have tried other brands, and feel this is one of the best in quality and consistency.
