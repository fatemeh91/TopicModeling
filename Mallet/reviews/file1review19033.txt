review/text: Useless product! My problem was diarrhea. My doctor recommended Reguloid (similar to Metamucil). It worked fine, but I wanted something less distasteful. Benefiber is very tolerable with no benefit! Then to add insult to injury, A supervisor at Novartis Consumer Health, refused to honor their "satisfaction or money back guarantee"
