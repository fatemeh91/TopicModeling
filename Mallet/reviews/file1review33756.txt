review/text: Not only do I have basically no arch to speak of but I also have severe arthritis in my feet and toes as well. This innersole does a great job at providing the right level support and cushioning for me. I can change what that support means day to day, since no two days with arthritis are the same. On a "bad day" I can use the plastic inserts to make the support a little softer and on good days, firmer.I like that this sole only goes up three quarters of the way into the shoe; I wear a size 13 women's which is SO hard to fit that if the innersole ran the full length it would crowd the toe box. This design works perfectly for me.Other than the arch support benefits these are very comfortable innersoles otherwise; the footbed part is synthetic but has a look and feel very much like suede. They do not make my feet sweat and they've been very durable, not flattening out like the plain white kind of innersoles. I can't think of single thing I would change.Very pleased with this product and highly recommended.
