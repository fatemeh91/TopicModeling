review/text: I bought this diaper stacker b/c it looked attractive, the price was right, and it would be able to hold just about anything and everything I needed. When I put it together, the base for the wipes area was loose in the box and I had a very difficult time putting it in. Also, once it was hung, and still empty, it did not look anything like the picture. All the pockets (especially the wipes pocket) were sagging to the front. I loaded the diaper stacker area thinking that the weight might straighten it out, but it did not. I put in the wipes warmer on top and it sagged even more forward. It was very dangerous as I bumped it walking past it and everything else I had put in the pockets fell out... including the wipes warmer. :-(I didn't buy it from Amazon.com, but don't waste your money here or at any other store on this. No matter what I did, I couldn't get it to sit upright and straight like the picture.
