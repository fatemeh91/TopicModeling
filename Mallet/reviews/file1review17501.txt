review/text: This is, by far, the best trimmer I've had the pleasure of owning. I am bald by nature :), but have that moon halo around the back of my head that I have to shave off ever-so-often. I also sport a go-tee that I like to keep trimmed to the minimal level. This thing zips through both like a hot knife through butter! No pulling or burn afterwards. It's Very sharp and cuts evenly. I use setting 1 to keep my mustache nearly shaved and setting 2 for the rest of my beard. I charged it for a few days after initially getting it, because I was working so much, and it's nearly 4 weeks later and it's still going strong with regular use and haven't recharged it since the first time! The guard pulls right off with minimal effort but is solid when it's attached and moves between the cut depth settings very well. It fits comfortably in either hand and is surprisingly easy to clean up after use. Bottom line, all the stuff about no charging stand, battery types and all that, the business end is the cutters, they are sharp, cut clean, quick and even and if it does die in two years...money extremely well spent. If you are that picky on this stuff, go to a professional, otherwise, become one with this trimmer!
