review/text: I have been looking for a good protein shake and have tried several different kinds (eas soy protein, warrior raw protein blend, vega nutrition, and spiru-tein) ALL of which had nasty textures (gritty, sandy) and horrible aftertastes - not only simply mixed with milk, but also with fruit as smoothies. This is the first mix I have tasted that is not only bang on consistency wise, but I almost get sad when I get to the end of the cup because it's all gone. I love it because I get my chocolate/sweet fix, while giving my protein a boost. I also love the fact it's not overly sweet. I would compare it to chocolate milk but with just a touch of sweetness. I'm not great at writing reviews, but I must say I highly recommend this product.
