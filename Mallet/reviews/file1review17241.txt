review/text: Well, i never write reviews but don't buy this thing. i had a norelco but i broke it. i bought this as a replacement and the battery life is HORRIBLE. fully charged, it didnt even last through one trimming session. by the way, u cant use the cord as a power source. all it does is charge the battery so when its dead u have to wait until it charges some to finish shaving. if i can save a few people from buying it this review was worth writhing. buy a norelco
