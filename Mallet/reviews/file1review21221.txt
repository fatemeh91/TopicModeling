review/text: I have used this brush for about a week now and my teeth do feel cleaner. I have sensitive gums, so I was worried the more powerful vibrations of the brush would cause some damage but on the contrary, my gums feel healthier and stronger now. If you are looking for a good tooth brush, you will not be disappointed. I admit I was a bit hesitant to spend $80 on the Oral B S-200 but it was definitely worth it for me.
