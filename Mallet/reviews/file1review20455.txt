review/text: My wife is short, and generally uses a seat booster to see over the dash and front end of her SUV. The old seat booster she was using was falling apart, so we purchased the Tush Cush. After the first day of using it, she proclaimed her love for it, and admittedly, when I used it, I really liked it as well. I'd happily purchase again (and am in fact looking to get one for myself - on my Wish List).
