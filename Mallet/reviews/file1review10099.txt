review/text: Having had recurring UTI's in the past and not remembering to drink cranberry juice or eat cooked cranberries every day, I now take 3 of these per day plus 1,000 MG of Nature's Way Alive brand Vitamin C powder which I also buy from Amazon. My doctor recommended the Vitamin C in addition to the cranberry pills as a stronger preventative for recurring UTI's. His advice is usually good. I also drink some cranberry juice and eat some cooked cranberries.We use a few other Nature's Way products also and find them to be of very good quality with the least number of "bad" ingredients compared to other brands. Amazon has the best price on this item and several others, especially with subscribe and save.
