review/text: Just got the 16 pack. Totally ripped open. Batteries spilling all over the box. They are dated to expire on 03-2018. We'll see. I've tested some. They work. But the package looks so old and beaten up that I'm wondering about the life of these batteries no matter what the expiration date is. Plus, the package contains a little plastic car from the TransFormers movie. A little dated??????? I'll post another review if this turns out to be a flop.
