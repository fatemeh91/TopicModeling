review/text: Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this pen: relatively inexpensive, good name/reputation, great build quality. It looks very professional and feels great in the hand. I love how thin the pen is, and Cross ink lays down a good line for traditional medium ballpoint. I prefer a fine tip, but I'm sure I can find alternate refills to suit my needs when these run out of ink. Additionally, it has "stops" in between each tip so that you can lock your pen in the "off" position when not using it (one of the big complaints about the famous Zebra Sharbo X).But there are a few things that set this back from being perfect, and I think they all stem from the fact that this multi-function pen also includes a pencil. First, my ideal multi-pen would just have 3 pen colors and would not have a pencil. This would eliminate the need for an eraser (and the screw-off cap) and would eliminate the need to have the pen be able to depress/plunge. Instead, the back half of the pen is thicker than the grip part so that the back can go down when you depress it, which makes it feel off-balance and look a little odd. Additionally, you can depress when you're using the pen tip, which makes the tip stick out really far while it's being depressed. (It doesn't stay stuck out there, just while you're depressing the back. I only mention it because it's annoying, not that you would ever do this, even accidentally.)But just imagine this pen with 3 pen tips (black, blue, red), the back is just as slim as the front, and there is no cap to lose! I cannot imagine a more perfect pen than that. Now if only they would make it...
