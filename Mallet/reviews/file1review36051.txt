review/text: Dissolved taste awful, kinda like putrid fishy. I believe the reported medicinal benefits and find the temporary taste inconvenience acceptable. This bulk container is an excellent value. I use a sweetener, flavor, 2 teaspoons of the arginine and 1/4 teaspoon citrulline stirred up well in water, and then bottoms up quickly.
