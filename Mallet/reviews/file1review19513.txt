review/text: After buying a couple of potty seats that were much less expensive and a potty chair that played music for my 27mo. old son, I finally gave up and bought this one. I am very happy with it, and my son takes great pleasure in the fact that he can easily put it on and take it off all by himself. It doesn't slip around, and the built in splash guard is perfect. He can't take it off and lose it somewhere in the house like he did with his potty seat's splash guard, and the edges are smooth so he doesn't scratch himself on it when trying to sit down. Also, the potty seat was too small for him by the time he was 2. (He is a bit big for his age, but not chubby or anything.) Since it doesn't have any cracks for the mess to settle into, it's easy to wipe clean when needed.I also like the fact that it's just plain white with black trim since I am using it in the guest bathroom. I bought a little hook that you stick on with adhesive tape and put it on the side of the toilet tank to hang the seat on. It works perfectly, the seat is out of the way when it's not in use, and my son can easily reach it when he needs to use it!I am glad I spent the extra $$, I should have listened to the reviews I read and saved myself the trouble of buying and returning the others!
