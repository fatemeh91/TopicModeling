review/text: This is the first time ive used a equilator. Got to tell you it hurt the first few times and it irritated my skin a little to. Ive realized the more I use it the less it hurts. Just like plucking your eyebrows where it hurt the first few times but after that it doesnt really. And now my skin doesnt get irritated. I use it to shave about everything and its very effective. I dont have to shave very often and each time the hair grows back there is less of it and its thinner. I highly recommend it and want to remind everyone it is a process each time you use it.
