review/text: Fantastic item! after searching high and low for a lip balm I have found the one that works for me, I'm on my 7th pot of this and still does not dissapoint, I understand that the price is a little off putting for some people but it lasts for a really long time! I think it's because it actually works as is supposed to so you don't have to reapply every 10 minutes like with other balms! I have really dry lips and I also travel a lot, so climate change and airplanes have not done me any favors, and this balm always keeps my lips soft and moisturized! another important thing for me is that is not glossy, I hate glossy lips and most lip balms tend to leave you with a glossy look, the nuxe reve de miel does not, instead you get natural moisturized lips, it also goes great under lipstick and I love that it does not contain any parabens! I have been throwing away all my skin care/makeup containing damaging chemicals and I'm glad for brands like this that provide natural and good ingredients. I will keep purchasing this item until the end of time!
