review/text: I normally use the lemon and honey flavored Cepacol lozenges. I decided to try these because the flavor sounded good and it had coating action. I wasn't impressed. My throat was still soar after using the lozenges. The coating action wasn't good either. The flavor was weak. I recommend sticking with the orignal Cepacol lozenges if you want your throat numbed. I get better coating action with Halls Chillers and they taste better.
