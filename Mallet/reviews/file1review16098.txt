review/text: We bought 2 bottles of the PetAlive UTI-Free for our 4 year old male cat. He was on a generic dry cat food diet and we noticed he was urinating on the floor of our utility room instead of in the litter box as normal. (It was winter time as well... cold weather and crystals in urine?? Not sure.) Anyhow, some of the puddles on the floor even contained some evidence of blood. We would watch him try to urinate outside and he would just strain. We have had cats with this issue in the past and have spent lots of $$$ at the vet. We thought we'd give this a try. We bought a few cases of Friskies wet cat food and sprinkled the PetAlive product onto his food for a few weeks. It took a little time, but he got better and he went back to using the litter box without a problem. We continued with all canned food until symptoms were gone. He currently gets a can of wet food in the morning and the same generic dry in the evening. Glad we gave PetAlive a try.
