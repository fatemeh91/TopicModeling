review/text: I have a keloid from surgery, and 11 mos after surgery started using this product. I had to figure it out myself to use this product as the surgeon did not know what to do about keloids as most of the rest of the medical profession. I was tired of my keloid bothering me, so I researched this online and found out about Mederma and this product. Mederma did nothing for me. But using this product for almost 2 months, my scar is 50% reduced in size, less red and less painful. It will likely take more than the 3 mos suggested on the box to get the maximum benefit, but I will take it.
