review/text: I used to own the Evercare Adhesive Roller I picked up at a Target but I haven't been able to locate this brand anymore in store. I wear black dresses often for work and I can't stand lint on black clothing in any fashion. I bought this brush based on the reviews and I like it. It's removes most of the lint from my dresses and other clothing. It does tug a bit at the clothing as you're brushing which I didn't care for, now I just use shorter brush strokes. It works for the most part and was a good purchase, however I feel I still need an adhesive roller for the stubborn lint.
