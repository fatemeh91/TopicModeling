review/text: I really enjoy the Slim Fast Powdered drinks. I've never used the prepared drinks. But what I like about the powders is I can throw in all kinds of fruit in to the Vanilla drink or instant coffee in to the Chocolate drink. I usually have one drink for lunch and it really does fill me up, and it "tastes just like candy". (I Love Lucy).
