review/text: A small, manual carpet sweeper is a very useful thing. I had one of 'em 20 years ago, and for some reason, I threw it out. Dumb. We have two cats, so of course, hair is everywhere. I was surprised how much unnoticed hair it picked of off the carpet. It's ideal for the bits of debris one tracks in the door, and for those snack crumbs that fall between the couch and the coffee table - you know what I mean!Easy to dump the collections - just put the device over a receptacle, push on the bottom where it clearly says "push". Give it a little shake to remove any residual dust, and you're done.
