review/text: I have been using this product for awhile and I think it does a satisfactory job. It cleans the dishes well and leaves no smell in my plastics, including my daughter's plastic plates and cups. I stopped using Cascade when I realized that you could actually taste the chemicals on the plastic. Cascade does do a better job cleaning. It should. It, like every other widely available commercial brand, is a very strong base (alkaline), very caustic. Their phosphates are detrimental to marine life. And now many contain bleach. More dioxins, please! The Seventh Generation version does not clean my silverware as well. If anything is stuck-on before washing it remains there (especially egg or almond butter). My solution to this is pretty easy and obvious. We just keep a bus tub in the sink with a small amount of water. Dirty utensils go there. Dishes get the same treatment if necessary. Sometimes (not often) there is a powdery white residue on the dishes which is easy to remove. Overall, I am pleased with this product and its shortcomings are not enough to make me switch back. I just feel better about using this in my home.
