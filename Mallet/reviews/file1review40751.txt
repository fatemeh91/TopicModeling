review/text: The clock portion of mine has not worked since the time I bought it. I've tried different batteries, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I have taken the clock off and thrown it away. I am now using the pill holders as a pillbox. It's not very good as a pillbox either it's hard to get the pills in an out because of the slant of the lid.
