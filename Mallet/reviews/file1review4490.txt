review/text: I'm sitting here chuckling as I write this. When they came out with the Mach 3, I thought to myself "How ridiculous! Who needs three blades?". When the Fusion came out, I was openly hostile - "How many ***** blades do we need? Stop the madness!!". Well, I recently bought some Gillette body wash and in the package was a free Fusion. I resisted for about a week and then finally used it. Needless to say, I'm here on Amazon ordering some Fusion blades. I guess that's why the New England Patriots play in Gillette Stadium.........
