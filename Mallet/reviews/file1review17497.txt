review/text: It works well enough but every time I go to clean the thing, the blade portion falls off. You can look and see how very cheaply this itty bitty plastic piece is. It's only a matter of time before it wears out, breaks and makes the razor unusable. I'm just sick of the cheapo plastic designs. Again, the razor works as advertised, but it's just more cheap plastic waiting to break.
