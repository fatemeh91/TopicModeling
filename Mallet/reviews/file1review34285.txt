review/text: Works amazing. Ive used comcination of Tucks, Prep H, 2% Lidocaine, Nupercainal (Dibucaine 1%), Hydrocortisone, Ice, 800 mgs advil, sometimes all at once, you name it and nothings worked very well. 1st time I used this it burned for about 2 mins then got icy cool. Pain gone, itching gone and I can sit and LIVE again within 15 mins.Haven't tried long term, but initially the best treatment ever and I've been battling these roids, internal and external and thrombosed for 6 months and this has been the most effective so far.Buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
