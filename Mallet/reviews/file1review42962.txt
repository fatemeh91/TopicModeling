review/text: (3) pieces, each (3) ft. long were rolled up in a box. When opened all were distorted and crushed because of the packaging. In tim the product will regain about 90% of it's memory and will return to it's original shape, but it's a very slow process. What's worse product falls off my toe. I use these to relieve the pressure while running against one of my small toes. The foam tube falls off and ends up under my other toes in the sock, making my outdoor run very uncomfortable. I use to buy a similar product through my foot doctor's office, and paid a higher price. I went back to my doctor's office...this is an example of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;.
