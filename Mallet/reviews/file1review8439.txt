review/text: I use this to clean thermoses and oddly shaped drink lids/food storage container lids. The brush works well partially because it is soft and pliable. The strands are long, but bend and push into small crevices and hard to reach areas that stiffer bristles can't touch. Simple little tool, but it works.
