review/text: Let's face it! Who doesn't have to do the dishes? I think it's safe to say that each and every one of us has to do the dishes at some point. The main point I'd like to emphasize is the quality of this product. I've had a SIMILAR product for over a year that my mom bought for me, but you know what? It's almost impossible to get the thing to dispense soap. Sure, you can put soap into it, but trying to get the soap to come out of the bottom is near impossible. Then I found this product, and it is so much easier to dispense soap from, and therefore more effective. For every line of products on the market, there are always varying degrees of quality. This is true even with dish scrubbing devices, and this particular scrubber brush is oh so high in quality. Trust me, and treat yourself to one.
