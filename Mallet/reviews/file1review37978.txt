review/text: This is probably the only review of using this product on an actual patient. I'm an Advanced EMT, and work at a couple different places. One of them is a casino, and I provide basic life support first-response there. We purchased this defibrillator for the reviews, and the price. I got a call for a guy that wasn't feeling well, so I headed over. Right when I got there, he lurched up, and slumped over. I checked for a pulse, and found none, so I started CPR and hooked up this machine. It advised a shock... zapped him once, and got a pulse back. By the time the ambulance arrived he was conscious and alert.The machine was very easy to use, very straight forward. The spoken directions were very clear and calm. It helped a lot to have something so calm during such a chaotic time.Now for having one in your house: if you've got the money, go for it. I don't feel it's as essential as a fire extinguisher or seat belts, but it couldn't hurt. It'll provide a safe sound of mind. I doubt you'll ever use it, but it's still a nice thing to have.
