review/text: I thought the scrumptious baby cream smelled heavenly and though I found it greasy upon application, it left my hands feeling soft and pliant, and the greasy feeling left eventually! I am very picky in my hand lotions, I don't like it cloying my skin, making it feel like it cannot breath, this product didn't make me feel like this! Everyone who tried it agrees that the smell and feel of the cream was something they enjoyed and would use again! Watch how you squeeze it out, it comes out rather fast and thick.
