review/text: I am currently deployed overseas and do not really have easy access to multiple products. My wife sent me some Preparation-H but it did nothing for me. I was in so much pain I would have tried anything. Finally I got on amazon and ordered several creams and pills to be shipped out. It was here in less than a week, thank you amazon! Ten minutes after I used this I felt relief for the first time. The smell is strong but you wont even notice as soon as you fill the relief. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.
