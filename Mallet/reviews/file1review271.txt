review/text: I am reviewing the clear jack rabbit vibrator and it is absolutely amazing. Let me tell you, I am a 19 year old girl and I have NEVER had a clitoral orgasm. I tried and tried, but I always ended up getting bored and giving up, so I thought it was impossible for me to ever have a clitoral orgasm. Y'all, I had my first C orgasm ever, and I came in about a minute and a half! Felt soooooo good! I would say that noise level is a 2.5 out of 10, and it has separate vibration and rotation of the head/beads. It's waterproof which is a nice feature. I would recommend investing in some decent rechargeable batteries with this baby. Overall fantastic product, would definitely recommend and buy again
