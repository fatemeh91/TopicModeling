review/text: My sickness cycles were so reliable you could sync you watch to them. I got sinus infections 2x a year and a bronchial virus/bronchitis at least one other time a year. Since I discovered Source Naturals 2 years ago I have not been sick with either of those reoccurring illnesses once! I'm so overdue for being sick I'm afraid I'll contract something horrible! This formula has limited symptoms at onset from sniffles to a slight sore throat, reassuring I wake up the day after at 100%. Highly recommended, one of the best products I have found on Amazon.
