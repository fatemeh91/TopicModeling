review/text: For a little background: about a year ago I switched from a high powered antiperspirant over fears and concerns about the neurotoxicity of those products. I went to a "Thai Deodorant Stone" which worked wonders in reducing my body order dramatically (no foreign smell just very little if any natural odor occurring). I then decided i needed something for the upcoming summer and gave this a try to just give me the extra security knowing that this smell was on me masking any other undesired smell. I still use the deodorant stone to cut down on odor causing bacteria, but using this spray in conjunction is very refreshing. It has a light piney smell (reminds me a bit of my mom's hairspray smell as a child). One spray under each arm is all that is needed to last you all day, and even into the next sometimes. Definitely works, I'll be buying this product again.
