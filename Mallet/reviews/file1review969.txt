review/text: Well constructed and designed. Needed something to help me do maintenance on our swimming pool since I have difficulty stooping or bending. This device is perfect to extract the skimmer basket from a standing position. Additionally, it firmly holds the water test apparatus so that I can get a water sample from the pool with stooping down or bending as well.
