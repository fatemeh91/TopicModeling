review/text: Wow, figured this would last me 6 months-1 year because it's so cheap...left it charging over night and used for the second time today only to see that by the end of my use three of the teeth on the inner part of the guard are totally bent. When I tried to straighten them back one of them broke off, I'm so angry! I guess my recommendation is to not set the trimmer down with the guard resting on anything (it was in my dopp kit w/things pressed against it...never been a problem w/my last beard trimmer) because it's VERY flimsy plastic, not hard like my hair trimmer guards or my old beard trimmer that lasted me two years. Though they don't even include a stand, so good luck keeping it propped up on something.Trimmer itself seems pretty good but I could not recommend this product seeing as if any more of the teeth break off the entire thing is useless. Also would've liked a longer setting or two. I used the 8 setting and my beard is currently shorter than it usually is so not much room for growing it longer.
