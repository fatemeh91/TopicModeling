review/text: I grew tired of using Wal-Mart stocked whey protein powders because of the high level of cholesterol and fat in each scoop. So, I decided to give Optimum Nutrition a try a couple of months back based on its reviews and its low cholesterol. I have noticed an improved muscle gain with Optimum over the other brands I had tried, though this could be because I used it more frequently throughout the day since I am not concerned about the cholesterol content. Whether or not I plan on working out that day, I will use a scoop in my bran flakes to get me going with most of my nutrients for the day. With half of my recommended daily protein intake for the day in each scoop, it is actually a very cost effective way to maintain a proper protein intake. So, whether you are a body builder or just conscious of proper nutrition, I highly recommend this product because it is one of the healthiest, pure sources of protein available, and it is very reasonably priced.Thus far, I have purchased the French Vanilla Creme and the Coffee flavors, and I have been very pleased with how much I actually enjoy the flavor of the powder. Let me begin by saying the powder dissolves very easily when mixed with a liquid, so it can be versatile in its use. The French Vanilla Creme is very appealing as a generic flavor that works well with most foods or liquids you would normally add it to. However, the Coffee flavor is more distinct, and does not work with everything the French Vanilla Creme will. I am a coffee lover, so it isn't a problem for me, and I really enjoy the Coffee flavored powder. When ordering it, I had my doubts about its "coffee" flavor, suspecting it may be just a powdery and light flavor. But, because it actually has very finely ground coffee in it, the coffee flavor is really strong! I suggest mixing it with a low-fat milk for something resembling a cappuccino. If you like coffee, get the coffee flavor.
