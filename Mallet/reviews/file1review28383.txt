review/text: This has been the best protein I've tried by far. The flavors are (mostly) fantastic, the profile is spot on, and it's one of the few that doesn't taste bad when mixed with plain water. My only complaint would be consistency, about 10% of the time I get tubs that are "clumpier" and have some trouble mixing in a blender bottle although a quick hit with a wand blender takes care of those rare orders. It's also one of the few proteins I've found I can drink during training without getting a heavy or bloated feeling. Mix in a little peanut butter or maybe some berries and banana and you also get a good meal replacement shake.
