review/text: There's no reason NOT to carry this kit in your pack if you do any sort of outdoors activity. It contains a lot of things that could really save your butt one day, and it's cheap as dirt.There's a bit of extra space in the bag. I added a few items to the kit... it's stuffed to the gills now. I added a CRKT P.E.C.K. knife, four waterproof strike-anywhere matches, and a paracord neck lanyard attached to the whistle. The lanyard is mainly to prevent me from panicking and forgetting about the whistle, which should be the first thing you go for in any emergency.
