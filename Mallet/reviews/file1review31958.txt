review/text: I mix it with orange juice, I don"t know why people have such a hard time drinking it, it tastes fine to me, although I have been using products like this for years. You will get used to it, it just tastes like powdered veggies, big deal. If you can take shots of vodka or other alcoholic drinks, you can drink a shot of this. I can feel the great effects on my body right after drinking this, as it contains nutrients that heal your body and contributes to the elimination of fat from your body as well. Drink for your health!
