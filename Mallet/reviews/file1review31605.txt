review/text: Just received this brand of castor oil. I had bruise for over a week from a blood work up. I applied the castor oil, the first day I received it, without a bandage. I applied more castor oil overnight with small bandage and the bruise was larger than the bandage. Next morning the old bandage fell off, I applied more castor oil using the same size bandage now the bruise does not show outside of the bandage. This is only the second day I am using the castor oil. I also applied the oil to my hands. One of my fingers would seize up on one hand, after using the castor oil my finger did not lock up. All my fingers are supple.I plan on reading more uses for castor oil and try it out. I received the product within a week. I am happy with the supplier.
