review/text: I tried this many years ago for a cold I had. Did NOTHING. Later I found out it did nothing because it has no active ingredients and based on nonsense known as "homeopathy " The idea more you dilute something the STRONGER it becomes. So of course of if you dilute it down to one part in 10 to the 400th power it must be strong stuff, NOT! It's a sugar pill with no active ingredients and no effect on colds or flu.
