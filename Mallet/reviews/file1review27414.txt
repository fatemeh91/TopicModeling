review/text: My son is a hockey player and I purchased this for him to use as supplement after practices and games. Previously, we purchased the EAS powder, but after reading the Consumer Reports article decided that it would be better to find a brand that had less issues with dangerous impurities. The Optimum brand items reviewed in Consumer Reports passed. He mixes it in milk and it tastes fine, not great. It would be nice if it disolved easier, but it is no worse than the EAS powder. My daughter (a soccer player) makes fruit smoothies and adds the powder. Really can't say if it helps or not, but we are happy with it. As a parent, I like it for my kids as a snack replacement after exercising, but not as a meal replacement.
