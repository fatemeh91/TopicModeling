review/text: Very happy with this product. My husband has a recurring skin fungus problem. Every five years or so he's had to go to the doctor's for another prescription. This time, we tried over-the-counter Gentian Violet. It did the job wonderfully. In three days the skin fungus was almost completely gone. The downside: It does stain the skin purple, but only for the duration of use. He was able to keep the area covered so no one noticed. The upside: very inexpensive and quick-acting.
