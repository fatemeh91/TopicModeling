review/text: This unit is very easy to use and set up for the basics- monitoring your blood pressure.It comes with a nice zip case and easy instructions. I had no problems getting it to work properly,and it appears to be very accurate. I take my pressure twice a day, and am very happy with this unit.Dont be surprised if you get an occasional reading that seems way to high or low- it could be a variety of factors, including when you do the test, how anxious you are, etc.Read the directions, put on the cuff and press the button. I take my readings and put the results into an Excel spreadsheet, and made a graph to give my Doctor. He really liked having the info right there.Great unit for an affordable price.
