review/text: It looks like they bought a elastic bandage wrap and cut off a 6-inch piece and just sewed the ends together.took approximately 2 days before it started to crumple up around my wrist like a stretched out sock.took approximately a week before the seam started to unravelyes, there is a big seam running lengthwise down the wrist support where they have sewed it together. There is NO support from this item because it's so poorly made and not stiff enough.you would be far better off wrapping an Ace bandage around your wrist several times before using this.not worth buying AT ANY PRICE ... it just falls apart.
