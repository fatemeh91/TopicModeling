review/text: I bought this product hoping it would work better than most ephedra free products and it does. I've tried many ephedra free pills and they don't work anything like the old Xenedrine, but these pills really do work at least for weight loss. They don't give you that jittery feeling [which I like] or a lot of extra energy but you will see a noticeable amount of weight loss. I'm ordering my second bottle and I'm very happy with the results. Many family and friends have said I look alot thinner thanks in part to these pills. BUY THEM YOU WON'T REGRET IT
