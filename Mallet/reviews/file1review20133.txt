review/text: 3 years ago I was diagnosed with stage one cervical Cancer. I was immediately referred to an oncologist. Before my visit I did extensive research and came across DIM . When I went for my appt I explained to the doctor that I was against surgery because I hadn't had any children yet. I also told her about DIM and wanting to try it. Because I am a nurse and work in the same hospital she trusted that I would follow up monthly and gave me three months to try it out. If she didn't see any improvement at my next visit I would have to undergo the surgery. Needless to say at my next visit my results came back moderate. She allowed me to continue and the next visit Results were mild. The doctor was astonished ! I began to slack off and stopped taking the DIM everyday. When I went back my results were not good. I told her I stopped the DIM and her reply was surgery. I asked for a few more months and promised I would take it everyday no matter what. I went back 3 months later and my results were all clear. I continued with it over the next year and was officially discharged from oncology ! This product is a miracle worker!
