review/text: I ordered Melatonin of two types - 3 mg and 5 mg for my sleepign disorders. I am much happier with the 5 mg Melatonin as it does not happen to have side effects on me that the 3 mg Melatonin does - which is superficial sleep with too much dreaming and sometimes heavy dreams. I am much less happy with the 3 mg Melatonin. When I wake up I do not feel as rested as with the 5 mg one.I do not think I will be buying the 3 mg one again.
