review/text: I love these products! Came across them at Bed Bath and Beyond but now buy them off Amazon since they have better prices. The thai coconut lime is my favorite scent as well as the mediterranean fig (wouldn't think fig would be good but it is!). The system works well, and each canister lasts for about a month and a half when set to spray every half hour.
