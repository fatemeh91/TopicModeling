review/text: I am type 2 diabetic and have a problem with my blood sugar crashing. Sipping a container of this brings it back up and will keep it up longer than a highdose of a sugar drink,plus it has nutritional value.Great for an easy between meals snack.You can buy a pack at Wal-Mart to try it. A case delivered right to your door containing six packs is a bargain and convenient.Size stores easy in your fridge.Great buy from Amazon,right to your door no shipping charges,PDQ.
