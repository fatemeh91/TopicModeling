review/text: This is one hundred twenty-three dollars worth of placebo. Anyone considering using this or any other homeopathic remedy really needs to become aware of the fanciful principles behind homeopathy - it's not some sort of natural, herb-based treatment; it's pure wish-thinking. Homeopaths believe that a substance which produces disease symptoms in a healthy person can be used to cure a person already suffering from the same symptoms. If that's not childish enough, homeopaths also believe that in order for this magic to work, the "active ingredient" must be diluted repeatedly until not a single molecule of the substance remains in the dilution medium (water.)Read that again - there are NO ingredients in homeopathic remedies apart from water, sometimes sugar, and whatever binding agent is used to turn this "concentrated nothing" into pill form. This is why homeopathic doctors (read:QUACKS) can state truthfully that there are no side effects to homeopathic medicines - there are no effects whatsoever, beyond a possible placebo effect. For years skeptics like James Randi have downed whole bottles of homeopathic sleeping pills while delivering lectures on the idiocy of homeopathy, with nary an ill effect, and without getting at all drowsy. Unfortunately, due to the general ignorance about this baloney, drug companies have even put homeopathic labels on actual medicines (Zicam, for one) just as a marketing gimmick, even though (by homeopathic standards) the medicines contain a huge overdose. Quackwatch.com has a good section devoted to this nonsense - I recommend anyone considering throwing their money away on these products (AND, by rejecting real medicine, jeopardizing their health) check the site.
