review/text: I get really bad migraines and have constant allergy symptoms and this thing works so well. In addition to having the pressure and the darkness that help me feel better when I have a migraine, the icepack stays cool and is soothing. I have actually fallen asleep with it on before and woken up with my migraine gone!If you suffer from allergies or sinus pressure like I do, this mask is a miracle cure and better than any ibuprofen.
