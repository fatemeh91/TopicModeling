review/text: This might be meant for men, but I'm not a man and I use it. :)I don't want to use anything with aluminum. Even the all-natural "mineral" stuff is 100% alum, which defeats the purpose. So, I went to the store and looked at all the deodorants. All had artificial colors and scents except this one. It does have a scent, but it's natural and very mild (I don't smell whiffs of it during the day). It's not 'manly' or 'womanly.' It works, but you still might perspire because of the lack of aluminum crud.As for the all-natural non-alum deodorants and anti-perspirants which are available (Tom's, Kiss My Face, Jason, etc.), they simply don't work for me. They seem nice but I perspire even more, and body odor becomes a problem (which is isn't with the Speed Stick).I don't give it 5 stars because it contains propylene glycol. I'd still rather have that than aluminum.
