review/text: I thought the Old Spice Classic Deodorant worked great! It had a great fresh smell, but also had a manly smell to it. At the same time, it wasn't overpowering. I also liked that it didn't leave a white powdery film on my clothes like others do. For a deodorant, it kept me surprisingly dry.
