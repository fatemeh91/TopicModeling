review/text: i am very happy with this product. i have a low pile carpets in the rooms my son plays in and i can never find a time to clean them since my son absolutely HATES the vacuum cleaner. this little number did exactly what i wanted and more. it picked up all the little pieces of crackers, snacks, cat hair, MY HAIR, and more! i didnt even know the carpets had all that dirt on them!! im very impressed!FOR THOSE WITH HANDLE PROBLEMS: i did not have any problems with the handle coming apart. if you read the instructions it will tell you when you put the handle together, to STRIKE DOWN HARD on something. so i took it into the garage, put some old phone books down and did just that. i cannot pull the handle apart now and i even shook the thing with the base attached.for an item with no suction, and for the price, it is the best!! hoping this item stays for a very long time!!
