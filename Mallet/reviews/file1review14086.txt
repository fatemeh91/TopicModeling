review/text: I use it for lightweight items because everything else kept falling out and/ or caused the velcro straps to come undone. This thing needs LOTS of improvement and I don't understand why they haven't been made after all of the complaints. I found it at Target for $4 and it helps to keep baby's nursery organized but it is temporary. There is NO WAY I would pay full price for this thing.
