review/text: For those of you who have to clean their toilets every month or so, I am jealous. I would have to clean my toilet every week, if not more. Our water has A LOT of copper, so my potty would be greenish blue. If not that, then it's red from our local clay. If not that, it turns a pretty shade of black. Can you say ICK!!!?So...My dear husband picked this up from the store and we installed it. I (literally) have not scrubbed a toilet in almost 6 months. Granted, we've replaced the thing every 2 months, but hey! Our water is REALLY bad, and this thing keeps the toilet REALLY clean!This new mama's a happy camper!!:)Oh, yeah, and guys, just because you bought this, it does not mean you get to do less chores! It just means that there is one less chore for US to do! hehehe Just Kidding. :)
