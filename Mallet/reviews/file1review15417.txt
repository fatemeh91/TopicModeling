review/text: The product I received was not what I ordered. It was a different type of Pantene. I returned the package the same day, (at my expense) because it was not what I ordered. I was a 25.4 oz bottle, but not the Pro V, Daily Moisture Renewal Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry or Damaged hair. I was very disappointed that it was not the right kind because I had searched quite a while for it.
