review/text: I buy Optimum Gold Standard for my whey protein all the time. There aren't very many whey proteins that are better. A good place to check for ratings is bodybuilding.com they constantly have tests, ratings and reviews from serious body builders and people who train hard. Price is the selling point on this though. Just four years ago you could ge the ten pound bag for under $75 on Bodybuilding.com. It is at or above $100 on all sites now. The positive of getting it on Amazon though is the free shipping which will cost you at least $15 on BB.com. So I buy it through Amazon now as well.
