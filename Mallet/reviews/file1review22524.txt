review/text: I was not sure what to expect when I ordered these, because they were a LOT cheaper than other disposable changing pads, but I am not disappointed. They do the job. I was sick of washing my cloth (although waterproof) changing pad several times a week, and my newborn daughter even went through a "phase" of peeing on the changing table (once her diaper was off) during several changes a day. I would not have been able to have washed the cloth changing pad that many times! These are very thin, but absorbent. They always have done the trick for us, soaking up the pee so that none dripped to the cloth changing pad underneath. WONDERFUL!
