review/text: This item was advertised on the Bissell web site for more than I paid for it here on Amazon.com. So I bought it here.I have 2 infant boys ages 2 and 1 year old who can both 'use' this sweeper with no problems and no noise. They can learn to clean this way. I love that.The only problem is the handle comes apart at the drop of a hat. Not cool. I called the Bissell company and spoke to a rep and told her that I loved my sweeper, but why in the heck didn't they just make the entire handle screw together?? It only screws together where the sweeper attaches to the first handle section. So, I glued it together, using wood glue. Yea, I know, but it works. The rep from Bissell giggled after I told her my suggestion. I asked her why she was laughing, but she didn't answer-just giggled more, so I just hung up the phone. I hope they take it seriously though and incorporate the screw together handle for the whole handle with the next model.It serves its purpose and sweeps up the crumbs from my floors and pushes most crumbs from the edges of the walls so that I can get them with the sweeper. Would I buy it again? Yes. Was it worth it? Yes. If light pick up of crumbs is all you need this is for you. (Just glue the handle!) If you need a larger dust pan, buy a larger model than this one. Hope this helps you make your choice.
