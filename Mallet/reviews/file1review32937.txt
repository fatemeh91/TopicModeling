review/text: My husband was using a very strong medical laxative medicine to help nature to do its thing and was having stomach ache because of it. Our DR. told us that some of the Doctors and nurses were speaking highly of the Smooth Move Laxative Tea so I ordered it for him to try. Well, it is great, no more stomach aches and he is having smooth moves!!! And he says is a good tasting tea. Two for the price of one, what a deal!
