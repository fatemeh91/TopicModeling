review/text: I was very excited to read the other reviews and so I purchased the eyelash curler when it was offered through the "gold box" specials. Fortunately, I didn't spend a lot on this item because it didn't work at all. The red strips that are suppose to turn white when it's ready and warm never happened. It would have cost more to return the item than it was worth so I plan to put it in the trash.
