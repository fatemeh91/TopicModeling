review/text: I bought this product for its heating feature. To my great dismay, the heat function cannot work alone. You must use the whirl function with it. In other words, once you turn on the power, this thing is ON, ALL THE TIME! It's so annoying. I just wanted a quite bucket that keeps the water warm, which is not what this product is. Worse, once you open this item, you cannot return it for any reason whatsoever, even if you don't use it. I opened it to read the instructions, and that was it for me. When I realized that it was not how I envisioned the product to be, it was too late. So good luck!
