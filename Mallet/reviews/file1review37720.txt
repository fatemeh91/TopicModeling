review/text: I excitedly received my product and read all the directions for proper use. I planned on removing hair from my legs and bikini area. I'd never waxed before -- I shaved. So in anticipation of using it, my first question was whether there was enough to do my legs in one box. The answer was yes. I read the proper techniques and after creating a VERY sticky mess on my legs, I removed only three hairs. Convinced I'd done something wrong, I tried the other leg. Same results. The sticky goo is hard to clean off skin as well as anything else it comes into contact with. The wax remover provided in the kit worked well and removed the wax from my legs but I decided it was easier to shave
