review/text: When our son outgrew the infant bath we had for him, I got one of these. He started to enjoy bath time a lot more sometime after that.As far as inflation goes, as someone who's helped inflate a queen-size air mattress by mouth, I can say that this wasn't too bad. It took a few minutes, but once it was done, that was it until it had to be packed for a trip or for moving.We made one trip while he was using it, and took it with us. It made bath time at the hotel a *lot* easier than it would have been otherwise. It also eased the transition into a new bathroom in a new house when we moved.Our son wasn't inclined to let us use the feature that makes hair-washing easier, so I can't comment on the effectiveness of that, but other than that, we got full use out of this tub until he grew just so big that there wasn't enough room for him in it. The suction cup for hanging it on the wall between baths is great (and also very helpful when we have guests sharing the bathroom with him). Draining the tub can be a little tricky, but eventually there's enough water out to be able to dump it over easily and then hang it up until the next bathtime.This is an excellent tub for when the infant tub is outgrown but the bathtub is still much too large.
