review/text: My hubbie wanted this since he read about it's health benefits (we all need amino acids!). We have found that it is really yummy - a great salt substitute (kindof tastes like soy sauce, and is pretty salty tasing - though not actually high in salt). We even use it as salad dressing and veggie dressing, in addition to in stir fry and other (roasts, casseroles).
