review/text: We are beginning to try cloth diaper systems and started with these as a first pass, as they were among the cheapest and best selling. I would not recommend them, as they lack the absorbance, softness, and durability I am looking for. In short, it's very cheap cloth and may be useful when double or tripled up for alternative uses. We will continue to use these only as a backup. I much prefer a natural cotton trifold diaper that we bought at a local store. It's twice the price but 10-times the quality.
