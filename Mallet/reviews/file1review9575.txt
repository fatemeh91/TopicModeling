review/text: I've tried the MetRX Protein Plus bars a number of times and they are the only ones I'd buy. They taste indulgent like a huge candy bar, but are sweetened with malitol and not sucralose, which I believe is of questionable safety. They are made with whey protein, as opposed to soy protein isolate, the latter which causes problems for some people.They are not calorie cheap, but the calories from the sugar alcohols aren't absorbed, so the net carbs are actually quite low.
