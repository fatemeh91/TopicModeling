review/text: We've had this toothbrush for more than a year. I won't get into all the interesting functionality; several reviews here do that very well. This works great at cleaning your teeth and making your gums feel good.I have a problem with the battery life. I don't know exactly what I ought to have expected, but I certainly expected better. After less than 1 year, the battery began to wilt after just a few brushings. With two of us using it only for our evening cycle, we are finding it necessary to recharge it every couple of days. With the price we paid for it, I would think it would last longer. I could have purchased a lot of manual brushes for the same cost.I remember it having a one year warranty, though I never sent in the card and have since lost the manual. This is my fault.Bottom line: good toothbrush, but send in your warranty card and keep the help-desk number.
