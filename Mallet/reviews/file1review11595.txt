review/text: ... but that's the definition of any battery. And unfortunately, these batteries leak faster than any rechargeable cells I've ever encountered.The nominal charge on all NiMH cells is 1.2V. Usually right after a charge, they'll be 1.36 or so, and even after a few months should be around 1.3. However, all these batteries leak far faster than that. After two weeks of just sitting in a box, of the eight I charged, two were down to 0.94 volts, others hovering near a volt, and the best of them barely reading 1.2.I'm afraid Duracell has permanently damaged their reputation with me because of this. Oddly, I bought an identical-looking set from them two years earlier, and they are still going great. There must be some defect with these -- but judging by the most recent reviews here, it is hardly an isolated incident.
