review/text: I love this stuff! I originally bought the Strawberry, which is good but gets quite old fast. I personally added Truvia to mine because I liked it a bit sweeter. But this time I ordered the milk chocolate to try something new and IT'S DELICIOUS! I don't even have to add any sweetener!Also, you aren't going to find a better deal for 5 lbs of whey, especially with the subscribe and save option. Even on bodybuilding.com.
