review/text: This is my only experience with a sleep mask and I bought it to help me to sleep after day break. No mask can fit everyone's face perfectly. In my case, I have to wear it a little high on the bridge of my nose to keep it from impacting my breathing. This position lets light in between my eyes - not much, but enough to matter. The mask is comfortable if worn loosely, but this won't work if you toss-and-turn a lot. The material is soft and comfortable, but I didn't use it enough to judge durability. I was impressed that the raised area works so that your lashes don't brush if you blink. I guess it works OK, but I've gone back to putting a small towel over my eyes when the sun wakes me.
