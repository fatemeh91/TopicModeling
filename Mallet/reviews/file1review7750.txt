review/text: Awesome brush for just about everything, it fits into glasses, has a one inch scrapper on the end that is soft enough to use on nonstick pans, and cleans up easily. I had one that lasted fpr abput three years. I still used it even though I hid it from company. I searched for about a year before I found it online, Yeah! They only thing that you should know is that the bristles are not stiff, so if you want a stiff scrub brush this is not for you.
