review/text: It was just that. I had never used this massage oil before so I didn't want to buy a huge bottle so these were perfect. Also, my husband and I both have sensitive skin and we had no trouble whatsoever with this product. A surprising plus was that we could use them in the bath tub no prob. I would definitely recommend.
