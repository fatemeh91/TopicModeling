review/text: I just received these tweezers in the mail and I'm very disappointed. I bought them to replace an old pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers that had a true needle point. This new pair of Tweezerman splinter tweezers do not have a needle point; the tweezer's point is squared off so they are not sharp enough to pierce the skin and grab ingrown hairs.Also, the contact area when you have the tips pressed together is so small it's difficult to grab any hair with these making them quite worthless.They are being returned.
