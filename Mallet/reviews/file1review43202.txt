review/text: I don't really like the smell of this product but I would deal with it as long as the product does a good job. It doesn't. Instead of cleaning the shower room (tiles and the glass door), it made the surface sticky and left dirty spots. This was a waste of money. I'll sticky with my seventh generation products.
