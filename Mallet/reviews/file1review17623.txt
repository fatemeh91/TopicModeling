review/text: I've had a Wahl beard trimmer for the last 3 plus years, that looks and functions like a normal hair clippers. But the little guard thing kept coming off mid-shave...with sometime disastrous results. With the Wahl, a beard trim normally took ~15 minutes, and generally, would leave an inconsistent length. So I saw this on sale, and pulled the trigger. Last night, went in to trim my beard just a bit, and after seeing how easy and thorough it worked, trimmed my whole beard....in less than 5 minutes! Not only is it easier to use and quicker than my old trimmer, it leaves my beard with a consistent length all the way around. I only wish I had bought this sooner!Updated review. I can't even remember how long its been since I purchased this, but its still going strong. Only one downside I've found - you can't shave while its plugged it/charging. This is mildly problematic if you failed to have a full charge to cover your trim.....you're kind of stuck with a half trim until its charged enough to finish up. I'd probably give it 4 stars because of that...but I'd still buy it again.Edit - Update - February 2012 (originally purchased Sept 2010). The trimmer has basically died. It was dropped, and now works somewhat sporadically. The battery life has started to fade and only lasted two trims really before needing to be recharged. I'm going to try another brand - leaning towards braun, hoping for longer life of a product.
