review/text: After a month of using the monitor at least 4-6 times a day, I have no complaints about the product. By following the simple directions on its use, it gives you accurate results. The automatic operation of the unit makes everything easy. Told my doctor I had purchase the HEM-711AC and he stated that was one of the BEST if not the BEST.
