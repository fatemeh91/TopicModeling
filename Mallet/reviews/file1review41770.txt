review/text: Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power ToothbrushI ordered this item on July 22, and by August 8 it had stopped holding a charge. It was the weekend, but I tried to contact Oral B anyway. Their customer service was closed. Their web site told me to take it to the nearest service center, but it found none near my zip code. It had no instructions for how to handle warranty issues if there was no service center. On Monday, I called them, delaying the start of my vacation until their service center opened, which was a 9. We got on the road over an hour late. Speaking with them, I had two choices: (1) return it to the store where I bought it (I bought it on Amazon) or (2) send it to a service center. They couldn't tell me which center to use, since there are none in my state and their system apparently does not go beyond state lines. I had to tell them the names of my neighboring states. Their service centers few and far between, and not in big cities. For instance, in Massachusetts the only service centers are in Yarmouth and Salem. So I, like most people, have to mail the toothbrush in. Oral B makes you pick up the cost of mailing, and each service center is an independent small business. So one can hardly expect uniform service, and it's not at all clear who's responsible if there's some problem with the service center.
