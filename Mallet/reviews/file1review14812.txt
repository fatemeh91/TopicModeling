review/text: This product should be great and is when it works, which is about 15% of the time, it is really great. I bought this six months ago, in the Mac version. The principle is medically sound, you can ignore the new age theories and mysticism in which the manufacturers indulge. Unfortunately the software crashes the Mac far more often than it works. I have two set ups, on two different Macs, with two different sensors. (I've also bought two pockets versions of the product, which are useless to me because you cannot set the breathing rate, which you can on the Mac desktop version). I do not mind software crashing normally, within the protected sandbox, as Apple calls it; normally when piece of software crashes it does not take down the whole Mac with it. Emwave does, the whole Mac freezes, you cannot use the mouse anymore, and even waiting five minutes it remains frozen, and so you have to do a hard reboot. This is risky and if you do that many times it may cause your whole Mac to malfunction permanently until you go through the hassle of reinstalling the operating system. It has required hard reboots many times. And as I say, I have two copies of the software, two different machines, and two different sensors, so this seems to be a systematic problem with the Emwave software, not a problem with my setup. I note that other reviewers also report the problem of crashing. I need this product to improve my stress response and health generally, which I have seen it do when it works. For me this product is a very nice to have, and not having it isn't a life threatening problem, although the long term effects of stress are life threatening. I cannot recommend this product, regrettably, until this problem is fixed. I am using v 2.2.5 of the software, which at the time of writing is the latest version. Unfortunately there seem to be no competing products. It is almost tempting to go create one.EPICTETUS
