review/text: I bought these gloves in XXL for my dad (who has very large hands) because his hands were always aching from the arthritis that has developed from driving a transfer truck for many years. The gloves fit him great (and his hands are big and hard to fit). He loves these gloves, and said they started helping immediately! He always wears them when he drives now. Highly recommend these for people who have those aching hands at the end of the day from working with your hands!
