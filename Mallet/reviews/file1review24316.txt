review/text: I was skeptical too. I had heel pain on my left foot and some strange pain in two of the toes on my right foot. Within minutes of putting these in my shoes BOTH pains diminished!!! They feel a little strange when you first insert your foot into your shoe, but you will get used to it.Mine was the G size I think (10.5)I write back in a few weeks and let you know how I am doing . . . but so far . . . . I am ready to buy more so I don't have to switch them into other shoes that I own!!
