review/text: A friend recommended this magnetic bracelet because of relief they received for carpal tunnel. I wore it for about 2 months and have no relief. I also tried it to help with a bout of vertigo, but it didn't help with balance either.Be cautious of wearing them near watches, it drains the battery. I did not have success with this item.
