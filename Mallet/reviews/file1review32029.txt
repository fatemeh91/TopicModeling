review/text: Great stuff for you. Here's what I do to increase the health benefits and taste. I blend it into a smoothie with bluberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and a banana. I add a scoop or two of the powder. It tastes much better and the antioxidents in the berries are a huge plus.
