review/text: The Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock is the replacement needed when your shaver starts to dull. They say you should replace the foil & cutterblock every 18 months, but I find the need to replace it about once a year. I think it is well worth it to get a brand new shaver.
