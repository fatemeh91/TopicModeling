review/text: It seemed to be working (it was turning the wart white) but it made it painful to walk on after a few days. I had to stop using it on him at this point because he had such a hard time with it. It could be the location of the wart, but he walks fine with other treatments we've tried. I can't mark it 1 star because it did turn it white (which went back to 'normal' within a day of not using this) but not 5 since it was so painful for him. Thought I'd mention our experience in case you have a kiddo to put it on.
