review/text: This tea is no longer sold in the USA grocery stores I contacted the Ricola factory trust me I know. I originally tried this tea in Norway when my dad got really sick on our trip over there. I combine echinacea and hyssop into the tea according to the directions on the bottles (in liquid form) and my friends have dubbed this the miracle tea. I have made it and brought it to them when they were sick and I feel like I get better so much faster when I drink this. It is tiny granulars inside the can you add to hot water and it dissolves to tea. It really opens your sinuses up and is soothing. Great tea worth the price.
