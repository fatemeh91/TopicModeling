review/text: I have had this ring for two days and cannot believe the difference! I am not constantly aware of pain in my thumb and I can pick things up without wincing every time. I love that it is easy to adjust to fit tighter. My thumb joint is enlarged with arthritis so by time I get a ring large enough to go over it, it is very loose and annoying to wear. Not with this ring, it easily adjusted to fit snugly. I only gave it four stars because it does leave a black ring underneath. But the pain relief makes it well worth wearing it anyway.
