review/text: This stuff is amazing!!! I started with the Rainbow Vibrance, trying to ease myself into it, and after a week, I noticed that I had more energy, so I ordered the Green Vibrance. After a week on the two, I started exercising, getting up at 6 or 7 am to do it, and believe me, I am a sleepyhead. I have so much energy with this, it is so noticeable, that when you don't take it, you feel so draggy. Also, I have horrible cramps, and my cycle was almost pleasant. I love this green stuff, and the taste isn't bad at all. I eat vegetables on a regular basis, plus, I drink mine over a period of 30 minutes and I savor the taste.Update: It's been about 5 months now, and I plan on taking this for the rest of my life. My cycle has regulated, my cramps are completely gone, and between this and my Kangen water, I am almost never sick. I have seen some amazing benefits from this, and I don't understand why more people aren't hooked. I started off drinking this with just water, but for the last month, I have been putting this in a smoothie, and once I ate it with oatmeal (green oatmeal-not a great color).
