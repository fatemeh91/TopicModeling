review/text: My husband and I are hoping to start a family soon. I bought and returned two other brands of prenatal vitamins after learning there were certain amounts of ingredients that were either too much, too little, or possibly harmful (e.g., Ginseng, [...]. I try not to base my decisions on reviews, but I found an overwhelming amount of positive feedback on this vitamin. I was especially drawn to the fact that it is 100% natural and includes probiotics. The only essential it is missing is EPA/DHA (Omega 3 & 6) but I already had a large supply of those supplements in my cabinet so I simply take one of each every day. I find myself having more energy every day, even after not sleeping well the night before. In closing, I would highly recommend this vitamin to anybody who wants to make sure they get the correct amount of supplements crucial to the development and well-being of their newest family member!Peace-
