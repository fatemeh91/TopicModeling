review/text: I purchased a replacement for my Braun three months ago after the original mesh broke and started cutting my face. Guess what, the replacement head is now broken as well. I guess I will buy the third one and start treating this as a more fragile item, but this is definitely not what I expected when paying for a high-end shaver.
