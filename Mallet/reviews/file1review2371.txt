review/text: I have been taking this product for about three weeks. The company recommends three caps daily; however, I have reduced this to two. Further, I do not swallow the caps but bite into them and suck out all the oil. I find that this method gets the product into my system much faster. The taste of the oil is pleasant. I feel that the product is working. My dry eyes seem to be getting much better since taking Omega-3. I would greatly recommend it.
