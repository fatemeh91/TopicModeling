review/text: I'll start with the only caveats first, I don't find anyway to clean this and it cannot get wet or it's ruined.Other than that this is a great product. It has a band that velcros at the back and it actually stays put and doesn't slide down your hair. The gel has enough weight that the mask settles on your face and isn't "missing" any spots. It's a persistent relieving warm and I felt better before it cooled down. I haven't tried chilling it yet, but would assume that it stays cold just as long.I have tried several other masks over the years and like this the best. There is no steam on my face (Therabeads left steam and made my eyes quite hot). No strange odor--I had one that was full of uncooked rice, which actually felt good but smelled like old rice after a while. This product also comes with clear instructions and a plastic storage/chilling bag so it won't get wet in the fridge/freezer.
