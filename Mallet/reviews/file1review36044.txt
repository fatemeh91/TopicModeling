review/text: This may be the worst tasting thing I've ever drank. I started using it as a Pre- workout drink because most pre-wo supps have arginine in them. It's suppose to increase hgh levels and all, don't know if its true, but its definately the cheapest arginine on Amazon. Now I have to buy more supps to make my homemade jack3d. I would recommend it to someone.
