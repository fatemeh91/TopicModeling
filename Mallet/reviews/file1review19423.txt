review/text: Great results so far with one 5-in-1 repeller in the basement and another in the barn. I set up two live traps to catch mice and none entered the basement while the 5-in-1 was used. I replaced the 5-in-1 with a different repeller that I purchased locally at the hardware store to test them out. On the first night with the second repeller, the live trap caught a mouse. I put the 5-in-1 back in the basement the following night and have had no mice since. It has been a great product.
