review/text: I have very tight teeth and would routinely shred dental floss. Ever have a shred of the floss get stuck between your teeth? The Hummingbird flosser is the answer! The floss is tightly strung and the vibrating action of the flosser makes it much easier to get the floss into those tight spaces and -- even better -- to remove it intact!
