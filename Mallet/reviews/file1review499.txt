review/text: The overall construction of the product is good. However, the vibrating bunny ears are a little long and high on the vibrator and it seems impossible to get everything to line up, seems like you have to get it just in the right place and then be careful as to not move it. Also, while the vibrator is in use, if one squeezes hard enough the metal balls that move around are quite easy to stop and painful to the squeeze. It also tends to be a bit wider than most vibrators, which is good for me, but another girl I know can't enjoy using hers. It has nice speed setting options but isn't my favorite toy.
