review/text: INTRODUCTIONI have one of those undiagnosable conditions / sun sensitivity that produces musculoskeletal pain at about level 7 every day. Tylenol had zero results at safe levels. I also have fibromyalgia, and the fibro flares add more pain in addition to the above, unknown problem.EFFECT OF MSMThen, I found something obscure on the web that said for some conditions one could take up to 30 or 40 milligrams of MSM per day. So, I started experimenting with more than one capsule per day, and FANTASTIC pain relief was the result.Research has shown MSM to be effective in arthritis of the knee.DOSAGE OF MSMThe most I ever took was about sixteen 1 milligram capsules spaced throughout the day. Now that I know to avoid sun and UV lights (florescent lights) I look at the MSM bottle to gauge my pain level. If its nothing, I take no MSM. If I'm creaky and aching, I take three capsules in the morning, which usually lasts to nighttime when I take three more.SAFETY OF MSMa) Informal clinical trials of MSM safely use dosages up to 6,000 mg/day.b) Possible interactions of MSM with medications you take and other Supplements may be checked on the web at Drugs.com. I found that it is not particularly reactive with other supplements and the medications that *I* take, but your mileage may vary.SUMMARYTo summarize, this is a benign, little-known, and very helpful supplement.[By the way, don't experiment with high doses of other supplements, and do use a high quality source like Jarrow.]
