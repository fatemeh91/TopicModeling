review/text: LOVE Green Vibrance!First off I have an autoimmune condition that makes my joints swell. I have been on a light dose of a drug called Plaquenil for about 4 years now. On top of this I am a long time sufferer of recurrent UTI's. I do everything to prevent them yet I am always plagued. I use scent free soap, pee after sex, take a cranberry supplement, eat tons of yogurt, drink tons of water, the doctor has even prescribed a prophylactic antibiotic to take after sex. Which by the way I hate doing because it seems a little extreme. Anyway all this pill popping is just... its really exhausting.SO.... My husband comes back from a trip to whole foods with this Green Vibrance... Looks, smells, and tastes.. funky... but with OJ its tolerable if not good... And what do you know?????? OMG The UTI's Stop! JOY JOY JOY! One scoop every morning with some OJ... Not only is it really good for you and packed with vitamins.... I no longer get UTI's Thank you Green Vibrance! I will ALWAYS have a jar of this in my fridge! THANK YOU!
