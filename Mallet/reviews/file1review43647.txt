review/text: After a routine physical, my husband was diagnosed with border-line high blood pressure. Our doctor recommended an at home blood pressure monitor. We checked around and decided on this model. It is very easy to use and easy to read. We check our blood pressure every few days. It is a great tool although diet and exercise can help my husband lower his blood pressure!
