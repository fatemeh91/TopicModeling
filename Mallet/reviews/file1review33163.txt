review/text: I've been taking these immune boosters for a number of years now and I can say that the effects have been positive. For health maintenance, I take 1-2 capsules each day. If I'm feeling a little off-balance(like when the weather gets unseasonbly cold) I'll take 3-6 capsules each day until I feel better. The recommended dosage on the bottle is different. I've experimented a bit and found that this amount works for me.The ingredients come from herbs and plants. I have had no nasty side-effects whatsoever from taking these(unlike when I use to take conventional meds). Overall my health has been great and I rarely ever get sick. I do maintain a healthy lifestyle with plenty of exercise along with eating nutritionally sound food. If you are inactive and eat mostly junk food, then these supplements won't be too useful.Amazon always seems to offer a great deal for these(along with the free shipping and no-tax). I recommend getting the bottle with 240 capsules as that is the best deal. One note of caution though, the smell is a bit strong. I'm used to it but for some others, it might be a bit much. Overall though this is a great product and I strongly recommend it to help maintain your immune system.
