review/text: I am a nurse. I saw one of these blood pressure cuffs being used by another nurse, and asked her about it, then, promptly ordered one for myself. At that time it was 100.00, through a cnursing catalogue. I work in a busy rehab center where I take atleast 8-20 blood pressures daily. What my patients say about this is, "Wow, it didn't tighten my arm at all." "Didn't hurt a bit." "I've never seen one like it."A doctor and myself measured readings done manually and readings done by this little machine, and found either way to be only a couple of numbers different.My mom loves it, and we found the same model on Amazon for alot cheaper than 100.00. I have had poor experiences with another wrist blood pressure monitor that was 39.99. This little Omron is quick, easy, and correct.Some of it's features: If you move your arm while you take the blood pressure, it shows an E for error. The batteries last about three motnhs. On this model, there is no battery indicator. It stores over 10 blood pressure readings. It also measures the pulse. There's no date or time stamp, but I didn't have good luck with the model with that feature.To me, every house should have one of these cuffs, not the cheaper priced cuffs that donot work. I've used it at home and at work consistently, and I will buy the exact same cuff again. I hope Omron doesn't stop making them.
