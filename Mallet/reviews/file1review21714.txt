review/text: We bought this tub for our son when he was 9 months old. He is now 14 months old and LOVES it! It is so easy to use and we really like that you can store it on your shower wall when not in use. The high sides are an added safety feature as it discourages our son from reaching the edge of the regular tub and start climbing. The price is great, so much so that we bought one for each set of grandparents so that he can have his regular bathtub when we visit them. It does take a good set of lungs to inflate but once it is full of air it stays that way. We have been extremely pleased with this tub!
