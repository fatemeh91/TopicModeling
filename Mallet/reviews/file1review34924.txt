review/text: These are not a "knock-you-out" type pill. Take them about 20 minutes before you need to sleep, and once that time hits, you can feel yourself getting gradually drowsy. These pills ease you into the natural state of sleep, and thus are the reason why you can sleep better and longer. I've currently decided to stop using the pills just because I'm trying to learn (or re-learn, I guess) to fall asleep naturally. I'm 20-years-old and have had sleeping problems for years, and I definitely recommend these as a short-term method of helping you get to sleep.
