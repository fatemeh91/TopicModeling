review/text: We were tired of lugging out our vacuum cleaner to get crumbs and dust off the carpet in our dining/kitchen area. The sweeper does the job almost as well. The same is true for bare floors. The sweeper does need emptying after almost every sweep or else will not do the job so well. Others have mentioned the handle sections separating. This happened to us but since we used a hammer to bang them into each other, we haven't had a problem. Added bonus: our two-and-a-half year old grandson loves to sweep for us.
