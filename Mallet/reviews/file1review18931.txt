review/text: The sizing guidance was correct and it fits perfectly. I have osteoarthritis in my knee. When I play tennis, the brace provides some support but does not fix the underlying problem with my knee (I didn't expect it to). I think it also provides some psychological support. So it helps but not dramatically in my case.
