review/text: I have one in my car and I fly a lot and I bring another with me on planes. It only takes a few seconds to blow it up and you have excellent back support. Although given the change in cabin pressure, one might want to wait until they reach cruising altitude. The product is durable although I did where one out or poke a hole in it in my car after a few month.
