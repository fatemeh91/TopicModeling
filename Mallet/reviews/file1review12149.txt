review/text: I rarely complain about things on Amazon and, in general, am an easy pill taker - no problems swallowing pills (even large ones) and no problem with pill odors. I bought these as soon as I found out I was pregnant based on the good reviews. My first trimester consisted of a lot of nausea and from the first day I opened the bottle of these pills, I almost lost it. The smell was intolerable!! I could barely take them throughout the 1st trimester and instead, wound up taking all of the gel tab pills that came to me through free samples from my OB's office. Once 1st trimester was over (and my free supply had run out), I decided to try them again. It was a little better but the smell still persists each and every time I open the bottle. Even my husband can't stand the smell if he happens to be standing nearby. Because of how bad they are, I still gag about every other day and in general, the whole thing has been a VERY unpleasant experience for me. I should probably have just returned them right from the start, but I didn't and now I'm stuck. And also in my 8th month, so this ordeal is almost over. I will definitely be buying gel tabs if I ever get pregnant again!
