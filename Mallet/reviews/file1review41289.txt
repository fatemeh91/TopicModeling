review/text: I only wish I had found them sooner. I have always hated traditional pads, I find them irritating. And I get alot of UTI's that always seem related. I also hate knowing that I am just adding to the waste on this planet. Those things probably degrade so slowly. When I switched to reusable pads, I lost the guilt of throwing away all those pads and best of all, these don't irritate me like the disposable ones do. There is only cotton and it feels so much better.I have not had any problem with absorption or leakage or anything. They are prone to moving a little bit more than normal pads since they are not adhesive, but the snap button works well and its not like they could fall off completely, just that they could move slightly anterior or posterior if you are very active. I thought changing would be difficult in public places since you have to bring the pad back out with you, but you can have a small discrete bag or your purse. Has not been an issue for me.I cannot recommend these highly enough!
