review/text: As a teacher of young children, I am always being exposed to "coodies", so this really helps to keep bugs at bay. If you take it when you first start to feel rundown, it seems to be the mst effective. I know it's a bit pricey, but this is the best deal out there. I would rather take a few doses of this than other medications. It's the best!
