review/text: I've gone through quite a few different brands and none compared to this. Its is hands down the best feeling condom i have ever had and my girlfriend agrees as well, and unlike other thin condoms it does not rip easily. One issue I do have is in the circumference of the condom, as i am a little larger it is hard to get on and is a bit snug, so that's something to watch out if you are 7+inches(as i have used it more its become easier to put on). You won't find a better price at any drugstore either.
