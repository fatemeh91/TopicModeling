review/text: I have tried a few different whey protein supplements out on the market and this is the one that I keep coming back to. I think it is one of the better tasting ones out there. I did like BSN's whey protien to supplement and thought it tasted better than this but for the price and the amount of protein you get per scoop, you can not beat this product. Optimum nutrition mixes so easily and the double chocolate, rocky road, and cookies n' cream taste wonderful. I usually just throw some water in a cup and add a scoop and stir it. Mixes well and barely leaves any clumps. Also, the supplement is very effective when it comes to reaching your goals. I usually go to the gym about 3-4 times a weak and lift fairly heavy. The gains with this supplement have been great. It's not a miracle supplement but it sure does what it is supposed to in terms of fueling your stressed out muscles with fast protein and BCAA's. Also makes a great snack for when you are hungry or can not get actual protein from food. Low and fat and calories.
