review/text: This product was recommended to me by my OB after my second c-section. I couldn't believe it works as well as it does! I started noticing improvements after only a week, although you need to wear the sheets for 8-12 weeks in order to see the best results. My scar is no longer bumpy and red; instead it is smoother and more skin-colored.Like I mentioned, this was my second c-section, and my scar looks better NOW (12 weeks postpartum) than it did years after my first c-section. I am amazed!I never really had a problem with the sheets sticking well like the previous comments, but that might be because of the placement of my scar. (I could wear underwear or yoga pants with an elastic band that would help hold the sheets in place.)I highly recommend this product. I never tried any other product, but I have heard that the silicone sheets work better than any cream out there.
