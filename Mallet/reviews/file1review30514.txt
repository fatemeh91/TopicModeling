review/text: I have tried (what seems like) every natural deodorant product out there. I've tried all the natural brands, sprays, crystals...you name it I've probably tried it. I REALLY wanted them to work because I hate putting the Aluminum-based products on my skin. BUT, none of them work. They may work for a few weeks, but it seems like my body builds a tolerance to them and then their effectiveness goes away. I was hoping this would be a better alternative to the Aluminum based deodorants I have been forced to use. Using Deodorant that isn't effective not only makes ME stink, but it also ruins all of my clothes and they're left with that stench that DOES NOT GO AWAY...yuck! I've been using this product for two days now and already it is not working and I've got that smell on my shirts. :-( The sweating doesn't seem to be an issue as much as the stink is. Unfortunate I'm going to have to resort back to the bad stuff...I just can't afford to continue ruining my wardrobe.
