review/text: My son was born quite large (11 lbs 2 oz - and no, I was not diabetic), and we struggled getting him to regain weight lost after birth. I have always strongly wanted to exclusively breastfeed him. We saw lactation consultants several times and by all accounts everything was fine - our son just wouldn't gain weight. At our two month checkup with our pediatrician, he was still below birth weight. Even though I didn't necessarily have a supply issue, our pro-breasfeeding pediatrician suggested I try MotherLove to see what happens. I bought the tincture and while the taste was shockingly unpleasant at first, I have definitely gotten used to it. I can't say that I noticed a HUGE increase in supply, but I did feel it made a difference. Four weeks later, we confirmed my suspicion with a weight check, and our son had gained 11 ounces in those four weeks. That's more than the previous 8 weeks combined. It COULD be coincidence, but I can't help but think that MotherLove More Milk Plus increased my supply just enough to meet the growing needs of our son. I wasn't necessarily worried before, but now I can rest easy knowing that my milk is giving him everything he needs. Highly recommend for anyone with supply issues and/or growth concerns as with us!
