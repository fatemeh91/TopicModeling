review/text: Once you load up the toothbrush with toothpaste and turn on the unit, you can expect a thorough cleaning action. The timer is handy in telling you when you've brushed enough. However, there is one glaring design failure that makes it so that I can't rate this very highly: you can't put toothpaste on this thing without some serious balancing.It would seem that there is insufficient flatness on the back of the toothbrush such that the brush is a bit wobbly. Half the time the toothbrush is knocked over when putting toothpaste on, smearing toothpaste all over the counter. I'm really tired of the toothpaste in my counter grout; it should be on my teeth.
