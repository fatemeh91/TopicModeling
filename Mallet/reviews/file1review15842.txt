review/text: I have had pain in my left knee for years. Then I just started get pain in my left index finger base knuckle. I knew I had to do something so I decided to try this product. Both pains were gone in lest than two months. I am ordering more today. By the way order from Amazon, at your local drug store it is twice as much.
