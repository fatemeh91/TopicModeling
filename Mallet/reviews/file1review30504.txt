review/text: For years I had no real skin issues, but lately it seemed no matter what I tried, it wasn't working. Everything was irritating my face, I was breaking out more, and my skin was oilier. I happened upon Dermalogica while shopping for shampoo, lucky for me. I ordered this cleanser, and I loved it immediately. It's light, it smells great, my latest breakouts have clearing up without any spot treatments, and my skin feels great after cleaning, instead of dry or irritated. Recommended for anyone with sensitive skin or troublesome skin. It might seem costly, but a little goes a long way, and it's well worth it.
