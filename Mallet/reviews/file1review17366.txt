review/text: When I bought this on the strength of the Amazon reviews, I thought to myself "how good can it be?". Well, I found out. This unit lives up to all the praise. No pulls or snags, and creates a uniform cut without exception. Previously, I'd always have to go back without the depth gauge to smooth things off, but not with this model. The only touchups I ever need to do is around the lips (but that's to be expected).
