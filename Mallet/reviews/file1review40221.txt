review/text: I liked the toothpaste. It wasn't too minty and didn't have a gritty feel after using it -- even with the baking soda in it. I've tried other toothpastes with baking soda and a lot of them leave a gritty feel in your mouth. This one was ""refreshing"" and the taste was neither too strong nor too weak. I would purchase this product again and would recommend it to family and friends.
