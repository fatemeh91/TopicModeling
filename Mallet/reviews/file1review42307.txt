review/text: I never write reviews, but this product is so effective that I feel like I have to! Last year I had a lot of physical problems; heart palpitations, hair loss, fatigue, heavy and irregular menstrual cycles, and unable to concentrate. It got so bad that I thought I was dying! After being told I was fine by the cardiologist, family doctor, and gynecologist I figured it was time I did some research. What I found was I was most likely deficient in Iodine. So, I decided to try liquid vitamins to see if it would help. Within three hours of taking these vitamins I felt energized. One week later, my heart palpitations are almost gone, my hair is thick and no longer falling out, my menstrual cycles are completely back to normal, and my brain is functioning like it used to! You do not know how excited I am to finally be feeling good! These vitamins taste great, and they really work. I don't get a stomach ache taking them, and I instantly get a boost of energy. Try them! You will not be disappointed!
