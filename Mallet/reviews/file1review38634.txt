review/text: I was distressed to find out that I had been wasting my money on magnesium pills that were virtually doing nothing for me. Upon research I found that magnesium malate was one of the kinds I needed to be taking for my needs. I chose this brand by other reviews and I agree.. they are wonderful!!! great for my needs, fast shipping, easy flip top or screw cap... will be buying more again!!!
