review/text: I've used these for years as I'm prone to carpal tunnel syndrome. These support gloves are comfortable and flexible and help anyone who has to do a lot of repetitive motion activity like typing. They wash up pretty well, too. I would not hesitate to recommend these to anyone who does a lot of typing or fine needlework or anything of that nature.
