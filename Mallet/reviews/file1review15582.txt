review/text: have been using lavilin deodorant for many years. i really liked the old formula best, as it seemed to last a little longer. however, i use it once a week and remain stink free. as to the reviewer who said it did not work, be persistent. it did not work very well for me either when i began using it. i had to wash my underarms during the day or i would start getting odor. as the weeks went by, it began to last a week or longer with regular bathing. wouldn't want to be without it!
