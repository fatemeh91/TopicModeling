review/text: I am not a bodybuilder. I found this because my body requires extra protein and I don't consume much dairy so as an aging female I loved the nearly full dose of daily calcium I get in one serving. I love the chocolate and just mix with ice cold water, using less water than recommended so its thicker. I think it tastes just like a chocolate shake with no after taste. I have been using this product for two years now. Highly recommend.
