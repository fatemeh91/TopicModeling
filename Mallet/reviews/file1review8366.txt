review/text: Just the right length, flex and brush head width for the 27oz non-insulated and 20oz insulated Kleen Kanteens. It reaches the bottom of the 27.1oz Voss glass bottle with about 1 in. of the handle sticking out of the bottle. However, it will not fit into the mouth of the 12.6oz Voss glass bottle.
