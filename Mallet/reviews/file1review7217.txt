review/text: We were generally pleased with the product, but had a real problem with the packaging. When I opened the footbath for Christmas and removed all the contents, we were misssing the foot nodules and the remote. When I called Brookstone, they told me they were probably hidden in the styrofoam packaging. Well it was too late to look since we discarded all the packaging while cleaning up from the Christmas mess. They also informed me the product was discontinued and we could not get replacement parts. The footbath works fine without either of the missing parts, but it would be nice to have what we paid for.
