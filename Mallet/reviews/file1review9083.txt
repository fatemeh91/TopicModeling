review/text: Edited, added note a year or two later:1-2 times a day, I add 2 TBLS of Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar to a small can of pineapple juice, some cubes of ice and blend it in a blender (on "ice crusher".) Frothy, refreashing and Delicious!I also always add a scoop of Green Vibrance; the above ingrediants make Green Vibrance tasty. Anyway, love the above recipe!!! And love the energy and clarity it seems to give me!!!original post: If I can only remember to use it. They say it takes "30 days to form a habit". I am going to remind myself with stickie notes- "drink more Green Vibrance!" I like it best with cold premium OJ. If you are feeling tired, etc., especially women, you may have a systemic candida yeast problem. Put more "probiotics", like from this product, in your diet to help keep things "in check", in your gut. Good luck everyone and God Bless!
