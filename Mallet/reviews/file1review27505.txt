review/text: I have been using ON for at least 4 months now everytime after I work out. The flavor never gets old, and I mix it with water! It supplies 24 g of protein everytime. That is equivalent to a burger without all the carbs and fat. Recovery rate is fast and I feel stronger everytime I go back to the gym.
