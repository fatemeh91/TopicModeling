review/text: This thing is a life saver. My husband just had hip replacement surgery, and cannot put on his own socks yet. This allows him to be independant and put his own socks on. Everyone who has undergone surgery and needs assistance putting on socks should invest in one of these. I didn't even know something like this was out there.
