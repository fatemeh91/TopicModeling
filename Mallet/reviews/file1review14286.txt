review/text: The product cleaned better than nothing and did decrease the amount of scrubbing I had to do--WHEN THE DEVICE WORKED. I actually bought 3 devices because I thought I ruined the first two by allowing the battery compartment to get wet by not changing the batteries properly. However, with my LAST unit, I realized that the cleaning solution leaks into the battery compartment thus rendering it inoperable. Guess I was a little slow to realize that the device is of poor quality. Too bad.
