review/text: I had been purchasing the liquid flaxseed oil and putting on salads but thought I would try the gel caps as I don't eat quite as many salads in the wintertime. I think they are just as good although the gel caps are large but being gel they are not hard to swallow. I usually take one after breakfast each morning. There is no aftertaste and I definitely would buy again and for 200 capsules the price is right.
