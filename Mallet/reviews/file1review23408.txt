review/text: I bought this item for my wife and she loved it. She is going to school to be a RN and she said that the stethoscope was better than the ones sold at the campus bookstore. The heartbeat comes in really clear and is "really pretty". I would recommend this item to any person who is in need of a good stethoscope. The ear buds are soft and comfortable. Comes with an extra set of ear buds and an ID tag.
