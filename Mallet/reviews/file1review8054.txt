review/text: I had one of these when I was studying abroad in Germany and was looking for something similar. These are great if you hand-scrub your dishes - you get a great grip and it fits in your hand nicely, and all you have to do is push down the top to dispel more liquid.Only problem is, it dispels fluid because when you push down the rubber top, you're also pushing air and anything in there out towards the hole, so once you push it a couple times, it looses the air inside that's helping you push fluid out and then I have to unscrew/rescrew the top again to get that same air pressure going. Also, after about a month the brush gets kind of matted and stained, and doesn't scrub as well, so you have to replace it.I'm not sure I will buy this again, I might look for a better made product.
