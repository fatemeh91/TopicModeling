review/text: I'm still not sure whether Inositol is what my body needs, but I can say the powder form is much more effective than the pill form I had tried from another retailer (generic brand). This leaves me feeling calmer, the pill form pretty much didn't do anything. If you think you may benefit from Inositol, try the powder first.
