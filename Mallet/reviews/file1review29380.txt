review/text: I recently purchased this fragrance as I am huge fan of the Creed Fragrance line.This is the 1st time I have tried Royal Water by Creed and really like it a lot. It has a clean, crisp smell with hints of citrus under notes. I also love the fact that this fragrance isn't overpowering to the olfactory senses and unlike many fragrances today, Royal Water, doesn't have a sickly sweet or overpowering floral scent.The only draw back that I have found with this fragrance is that the fragrance doesn't last throughout the day. I am a huge fan of Creed's Himalaya scent and its scent lasts a long time.
