review/text: I've bought over ten of these in the time I've used my HDR80 headphones. Brand new, they'd only last a few hours, and it makes sense because they are just a couple 1.4v watch batteries stacked together once you crack the shell open.If you buy a headset that uses these, you can count on having to buy these batteries again and again, as they only seem to last for a few months before they get weak and won't hold a charge.At least I was able to modify my hdr80 so that I could power it with AAA's instead. I can enjoy great sound without the tax of buying these overpriced batteries. I'd avoid any headset that uses these, unless you don't mind the extra expense and hassle of doing the battery shuffle.
