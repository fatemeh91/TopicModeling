review/text: I have tried and own several including Levenger and others. This is a nice sort of heavy pen that floats across the paper. I have arthritus and have to write a lot. This pen makes it posible for me to write neater and longer than any other writing divice. Of course I can't spell with a damn and my grammer is below C average but it is nice to be retired because I can tell you now that if you don't like what I write you don't have to read it.I also like the fine point.
