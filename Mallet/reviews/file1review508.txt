review/text: Haven't tried out the waterproof aspect of it, but my wife really enjoys it. It is a little bit large, so you'll probably want to have some good lubrication on hand, but it does the job well once you get past that.The biggest problem is that the ear on the rabbit are pretty stiff, so can be a little rough part of the time. But this seems to be only occasionally for my wife, and you can always turn them off if they're bothering you.
