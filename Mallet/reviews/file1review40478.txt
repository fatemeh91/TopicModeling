review/text: First off, Taylor shave creams are excellent. They are comparable in quality to all the other high end English shave creams, and come in a slightly smaller tub for way less money. That's preferable if you're like me and like to stock a wide variety so you can smell what you want to smell whenever you shave.So check on Taylor being as good as the others. Don't let any reviewer sway you that DR Harris or others are sooo much better. I've found different brands make better and worse in different scents. DR Harris has the best lavender, Taylor has the best Sandalwood, Trumper owns Violet.This St James stuff is interesting. At first I really didn't care for the scent, and that was after taking in a good whiff at a local shave shop. I came home and ordered on Amazon to save about $10, and when it got to me for whatever reason I just wasn't as fond as I'd been.That being said, scent is a very personal kind of determination. I like it enough to use it, but it's not my every day smell.What is EXCEPTIONAL about this product is the quality of its lather. It is far and away the best lathering cream I have ever encountered. It makes me wonder if the smell is just a byproduct of their having crammed every lathering agent into the same cream.It is extraordinarily comfortable. If I have a special occasion and I need to be as clean shaven as possible then this is what I use. You basically can't cut yourself with this stuff on.So if you want a super lathery cream and you haven't been happy with others then go for this. It's great with that.I only gave it four stars because of the less than universally acceptable scent, but I'm tending towards 4.5.
