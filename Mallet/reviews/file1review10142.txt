review/text: I have been using Wahl products since high school and college. This trimmer does an admirable job. Keep in mind I keep my goatee / beard longer at around 1/4". I do not know how well it will trim for those who like shorter lengths. The trimmer shapes pretty well. The inconvenience of a cord is worth it in my mind because you get better cutting power and the vacuum is stronger. I don't like having to worry about charging a battery. This trimmer still does not get every hair into the collection tray, but my sink is a whole lot cleaner than it used to be. The collection tray is easy to remove and empty. The unit is lightweight and very ergonomic in the hand. The blade guard seems easy to adjust and is easily snapped in place and removed. I like having more than four or five length choices. It could be quieter but one should get used to it. I have always known Wahl blades to be good cutters, and with corded power you don't have to spend a lot of time trimming. Overall, this trimmer seems to be a good buy for all of those having trouble with the more well-known brands of vac trimmers.
