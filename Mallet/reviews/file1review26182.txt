review/text: Just received this today. Yep, it's big, but not monstrous by any means. The measurements are as follows:- Length: 8 inches- Girth (shaft): 5 inches- Girth (head): 5.5 inchesThe packaging doesn't list exactly what's made of. This is the information it lists:- Sil-A-Gel formula- Anti-bacterial- Non-toxic formula- Latex-free- Cadmium freeI ordered this in lavender. The actual colour is a little darker than pictured, but not by much. I'm thinking the picture is just at a high contrast.As others have stated, the flexibility is perfect. It's flexible enough to move with your body, but firm enough to do its job without folding in on itself like jelly.There is a smell, but it's not strong enough to clear out a room or kill the mood. It has that new, synthetic smell that many items have. I'm not sure what else you would expect from a product made of these kinds of materials. It's not an issue for me, and I expect for the smell to go away with time and several washes. After the first wash, it actually smells kind of nice. Like blueberry.All of that being said, I would suggest ordering this from a seller other than Hustler, who is notorious for slower-than-molasses shipping. If you do decide to order from Hustler, at least read their seller feedback beforehand and prepare yourself.Hope this helps!
