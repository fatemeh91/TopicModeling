review/text: I have had this unit a couple of years and its still working perfectly. Keep in mind however when you order it- the cuff size makes a difference. I got it with the larger cuff size and I am at the upper end of the size. You need to make sure when you measure your upper arm size- that these cuffs dont stretch and if you try to squeeze into a cuff that doesnt fit you properly- you will never ever have an accurate reading. This unit however is great for the home user and is so self explanitory and keeps very accurate readings. Do keep in mind it does NOT have the internet connection for it. I believe you have to purchase that seperately.
