review/text: Being a long time Gillette razor user, I've come to find out that blades can last either five shaves or as little as three before it starts jerking your whiskers out and leaving me with razor burn. All I can suggest is find a better blade and try using a Schick Titanium blade. I've had as many as 50 shaves from one blade or as little as 30 shaves which is saying a lot because I have one very heavy beard.Gillette; do your homework and come back with a better bullet the put in my razor or get out of the business!
