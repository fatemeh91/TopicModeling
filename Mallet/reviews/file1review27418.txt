review/text: I don't know about you, but when I'm done getting swole, it's time to get my Wheys on. I always reach for ON Gold Standard Whey, because the taste and price can't be beat. But I did not expect to be in for such an amazing treat when I ordered my latest jug of protein goodness. Optimum Nutrition has given their 100% Whey Gold Standard a Gold Medal facelift, with a balls awesome gold foil label. But they didn't stop there. The scoop in the jug has been refinished with gold as well. I feel like a champ scooping out a double scoop serving of pure awesome into my blender. The blender trembles with anticipation at getting a chance to mix all that double chocolate madness into a shake for my enjoyment, and nourishment.If you're serious about becoming the man (or goddess) you can be, then you have to get yourself some of this amazing Whey.
