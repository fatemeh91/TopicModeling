review/text: I was hopeful that this brush would work like a charm due to positive reviews, but unfortunately, it just doesn't do a well enough job on my wool coat. I have bought 99 cent lint brushes that have worked just as well as this brush. It just doesn't do a good job of removing pet hair and other lint from my coat.
