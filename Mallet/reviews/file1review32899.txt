review/text: I bought this, knowing the risks and side effects (one of which being laxative withdrawal), because I prefer herbal remedies to store bought medicines. I rarely have need of such a product due to my vegetarian diet. Occasionally I don't eat enough fiber, it happens; I purchased this tea and tried it because Traditional Medicinals teas are fantastic and usually take care of my problems quickly.The tea tastes nice, I wasn't turned off to it, my husband however was. I'm a big fan of Chi tea and spice tea, so this was right up my alley. I brewed for 10 minutes, no longer. In about 4 hours I produced a bowel movement that was...unpleasant. The product took care of my bloating and cramping, however it was a bit much. I suggest perhaps brewing for 5-8 minutes instead of 10-15 unless you're used to the way this product works. It's suggested that you sleep, I do not recommend this. I've heard stories of people using it before bed and waking up to a mess. Given the urgent need to go I experienced once the product kicked in, I'd say this is a reasonable fear.I did feel as if I'd been cleansed out properly, and felt much relief afterwords, so the product does what it should do, just be careful of it and use it in moderation. Herbs are not 100% safe just because they are natural, so do your research and be aware of what you are putting into your body.
