review/text: This product is huge, noisy and doesn't do anything exceptional. Actually just throw hot water in your feet in a way I cannot call it "massage". It's my worst online shopping experience ever. And to return the product I will have to pay more than $30, I lost time and money with that. Pay attention: go to the store and see it before you do the same mistake I did.
