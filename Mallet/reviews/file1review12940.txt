review/text: The minute I opened the package I was bowled over by the strong chemical smell. I opened it up thinking it would air out some, but it did not, so I returned them. (I'd bought 2.) Didn't want to take the chance of washing/drying them in case the smell didn't go away, then I wouldn't be able to return them, so I don't know if the smell goes away in time after washing, but considering how strong it was I doubt it.
