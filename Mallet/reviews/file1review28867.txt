review/text: Out of all the Whey Protein shakes I have tried, this is the best tasting. It still leaves a chalky taste/feeling in your mouth, but if you rinse you mouth with a swig of water it goes away. Overall I am satisfied with the Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate, and will be buying it again when I run out.
