review/text: I used slim fast for almost 6 months this year and saw mixed results. I followed the 3-2-1 plan almost religiously and did really well the first few weeks. I quickly dropped 20 pounds, but then saw my results come to a halt. My diet did not change, and I was still exercising, I just was unable to shed any more.The product tastes great, and curbs hunger very well. I had the energy to maintain work outs, but the high carbs meant less protein. After choosing to discontinue the slim fast I switched to a lean protein/low carb diet and was able to regain the ability to lose pounds.For those wanting to lose a few quick pounds, or provide a quick meal when maintaining a healthy weight this product is a good choice. If you have a significant amount to lose you may want to look into another option.
