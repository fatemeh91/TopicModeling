review/text: My daughter has special needs and cannot hold a bottle. This worked great to hold the bottle at mouth-level for her, and she can drink from it whenever she wants.Unfortunately, the first one I bought broke after only using it 3 times, if you twist the 'locking' mechanism on the bottom too hard you can snap the plastic bits holding it together rather easily.I bought a second one (that's how good this is, it really is!) and within a few months of use the velcro that holds the bottle in the holder has ripped apart, but I was able to repair it myself to continue using it.So, it's a great product, just be careful with it, it's not meant to withstand a great deal of wear and tear.
