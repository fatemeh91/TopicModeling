review/text: I was very skeptical, however all the great reviews along with my suffering got me to order this. It worked immediately! I still can't believe how well and what relief I have. Highly recommend. And as for the smell, it really isn't bad it just seems like a strong plant type scent. you can use a q-tip like one other customer suggested or not. Very pleased and I can take this with me. Also ordered the anuice, not sure how I feel about it yet and find that I use this over that. If you are looking for relief try this!
