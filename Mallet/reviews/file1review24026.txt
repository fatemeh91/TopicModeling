review/text: Despite the description of Pediatric AND Infant stethoscope and despite the product description stating BOTH stethoscopes are...The product is only ONE pediatric stethoscope, not one pediatric and one infant stethoscope as implied. No infant stethoscope is included in this product. The cost of this is ~$20 higher than an individual pediatric scope again suggesting that paying a little more and bundling, you are getting TWO stethoscopes. Please be aware this is only ONE pediatric scope and does NOT include an infant scope.
