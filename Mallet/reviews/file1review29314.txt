review/text: I am disabled, a C-5 quadriplegic. I need extra long and flexible straws to make drinking things easier. These do a good job and I recommend them. We had to order a case of 24 packs of 40 = 960. Lots of straws, lol. The 1st pack we opened the straws were all bad-small holes made them unuseable. The 2nd pack was fine.
