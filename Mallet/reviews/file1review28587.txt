review/text: I've been through one canister now and I like the results. I originally started this workout plan to lose some weight. I lift two days a week and do hard cardio two days a week, every week. I have been at it for 5 months now, and I haven't lost a pound, in fact, I've gained about 8 pounds. But thanks to ON I know it's all muscle. I weigh more but my waist is smaller - I can tell by the way my pants fit. My arms, shoulders, and even my legs look lean and muscular, but my little belly is still there. Part of it is body type I guess. I'll keep at it as long as I can. I have one shake with milk in the morning for breakfast and one immediately after my workout, which usually ends up being around noon. Once I started using ON I noticed I was less sore after lifting days. I also feel good about myself because I know I'm only putting the best stuff in my body. Overall I'm very pleased, but I wish it would help me get rid of my little belly.And oh yeah, it tastes great blah blah blah. Mixes well yada yada yada. Frankly, I don't care about this stuff, as long as I get results.
