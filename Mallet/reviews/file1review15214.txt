review/text: First I want to say I'm not a big fan of protein bars in general, I find most of them dry and tasteless. However these are moist and flavorful. Unlike some posters I didn't find them to be chalky at all. I love chocolate and find these to be a terrific and satisfying replacement for candy bars and with the protein I can feel good about this product as either a meal replacement or a snack.
