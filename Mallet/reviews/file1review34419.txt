review/text: Many reviews sing the praises of this lube, and I have to agree. For most of my toys, I use a waterbased lube (either of the Gels from KY or Astroglide). Recently I added an Aneros prostate stimulator to my collection (wow!), and I like to leave it in longer than my typical toys stay. Waterbased lubes tend to dry out quicker, but just the smallest coating of Wet on the Aneros Progasm and I'm good to go for hours. Great product.
