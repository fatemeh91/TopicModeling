review/text: Even though it has been mentioned by other reviewers before I would like to emphasize two points.First, it gives amazingly consistent readings for weight and body fat and seems to be quite accurate. My previous scale was much more inconsistent and inaccurate even though it was a brand name electronic scale.Second, the instructions indicate this scale is not intended for the body fat measurement of athletes - those who work out an average 1 hour a day or more. I guess most people who keep track their body fat also do some kind of sports. And I also guess you need a more expensive Tanita with sports mode if you work out regularly and want to know your actual body fat percentage. Athletes have significantly different tissue composition (more muscle) to that of sedentary people and this is why researchers and companies use a different formula to calculate their body fat percentage.
