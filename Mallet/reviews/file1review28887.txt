review/text: There are three important things to me when it comes to which whey protein to buy: Nutritional Value, Taste, and Cost. And in all three of those areas Optimum Nutrition has hit a home run. They managed to pack 24g of Protein into only 120 Calories with only 3g of Carbohydrates and 1g of Sugar. And at less than $45 on Amazon for 74 servings I couldn't ask for much more. Oh, and by the way, it tastes great. I happen to prefer the double rich chocolate flavor myself, but either way you go, you won't be unhappy.
