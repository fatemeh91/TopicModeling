review/text: Although it's not organic or all natural, it is something I have decided "I CAN LIVE WITH", a slight indulgence, with nutrition.This is really a healthy alternative to a candy bar, this is a very hearty bar, and will make you feel as if you have eaten something. Healthy fat, whey protein, enriched with 14 vitamins and minerals. And most of all it not too sweet, and does not have a overwhelming taste of whey. I have been trying to get my son eating or drinking protein but he just can't seem to stand the taste, but I find him sneaking these !! A treat I do not mind him having.
