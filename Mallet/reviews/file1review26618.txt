review/text: I got the back booster to relieve minor back ache in various chairs. I can now inflate it to the level I need for any certain chair or for the car. I was concerned the air might shift to the sides away from where I wanted the support, but it is working fine. I don't have the need to deflate and take it traveling, but that will be a good feature should that come up.
