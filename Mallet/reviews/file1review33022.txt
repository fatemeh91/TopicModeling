review/text: I like the oil, I just don't care for some of the fragrances. I enjoy earthy, spicy smells, and two of the 5 fit the bill and I've been enjoying them a lot. But the other two were really floral and sweet, which are things I usually don't care for at all in a fragrance. The fifth is almond scented, which is practically unscented (not that this is a cheap product, but that almond fragrance is very mild). I will definitely order more oil from this company, and I'm happy I tried the sampler before buying a full bottle of any one fragrance. The oils themselves are very slick without being too heavy, and they absorb well into the skin.
