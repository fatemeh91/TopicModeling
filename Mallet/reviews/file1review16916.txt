review/text: I bought an 8825XL about two years ago. Prior to that I had used Brauns for many years. I am very happy with my Norelco.I kept buying Braun razors because, when new, they give a very nice shave. The problem, for me, was that the shave quality deteriorated quickly because the foils in the head are so darned delicate. So I would buy a new Braun and in about 3 months it would need a new foil. But, of course, I didn't really want to put out the $30 quite that often so I would go for months with a poor shave. I would usually buy new foil and blade when I started getting nicked up. I bought the Braun with the cleaning system, thinking that taking the cleaning out of human hands would fix it. Didn't work that way, though. I was getting a little more out of a foil but I was paying $5 per month for the juice.Anyway, I gave up and bought this Norelco. The first shave was _very_ nice. Just as good as a new Braun. And now, two years later, I have still not bought a blade set for it. The shaves are at least 90% as comfortable as when new.The Norelco has been reliable and it is easy to clean. Once every couple of months I take the heads apart and clean the blades with alcahol. My wife commented on how quiet it was the first time I used it.But maybe the problems with the Braun are just me. Maybe other Braun users have mastered the trick of handling it without messing up the shave quality. I'm sticking with my Norelco.
