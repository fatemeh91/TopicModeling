review/text: I swear by these pills. I take two every four hours anytime I feel something come on. My symptoms always subside. I currently have come down with something I thought too strong for these homeopathic pills- last night I was feverish, exhausted, achey, headached, and a deep cough. This morning, I have only the cough and even that is better.I never review anything, ever, by the way.
