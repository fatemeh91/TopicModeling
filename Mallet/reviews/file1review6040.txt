review/text: We purchase these units to be used in our dental practice. California state law now requires that we take blood pressure reading prior to use of any administered anesthetic. Since we cannot ask patients to remove clothing and put on a medical gown as is done at a doctors appointment, these work great when patients have too much restrictive clothing on. We have one in each operatory. Periodically we check the readings against the traditional cuff and stethoscope method on ourselves and the readings are consistently correct. A number of our patients have told us they use one at home for daily checks. Next best thing to a cuff, and Amazon has the best price we have found.
