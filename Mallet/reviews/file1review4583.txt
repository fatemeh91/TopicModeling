review/text: First let me qualify myself as someone who last used a non-electric razor when I was 18...over 25 years ago. Thus the beginner tag. I stopped using a bladed razor because of cuts. For years I kind of accepted an average shave from electric razors because I just knew a blade would cut my face. I even grew a goatee because I could not get a clean shave on my chin. About two weeks ago I received an unsolicited free Gillette Fusion in the mail. I just sat it on my desk and figured I would toss it out eventually. Something inside told me to "research" it on the Net. I did and decided to give it a whack come Monday morning (Nov. 6). After perusing these reviews I decided to not buy the Fusion gels. I instead bought the Face Scrub, Shaving Gel and Post Shave Lotion of the Neutrogena Men, Razor Defense line. Let's just say I did not know I needed a Face Scrub product. :-)With some trepedition I went ahead with my "test." I could not believe how gently the Fusion glided across my face. And, just as importantly, what an improvement over my electric razor. I honestly do not think I could cut myself if I tried. Okay, of course I could. :-)I recommend this razor. I have not used Mach3, Sensor, etc. so I can't say it is better or worse. But I like it.P.S. The cartridges are, of course, overpriced.
