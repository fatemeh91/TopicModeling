review/text: Ever since I could remember, I had painful stomach problems. After getting older, they changed and all of a sudden I noticed I specifically couldn't eat peanut butter any longer. I did some research online and found out about enzymes and what a key role they played in all of the functions in your body, including and most commonly digestion. I also found out that our bodies aren't as efficient as producing them as we age. I tried the single enzyme approach for things like beans and milk and proteins in the past, but never had any luck. Then I found Omega-Zyme and it immediately worked. I was amazed! I haven't taken it daily as recommended yet, but I should, because there is no doubt that I can eat peanut butter again as long as I take my Omega-Zyme with it!Update 6/21/2010 - I've continued to buy this product because it has worked well for me. I've used it mostly with peanut butter and it never fails, but I generally don't take it with all meals because I generally don't have problems with other foods. Recently, though, I started weightlifting again and began supplementing with whey protein and the pain and gas returned with a vengence. It made going to work an anxious experience. Because I had started associating Omega-Zyme with Peanut butter, I didn't think about taking it right away to help my problem, but after several days of pain and discomfort I remembered Omega-Zyme and tried taking it with the protein powder. I took 3 OmegaZyme pills with each of 2 drinks throughout the day and my problem was gone! Yet again, I was extremely happy and amazed by the benefit this product provides me. As a note, though, no product is guaranteed to work for everyone. Digestive problems can be caused by a large number of issues (allergies, gulping air, intestinal bacteria profile, enzyme production, etc...) and I believe this product will only help if your problem is related to enzymes. I hope it helps you as much as it has me!
