review/text: I purchased these slippers as a Hanukkah gift for my 90 year old aunt, my best friend. She has arthritis pretty bad, and lives in MD, where it can be very cold in the Winter.I wanted to get her something different, alittle something to make her feel pampered. She loves these, and after what she told me, I purchased a pair for myself, in a different color, since when I went to order this they were out of this color.I too like these, even tho I don't have arthritis, at least not in my feet, but they made my feet feel warm, and did make them feel better. I like that they are adjustable. Everyone could use a little extra pampering, couldn't they?!
