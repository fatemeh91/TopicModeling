review/text: I have worn hard contact lenses for 50 years, and have tried every cleaner out there. This cleaner is far superior to any other. It only takes 2 or 3 drops per contact, so it lasts for months. Labob should advertise this product more. I had never heard of it until my optometrist gave me a sample. It is impossible to find locally, so I am very glad that Amazon carries it. Try it - you WILL love it.
