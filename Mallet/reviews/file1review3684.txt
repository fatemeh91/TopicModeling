review/text: I have been taking this product for ~6 months now and have really noticed a difference in my overall health. You can do a simple Google search for the benefits of magnesium and find a myriad of articles and studies about its effects. One thing most people don't realize is it can take up to two months to notice any differences as your magnesium levels begin to normalize.I take 400-600mg (2-3 tablets) a day. One in the morning when I wake up and one at night before I go to bed. If I add an extra tablet I add it sometime during the late afternoon. It's best not to take the full dose at once as your body will not absorb all of it. It's also best to take this on an empty stomach. In the morning I take it 15 minutes before I eat breakfast and at night I make sure I haven't eaten for a few hours (which is probably a healthy decision anyway)I have noticed a better ability to relax, less muscle cramps after a hard work out, and I sleep much better than I did before. Magnesium has many wonderful benefits and I would encourage anyone to do some research to see if it is right for them! It has worked very well for me.This product is very affordable and I highly recommend it to those looking to boost their magnesium levels.
