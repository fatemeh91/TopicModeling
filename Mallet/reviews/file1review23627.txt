review/text: I am a mother of twins who have sensitive skin. My cousin gave us a bottle of this last year and we absolutely love it. It is great for their sensitive skin and it smells soooo good! I really like it much better than Aveno's baby wash! This soap lathers up so much better than Aveno but also dissipates in the tub water so it doesn't get too sudsy. A little goes a long way. I even have all my girlfriends with twins hooked on it now too! We all love it and am really glad that Amazon carries it! Try it, you won't be disappointed!Mamma to Kaia and Kolby, 10 months
