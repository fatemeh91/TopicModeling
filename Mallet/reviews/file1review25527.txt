review/text: I am so happy with this Panasonic ER411 trimmer. After plucking and many other painful procedures, I gave up on these little trimmers because my previous one was WORTHLESS. I looked at Amazon and saw the wonderful reviews for this trimmer and resorted it as my last bet. I went to Target and found it, bought it for $19.99, and it works great! This is not just a tool for men, I'm a woman and I use it for the original purpose: nose and ear, but also eyebrows, upper lip, chin, cheeks, etc. I'm Greek and can not help my hairy genes, but this little trimmer works WELL and hasn't upset me yet. Much better than shaving, tweezing, plucking, depilatories, etc!You can basically use it anywhere on your face like I do, but I do not suggest using it on other parts of the body, like your chest, stomach, etc. In those areas, it pulls the hair and is quite painful. On my face I haven't had any pain yet, like other reviews stated. Don't jam the thing up your nose or ear, you'll be asking for it. Just use it properly and it'll give you great results.You may have to rinse your nose out because the tiny little cut hairs can be quite itchy. Other reviewers: please spare me the disgusting comments about your cleaning rituals. Sorry, we don't need to know everything!!Last tip: If you see a stubborn piece of hair that the trimmer is trimming but not removing, gently guide the trimmer the OPPOSITE direction over the hair and you'll hear a louder noise that lets you know it GOT the hair finally.All in all, a WONDERFUL trimmer, I have no complaints yet, I keep it in a drawer, I'm sure if you drop it you'll have problems, but isn't it that way with everything now? Just be careful and it'll last long. A+++!!Enjoy your hairfreeness!
