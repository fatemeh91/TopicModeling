review/text: We've had this toilet topper for a while and it really is nearly perfect. Easy to put on, take off, and clean. I always tell my son to push his little man down into the toilet, so we haven't had problems with the splashguard like some have. It would be nice if the seat was a little bit squishy (like the weePods) so it would be just a little more comfortable to encourage him to stay on it longer. But for the price, yeah, this is the best we've used.
