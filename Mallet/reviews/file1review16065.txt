review/text: Smells wonderful and really heals wounds. It is also very soothing and an excellent pain reliever for cuts. A dear friend from Australia introduced me to it (she let me use hers on a bad cut) and I immediately had to purchase my own.I love it and highly recommend it! No medicine chest should be without it.
