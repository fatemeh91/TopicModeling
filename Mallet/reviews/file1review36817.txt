review/text: I purchased this product because I have ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and I have difficulty putting on socks among other things. I was hoping that it would help make it easier. Unfortunately, I can't even begin to load the sock onto the device so it's basically worthless to me. If you have any difficulty with your hands, this item is not for you. If hand strength isn't the issue, it will probably be a worthwhile purchase.
