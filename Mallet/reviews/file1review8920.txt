review/text: I have been a fan of Green Vibrance for years now. It keeps my blood sugar stable and makes me less hungry. The nutrients provided satisfy my hunger cravings and revive my energy. I use this early in the morning, before my work out. I also keep some at the office to use when I need a boost before my massage work. It goes without saying that Green Vibrance is a much more beneficial boost than caffeine or sugar.Green Vibrance by Vibrant Health - 24.34 Ounces (60 day supply)
