review/text: This neck pillow is just what I needed for my tense, aching neck and upper back. As a health care professional, I work long shifts doing a lot of physical work as well as working at a computer station entering and reviewing information on charts, so my upper back and neck are tense and sore a lot of the time. After work, using this warming neck pillow is just the right thing to release the tension and relax the sore muscles in my upper back and neck. After the first time using this product, I was able to sleep more comfortably without the constant pain I had in my upper back waking me up every time I moved.I also purchased the shoulder wrap, which can be used for the upper, middle, or lower back. I use the two together and I feel like I just left the spa after a massage...very relaxed and NO sore muscles!! AND I save a lot of money compared to getting a massage!I highly recommend it!!
