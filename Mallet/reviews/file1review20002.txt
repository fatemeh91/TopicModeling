review/text: This tub has a great concept with being able to fold up - but is terrible for a newborn. There is not enough support for the baby and he or she will slip and slide all over - even if you are holding onto the baby with one hand. I threw this tub out and purchased one with a net that snaps on over top of the tub. This is MUCH better and safer since it cradles the baby while bathing. Once he or she is old enough to sit up without support, you can take the net off and use the plastic tub like a regular baby bath tub. Safety 1st also makes this kind for roughly $15.
