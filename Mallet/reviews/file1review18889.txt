review/text: This cover was purchased for our baby's bathinette which is housed in a bathroom. We like to cover the bathinette which is vinyl with a changing pad. The surface is very slippery when wet. Wet baby, wet surface make a dangerous area for baby. The terrycloth is perfect because after after bath, it soaks up the water and the surface is not slippery at all.
