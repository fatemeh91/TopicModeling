review/text: we got this as a gift about 3 months ago. i use it everyday, all the time. it works great for cleaning off dishes to go into the dishwasher. i was worried it would use to much dish soap. we have only filled it three times. i take the sponge off, and throw it in the dishwasher to sanitize it. i have been using this product daily for 3 monthes now, and it is just now needing to be replaced. i would highly reccommend this product. i can think of nothing negative to say about it.
