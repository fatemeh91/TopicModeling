review/text: I have been using two of these braces for the last two years. Prior to using these braces, I had resorted to using neoprene style braces from one of the big box sporting good stores. I always found the neoprene braces uncomfortable, smelly, and too damn big. I am a runner, cyclist and skier with a meniscus tear on each knee. I love this product. It is light, comfortable, easy to put on, and easy to remove. The fabric is very comfortable, and they are surprisingly supportive. I will buy new replacements soon.The price is great too! Make sure you get the correct size. MEASURE don't guess!
