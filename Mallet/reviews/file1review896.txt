review/text: This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more. The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.Ingredients: Rice, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and black pepper.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave. Can also be used on lower back if you are laying in bed on your side because of the shape of the product.~The Rebecca Review
