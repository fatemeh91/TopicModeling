review/text: This fiber works as promised, it fully dissolves in water (or any other liquid that you may choose) and does not have any flavor or &#34;grittiness&#34; that some other fibers do. I was originally given a can of this product by my Doctor who had just ordered some and I have already ordered more. It does what it says it will do at a reasonable price.
