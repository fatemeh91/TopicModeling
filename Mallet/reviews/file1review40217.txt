review/text: Colgate is one of my favorite toothpaste brands. However, I think this time, they've mixed together too many different ingredients. I haven't used it long enough to give it an honest opinion. Perhaps the peroxide whitens your teeth over time, and the paste controls tartar. It just didn't leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean like other toothpastes that I've used.
