review/text: I used the size guide from the seller, but the wrap is too large - it slides down. (I'm not sure if this is a size issue or a design issue.) But in order to exchange it for another size, I have to pay to ship it to them and they will charge to ship another to me. Since I can't be sure that the smaller size will work I didn't want to invest another $14 to make an exchange.
