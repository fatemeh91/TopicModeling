review/text: It worked very well for about 2 weeks. I followed the heating directions (30 seconds then 10 second increments). The shape is great if you carry stress in your shoulders that radiates up the neck. Stayed warm for about 20-30 minutes. Never too hot for direct contact with skin. After 2 weeks of use (maybe 1-2 x per day) it bubbled up while in microwave at 22 seconds. The smell was toxic and the wrap ruined. Will not risk it again and now searching for more stable wrap.
