review/text: This COVER IS GREAT FOR THICK PADS. But NOT SO GOOD FOR THE ONES THAT COME WITH THE CHANGING TABLES. I have a 3-4 in. thick contour changing pad upstairs and this works Great,..Because where the slits are for the restraining belt to go through fits good. This is because the pad is thick and the straps are more towards the outside edges of the table. However downstairs I only have the 1 in. pad and the location of the slits in the COVER make the straps be in the center of the table and I always to move them out of the way before I can put the baby down.
