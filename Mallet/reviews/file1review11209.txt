review/text: This is my first Amazon review after being a loyal customer for years. However, seldom you come across a products that is so clearly broken, It has compelled me to write the review.Do not buy this product - It DOES NOT measure temperature with ANY accuracy - I got 97.4, 99.7 and 98.1 when regular instrument shows 99. I returned first one and tries second piece - Same exact problem!To me selling this product is a fraud. I am henceforth skeptical of Vicks as a brand. They must have poor quality control.
