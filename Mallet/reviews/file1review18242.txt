review/text: I was skeptical of this product, but having read the rave reviews, thought I'd try it. I've been taking it for a week now, and I have had no stomach cramping or diarrhea. I can eat like a normal person. I've dealt with this so long that I had almost forgotten how nice it was to just eat dinner and not get sick afterward. I would hesitate to give the title "Wonder Drug" but this one certainly deserves it in my book. If you suffer with IBS, you owe it to yourself to try it.
