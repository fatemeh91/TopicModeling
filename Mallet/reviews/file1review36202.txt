review/text: This thing is heavy which makes it a bit difficult to use when cutting your own hair especially holding a mirror with one hand. The 20.00 cutter at Rite Aid is easier to handle.Also, the smallest length attachment doesn't line up with the metal cutters and it has some burrs on it which tend to scrape the scalp a bit.Buy the cheap model and replace the whole shaver when dull.
