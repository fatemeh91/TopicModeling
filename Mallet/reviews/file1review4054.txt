review/text: This razor system does not give a close enough shave for me. The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all. They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me and I don't think its the case for most people. Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving. I now use the Norelco 8150XL electric shaver exclusively and it works like a charm every time.
