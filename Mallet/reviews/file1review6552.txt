review/text: I had tried my friend's TheraCane for shoulder and neck pain and after reading the reviews, I chose the Body Back Buddy instead. I like the extra knobs and the fact that it has a more pointed knob and rounded knob for different amounts of pressure. I do not regret my decision or the few extra dollars the Body Back Buddy costs, although the TheraCane works well too. It is quite a conversation starter when people see it sitting on my couch. My friend who has fibromyalgia and my Aunt who is a hairstylist and has back pain both thought it was helpful. I have finger numbness and shoulder and neck pain and the BBB has helped a lot. I also use it on my feet when they are sore. It's my husband's new best friend, because I'm not constantly asking him to rub my shoulders or my feet.
