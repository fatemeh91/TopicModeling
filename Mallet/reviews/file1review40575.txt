review/text: I purchased this product at a local store. After I read the reviews at Amazon.com, I almost returned it. However, I thought to myself, I didn't spend too much on it. If I didn't like it, I would use it for other purposes.I have used this dish gel for more than a month now. I actually love it. It cleans very well, better than other green products I have ever tried. It leaves my dishes shiny and spotless. I do take the advice from other reviews here. I only fill it to one line. It only takes a little to clean a full load. I have perfect results with every load. It doesn't leave any scent on my dishes, which is what I prefer. I will buy this product again and again.
