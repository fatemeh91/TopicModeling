review/text: When I began having some heart pain during the day I thought it might be heartburn or something else. But it continued and my doctor had recently told me I had high cholesterol. I am taking a medication which causes high cholesterol so I wondered if I had Angina. I had a bottle of this Coenzyme Q10 which I had forgotten about. I decided to start taking it to see if it would make a difference. Within weeks my heart pain went away.Angina is a condition where the heart doesn't get enough oxygen. So if you don't have enough Coenzyme Q10 you can experience circulatory problems. Since Angina can predict a heart attack you should see your doctor to discuss your health. This is a natural treatment but many doctors agree that it is helpful for heart problems. I just know that my experience with this supplement was positive. I have only been taking the 30 mg capsules but will now start taking slightly higher dosage.If you decide to take this product I take no responsibility for your health.
