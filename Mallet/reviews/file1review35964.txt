review/text: I have purchased other bee pollen from one of my favorite brands but this one tastes WAY better. I also feel a peace of mind knowing it is organic. Love it and shipment time was wonderful.If you have read about the health benefits of bee products and are considering bee pollen, the flavor of this one is worth the price, hands down. It is a smidge sweeter and the texture is better, too. Hope this helps.
