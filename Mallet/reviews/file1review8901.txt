review/text: I ordered this because I don't always plan aheaad enough to have a daily salad and large servings of vegetables with each meal. I have tried it in smoothies, as well as mixed with a small serving of orange juice. The taste is "green" but not bad - I can barely taste it in a smoothie with a banana and different fruits. My toddler even drank some of it!!The container says it is best stored in the freezer, so that is what I do, and I have one serving daily. I have noticed that I have more energy when I drink it, and what excites me the most is that combined with other steps (including cooking with water more ofen - steamed food instead of high-heat methods), my skin texture and overall vibrance has improved. A LOT. I will continue to use this product, well worth the price.
