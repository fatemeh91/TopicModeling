review/text: I bought this epilator after using an Epilady for a couple of years (off and on), and I'm very pleased with it. Of course it's painful, if you've never used one before, but after even one use it gets easier. I liked that I could finish both legs a lot quicker than when I was using my Epilady. The cord is the only drawback (I was used to a cordless), but really it's only a minor detail. Good choice for an epilator.
