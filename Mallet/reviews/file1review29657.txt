review/text: I found the Avent pads to be quite comfortable. They don't slip around in my bra, and they are very absorbant. However, I have found that for overnight protection I need to use disposable pads. Overnight leakage was just too heavy (and for a longer period of time) for the reusable pads to keep up with. But for daytime use, I love the Advent pads; they're soft, comfy, and indiscreet, even under t-shirts.
