review/text: I have eczema primarily on the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands. I haven't had a severe breakout in the past two years, but at its worst, it took several prednisone treatments to get it under control. Once under control, I was using a product by Ferndale Laboratories called SBR-Lipocream (skin barrier cream). I used the SBR cream mainly after showering (hydrating the skin, and sealing in the moisture), and it worked great to keep my eczema under control. Ferndale has discontinued that product (though they have newer products that I have not tried). When I was looking for a replacement, I ran across good reviews of Psorzema Cream and decided to give it a try. My eczema is mild compared to others, but I have to say that this is the best creme I've tried (and I've tried many). Not only does it quickly clear up my minor breakouts, it immediately relieves the itching. I've bought many many items through amazon, and been happy with every purchase, but this is the first purchase that compelled me to write a reivew. I've been using Psorzema for the past 6 months, and highly recommend.
