review/text: Vibrant Health - Green Vibrance, 22.43 oz powderI have been using this powder pretty much daily for awhile now - at least a year. All I can say is that I notice a difference within a few days if I stop taking it. I'm using Green Vibrance as my main source of supplementation and save money by no longer purchasing vitamins the way I formerly did. (I have come to the conclusion that vitamins in pill or capsle form don't get processed anyway.) My only complaint is that this powder is rather nasty tasting and can be hard to get down without some sort of sweetener. It can be a little difficult finding a beverage to use with it if you are trying, like I am, to stay away from juice. Yet, the benefits of this product far outweigh this inconvenience. I use Green Vibrance with powdered vitamin C. This combination seems to be, for me at least, a good boost for the immune system.
