review/text: Blistex Lip Infusion was recommended to me by one of the girls in the pharmacy. I'm glad she did. It does everything it promises. My lips feel lush and wet, dryness is instantly relieved. It's not just a topical coating, I feel the penetration. The wetness lasts and lasts. I instantly became a convert after one use and now it's the lip moisturizer I search the stores for.
