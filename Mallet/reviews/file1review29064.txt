review/text: This is a fine razor and my hubby is still using it over 3 years later, so we would really recommend it. As I am a great Amazon shopper and was doing some (neglected) reviewing, I thought I would let those considering purchasing this razor know that it has lasted a good while and that he has been pleased for years with it. Braun is a high quality manufacturer and this razor is easy to clean, not too noisy and gives a decent shave. It is a bit pricey but well worth it now as it has lasted him for a long, long time. We recommend it highly!
