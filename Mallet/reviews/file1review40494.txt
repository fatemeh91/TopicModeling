review/text: A good protein powder nutritionally, but for taste, not as versatile as others I've tried. With blueberries, big disappointment (similar to the strange, fake taste of Designer Whey's Vanilla), but pretty nice blended with cinnamon and peaches or bananas, and strawberries spiked with ginger.
