review/text: I like this product, but don't feel it does any better job than what I had been using before. It is hard to find powder HE detergent for my front loading machine, so this was a nice find. The fragrance is strong, but not objectionable. One box will last a VERY long time as I only need about 1 Tablespoon of detergent per load as I have soft water.
