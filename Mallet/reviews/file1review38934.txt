review/text: I can't see what all the hype is about these razors. I bought a large quantity thinking they would blow my old razor (Gillette Venus) out of the water. Big mistake. To me these are no different then cheap bics. Initially I was cutting myself constantly, which was never a problem with the Venus. Then the razor burn which was so unbearable that I had to slather my legs in aloe for relief. The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they didn't even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs. So I don't know if I just got bad batch of cartridges or what, but I think for people who have really sensitive skin this is a total waste of money! Back to Venus!
