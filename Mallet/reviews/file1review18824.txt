review/text: I started taking this supplement before I was pregnant with my first child and found that it gave me an extra boost to my memory and just a general sense of well-being. When I became pregnant I made sure it would be okay to take while pregnant and got the green light from my OBGYN, so I took it every night before bed. I gave birth to a very healthy baby boy and continued taking it on a regular basis, even while nursing. When we were out of the MineralRich I'd notice a difference in decreased production while nursing, but once I'd get my next dose, then everything was back to normal. My son has grown to be a very bright student (top of his class) and as a toddler he was even saying our phone number when he was two years old (unpracticed)!Both of my kids were raised on this and have thrived in every way. My teenage daughter is very athletic and health-concious and has begun to take this as part of her after workout vitamin regime.I'm VERY happy with this product and have been taking it since 1996. I was disappointed that my local GNC stopped carrying it and they started to sell a different version of it instead, but it wasn't the same. Now that I've found it on Amazon I'll hopefully never have to go without it or have to use other wanna-be versions of this product again. Thank you Maximum Living for making this product, my family loves it!
