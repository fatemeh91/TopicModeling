review/text: I lost one on a plane. I still have one and just bought another. I like the ability to change the inflation. They last a long time. The only negative is that the labels tend to wear off quickly, which doesn't bother me. Note that all air pillows change firmess on airplanes as altitude and cabin pressure change.
