review/text: Great idea. But this company could spend a few cents more to put a good no-slip slider buckle on the strap where it adjusts. A few cents more. A touch of thought and quality where it counts. Nope. Shame. I hope to use it, but will always worry about pulling the strap through. I have other items with the proper buckle, and they work fine, no slip under most any condition. Hoping it holds when I need it.
