review/text: I had a laser vein procedure which causes severe bruising afterwards. I had the first leg done without using this product, and had bruising which was very painful and long lasting, several weeks after the procedure. For the second leg I started taking the pellets 2 days before the procedure, then for as long as the bruising continued thereafter, plus used the gel directly on the bruising and was amazed to find 1. much less bruising resulted, 2. the bruising that I did have was less painful 3. the bruising went away much more quickly. This is good stuff!
