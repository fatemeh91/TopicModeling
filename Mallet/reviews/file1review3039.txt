review/text: I'd read that these condoms run wider than normal, so I thought I'd give them a try, figuring if it worked for the average porn star, my little guy would do fine... Not quite the case, unfortunately... the fit was too snug, to the point where I couldn't climax until I'd removed the condom... I guess I can enjoy the idea that I'm thicker than most porn stars, but that doesn't help prevent STD's.The size not working out for me isn't the condoms fault, though... All other aspects of this condom were just fine... I liked the lack of condom odor and the lack of the typical greasy/oily feeling most condoms have was nice. (this was precisely what I'm looking for) Structural integrity seemed sound. Even though the condom was extremely tight, it still did not rip.My search for a non-lubricated, odor free condom for larger than average guys continues! but if you're not packing a soda can, these could be great for you.
