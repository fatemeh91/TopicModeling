review/text: First off, I usually have tightness in my shoulders and neck (probably from spending too much time in front of a computer all day at work). I also have stiffness in my lower back from time to time. The BBB is really effective at reaching all my knots and bringing relief through hitting those pressure points (on the neck, upper and lower shoulder blade, and all along the spine). What makes it so good is that when you position the "ball points" on those areas, the tool is designed so that you can use just modest leverage to get to the deep tissue. This is key because you can use this for quite a while and not get tired. I can't stress the importance of this enough. I find that with proper positioning, I can really get a lot of pressure by simply using my arm weight with modest effort.Also, I find that with some practice you can actually slide the ball points along your tight areas, which more effectively mimics a real massage vs. just getting point pressure (which I find brings less relief). For instance, by gently laying on top of the bbb (facing up), I can get a very deep lower back massage - and all by myself!The bbb is also very sturdy. Takes a little bit of experimentation to get used to it, but all in all, it's one of my favorite self-massage tools and I would highly recommend it.
