review/text: Great exercise drink, energy lasts much longer than fast acting carb drinks like gatorade. I've tried many others & this is easily the best tasting, longest lasting carbs, no weird unwanted ingredients, no caffiene & no artificial sweetners. if you're loking for a good, drinkable pre, post or during workout carb drink, this is it. I use the Orange flavor only, cant speak to any others.The flavor is really good... However, if you use the full 4 scoops it is VERY sweet. But the 4 scoops is 400 calories & way more than I need or would want from a carb drink in one serving. I typically use 2 scoops for a good, not too sweet drink mixed with approx 24 ox of water. There is no aftertaste whatsoever. For a really great tasting drink, mix a little orange gatorade with it.
