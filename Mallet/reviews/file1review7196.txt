review/text: Pros: large size, heating element, air jetCons: water spill, airjet too strong, no temperature control.I received it as a gift. It has a nice large size and should be large enough for average or slight large feet. It is good to get a heated foot spa. But whenever you turn it on, the airjet started running, either low of high speed. But even the low is still strong and often time water would run all the way over the splashguard and spill outside the spa. So you'll have to use your feet to block the airjet. The heater works, but you'll have to turn it on and off and there is no constant temperature control.What I really want to see if a foot bath that has a constant temperature control and have more gentle setting on the air jet. Or make the front end of the splashguard larger to block the jetted water.I'll give it an average rating.
