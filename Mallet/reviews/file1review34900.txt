review/text: Melatonin Time Release helps you to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep through the night. However, don't take it unless you do have 8 hours to sleep or somewhere close to it. If you do, you will feel groggy when you get up in the morning. I highly recommend it for people who have trouble sleeping.
