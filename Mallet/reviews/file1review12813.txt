review/text: I have been trying to find a good hot/cold face mask that stays on the face (as opposed to the bean bag style ones). I get occasional migraines and insomnia and pretty frequent headaches and sinus pain. This one got good reviews so I thought I'd try it. It arrived 4 days after I ordered it and both the heat and the cool are really soothing. It stays on my head with the velcro straps and seems like a good product. I also like that it's made in the US. I was originally looking for an aromatherapy mask but instead opted for the Aura Cacia lavender mist to use on the outside of the mask and the 2 together are sooooo lovely.
