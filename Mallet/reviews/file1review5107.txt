review/text: I have been buying the Cookies & Cream flavor of this protein powder for the last year or so and was so thrilled that I finally found a protein powder that I enjoyed drinking, even mixed with just plain water (as I do it most of the time). The C&C was the best flavor ever. Anyway, I tried the Vanilla Cake Batter flavor just to see, and found it to have an overwhelming "coconut" aroma and flavor that I don't care for. I'm very sad that Essential Naturals has apparently discontinued Cookies & Cream, it's a very sad day...
