review/text: I'm 30 years old and we have been trying for more than a year. My first test showed sperm count of just 50 thousand which is practically zero. My urologist gave me Clomid 50mg and it improved my testosterone pretty good however it didn't improve my sperm count much. The sperm count after 4 months was just 1 million and it didn't improve from there. I've been taking Fertility blend for more than 9 months and there was no improvement. Finally after 6 months my urologist asked me to go for ultrasound and the test showed that I've had a medium size varicocele. I've scheduled Varicolectomy surgery in October and boom my wife was pregnant in January. Within 76 days of surgery, my wife became pregnant. We can't express our happiness in words. My semen analysis after 3 months of surgery showed 12 million count. So we believe it's a mix of miracle and varicolectomy surgery, that helped me. I've changed so many things to improve my sperm count like taking organic green tea, Maca powder, L-arginine, Horny goat weed with maca, gozi berries and most important of all Fortege tablets by Alarsin company (herbal product from India which my herbal doctor uncle personally vouched for it, so ordered them through ebay). I strongly believe that this Fertility blend won't work on it's own if you have a problem like Varicocele and it's the dominant cause of all infertile men. So my sincere suggestion is please go see your urologist and ask him to prescribe testicle ultrasound, this test will tell you the most important things about your reproductive health. I always want to make it clear that this Fertility blend didn't give any side effects also so it may be safe to take these but don't rely 100% only on it.
