review/text: I was one of those very happy customers with this product until I went to buy the second round of filters (probably a year and a half ago). I thought maybe places were out of them or something and was able to get them via Graco directly. Now I sent them a message this morning via email and got a really bizarre response that if I want to buy any product from them or their sister companies, I can get a $20 rebate? That doesn't help me with my diaper pail! I'm about to have my second child and am stumped for what type to get now. This was a great product, so why they stopped making them is beyond me - there is NO diaper pail that gets rave reviews across the board, so why stop making this one? Just shaking my head. Maybe more reviews on amazon will help some poor schmuck from buying one off another site. I always come to amazon for product reviews, so maybe this will help someone.
