review/text: Just ordered two sets of six (free shipping) for the Easter bunny to give my husband.The last place around here to carry it was Target, was there today, nope, nada, none.Thought about trying Axe but I really don't know what Twist, Excite, or Kilo (kilo, really?)is supposed to smell like. Glad I could find it somewhere.
