review/text: Soil organisms for human consumption have had very little study in the USA and in Europe they are strictly regulated for use only in livestock. I took this product for a few years, and I think it may have contributed to the severe bacterial overgrowth of my small intestine. Do a lot of research before taking any probiotic as not all strains are suitable for everyone. The exception is possibly acidophilus, and even bifidus can become pathogenic in immune compromised people. I feel this product should be pulled until further research is done on it.
