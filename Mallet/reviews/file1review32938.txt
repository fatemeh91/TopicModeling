review/text: I ordered this item, however the merchant told me it cannot be shipped to my country.They offered me to select a different product.They didn't have the second one I picked,, but from a third try wefinally found a product they can ship.It arrived quicky and everything is ok.Two cons:- it would be better if condoms are packed in some bag and not just put in an envelope- product they send me is cheaper than the one I initially ordered and I was charged for thepricier one. I asked if I'll get few condoms extra cause I pay them more, but I got no reply
