review/text: This is awesome stuff. My son drinks most of it, but I've had a taste and it's good. We make shakes every day, we add it to our waffle batter, etc. It's good stuff. You'll like the taste and it's good for those of you doing body-building, etc. My 24-year old daughter is "not dating" this guy that comes over to our house every day except for Sundays when he does laundry and who just happens to be a body builder. Trust me. This "just a friend" is well developed. He uses the same exact brand and flavor (this particular flavor is cookie dough). My son and my daughter's "not-a-boyfriend-but-we're-just-very-good-friends" both love the stuff.Hence, I recommend it.Edit October 2012My daughter finally married this guy. I don't know if this product had anything to do with their going from "just friends" to newlyweds, but you never know?
