review/text: After Knee surgery I was at a loss to put a sock on my foot. Not wanting to be dependent on someone's help I went looking for a solution. The Kingman Sock Aid is a great and easy to use device that really works and gives you back some self reliance. Priced right, easy to use, and does the job.
