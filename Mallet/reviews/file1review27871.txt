review/text: Overall I do like the product. It has just the right amount of protien at 24g, 3g Carbos and no sugar. It mixes very easily in cold water with no lumps. I would buy again if they would get rid of or greatly reduce the sweetener. The sucralose sweetener is just way too much and makes me almost gag!! I really would prefer this product with a no sugar option.
