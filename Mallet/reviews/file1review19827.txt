review/text: We like simple designs, things that look as normal as possible, considering what it is! My kid didn't need a pink polka dot toilet seat to want to toilet train, but if that would help yours, by all means get the pink one! I say whatever makes the process easier is what you should do. That is why I purchased a total of 3 of these when I realized my daughter preferred these to the little stand alone potties. Suddenly it became important to have one on each floor of our house, and one in a travel bag that we keep in the car. We just use a large tote bag when we go out and use this on public toilets, then clorox wipe it down afterwards. From our research, those portable ones are flimsy, often don't fit correctly, pinch tiny tushies, etc., etc. So we've found this to work well on just about every toilet out there, and it's reliably sturdy and familiar for our kid to feel at ease whenever and wherever she may need to use it. So with 3 of these items, you could say we are fans.
