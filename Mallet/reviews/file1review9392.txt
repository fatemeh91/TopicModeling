review/text: I take a lot of vitamin pills and this organizes them very well. I particulary like the two compartments, one for AM and the other for PM, as often I don't want to take all the pills at once. Another feature I love is the rounded shape of the capsules - very convienient to plug into your pocket and take it to work etc. In fact, I have onein my pocket now and must take my pills :)Only downside is that they can be misplaced easier but with a little viligance these will last
