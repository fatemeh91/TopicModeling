review/text: I used this product to get rid of an ulcer in my esophagus, so I took my mother off Nexium and put her on DGL and it healed up the ulcers in her stomach.The gastroenterologist said her stomach has never looked so good, and he has been treating her for 20 years. He said, "whatever you are doing it is working." This stuff will cure and keep away ulcers! She still takes one everyday for maintenance and likes the chocolate flavor.
