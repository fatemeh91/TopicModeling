review/text: Do not buy this product, at least not until you find it in a store and try the fragrance. The smell is VERY strong and overwhelming. Contains a lot of alcohol and fragrance; not just natural ingredients. On top of it all, you can not return it because it is classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases and cannot be returned to Amazon.com.
