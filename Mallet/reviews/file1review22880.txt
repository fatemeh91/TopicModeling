review/text: This is an awesome product to have in an apartment! I am a college student and do not particularly enjoy cleaning. But with this BISSELL sweeper, you don't have to plug it in or worry about the sound at all. It's perfect because it works on both carpets and wood floors, so only one unit is needed for both surfaces! Definitely worth buying!
