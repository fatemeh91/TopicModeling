review/text: Bought this for my son after his old one finally gave out. The old one was larger, so it took a little time to figure out where to put all the supplies in this one. We like the smaller size, fits better in backpack, less obvious when carried into restaurant,..etc. Not too small and not too big. These are sturdy, and our original one lasted a really long time.
