review/text: I've been carrying this with me for a few weeks and have now used it for all of it's suggested purposes, including an actual panic attack.It did NOT stop my panic attack. I think it works for people who have never taken a RX medicine for panic. I have been prescribed meds in the past for anxiety and panic & I guess I expected too much of this product.The taste is like alcohol too, which I don't care for. It's 24% alcohol so that's to be expected.As far as day to day stress/anxiety I guess it was ok. If you have severe panic/anxiety, this is NOT for you.
