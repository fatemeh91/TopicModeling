review/text: I bought MineralRich for 2 reasons: to put minerals in my body for healthy living and for hair growth. I saw on a youtube video that it helps promote hair growth. Well, after taking this liquid vitamin for a month just as directed, I will say that no, I did not experience an energy boost like some other reviewers claimed nor did I experience significant hair growth. I gave this product 4 stars because I imagine that it did more good to my body than harm. Not likely to purchase again though because I like to actually see results and I didn't see any changes with this $30 liquid vitamin.
