review/text: I'm not sure why other reviewers say that these bars are bad tasting. They are among the best tasting I have ever had. Furthermore, they are like eating a candy bar. I will say that I do not care for the cookies and cream variety. But these Peanut Butter bars are absolutely the best on the market.
