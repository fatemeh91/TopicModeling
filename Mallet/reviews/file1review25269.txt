review/text: We have had Sennheiser battery's in our family for 6 years and they are not worth what one can get for a battery . Just look at the improvements on you cell phone battery Li-Ion. What has Sennheiser done for their battery's? NOTHING . They have a great product but languish on still making money on a lousey battery. We think they should switch to AAA battery's and it will be a better deal for all of us. Sony will be our next headphone set that my wife wants for Christmas.RD Varin
