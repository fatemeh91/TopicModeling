review/text: I do Protein Sparing Modified Fasts, which are pretty restrictive, so the things you can eat, you want to taste good.I've been through at least 10 different protein powders, and they all have their own explanation of why they beat all the others. They also all claim to taste THE BESTEST!!!11!1. They don't. Some of them are downright disgusting.Granted, I am not a weight trainer or an athlete, just someone with whom sugar does not really agree and who wants to lose weight. PSMFs are fast, effective, and nixing the sugar makes me feel a thousand times better. Because I'm not looking for any specific nutritional punch, just something for a meal supplement, my main concerns are carb count, protein quantity and taste.The carb count is low. Just a couple of grams per serving.The protein count is higher than a lot of others, which range from 16 to 20 on average. This one has 25.The taste is great! Don't get me wrong, I much prefer the taste of a rich, thick, sinful vanilla or chocolate shake, but for what it is, this stuff is really good. There is no grainy texture, no lumps, no aftertaste, and even in water (with just a tablespoon of cream for richness... yes, I know that's cheating on the PSMF, but I do it anyway and it still works) it rivals a pretty good glass of chocolate milk. This was for the chocolate malt flavor. I have the vanilla but I haven't gotten into that one yet.GNC had it on sale for 25.99 and knowing what it tastes like now, I'll likely go grab a couple more tubs of it.
