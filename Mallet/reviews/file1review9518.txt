review/text: I've been taking these pills for about 2 months now, for my brittle nails. I usually have little hope for vitamin supplements, but after about three weeks I noticed that my nails were much stronger. Even better, in the past week I've really noticed a change in my face. My pores are almost completely unclogged. My skin is smooth and soft. Since I've noticed the difference, I've started taking the pills three times a day, instead of once. Things can only get better. I totally recommend these! Really! At least worth a try :)
