review/text: Folks come on my Grandmother always told me you get what you pay for, what did you expect for under five dollars. I too ordered one, not the greatest, but I expected that because of what I paid for it, I am not going to be shocked or surprised when the emblem breaks, or you can't read what it says on the back. I did not buy it to impress anyone. I just want the authorities to know that I am a diabetic, if I can't tell them myself. My main gripe with this company, is that the item was backordered, and no one told me, so after about three weeks or so after the due date I became concerned (NOT TOO CONCERNED ONLY 5 BUCKS), but none the less they told me "OH YEAH THAT HAS BEEN OUT OF STOCK ON BACK ORDER WE SHOULD BE GETTING THEM IN SHORTLY" It would have been nice to know this before I became worried.....Bottom line you get what you pay for..............
