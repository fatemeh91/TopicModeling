review/text: The handle pieces really could have been better made. Such as the way a certain floor duster handle has interlocking pieces at each end so that once the piece is in place, it is locked. My Bissell handle has not managed to stay together, even after striking against a hard surface as the instructions suggest. Disappointed.
