review/text: Hi there,I am 24 years old and have been dealing with cronic constipation my whole life. I am currently doing colon hydrotharapy and wanted something to help speed up my recovery.If you dont know what colon hydrotharopy is I deffenetly would recomend it for those who deal with cronic constipatoin. But I found oxy- powder on amazon and on lots of other sites and saw it had good reviews so thought id try it out. I took 4 tablets at told and that night and will admit my tummy was rummbling from the oxygen doing its thing. And by the next morning I had 3 bowl movements within a hour. And what I loved is that it wasnt that painfull type of urgency that I got with other cleansers. It was just a little movement that I felt and knew I needed to go but I could hold it if I had to. So it was great for when I was at work and could not make it to the restroom in short amount of time. I would recommend this product to everyone, But again everyones intestines are different. So you might not experience what I did. But like I said for ppl with lazy bowels, this stuff works!
