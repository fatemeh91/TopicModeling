review/text: Sturdy, quick, efficient and uses no electricity or dreaded batteries! We have a powerful central vacuum, several a/c vacuums and several irobot (battery powered), vacuums. My wife would forsake them all for her Bissell push sweeper. She is now buying them for gifts. It really is handy and does a great job. It gets into the carpet nap better than you would expect. I would not recommend using this for a whole house or very large areas, but for spot, area and quick cleaning, it's great. Well built and fairly priced too.
