review/text: When I was piping the henna on it seemed fine but it started cracking and drying very quickly even though I kept putting lemon juice on it. After around 4 hours I got a very light stain that is now fading after only a few days! I wouldn't buy this brand again:( I have a lot left so perhaps adding some lemon juice or some kind of oil to the paste before applying it will help the end results. There wasn't a problem with shipping or charging so thats not the issue just the actual henna itself (imagine that!). So I recommend not buying this paste.
