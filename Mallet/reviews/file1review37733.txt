review/text: These cones have a huge seam on one side that causes the henna to come out in a flat ribbon instead of a round strand. I asked for a return and they said to try cutting off more of the tip (but I wanted a thin strand so that wouldn't work) or taping the seam down. I tried the tape and it was better but still didn't come out in a nice round shape. For example, I couldn't make nice round dots with it. Then they said I could return it, but I had to pay the postage. Don't buy these.
