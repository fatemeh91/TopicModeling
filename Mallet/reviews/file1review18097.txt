review/text: very nicely made but only awarded 3 stars from me due to my big honking nose not allowing a tight seal thus allowing too much light to penetrate for my liking. If I had an average sized nose I can see myself being happy with this. I still use it on occasion when I really need it. As a night shift worker i would like to find an eye mask that has a wider back strap that doesnt interfere with my ears I can wear everyday. This is not it.
