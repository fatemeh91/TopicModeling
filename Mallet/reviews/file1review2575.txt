review/text: My wife saw one of these products on Sex in the City. After several conversations where it was casually brought up as part of a discussion we made the choice to purchase and try out the product to see what all the fuss was about.If you are use to small simple design vibrators that are a singular non-moving shaft then this vibrator may catch you off guard at first. There are two sections to the vibrator. The main shaft both rotates and vibrates. It consists of small balls and so it has an uneven texture. The smaller shaft on top consists of two pieces of silicone that vibrate rapidly together.Honestly, the first time we flipped on the vibrator we both laughed because we felt it was a little ridiculous. She also felt a little intimidated since it was something very new and, as she mentioned, there seemed to be so much with switches and moving parts going on.We slipped a condom over the main shaft as well as astroglide lubricant. Let me tell you my life LOVES it!She enjoys the vibration as well as the rotation being preformed internally. As if that is not enough, the smaller shaft vibrates rapidly across her clitorious. I have rarely seen her experience a full body orgasm where she ripped the bedsheets off while arching her body high in the air. This vibrator has helped us achieve that on several occasions now.The vibrator does make noise but it is not to the point it is loud and overbearing distracting from the situation. Also, it is great it runs on 3 AA batteries which makes replacement very easy but, with small batteries, the device does not last that long before you have to change them over.Overall, a much welcomed edition to the bedroom let it be for solo play or for partner use. A good step in the exploration of dual simulators.
