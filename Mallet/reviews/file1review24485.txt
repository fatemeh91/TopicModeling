review/text: Who would have thought a little gel pack could heal my toe and ball of foot pain. This really worked. I wore it every time I ran. And it works if you place it properly - you actually have to place it lower on the ball of your foot than you might think. It arrived on time and lasts. Just rinse it after each time you use it so that it sticks the next time.
