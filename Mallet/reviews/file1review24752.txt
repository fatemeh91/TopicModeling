review/text: I purchased these for my mom. She was intending to order socks that had a closed toe. Because she had no idea what "inspection toe" meant in the description, and one of the images showed a sock which does have a closed toe, she assumed it was the right product and I ordered it for her. When they arrived with a toe opening, I contacted the seller to return them. Not only do I have to pay for shipping but I also incur a 20 percent restocking fee! Essentially, I am only getting half of a refund all because the item description is not very clear. I noticed a few other reviews that say they had the same problem.
