review/text: I was recommended this product by a doctor. I then stupidly decided to read the reviews on it and was scared to death to take it. After my second visit, he reassured me that it was safe and that many members of his family use it also. Actually, everyone that I had asked personally about Dulcolax said that they didn't experience discomfort as it is described in so many reviews. I decided to take it, and when I did, I was so afraid that I wouldn't let myself sleep for the next 9 hours. I noticed a trend in the negative reviews. Everyone that had taken it had woken up in pain. They fell asleep after taking it. So I decided to do it a little differently and stay awake during the entire process. Well, to my surprise, I only felt pain in the upper part of my stomach for a short while, and then no more discomfort until 12 hours later. It just felt like the normal cramps you get with diarrhea. And then relief. My advice to anyone taking this would be to start off with 1 to see how your body reacts to it. Don't let a few frightening reviews stop you from getting some pretty decent constipation relief it you need it.
