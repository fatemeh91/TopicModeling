review/text: My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/D7Cgv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!He told me that Nattokinase works so effectively because it dissolves existing blood clots and fibrin while enhancing the body's production of plasmin and other fibrinolytic agents like urokinase. Researchers agree that nattokinase is 4 times as potent as plasmin and is significantly better than any prescription medication. It works for longer periods of time without any of the dangerous side effects associated with pharmaceuticals.One year ago I was hospitalized with deep venous thrombosis. My major veins were clotted shut from groin to heel in my left leg. I spent 6 months on Coumadin and was told that two thirds of my leg had not resolved but the Coumadin couldn't help any further and that I was doomed with post thrombotic syndrome/post phlebotic pain syndrome and venous insufficiency for the rest of my life. This is when I began to take the natto. In 3 months my high fibrinogen has dropped to a healthy level and the damaged leg is recovering with reduced VI and declining pain. Amazing!
