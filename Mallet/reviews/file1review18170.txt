review/text: I have had 3 of these masks now, in 3 different colors. The eye design is wonderful and comfortable in any position. I have never had a problem with the velcro closure on the back of my head. I sleep upright in a recliner due to neck problems. My issue with the mask is the lack of quality in the construction. This mask is apparently glued together around the edges. After 3 months of continuous use, the edges are pealing off. It looks like I have 2 masks on top of each other. I would buy this again if it were cheaper or put together better. I am now forced to find another alternative because I can't afford a new one every 3 months.
