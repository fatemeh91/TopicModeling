review/text: Ouch.Other reviewers have said that Swissco natural bristle toothbrushes are softer than regular nylon bristle toothbrushes, and that if you want a soft natural-bristle toothbrush, get one labelled "medium."Boy, are they wrong.After buying this brush, using it twice and then nursing a set of ravaged gums for three days, I decided it was better suited for cleaning small glass bottles and the nibs of my calligraphy pens. I am not putting it in my mouth again.I have since learned that Swissco toothbrushes are coded extra-soft, soft and medium, with medium being the hardest. I'd say the "medium" brush I bought was comparable in feel to the hardest "extra-hard" nylon bristle brush I've ever used, and since I wanted a soft brush, I should have opted for the one Swissco calls "extra-soft." Unfortunately, the wooden handled brushes only come with "medium" bristles.*Live and learn, I guess. But it would make more sense for Swissco to use a coding standard in accord with most people's dental hygiene experiences.Still, it is a lovely brush, warm yet minimalist, almost Japanese in its natural look and Zen-like austerity.*Softer natural bristles are available on Swissco's "tortoise" and "white horn" handled toothbrushes, both of which are actually plastic. This wood-handled "medium" bristled entity is the only all-natural toothbrush that Swissco makes.
