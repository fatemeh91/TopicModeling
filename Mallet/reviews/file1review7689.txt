review/text: When I ordered this product I had read reviews stating how well this stuff works....and they were right. All you need is one spray of this stuff and you are good to go. The smell is not offensive and it eliminates odors in a matter of seconds. I use it as a bathroom spray, but apparently this stuff is also used for intense situations such as decay etc..Overall, for an odor eliminator I give this product 5 stars!
