review/text: I had purchased a less expensive Hometics unit from Wal Mart that supposedly had heat & massage functions and was extremely disappointed. Hot water became room temp in minutes, the massage strength was very weak and the unit was not very deep and water would splash out. I returned that unit and bought this one after reading the reviews and am very pleased. The unit has plenty of room for my size 10 feet, the massage feature works fairly well, the remote control is a nice feature, and it has a long cord to make placement within the room convenient. As for the heat, wow, I have to turn it off after a few minutes as it actually gets too hot! I've had no problems with the drain plug as mentioned by other reviewers, and I've also drained the unit by simply removing the splash cover and tilting the unit. My wife and kids have used it and really like it as well. My only complaint is that you're not supposed to add bath salts, oils, etc as they may clog the jets. Overall a very good product. Cheaper models simply don't do the job.
