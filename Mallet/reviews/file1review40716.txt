review/text: I have used this product for at least a few decades and there a few things that have remained consistent over the years:1. It tastes and feels awesome. I never leave home without it!2. People always comment on how good I smell (the "fruitiness")3. Guys always comment on how they love the taste when they kiss me - from the time I was a teenager to my middle age years.4. It never fails to help me through my 'dry mouth' moments.It is the only product in my life that I could not bear to be without! The other flavors are ok, but the grape absolutely rules.Please buy this product so that you, too, can be a believer and then help make sure they never stop making it! :-)
