review/text: This stuff is just like any other protein powder I've had. The flavor selection is great compared to other brands and they don't taste terrible. I've had the chocolate mint and the strawberry banana and they're both good when mixed with rice or soy milk. My boyfriend and I buy the 5lb size and it lasts a very long time between the two of us.
