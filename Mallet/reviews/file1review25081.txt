review/text: I'm not sure what more you can say about a battery, other than "it works" or "it doesn't work". I had the original Yuasa battery on my alarm system since I built my house 18 years ago. I had to replace it for the first time just last month, and it works! I'd be happy if the new one lasts half as long as the first one did.
