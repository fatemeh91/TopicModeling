review/text: I bought these ice packs for relief from sore nipples from breast feeding. They are amazing!! I use a pair to heat in the microwave for before feeding to help let down. Then I use a frozen pair after feeding. I would highly recommend! After feeding is behind us, they'll be perfect for boo boos and lunch boxes!!
