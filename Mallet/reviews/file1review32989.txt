review/text: Persil Megaperls ColorGood stuff and as the other user said, if you do your math, it works out as comparable to Tide. Persil works better than Tide in front loaders because it does not clump in cold wash and dissolves completely. No perfume smell and treats colors gently. I have these no iron chinos with the stain guard and when we used Tide, they would wear out quickly - frayed cuffs and seams. My mother-in-law recommended changing detergents and since then no problems and the stuff cleans better than anything we have used in the past. Factory Direct is a very efficient seller as well.
