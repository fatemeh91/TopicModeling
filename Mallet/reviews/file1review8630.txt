review/text: For the price, I would have been happy with a product that was half as good. But the OXO scrub brush, with it's pretty ergonomic handle, allows me to clean without much of a hassle at all. It's bristles are also tough and will seemingly hold for a while. A product that very much continues to make me grow fond of the OXO brand!
