review/text: I'm 34 years old I've been struggling with Erectile Dysfunction for years. I have seen over 10 specialist and had at least a half dozen X-rays and MRI's. Nothing. It was suggested by my last and most prominent Urologist to get a prosthesis inserted. Not a great option for me, but one I was prepared to go through with.I tried this Imperial Elixer Korean Red Ginseng product after talking to a friend, low and behold after taking it for a couple days I started to feel a slight return of my erections. It's not all the way there by any means but to have any improvement for me is a big deal.I've made multiple changes in my lifestyle i.e. walking more, spending less time in front of a computer etc...but my improved condition i feel is a direct result of just beginning to take this product. I just wanted to share that in this space. I've only written a few product reviews before but I know how much value I get from reading other peoples reviews before i purchase products so I wanted to share my testimony with this product here. I'm a real person, definitely not a paid spokesmen.I have read that taking as much as 3 separate doses of 900mgs of this stuff a day (2,700 mgs a day?? Seems like alot) is a good dose and I've also read to NOT take Korean Red Ginseng for more then 3 months at a time. I have to find clarity on that but all I can say is that in the meantime, taking this product has given me the confidence that I can fix this situation without a surgery. For that I'm thankful and recommend it.If anybody knows anything about the 3 month at a time limit or the dose amounts, please respond.
