review/text: I was skeptical when I first purchased it because of the reviews from the products website. It seemed to good to be true. Well it was as good as everyone said. It is on the expensive side but well worth it. It softens the stool and the relief is amazing. No cramping or diahrea. No running to the bathroom all day. This stuff is amazing. I am going to buy more. I try to stretch it out as much as I can while still getting relief. You would not believe how much stuff is inside of you. Pay the extra and get this stuff.
