review/text: There is a lot of hype on the internet about these eye drops helping dissolve cataracts; they did not live up to any of the claims made about them. I have used over half of the product and there is no improvement whatsoever. They are sold as "lubricant drops"...if this is what you want, you can get others for a lot less money!
