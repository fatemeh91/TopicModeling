review/text: I've been using this product for over a week after having supply issues at 11months when i started working, it workds for sure, tastes like crap like everyone says, the only weird thing that i haven't read anyone else say is... my armpits smell diferent! like the maplely smell the product has... i tried taking the pills instead and the same thing happens, ut doesn't bother me that much i just find it funny
