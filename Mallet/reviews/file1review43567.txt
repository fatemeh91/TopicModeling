review/text: This review is for the HEM-711AC, with the "normal" cuff. First, getting the AC adapter was worth the extra small amount of money. We go through plenty of batteries in this house already! It will work with batteries if you want to make it portable, though. I struggled with the decision about the regular cuff, or larger "comfit" cuff. My biceps are 12.5" in circumference, just under the 13" limit for the regular cuff. Well, the regular cuff works just fine for me and although I've never taken it to the doctor's office, seems to give readings comparable to what I get there. It takes just a bit of practice, but now I get remarkably consistent readings from day to day if I take my BP at roughly the same time and IF I'm relaxed. One thing this machine has brought to my attention is just how much being stressed or anxious increases my BP. A LOT - maybe 20 points, both top and bottom. For around $43, this was a terrific value.
