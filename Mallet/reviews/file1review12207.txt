review/text: LITTLE UPDATE: I am giving 4 stars now when I pregnant, easiest on the stomach so far and no problem swallowing it but still "neon yellow" urine.I have been searching for good prenatal vitamins for a while now,(I am TTC not pregnant yet) these are forth prenatals I've tried. Thought I finally got what I needed, natural, once a day, great reviews.. After week of taking this vitamin not so sure anymore. First of all my urine gets "neon yellow" 2-3 h after taking the pill. This never happend with the previous ones and I am assuming that it has just too much vit B for me (I compared labels and this one has a lot more compering to my old ones) and maybe my body is getting rid of the "extra" or the old ones were junk and my body did not absorb anything from them and this is why now my urin is "neon crazy" now. Other than that do not feel much difference so probably will try sth new again after finishing them (got 30 tablets just in case). Also: I have tried "dissolving test" on this vit and it did not pass it. Hope there is something perfect for me out there!
