review/text: You definitely won't get any from this item. I started to wrap one of these bandages on my leg and my finger went right through the bandage!! The edges started to fray as soon as I tightened the bandage. I tried more than more thinking maybe it was just one bad one in the bunch, but no luck.Don't waste your money on these.
