review/text: After much shilly-shallying, I took the plunge and bought this set several months ago -- and for me, at least, it's worked out extremely well. I've been saving a bundle on regular haircuts by cutting my own hair; it's amazingly easy and also saves me time, as it takes just a few minutes to do. Note -- this is important -- that I keep my hair short all around (maybe a tad longer in the front), basically crewcut length, so there's not much art to cutting it. I started out, somewhat nervously, using the #8 black plastic attachment (which leaves hair the longest), but now use the #6. I simply stand in my bathtub (a DRY bathtub, needless to say; you want somewhere for the cut hair to fall that'll be easy to clean up) and clip my hair all around, occasionally looking in a cheap, light suction-cup mirror that I stick to the bathroom wall, but mainly doing it by touch. Now, it's possible that my friends have been lying to me or snickering behind my back, but -- at least to my face -- they all say they think my hair looks great. I have no idea how hard or easy it would be to cut hair if it were long and/or wavy; perhaps that would take more skill than I possess. But for my purposes, this electric clipper has been a great decision and has already paid for itself many times over.
