review/text: On Sept 27, 2010 I had my blood work done. Cholesterol was 244, LDL 157, HDL 65 and Triglycerides 109. I read an article from mens health magazine about supplements, and Cholestene was mentioned. A year earlier I tried Cholestoff which dropped my levels by a few points but nothing to get exited about so I stopped.After reading the article I decided to give Cholestene a try. I was retested on Dec 6, 2010 and my levels had decreased significantly. Cholesterol went down to 164 and LDL went down to 89.2. Unfortunately Triglycerides went up to 124 and HDL went down to 50 but they are still within a healthy range. I didn't start any exercises to speak of. I followed the instructions on the bottle and that was basically it. I reduced my daily caloric intake to 1500 - 1800 which also decreased my cholesterol intake as well. This will help to keep my levels low over the long run.
