review/text: I bought this for cat hair and dust, it works great for both but not so well for anything like sand or cat food. I would give it 5 stars but like other people said the handle is horrible the bottom screws in which is good but the two top parts just get placed inside each other. Without some crazy glue it will constantly fall apart.
