review/text: Like many others, I chose this product based on all the positive reviews about it. Not only were there more reviews for this product than for most of the other units, all of them were positive. Having bought and used it now, I have to agree. I am adding my recommendation to the others. It is a great product. Though it is a bit pricey compared to the many, many other models to choose from, I don't regret spending the money for it. It is everything I expected. It heats the water from room temperature, and maintains the temperature comfortably. The water jets are powerful, and the unit is relatively quiet. I have nothing but praise for this product.
