review/text: These insoles are great. I got them for Achilles tendon issues and they provide a little lift in the heel which helps (flats are too flat for me). They also give me arch support for my super high arches, which is nice since most flats have none. Because they are 3/4 length, they fit in all the shoes I need them for. You can move them from shoe to shoe. They come with little velcro things to help them stick in place, but you can also just use them without -- they don't really slip. Note that they are a hard plastic, so they are durable but not cushy. This is better for me with my tendonitis, but good to be aware of if you are looking for comfort.
