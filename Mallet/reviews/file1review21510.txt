review/text: I started using the Sonic Complete after my last dental checkup. At the time I was 3 months pregnant - as any dentist will tell you, your oral health tends to decline during pregnancy, due to various reasons. Already I had a lot of tartar buildup and some places to watch. Well, immediately after my check up I started using the Sonic Complete. I love that it times the brushing for you, 30 seconds per quadrant, so you do a thorough job. Last week I went back to the dentist for my 6-month followup, now 9 months pregnant, and anticipating the worst - but it was the best check up I've ever had. The cleaning was a breeze - I had hardly any buildup and everything looked great. The hygienist couldn't believe it, especially given my pregnancy, and agreed with me that it must be the toothbrush. So I'm hooked! I'll be ordering replacement heads now and will be having my husband start using it as well!
