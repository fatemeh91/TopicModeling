review/text: I was hesitant, but as cascade were no longer making the fragrance free actionpacs, and because we don't really mind the smell of lavender (= like the smell really!), we gave it a try. We don't use too much in the Bosch that we have and stuff comes out as well as with the actionpacs.If I were to review the dishwasher, I might suggest that *it* doesn't work too well, but this product seems as good as anything else we've tried. It is certainly about a thousand times better than the Seventh Generation powder that we used for a while!
