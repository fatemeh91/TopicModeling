review/text: Hi,I finally found something that my kid loves and is good for him.He is a very picky eater and this Balance Bar in the cookie dough flavor is something he will eat everyday. It also gives him the protein and vitamins his growing body needs. We have tried other flavors, but the cookie dough is the best!Thanks,Tony
