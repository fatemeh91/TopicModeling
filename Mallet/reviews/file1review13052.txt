review/text: My identical Elasto Gel is at least 5 years old (and cost twice as much b/c I bought it locally). I got this one was for my 90 year old mom. It is a WONDERFUL quick-fix for sore, achy shoulder/neck muscles. My mom LOVES it, so much that she brings it WITH her when she travels.I heartily recommend it: easy to use; inexpensive; and WORKS.
