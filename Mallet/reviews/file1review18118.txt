review/text: This mask is okay for flying, but not that great for sleeping (in bed). The velcro on the straps gets stuck in my hair, then pulls it. My biggest complaint, however, is the light that comes through the mask. Bright light will come through the nose slits and the material doesn't completely block all light (you will not have total darkness if wearing to sleep during day).
