review/text: Although AED's all perform the same, not everyone should buy one of these just "to have in case" without training. When a victim suffers cardiac arrest, it sometimes takes more than just delivering a shock to bring them back. One MUST be trained appropriately in CPR should the victim either not need to be shocked and/or to provide oxygen and circulation in between the stacked shocks. PLEASE contact either the AED Instructor Foundation (...), the American Heart Association, American Red Cross or other qualified organization to find a CPR instructor near you! As a Career Paramedic, CPR instructor and EMT instructor I know this first hand! AED's are WONDERFUL and I have seen them work, but ONLY with proper training!
