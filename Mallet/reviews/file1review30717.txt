review/text: Like most guys looking into this, I've used countless multi-blade razors over the years. They'd throw another blade on and I'd be in line waiting to try it out. In addition, I used (and am still using) quite nice shaving cream---1st Trumper almond, now Anthony Logistics---and a badger hair brush. I thought I had it all figured out. Then I started dabbling in a goatee. The multi-blade razors didn't give me the precision I needed, and that, more than a closeness/expense of razors issue led me to try this little number out.I'm never going back. The closeness is profound. Not only that, but there's much less irritation. I haven't had a razor bump since switching. And, although I nicked myself once, it was ONCE and hasn't happened again.There's been a lot of talk about a "learning curve" and something even about utilizing a 35 degree angle or some such junk. Really, you set it on your face (very little pressure) and you make short strokes along the grain of the hair. The angle comes naturally: when you're removing the hair, you're at the right angle.There's also been some complaints about difficulty changing blades. Um, no. Easy. It's a simple, elegant and effective system.What about increased time it takes to shave? After a week or so, it'll take as much or as little time to shave as it had with the Mach 3 or 4 or turbo or whatever razorasaurus that you've been using.Last thing, one review complained about the razor's small size. I've got size 8 hands. Big, but not weird big. The Classic razor's perfect. It's heafty and precise. I love it.
