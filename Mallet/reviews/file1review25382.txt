review/text: My doctor suggested a manual b.p. cuff and stethoscope. I thought I would try this first before making a larger investment. When I brought it into the doctor's office we did a side by side comparison with his manual cuff. This was nearly dead on. The difference in the readings were so minor as to be irrelevant. Even the doctor was surprised at the accuracy.
