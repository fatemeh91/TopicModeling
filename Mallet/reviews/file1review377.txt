review/text: of course the user will not likely remain quiet. haha. All kidding aside, this is a very durable, quiet, waterproof multitasking vibrator. It does everything but complain about cutting the lawn. One thing I feel sets this vibrator apart from some of the others is the rotating beads. Since they are attached to rotating rods they don't stop moving when they come into contact with you. In vibrators that have loose beads, when the beads become depressed by the vaginal walls they sometimes stop moving. They are no longer stimulating the vaginal opening. This is not the case with this vibrator. Enjoy and don't forget to keep extra batteries or better yet...rechargeables.
