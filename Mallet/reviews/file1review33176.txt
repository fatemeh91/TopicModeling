review/text: A friend of mine swore by these. I though she may have gotten a job with the company. Turns out she has made a believer out of more than a few people.I have been into health foods, vitamins and supplements for a long time. I don't get excited as easily as I used to. However this is a well made formula. It has helped my family and I get over some really bad coughs this year. There is definitely something to it. It contains the usually round up of echinacea and goldenseal, but it also has many other herbs and ingredients that must be proportioned very well.I certainly recommend these to anyone looking for an immune system boost. This is the capsule version. I think it delivers more of a punch than the tablet version. Keep in mind you do have to take 6 capsules while you only have to take 3 tablets. Also the smell is a bit strong and not that great. You can taste it more with the capsules. Otherwise this is a great supplement to take when you feel a little sickness coming on.
