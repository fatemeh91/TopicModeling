review/text: Pjur is always the go-to lube for me and my partner. It's never sticky, lasts a long time but is easily absorbed. It has no aroma and actually moisturizes, so it doesn't even need to be washed off. The only downside is that the bottle doesn't have a flip top--tough to put the cap back on when one hand is holding liquid lube. Pjur beats anything available in a brick-and-mortar store. Well worth the price and easy to order from Amazon, of course. Can't recommend this stuff highly enough.
