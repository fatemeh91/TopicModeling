review/text: I bought these to add to First Aid Kits at a school. The barrier is a thick plastic sheet with a hard plastic insert in the middle. Right out of the package, part of the plastic sheet is cracked at a fold. The insert is not a one-way valve, but does contain a filter. The lower portion of the insert is about 1 1/4" x 1 1/3" x 1/3" and is intended to be placed between the victim's teeth during CPR. On an adult this might work, but could cause delay placing the insert properly. My main concern would be in using this in a child's mouth, which would have more difficulty fitting between the teeth, and could also push back on the tongue. Overall, this is an inexpensive barrier that might work for adults, but a different design might be considered for all uses, especially for children.
