review/text: Holy Moly! This little mighty mouse vacuum really impressed me. I was hesitant on purchasing due to the mixed reviews but for the price it seemed like a good gamble. I took it out to clean up some cat litter and fur on the carpet and my tiled bathroom floor. It is loud but has incredible suction for the size. Sucked all the litter right up off the floor, from her litter mat, and from the carpet. I was super excited so I started vacuuming in the bathroom crevices, and lastly tested it out on throw on my bed that is always full of cat fur. Sucked it right up. I know this will work great getting my car cleaned up and any time I have a spill to clean up and don't want to drag out the vacuum. This is just what I needed. Perfect for a long haired cat owner with constant furry messes.
