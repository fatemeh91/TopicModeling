review/text: It came in a couple of days, way faster than what I paid for. The packaging is good, spoon is included (you may have to dig a bit for it, but it's there.)I gained 23 pounds in 3 months using this product together with their creatine. Highly recommended. The taste is, well, alright. It's not tasty or anything, but hey, it's protein powder.Buy the "Ultimate Shaker Bottle" if you're looking for a good shaker, only 4$ and will last you a long time.
