review/text: Highly recommended item, can't say enough for shurhold. Every item I own from them has been nothing but great. Instead of 10 separate cleaning items, I have a few brush heads that I store in my bucket, the expandable pole tucks away neatly in my gunnel rod holder and I have the gaff head along with the docking hook.
