review/text: The first time I brushed my teeth with Colgate with Baking Soda & Peroxide I didn't care for it - especially the taste. However, with each use, I changed my mind. I kept thinking of the benefits from the added baking soda and peroxide, which should help with fresh breath and whitening of the teeth. While it isn't my favorite toothpaste, I'd recommend it to my family and friends.
