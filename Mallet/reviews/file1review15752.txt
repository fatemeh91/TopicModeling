review/text: I'm very happy with this multi-function pen. I like its good looking especially black color. You can replace the ink with the stylus for your PDA. I also appreciate its multi function. I have a pen, a stylus and a pencil in one and it is not big. It is comfortable to my hand. The only thing that I don't like about this pen is about the ink. The ink ran out rapidly and it's expensive and difficult to find the refil. I use refils from Platinum brand and it fits with this pen perfectly.
