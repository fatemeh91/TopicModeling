review/text: I love this product and have been using it for years. And this is a great price. We use this as a family and it really zaps your colds. In fact I start taking it if anyone is sick in our family and I usually don't get sick or have very mild symptoms. My daughter is a CNA certified nursing assistant and she uses this and hardly ever gets sick. I am now taking this daily as a vitamin. I don't care for the capsules because you have to take so many of them. This tablet does taste strong and is large so if you have problems swallowing this might not be for you.
