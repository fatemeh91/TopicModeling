review/text: I love Aqua Velva and have used it over 20 years but I tell you the truth I hate your new 7 oz bottle of plastic or whatever it is, give me the glass one back. The new plastic spills more than you can use and there is no way you can control how much comes out and what you can capture in the palm of your hand. I really do hate the new bottle, can't you give us a choice of bottles in 7 oz size.
