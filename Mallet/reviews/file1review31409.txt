review/text: I purchased this tape to use for compiling music play books. I used it has a hinge to fasten together clear plastic protector sheets that contain my music. The music is filed in 3-ring binders. It works great! I have used the books every day and the tape is holding up very well with heavy use. It is easy to apply, and if you make a mistake, it is easy to remove and replace. Since my original project, I have used it to make labels on plastic ware stored in the refrigerator and freezer. It performs with excellence! It is also great for medical use in wrapping gauze bandages. It holds well and the bandages don't slip.
