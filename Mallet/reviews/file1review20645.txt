review/text: My order was placed with AmazonI received myModel 8595 foil and cutter block yesterday. The original ones that came with the razor had an imprint of Activator. Not so, this one !!!If you have a tender skin, then best switch to another brand of razor. My intentions are just that. Two shaves and my face feels burned and the shaves were not close at all.Up to now, I have enjoyed this razor.Six years of great shaves. It has been pricey but worth it. All finished for me now.
