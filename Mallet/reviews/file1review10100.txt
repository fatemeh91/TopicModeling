review/text: The product was not opened, but it had obviously been damaged at some point the pills had been very roughly handled to the point that they had lost their smooth exterior making them difficult to swallow. If you have difficulty with pills this makes it even more difficult and some individuals might gag on them. A serious disappointment. Caution is advised. Be sure to open this product as soon as you purchase it to insure that it is in the proper condition so that you have an opportunity to take proper actions if it is not in an appropriate condition.
