review/text: I have the waterpik this model now call the "classic". You can still order it at Walmart and here places for as low as about $36.... Generally about $10 less than their newer fancier model. Note this is NOT the 20 year old model that others say lasted so well. But at least it has the larger water holding capacity, longer hose.I purchased it only about 4 years ago and the hose got brittle and cracked. I ordered a replacement squirter with hose and coupler for about $12 with shipping. Idea is you cut off most of the old hose and attach new. Problem is that the stub of the old hose is brittle and cracks not long after the repair. So I wasted $12.If I could open the base of the unit I could probably attach the good hose directly to the pump. But although I'm pretty mechanically adept I can't get the base open without destroying it. Clearly not designed with thought to allow repairs. I don't think company executives actually order the engineers to "design this thing so it will break in a few years and can't be repaired" but buy putting pressure on to make it as cheaply as possible the results are the same as if they had done that.I'll probably order a new one of the "classic" model as it's cheaper, appears to be marginally more functional than the slicker one. If Panasonic or anyone else makes a non-battery version of this device I mightout. Bottom line is despite the flaky quality the advantages in my radically improved gum health from using a waterpik (vs no waterpik) are so great that if I have to sadly toss one into the electronics recycling bin every 4 years that's what I'll do.
