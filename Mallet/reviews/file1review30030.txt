review/text: Of course you can also just lean on a wall to stretch your calves, but now you don't have to. And why wouldn't you want to? Well, first you actually need enough space in front of that wall. And that space in front of the wall be clear of clutter, clean, and can provide a good grip for your shoes. And your hands better be clean too despite all that lifting (or running) you may have done preceding the calf stretching session. But even with clean hands, at some point in the future, you will see marks on that wall that you will need to do something about.With the pro stretch gadget, you don't need to worry about space --- since you can do your stretches anywhere. In front of a chair, or in front of a table, in front of the piano, etc. And yes, even in front of a wall; you just wouldn't need that much space anymore. You can do stretching inside too. I have a tight home made gym, and this allows me to do my calf stretching right away. The "roller" feature allows for a good stretch easily and quickly. I have both the single and the "duo" version. Both are excellent. My plantar fasciities finally got healed when I regularly stretched with this gadget and used a night splint (Freedom PF II from AliMed) to bed.Highly recommended.
