review/text: If you have some back pain, neck pain, leg pain or all of the above, this baby is great. Relief One: You tilt back and the weight comes off your spine and legs and it is almost as if you are hanging from Gravity Boots. Relief Two: The shiatsu massager, really does a job, kneading your spine and shoulders. Pretty easy to assemble. Love it!
