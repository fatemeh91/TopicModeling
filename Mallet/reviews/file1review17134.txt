review/text: This trimmer has been great for trimming my beard/mustache. I like to keep it short, like the length it would be after not shaving for a few days, and this trimmer has an adjustment that is short enough for me (which many don't).The device works smoothly. It does not pull out any hairs, like some of my old trimmers, and the battery seems to last forever. I charged once it when I bought it a few months ago, and it is still working.Highly recommended.
