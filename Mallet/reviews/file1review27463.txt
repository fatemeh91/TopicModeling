review/text: The shipping was fast and everything came as expected, so there's no complaints about the vendor. I've had other ON whey powders in the past and have been really impressed with them for the most part. I read several reviews about how great French vanilla was, but when I tried it with milk I was very disappointed. The protein taste is not completely masked; even though the drink smells great, there is a pretty awful aftertaste. Despite this, the protein is good and I have no complaints otherwise. For anyone interested, mocha cappuccino, caramel toffee fudge, rocky road, and chocolate coconut have been my favorites.
