review/text: I shaved with blades for as long as I can remember. I always had to go at least 3-4 days in between shaving if I could to avoid getting torn to shreds on my neck. I bought this razor 3 weeks ago, and have had the best shaves of my life each time I use it (every other day). It is perfect! Using Lectric Shave makes it even better. And I'll spend less on this unit and any replacement cleaners than I would replacement blades in a year. Get this!
