review/text: This product may be tried and true by alot of people, but I will never again in life use this ! The severe cramping I endured along with the nausea and profuse sweating was one of the worst experiences in my life. I thought I would eventually pass out. I read the instructions and followed them through. I had plenty to drink as well. It didn't matter. These little pills are just mean and nasty. It is not worth the pain and misery. I will stick with Phillips Milk of Magnesia.
