review/text: Bought this for my wife on her 40th as a surprise,i did some looking around and found this one.it is big and thick,my wife loves the vibration on it,she says this is the best one she has ever had.As far as getting it in you do have to work it in,problem was solved with lubrication.It does have a smell to it which might put some people off,but other than that great toy and the vibrations are out of this world according to my wife.
