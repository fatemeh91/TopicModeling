review/text: This stuff is the best. I have chronic intestinal issues and regular laxatives cause me too much pain. I have used Oxypowder for really great colon cleanses and also daily management. I definitely recommend playing with the dosages and finding out what is right for you. Also, I wouldn't use it for weight loss, though I usually lose a couple of pounds when doing a cleanse. Drink lots of water and eat things that are easy to digest when using it for a cleanse. Otherwise, it has actually improved my life in that I have more energy since I can get things to move though my system better when needed. Don't know what I would do without it!
