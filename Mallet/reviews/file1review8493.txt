review/text: I bought this brush to clean baby bottles. It replaced theMunchkin Deluxe brush, and here's why: virtually all baby bottle brushes, including my old one, have a rounded tip. Now try to clean a flat bottom bottle with a round brush... endless frustration and leftover residue on the bottom edges of the bottle.This brush on the other hand has a flat top, so it reaches perfectly to clean the bottle bottom. In addition, it is long and flexible, and has a really good grip, so you can clean even the tallest baby bottle without any problem. It also looks resilient enough for frequent use (though time will tell on that one).Very happy with this purchase. Would buy again and again without hesitation.Update: 6 months down the road and countless hours of bottle cleaning later, the brush is still working perfectly and shows no sign of wear. Love it!
