review/text: It is a pretty good lighter. This is my first one so I am not up to date on Zippo's. I just got this one to fool around with, and smoke cigars, and it works great. It slides out of the case a little bit after about 20 strikes. But that isn't that big of a deal. The lighter fluid evaporates so use the fluid within 1 week-1 week and a half! The 4 OZ Zippo lighter fluid product will refill it about 8 times or more so it will last your 2 months or so (Sold Separately). Be sure to buy lighter fluid before you purchase this item, it does NOT come with lighter fluid (why would it???). This lighter is not a cheapy Bic, or disposable lighter, it is a lighter that can be used for 10 or even 20 years (with replacements of flints, wicks, and fluid of course). The wicks will last about 5 years (there is more in there then you can see, mostly folded in the Rayon balls, a synthetic cotton). The flints need to be replaces about every 2 weeks depending on how much you use it. And like I stated before, the fluid needs to be replaced every week. But it is a good lighter! I recommend it.Fast shipping (as always with amazon).Great products, never have defected items.BUY IT
