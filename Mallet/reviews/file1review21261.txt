review/text: I have used this product over the past month and here are my findings:Pros1) Cleans teeth well, I have deep molars and it gets down in the crevices.2) Refills are cheap enough ($5 dollar range) unlike some toothbrushes - low cost of ownership3) Well sealed, doesn't seem to build up any toothpaste munge, and rinses off well4) A second push on the power button when running goes into "slow" vibration mode - good for brushing your tongue without feeling like you're going to gagCons1) 30 second pause - every 30 seconds it pauses with a little blip - gets kind of annoying2) Packaging was kind of flimsy, and it doesn't come with a cover for the toothbrush head which is less sanitary in a bathroom setting, and will make it annoying to share across multiple people with nowhere to store the extra heads.OverallGood product, works well, seems to be standing up to normal use. If you're looking for a no-nonsense toothbrush at a reasonable price, this is it.
