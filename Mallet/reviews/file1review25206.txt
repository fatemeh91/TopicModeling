review/text: Yeah, this proprietary case is ridiculously expensive. If you are a little bit handy, you can take the case apart using an exacto blade. Pry along the edges, it is plastic welded, but comes apart pretty easy. There are two V80H batteries inside made by Varta. These are 1.2V Ni-MH cells for a total voltage of 2.4V. You can buy the batteries inside the case here on amazon for [...] (1.2 Volts .08 Ahmps.), or from batteryspecialists.com for [...] when you buy 6. You will have to desolder the tabs from the old batteries and solder the new ones in there. Have fun.
