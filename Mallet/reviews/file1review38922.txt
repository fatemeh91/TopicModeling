review/text: Comparing these razors to others I'd say they're decent. Shaving with them was fairly easy and, best of all, there were no nicks and cuts -- unlike some other brands. The only thing I didn't like was the handle. It was a little short, making it a little difficult to shave with at times, but overall this is a good product! I think I'd definitely recommend them to friends. They'd be great for travel.
