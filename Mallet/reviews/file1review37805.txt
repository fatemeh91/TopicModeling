review/text: Unlike some vitamins (Deva) I trust that these are actually vegan. But, as time wore on the pills began to crack - the outsides began to flake off. This made them difficult to swallow as they tended to catch on my throat - very unenjoyable. But I suppose no one said being vegan would be easy; too bad the serving size is 3 pills. Perhaps someone has a tip as to why this happened and how to prevent it.
