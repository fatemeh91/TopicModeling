review/text: These pills are huge. They are difficult to take. In the future I will go back to the three-times-a-day pills because they go down much more easily. In terms of effectiveness, I've noticed no difference between these and any other Osteo Bi-Flex product. Osteo Bi-Flex is good, but unless you are a horse you do not want these.
