review/text: After many years with the multiblade, titanium, battery powered, "real man" shaving systems who's blades last 2 shaves I decided to try something new. I must admit that I've never experienced a closer, more satisfying shave outside of an old fashioned barbershop. This is a well made razor that will last for many years. It's simplistic design, solid construction, and quality finish is sure to make this my lifetime razor. Thank you Merkur.
