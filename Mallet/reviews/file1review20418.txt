review/text: I'd been looking for a way to relieve the sharp pains in my tailbone that started early in my pregnancy. This cushion was recommended to me by a friend, and I have to say it's been amazing. I began using it just at the office, and I quickly decided to take it with me in the car, and I even use it on the couch at home! My pregnancy chiropractor also recommended that I always sit with my knees below my hips, so that the pelvis begins to open up and allow my hips to shift. The wedge shape of this pillow is an excellent way to make this happen. I would highly recommend this to other women having tailbone or hip pain during pregnancy.
