review/text: I had gastric bypass surgery over 10 years ago and must take good vitamins every day. I have tried a dozen different vitamins over the year but finally found the Nature's Plus, Source of Life, Mini Tabs. They are amazing. I feel better taking them than any others I've every tried. You won't be disappointed!
