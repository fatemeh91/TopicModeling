review/text: I sent these fabulous gloves to my best friend, having a hard time resisting sending them at all... because I wanted them for myself. They are fabulous, and I am looking forward to ordering some for myself. I own the bright pink gloves from Williams Sonoma, which are great, but the fashion award goes out to these Gloveables......Love em,,,,order now...these make a great gift for anyone. Thanks for making a fashion statement in the kitchen dear Gloveables....Fondly, Laura
