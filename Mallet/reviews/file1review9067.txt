review/text: I wound up giving this to my dad... it tastes sooo bad its almost unbelievable.. it tastes like grass clippings.. my father likes it... he swears it makes him feel better.. but that's only because he had a head injury and cant taste very well anymore.. i think that's the only way he can stomach it..
