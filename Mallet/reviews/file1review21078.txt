review/text: The Thermophore Moinst Heating Pad got me out of a bind when winter started for us (which, in Montana, was September 30). The weather change wrecked havoc on my back, but having this heating pad soothed it enough so I was able to get going in the morning and not hobble into work. Worth the investment.
