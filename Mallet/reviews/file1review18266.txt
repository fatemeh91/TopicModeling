review/text: I got this from Amazon on the subscribe service and save a bundle this way over retail drug stores. This is a smooth, but not overly slick lube. It can be difficult to wash off, but using shampoo can do it or just leaves your skin a little softened if you leave it on. Overall, it does the trick and holds up plenty long enough. Just be careful because with all silicon based lubricants, it will permanently stain sheets making it look like a permanent wet spot. Go with a darker color sheet or consider using a towel to protect the sheet. The water-based lubes are more slick and don't last as long requiring a reapplication, just depending on your endurance!
