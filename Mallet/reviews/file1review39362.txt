review/text: I purchased this because of its price, and I would have to argue that that is the best thing about it. I have a slight posture problem that I was hoping this project would help, but I don't have much faith in its efficacy. For one thing, there is little to no literature explaining how to best use the product. I received it in the mail and immediately put it on, but I was uncertain as to how tight it was supposed to be to get the best results and if there is a method to using the device, like starting looser and then tightening as your posture "improves". Other than a soreness under my arms and in my shoulders, I had no way of telling if the band was "working". I used it consistently for work during the first 2 weeks I owned it and have since discontinued use. I would recommend purchasing some other device, maybe not necessarily for design issues but more so for instruction that will allow you to use the device properly. If that costs more, I am now of the opinion that those few more dollars are worth the wasted space in my sock drawer where this band now resides.
