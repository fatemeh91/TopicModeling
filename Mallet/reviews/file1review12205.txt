review/text: I took these vitamins for a few months during my second pregnancy (which ended in miscarriage). Now, I'm not saying that the vitamin is to blame, but I was alarmed by the amount of Vitamin E in these pills, which is a vitamin you don't want to get too much of during pregnancy as it can cause serious defects (along with things like Vitamin A, which it also has a lot of). Taking this prenatal along with the corresponding DHA Rainbow Lite pills gave me 130 IU of Vitamin E. The recommended daily intake of Vitamin E for a pregnant woman is only 22.4 IU!! The label even states it gives you 333% of your DV of Vitamin E. No prenatal should be giving you more than 100% DV on anything, except maybe folic acid. I agree with other posters also that red raspberry leaf is controversial being used early in pregnancy, and not something I would have taken if I had realized it ahead of time. I've also heard of the problems with lead in these. I bought a different prenatal that gives only 15 IU of Vitamin E and nothing else exotic, to give room for my natural consumption of these vitamins in my diet. Again, I'm not saying these vitamins caused anything, but I would be careful. Ask your Dr. if you're not sure.Other, less important complaints for me were the fact that these really are huge horse pills, and I'm not one to have problems taking pills. I'm really good at it so it wasn't too difficult, but they really do have a funky smell just like every other vitamin I've tasted...if I had problems with morning sickness I definitely don't think I could have taken it.
