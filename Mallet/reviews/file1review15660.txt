review/text: I recommend this vitamin to all of my friends. I wasn't feeling up to par for a while so I decided to try a different multi. I turned to this one after talking to someone at the local health food store. I tried the first bottle and could definitely feel the difference. I don't take three. I take two in the morning with my breakfast and it seems to work. It does NOT make you jittery and contains NO caffeine which is great.
