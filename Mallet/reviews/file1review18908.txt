review/text: We started using this medication for our daughter when we weaned her off of baby formula. We are extremely pleased with it. We do still give her lactose free milk but she can eat whatever other dairy products she wants. Our only problem is we cannot find it anywhere in Canada so we need to have it shipped in from a foreign supplier:( . Other than that we are very happy.
