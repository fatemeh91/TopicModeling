review/text: I think I was slighly shy of the 18-month replacement cycle that Braun recommended, but my shaves were taking longer and by the time I was done, the shaver was uncomfortably warm to my skin. I suppose the dull blades were creating too much friction on the foil. Replaced the cutter and foil and I'm back to new. I think I will replace this annually from here on out. For $30 or so per year, it is well worth it.
