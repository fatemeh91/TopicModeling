review/text: This is a difficult product to evaluate because of how subtle the results of using it can be. It has a really nice flavor. I do wish it was the methylcobalamin rather than the cyanocobalamin, but the dosage is quite high, so that may make up for the lesser absorption rate of the cyanocobalamin. I will make sure it is methyl next time.
