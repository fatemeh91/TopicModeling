review/text: I've owned this razor for 6 months now and am very pleased with it. To be honest, my main motivation was the sticker shock of dropping a pack of modern, 3 bladed cartridges into my shopping cart. "$20-odd bucks for blades??? What a con. There are machines out there stamping these out by the thousand a hour". Men have been shaving for hundreds of years and they didn't need to shell out that kind of money. Harken back to the days of 'Mad Men' etc, no Quators for them and they got by ok.To be honest, it does not shave as close as the modern cartridges, so technology has moved on. I 'feel' some stubble growing back the next day, but since I have a fairly slow beard growth rate and only shave twice a week anyway it is not an issue. I did switch up to a cream-in-a-squeezy-bottle type shaving foam instead of a spray can, but skipped the badger hair brush etc. It DOES take a little longer to shave with it as you can't just whip it about your face, but after a couple of goes you get the feel for it.My (old school) barber was interested in my change, so I brought it in to show him the next haircut I had. He said the Merkur blades were the best out there. I did see one comment about others being better, but I can not comment on that as I have only used the German ones.I like the heft of the razor and the build quality. I was surprised it was so reasonably priced, I was expecting to pay more. I also feel smug when out shopping and look at the prices of modern razors blades. Pack of 10 is less than $6 and I am only on my third blade. I figure it will pay for itself several times over it's lifespan. So long suckers.
