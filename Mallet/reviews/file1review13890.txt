review/text: This pill dispenser saved my life. My little Lhasa Apso had to take pills twice a day and getting them down his throat was practically impossible. Most of the time, it was a very traumatic experience for both Benji and me. This pill dispenser works great with hardly any trauma at all. I highly recommend it.
