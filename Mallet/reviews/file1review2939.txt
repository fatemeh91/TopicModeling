review/text: I have taken this herbal supplement for all four of my pregnancies. I continued to exercise during all four and never put on more than 35-40 pounds by delivery. My first delivery was 3 and 1/2 hours labor with 3 pushes and he was born. Second delivery was 2 hours labor with 5 minutes pushing. Third delivery was 2 hours, 5 minutes pushing, and 4th was similar. I can't say what my deliveries might have been like had I not taken the 5W, I never wanted to find out. My dosage was different than the suggested on the label. I started taking 1 a day during the 5th week out from my due date. 2 a day for the 4th week. 3 a day for the 3rd week, etc, till I was taking 5 a day the week of my due date. I suggest this supplement for all women I talk to for an easier delivery, easier recovery, and your milk ready to go for breastfeeding. (My two sisters' labor/deliveries were not this fast or easy by a mile).
