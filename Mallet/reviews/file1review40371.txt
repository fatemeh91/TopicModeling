review/text: With somewhat ironic timing, my bottle of Gaia Herbs Quick Defense arrived just as I was coming down with the classic symptoms of a cold - scratchy throat, headache, etc. I took the recommend dose at the recommended time intervals. After I finished the bottle, I still came down with a cold.It is really hard to say whether my cold was better or worse after taking the Quick Defense. The sore throat portion of the cold lasted only about a day, which is not typical for me (usually lasts longer). I then started getting very congested and went straight into the "cough" stage which lasted a couple of days. So the anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that this product did shorten the duration of my cold.I would be willing to try this product again. As such, I am going to make sure I have another bottle on hand. The price of this supplement would be worth not having to deal with a nasty cold.
