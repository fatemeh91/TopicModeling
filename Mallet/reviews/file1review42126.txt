review/text: The charger is cumbersome and doesn't seem to actually charge the razor most times. Many times I set it down securely in the charger and find out the next day it has completely discharged.The popup trimmer keeps 'catching' the skin and cutting me.The battery life indicator seems as flighty as the weather. One minute it says it is full, the next it claims it needs to be charged.The form of the pivot is nice, but that's the only plus to this razor. I'd suggest staying far away from this one.
