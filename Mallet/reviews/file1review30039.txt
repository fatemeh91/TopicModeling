review/text: When I first saw these I was skeptical. I thought "Lamb intestines...on my wee-wee? That hasn't happened since that one long lonely weekend at Uncle Phil's farm."Boy did these bring back memories. Soft, smooth, roomy...and available 3 to 12 at a time.My girl...she didn't understand my excitement when thet arrived. She thought it was kind of weird. But I told her they tied off at the end and it was like tying a ribbon in my pubes. That's all it took for her...for me all I needed was her to make a few animal noises and I was on cloud nine.It's a shame about the not preventing diseases part of these...sheep in Scotland must be at the vetrinarian for shots of penicillin all the time. But otherwise I give these babies 5 stars...Thanks Trojan...for bringing out the animal in me...by bringing the animal into the bedroom!
