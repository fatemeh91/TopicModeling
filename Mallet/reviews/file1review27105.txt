review/text: After tasting the extreme milk chocolate you will never want any other. The extreme milk chocolate mixes well with a blender bottle, taste great and does not foam up from shaking. There are some whey mixtures which taste better, but for a pure whey, this is the only way to go. Highly recommend this flavor. Reputable brand. This combined with intense workouts = success.
