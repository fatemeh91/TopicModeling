review/text: These pills have all the things you could need in a prenatal plus the assurance that there are no harmful additives. Unfortunately for me they really upset my stomach. This isn't a usual reaction for me. I'm taking them now while nursing my son. I took another store brand during my pregnancy with no reaction. But this one makes me sick almost every day. I've tried taking it at all different times of the day but nothing works.
