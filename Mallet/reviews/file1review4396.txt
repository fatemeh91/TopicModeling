review/text: I have used the Gillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 system for several years and found the closeness to be excellent with one blade lasting three weeks. It costs about $9. The Gillette Mach3 Cartridges , 8 cartridges cost about $10. Now I've tried this Gillette Fusion Power razor at a cost of about $12 with Gillette Fusion Power Replacement Cartridges, 8-Count Package costing about $20.For the extra $3 for the razor, it cannot be beat. Gillette has raised its own bar for excellent shaving. This razor has five blades instead of three, guaranteeing the closest possible shave with several cool features. The blue lubricating strip turns white when the blade reaches the end of its use. It comes with a AAA battery that fits in the ergonomically slip-free grip handle (with a low battery light indicator). This vibrates the five blades at a high rate to ensure a very close shave. The microchip in the handle turns the razor off after eight minutes. Plus, on the back side there is a `precision trimmer' blade that cuts those sideburns exact and is gentle enough to trim around your moustache, goatee and nose. Gillette claims each disposable blade will last up to a month, but I have found Gillette blades (the three blade version) to last three weeks. So I expect this five blade version to last well past a month. That's amazing.The Gillette Fusion handle costs $3 more and the refills (8) cost $10 more, but they last longer and the shave is so much closer. Spend the few extra dollars and get a razor with blades that last longer than any other on the market. I suggest buying in bulk to save money. You do get what you pay for.
