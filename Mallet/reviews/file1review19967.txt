review/text: My nearly 3 year old daughter had been rejecting 2 different potty chairs, and was hesitant to sit on the "big potty" after nearly falling in the water. This toilet trainer sits securely on my elongated toilet bowl and is very stable when she climbs on and off, easing her fears. I am very pleased with it and would recommend it highly.
