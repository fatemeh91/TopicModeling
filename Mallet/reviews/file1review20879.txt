review/text: Excellent machine makes the move from a blade easy. I'm happy to be done with hot water, soap and shaving cream..and those painful late in the day shaves needed to clean up a 5 o'clock shadow.A super clean blade shave was great done every other day but sometimes two a day were needed and that was too painful and time consuming. This shaver makes it easy to touch up an evening shadow without hacking up your skin.First shave out of the box was great.
