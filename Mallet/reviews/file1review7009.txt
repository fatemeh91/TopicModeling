review/text: I found the Wahl custon shaver to be an excellent buy and very reliable electric shaver. I have owned and used a Whal shaver for over 20 years and love them. The new 5000 electric shaver is a new design that tells you how many shaves you have left on a charge with a number of small led lights that light up and indicate the charge left. Th electric shaver can be charged on 110 volts or 220 volts, making it making it ideal traveling abroad. This new Whal 5000 is the best electric shaver I have ever owned!! BOB
