review/text: I find my brain can't stop reeling after a hard day at work. For whatever reason, I tend to think about my short term, middle term, and long term goals before I go to sleep. I end up laying and thinking for up to 2 hours instead of sleeping. With this product, I fall asleep within a half hour of taking it. So I still think about what I need to do, but my thoughts slow down so I can get to sleep in a timely fashion. You are supposed to take one an hour before bedtime and one at bedtime. I just need one and I fall asleep within a half-hour.
