review/text: You like peanut butter but hate all the fat that goes with ot? then this is the bar for you. Its like eating a bar of peanut butter with no guilt. Sweet & Salty. I only wish there was more texture such as actual full peanuts inside. But I digress this is the most accurate representation of any flavor for a nutrition bar. It's a must-buy!
