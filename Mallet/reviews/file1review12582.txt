review/text: As many of you, I have been constipated all my life. I've changed my eating habits, drank lots of water, took laxatives, stool softeners and enemas, getting only a quick fix. This product is different. I am on my 2nd bottle and take 4 pills once per week. All week long I actually have regular BMs. I just hope that it is never pulled from the market or is found to be unsafe because its the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me.
