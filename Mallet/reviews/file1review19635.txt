review/text: We had a regular potty chair that sits on the floor and grew tried of it taking up floor space, cleaning the bowl, etc. so we decided to try the Bjorn Toilet Trainer. We love it! It does not take up any floor space, sits nicely (fit is great) on our regular toilet bowl, no cleaning up meeses and our toddler can get on and off of it all by himself. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is potty training.
