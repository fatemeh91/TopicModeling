review/text: I absolutely love this product. AMBI fade cream works fantastically. As an African American woman, I worry about my complexion and when I get scars. I don't like having scars at all and I'm fairly clumsy so I get them all the time. Nonetheless, I found this fade cream and tried it out and it worked wonders. Even on scars that I have had for quite some time! The first time I used it was on a scar on my cheek from a pimple that I had busted. I was devastated by the blemish and tried the product hoping that it would work and I wouldn't be marked forever. After a few weeks of use, I noticed the mark disappearing. Now you can't even see it! I would recommend this product to anyone trying to get rid of scars and marks.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.
