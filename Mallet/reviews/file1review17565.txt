review/text: When it came time to finally replace my trusty old Norelco I was a bit leery of ordering something online, but the number of positive reviews and the fantastic price convinced me to purchase it. After serveral months I can say I am very pleased with this trimmer. It is solid and well built. It has very good battery life. It is comfortable to use and does a great job! I had thought of buying a more expensive model that would vacuum clippings, or one that would operate while plugged in (for those occasions where you forget to charge it) but hours of reading reviews left me concerned about complaints of poor performance and flimsy parts. I'm glad I saved myself some potential aggravation and money too! Shortly after getting this I recommended it to a friend, he ordered one and is also very pleased!
