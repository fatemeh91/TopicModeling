review/text: This has proved to be one my smartest purchases yet. Bought for an office where we do massage, using a vacuum to clean up lint, sand etc from the carpet is often just not possible due to noise. This sweeper works fantastic! Picks up anything that's visible, is quiet, and stores nicely. We haven't had any trouble yet with the handle coming apart like some other reviewers, but if we do it's nothing a little duck tape won't fix. My only wish is that the head was larger and therefore covered more space. But all in all, a great tool for the times when lugging out a noisy vacuum isn't practical.
