review/text: We purchased the Sterling 311 for my 74-year old mother because her chronic back pain made it impossible for her to get down into the bathtub, even with assistance. From the very first day she used it, she loved it. She is now even confident enough to use it without having to have someone with her.Before purchasing the Sterling 311, we had reviewed both the walk-in bathtub (Cost: $3000-$4000, plus installation) and an inflatable bath lift (Cost: $1400, and non-returnable.) We chose the Sterling 311 not only for the lower cost (under $600 delivered) but because the installation was easy, and, unlike the inflatable lift, we had the option to return the product if it did not work well for my mom.
