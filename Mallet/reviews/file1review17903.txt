review/text: For years my wife and I have had chronic nasal problems. We have taken pills, used steam and a variety of sane and insane methods of keeping our noses clear at night. I knew about the nasal strips, but never really believed it could work... looked like a scam. My wife less skeptical and bought a box at a local pharmacy... it worked. It worked better than any pill. She made me try and it worked for me too. The only thing I hate is the price. From the pharmacy it cost a half a buck apiece for a bandaid with a wire in it. Forturnately, by buying a bunch from Amazon, we cut that price in half... but please... a quarter each for a piece of sticky plastic???? Oh well, must be worth it... we have bought more.
