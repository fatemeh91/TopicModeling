review/text: We are working on potty training my daughter and she loves sitting on this seat vs. sitting on a stand alone training potty. She likes being a big girl and sitting the same place that mom and dad sit. The downside to this seat is that unless you have toilet seats that are totally flat, the "attachment" pieces won't fit you toilet seat. So instead of returning this, my husband went out and spent $40 more for each of the toilets in our house so that this seat would fit and not slide around.
