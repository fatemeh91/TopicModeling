review/text: I've tried plenty of protein shake powders in the last 15 years and this is the first that I've found that truly tastes good. While I can't necessarily attribute my recent weight/muscle gain to this product (since I've recently started lifting regularly after an inconsistent period), I have definitely seen improvement. Recently finished my first 5 lb. container (Double Rich Chocolate) and on to my next (Extreme Milk Chocolate). Both taste good, but the Double is the better of the two.
