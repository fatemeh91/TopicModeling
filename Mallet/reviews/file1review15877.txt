review/text: I wish I would have had this belt for my last two pregnancies! I am in my last 2 months of pregnancy and bought this belt to help with some sciatic nerve pain in my leg. Not only has the belt helped to improve the pain in my leg, it has also allowed me to be able to walk or stand for 2 hours + without feeling much discomfort. I would definately recommend it.
