review/text: My daughter tried this stuff first and hated it. It made her feel sick but also disoriented. She was trying to read a magazine but couldn't understand a word of it. She gave them to me and I took one before heading off to a meeting. I was asked to take the minutes but really struggled to concentrate to do so. I suddenly felt so jittery and dizzy. I couldn't focus on any object or understand what was being said. I was afraid I would have a heart attack or something. I had a very disoriented and disconnected feeling. Thank God I wasn't driving! This is definately not a good product for many people.
