review/text: This is a great toy but the spining part broke rather quickly but that happend with my old one 2 idk if its just me or the toys. you have to be careful in the shower and make sure the battery part is sqrewed on right and most likey it will break if u sumerg it in water but other den that the vibrations are nice and strong and the size is nice kinda big but i like it not complaining.
