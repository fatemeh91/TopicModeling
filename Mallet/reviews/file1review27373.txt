review/text: I love the brand, Gold Standard is very good in all regards. I've been exercising and taking protein shakes for many years and after all my research, I am very pleased with the brand. Rocky Road is the best tasting protein shake I've ever had, but I thought I'd try something different and get the Chocolate Malt. I can't bring myself to down it. My wife tried it and couldn't stand it!! Absolutely the worst tasting protein shake I have EVER had, period. So much so I needed to post something on here!!! Just an FYI, try it for yourself if you must. ROCKY ROAD IS AWESOME. CHOCOLATE MALT IS TERRIBLE.
