review/text: I bought this thermometer for emergencies within the past year and when I was in a panic to check my sick baby's temperature in September, it did not work. The battery had died before I had a chance to use it! After the emergency passed, I went to several stores looking for a replacement battery. No one could match it to anything they carried. I found the same Vic's thermometer in the package on the shelf and could not find a battery type listed anywhere. The pharmacist could not assist me. Tonight with my glasses on and a 8x magnifier, I identified the model, but no battery type. Finally, I tried looking on Vic's website and still found nothing other than the bad reviews by other people who had similar problems. Rather than waste anymore time and money on this product, I will call this a loss and invest in a different brand thermometer with better reviews.
