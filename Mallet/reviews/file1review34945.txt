review/text: These things knock you OUT! because of the low dosage you may need to take a bit more than normal. They help my brother who came home from being deployed get some much needed rest (PTSD forces him to stay awake or be in a half-sleep-state). After taking these he was out for a comfortable 10 hours! seems excessive but he loved it.Be careful for those of you that have nightmares frequently like myself. I found myself strangely locked in a dream state where upon awakening i was in another dream. Inception style.
