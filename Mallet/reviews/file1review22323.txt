review/text: This is superior to many of the other stainless steel wipes because of the mineral oil it contains. I was so sorry I had stainless appliances until I found these wipes. I had tried so many other products and most just left more streaks or they didn't remove buildup. I also use it on my stainless sinks, no more water spots. You do need to go over the refrigerator and other appliances that are low to the ground with a clean dry cloth after using these to remove excess oil or else pet hair will stick to it.I recommend these highly!
