review/text: I was having trouble sleeping because of general anxiety about an upcoming trip. So I started taking this and all my sleep problems went away almost immediately. So happy I didn't go waste time on a sleep study for the problems!Now, the best part is that my dreams are completely insane and memorable. I have had lucid or partially lucid dreams for a month now- I am loving it. As a musician, I now feel like a lot of my best ideas are coming from my dreams.
