review/text: I have a daughter who, as we used to say in the 60's, is a "granola girl". By that, we meant, an herbalist, vegetarian, holistic medicine kind of gal. Okaaaay, I used to say. But, over the years, she's been working on old mom, "helping" me to eat better (and "kinder" as she often says).Anyway, back to point: she is a big believer in herbal remedies, and she was the reason I decided to order GALA HERBS, Rapid Relief, QUICK DEFENSE.So. I order it, stick it in the medicine cabinet, thinking, "yes, dear daughter, SURE, I'll use it. As you recommend, SOMEDAY."Then. Last week, I accompany a good friend to a Surgi-Center for out patient day surgery. I wait there half a day, amidst coughing, sneezing, unhealthy looking people. Take friend home. Good deed done.Next morning, I wake up feeling like I'm coming down with a head cold! Uck! Head cold, as in: my nose is stuffed up, my eyes are kind of burning and dry, and my throat feels raspy and slightly sore.Office germs, I think. I picked up something in that waiting room from handling the magazines or doorknobs! So....I swallow two of the Gala Herbs Quick Defense Caps with morning coffee and breakfast. And then, 2 more with lunch, 1 more with dinner. In the interest of full disclosure, I have a glass of wine with dinner too. And I also drink lots of water (4 bottled) during the day, plus a couple (2) of V8 juice. I go to bed early (for me), at 10 pm.Next morning: the above symptoms are GONE. I feel GOOD.Was it the early night's sleep? The extra hydration? My daughter's power of suggestion? Could be, but I've done all the self-care, hydration, and extra sleep before, and the cold still came on. The difference then, and now: no added herbs to "boost my immune system".So, as far as I'm concerned, the herbals in this quick defense formula work. Could be a placebo effect, but who cares? I felt better the next a.m., and you might too, if you try this herbal formula at the first signs of a cold.
