review/text: I am one of those guys who have always had to deal with the "five o'clock shadow that shows up around noon, so it is a tremendous advancement in shaving technology that I can get a close shave that won't require a second shave in the middle of the day.Just a tip here ... make sure you use the right shaving "cream" ... not just any will do, mind you. The special coating on the razor's "face" (the blue strip) mixes the best (for me) when I use "Head Slick" by Headblade. It is a mentholated cream.HeadBlade Headslick Mentholated Shave Cream 8 fl oz (237 ml)
