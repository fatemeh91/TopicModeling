review/text: While not quite the purpose that the company created Clif bars for, I wanted a nutritious and filling start to my day and all the breakfast bars and quick start foods next to them in the cereal isle were too low in nutritional value for the number of calories they put in. Clif Bars on on the other hand give a good start to the day when you don't have time for a "real" breakfast. The Chocolate Chip flavor makes it taste decadent while the grains make the texture feel like you're having something substantial.
