review/text: I have used regular Scrub Free for years. I love it. I picked up Scrub Free w/bleach by mistake. The fumes almost choked me to death. I had to open windows, turn on an exhaust fan and wait outside for the house to clear. My eyes watered, I coughed until I threw up. Who cares if it works or not. This product should be taken off the market. I'm taking mine back for a refund.
