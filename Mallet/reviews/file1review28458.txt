review/text: 100% whey protein gold standard is a very good tasting protein. It does have artificial sweeteners in it so beware. It mixes well with milk. I use a small hand held mixer and it leaves no clumps. The taste is pretty good. I usually stay away from artificial sweeteners so I am able to taste them in these. They need to make more natural product like 100% natural whey by optimum nutrition. It is disappointing that Amazon no longer has the subscribe and save for the natural whey so I had to settle for this product.
