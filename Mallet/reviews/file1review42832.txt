review/text: I've had digestive problems for years--most of my adult life. And my problems reached a climax when I was hospitalized with acute diverticulitis. My wife found this product at Whole Foods and ever since I've been taking just one pill a day (on most days--unless I do something crazy like drink too much alcohol or eat very spicy food--in which case I might take an extra one or two depending upon how screwed up I've managed to make my gut). I can't overstate the impact this product has had on my quality of life. It's been truly life-changing for me. And at this price you're talking less than $10/month for 180 pills. Expensive? Hardly. And worth every penny.One final note: I was singing the praises of this product to my brother, who was suffering from ulcers at the time. For him, he couldn't get past the bloating that the product caused. Fortunately for me, my condition was dramatically improved by Primal Defense--and without any associated bloating. But as with so many things in life, there is rarely a single solution for everyone's problems. I would therefore recommend NOT stockpiling this product before you've determined how it works with your individual digestive system and issues. I would suggest that you buy a small amount--perhaps even one of the smaller bottles--and give it a try for at least a week or two before you "buy in" as I've done. Good luck in your search!
