review/text: After using half a dozen other sleep masks, this one is by far the best. This mask completely blocks out all light, so those of us who are sensitive to light can sleep without being disturbed by the first rays of sunlight or by your partner's reading light, television viewing, etc.The best feature is the eye cut-outs--they allow you to blink your eyes, as we all do normally in sleep, without your eyelashes touching any part of the mask. It is very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend this product.
