review/text: Pedicures can be expensive at the spa so I prefer to do them myself. This pedi file is the same quality used at the spa for a fraction of the price. As I've gotten older I have trouble with dry skin on my heels that cracks and peels if I don't keep the callouses filed. I use this file on dry heels once every week or two along with daily moisture cream to prevent that from happening.
