review/text: When I received this product, my husband was even more thrilled than I. He was looking forward to the fact that I'd be shaving my legs more than once in a given week! With the harsh winter weather upon us, my dry skin becomes problematic. Shaving just seems to make my dry legs even worse. This is why I was so pleasantly surprised how well Skintimate Shaving Gel for Dry Skin did! I shaved my legs three times this past week, all with wonderful results. I love the fact that there's a moisturizer in the gel that actually helped relieve the dryness my skin was experiencing. In the past, I've always used my husband's shaving gel or soap. Skintimates rates much higher, in my opinion, due to the extra moisturizing element. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone who shaves on a regular basis. My husband concurs on this as well!! I will definitely purchase this product in the future.
