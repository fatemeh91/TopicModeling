review/text: I wasn't sure where to start with my premixed henna so I chose this kit. It's a good starting point to find out what I like & dislike as far as containers (cone, metal tube, etc). The quality of this henna paste is wonderful! It makes a beautiful rich brown stain & lasts a very long time. I will be purchasing more in the future.
