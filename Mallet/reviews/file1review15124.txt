review/text: These glasses are of a superior construction and design. I bought 3 pair and messed one up when I tried to bend them for a minimal adjustment. Just be careful when bending them at the hinge area, which was my fault. I am totally satisfied with them especially their optical quality of them being of the aspheric optical material.
