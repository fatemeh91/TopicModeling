review/text: I am an amputee and rely on crutches to move around. My old crutches were broken and were dangerous for me to use when I ordered these. When I got the crutches I found them broken. The part that goes under your arms was not connected on either crutch. When I attempted to use them the tops would come off and I would loose my balance. Out of necessity I was forced to glue them on until I can find a new set of crutches. I am very dissatisfied with this product and would not buy this item in the future.Item: Duro-Med Laminated Wood Crutches, Medium
