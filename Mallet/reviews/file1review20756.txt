review/text: Dear Sirs,I very much appreciate the opportunity you have provided for me to comment on my new Braun Electric Shaver.I am not a perpetual complainer. This is the first time in 40 years I have submitted a written complaint about a product which I have purchased.I must say , however, that I am keenly disappointed with my Braun 8585.It does not provide me with a clean or a close shave.Its performance is only very marginally better than my Norelco which has languished in my top drawer for more than 20 years.I am wondering whether the liquid cleaning "device" of the Braun is not just a gimmick--- messy, cumbersome and quite expensive to use.I sincerely apolgise for these negative comments but trust nevertheless that you will find them helpful.Respectfully submitted, Eric Sorensen, Minneapolis.
