review/text: Have you added sensuous massage to your lovemaking? If not, then you need to do so! Let me tell you, there is nothing better than light massaging and soft caresses to get a woman going. And, at such times, what you need is some good massage oil. I cannot recommend any range of products more than the Kama Sutra Massage Therapy oils - Serenity, Pleasure Garden, Sweet Almond, Healing Blend and Soaring Spirit.Each oil has a wonderful smell that permeates the room, and brings your senses to life. Indeed, I must admit that they act as something of an aphrodisiac for me! I love the way that this oil feels on my skin, and have found that it has a great moisturizing effect, working better than just about any moisturizer I have used. We have experienced no problems with this oil, even on the more sensitive areas of our bodies.Yep, we love these massage oils, and highly recommend them to you. If you want to please the lover in your life, then get him or her Kama Sutra's Massage Therapy Kit.Note: While I love these oils (and who doesn't like a massage?), you must remember that oil products tend to breakdown latex products, such as condoms and certain toys, so use it wisely!(Review of Kama Sutra Massage Therapy Kit)
