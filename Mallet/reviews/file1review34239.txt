review/text: This creme works really well. I gave it 4 stars because I am disappointed that the tubes are sovery small. They are smaller than travel size tubes of toothpaste.I bought a package of 3 thinking I was getting some for later use,however, the three tubes really equal maybe one half tube of regular store bought H creme.Not sure if I will buy again or not. Homeopathic pills are available that do the same thingand are pretty reasonably priced. This does lubricate and sooth the area great though. ;DNOTE: I am working on eating real foods from the earth, and NOT grocery store "Food Like Productsthat cause disease in the first place, so that my body is healthier and has enough fiber and waterwith real nutrients to keep the hemorrhoids from happeningin the first place. ;D
