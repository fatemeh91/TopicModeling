review/text: The reviews for this protein powder were so overwhelmingly positive that I went out on a limb and ordered two 2-pound containers (Chocolate Mint and Vanilla Ice Cream). I was nervous that they would be gross because that's what usually happens when I try protein shakes people have recommended but they are actually as good as everyone says. Don't get me wrong, you are not going to confuse this for a Wendy's Frosty... but you might ALMOST confuse it. I had the chocolate mint today just mixed with cold water and it was even good without milk!One thing: they don't seem to fill me up as much as some protein powders I've tried. I drank two scoops with a big bottle of water and was hungry again half an hour later. I ended up eating almost 600 calories that meal which is quite a bit more than I usually would. They seem to be more filling when mixed with other things like soy milk, frozen fruit and pureed pumpkin.UPDATE: I had to come back to share two fantastic recipes. (1) Mix one scoop of the vanilla ice cream powder with 5 oz unsweetened soy milk and 2.5 oz frozen berries. It tastes almost exactly like a strawberry milkshake. (2) Mix two scoops of the chocolate mint powder with 5 oz unsweetened soy milk and 5 oz iced coffee. It tastes like chocolate milk! If you add ice you can make it thicker.
