review/text: Love the idea of a better condom, these are praised by multiple sources on the internet.Thoughts...Latex smell: They say no latex smell, I say not better or worse but definitely there.Lube: Less lubricated than average, fine with me, I never liked the lube that came with condoms. Get a bottle of lube!Feel: Good, comparable with other brands that claim to be thin or extra sensitive. I don't know what is with these people who say it's like it's not there, WTF were they using before? a balloon? It still feels like a condom.Fit: average, regular size, 2" diameter. like all latex condoms it stretches very easily without much force, I think the people who complain they are too tight aren't rolling them out all the way resulting in effectively having a thick rubber band around their dick. plain cylindrical shape with a nipple at the end to catch your DNA.Price: Not important to me, I am totally willing to pay more for better. But I got 36 for a little more than what I pay for 12 of a comparable condom at the supermarket. So that's a plus.Final thoughts: Good, actually great, I cant say I've used anything better but I have used others that as good as these. Every other condom I've used can be purchased at a supermarket so I'm not comparing with anything exotic. I understand these have had a good reputation for at least a decade, they may have been something to write home about years ago, but I think every other brand is catching up to these with their new extra thin or extra sensitive lines. For me the search for a better condom is still on. For lack of something better, you can get these here for less.
