review/text: These bars tast really good and and are a good in-between-meal item for me. I have one in the car and a few at work for mid-day pick-me-ups. Says "meal bar" but no one could make a meal of one bar, maybe two as they are filling.I will be buying more as long as the price stays under $1.40 a bar.
