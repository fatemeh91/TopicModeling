review/text: I'm sitting here in Kandahar, Afghanistan wanting to quit smoking. I've managed to develop a 2 pack a day habit here, so I made the decision to quit. Here's the kicker: I have in my possession Step 2 and Step 3 - and I've had them for three weeks now. All I'm waiting on is Step 1. Needless to say, I'm not pleased with my purchase or with the retailer who was happy to take my money but not send my product.Still waiting until 6 April because that's the deadline date they told me was the latest date I would have my product. After that day comes and goes and I still don't have the product I've ordered and paid for, I most certainly will get a full refund, order from someone else, and then wait some more so I can get some help with quitting smoking.Thanks for nothing so far.
