review/text: It's okay, not really the best cream I've used. I mostly have to reapply a lot which can be frustrating when giving a massage. Even with deep tissue work it dries out kind of fast. I've used the Dual purpose massage cream from biotone and liked it a lot but I ordered this because I was looking for something without almond oil in it for people with nut allergies. Will keep looking.
