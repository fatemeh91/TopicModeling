review/text: This diet pill really works. You only take one pill after 2 meals with a full glass of water. It helped me to lose about 10 pounds in a month without dieting or working out. If you see any side effects, however, such as a headache or stomach ache, stop taking the pills, and they are not for long term use. The price is right, and the pills really do work. I wish I could take them forever, but I began to get headaches after about 1 1/2 months. Overall, I'd recommend them, though.
