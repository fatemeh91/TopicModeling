review/text: I've known I have trigger points for years (Thanks, Clair Davies!), but since I have a Knobble, a boyfriend, and some sharp edges on my granite countertops, I thought a Back Buddy type tool would be redundant. How wrong I was! I've been having a lot of tension headaches lately, and finally thought I'd give the Back Buddy a try.This incredibly bright blue tool arrived larger than I had imagined. It's great for digging into all sorts of area that the booklet doesn't illustrate. For instance, sit at your kitchen table, using the table to support the Back Buddy ,and lean one of the long pokey parts into your neck to apply pressure to your sternocleidomastoid muscles. You can also balance the tool on the ground, kneel, and lean into the same pokey bit to massage sore hip muscles. Be creative! I've used it to help stretch and to unplug an item behind a large appliance.When not in use to massage sore muscles, you could probably also keep it around to club a burglar in the night.Oh- and be forewarned: It has an incredibly phallic portion that *will* provoke your friends to inquire about your actual intentions for the tool's usage.
