review/text: I have been a devoted user of Lobob Optimum ESC (Extra Strength Cleaner) for 5 years. I wear gas perm bifocal contact lenses, am allergic to many preservatives, and suffer from dry eyes which makes the contacts develop a film by the end of the day.There is absolutely no product that I have found that does as good a job cleaning my contacts. In fact, I actually STORE my contacts in the cleaning solution every night. The contacts are clean in the morning, stay clean longer, and I am not bothered by reactions to preservatives because this product is preservative free.It is difficult to find where I live. The only store that carried it was Walgreens and now they have discontinued it. I ordered 4 bottles from Amazon and will continue to do so.Try it!
