review/text: I liked this trimmer. Really liked it. But only for a couple months. Now, the battery won't hold a charge for more than about a day.It only took a couple months for me to notice that the battery life was getting worse. A few months later, and it had gotten ridiculous. Adding to the problem: the battery is not replaceable. Adding even more to the problem: you can't run the trimmer by plugging it in. The included adapter only works as a charger. It won't actually power the trimmer.Remington might as well market this as a "disposable trimmer". There are plenty of other trimmer options out there. Look elsewhere.
