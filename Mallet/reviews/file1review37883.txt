review/text: My son is 15 months old and has 4 teeth....he has been a slow teether, but MAN is he grumpy when he starts! He wakes up super grumpy and takes forever to fall back asleep when his teeth/gums are bothering him. I have stocked up on the Hylands and Humphreys tablets. I was really disappointed when they were pulled off the shelves!I give him 2-3 tablets and a dose of Motrin right before bedtime when he is teething, and 9/10 times, he sleeps through the night and is a very happy camper in the morning.
