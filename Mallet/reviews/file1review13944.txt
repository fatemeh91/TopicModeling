review/text: seeing how dr.pepper is like my most loved drink in the world i thought i would buy the lip "gloss" because i alwasy buy lip gloss. i hated it. it wasnt worth my dollar and cents. it just made my lips feel dry and left me with a bad sore throat. even though i hate the stick, i still LOVE the drink.
