review/text: Braun Oral-B Professional ToothbrushI bought this brush to replace an older one and, wow, what a difference!This model's two-speed pulsating system lets you know when you've targeted an area sufficiently, also lets you know when you're over-brushing. Bristles change color when replacement is needed. Batteries last 11 days between charges so it's great for travel, too.I love the way my mouth and teeth feel between dental visits and my cleanings last longer with less plaque buildup.Highly recommended.
