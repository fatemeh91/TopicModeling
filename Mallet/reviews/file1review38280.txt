review/text: These have so much good in them, Make sure you get at least 180 because the recommended dose is at least 3 a day. These are rated very high on the vitamin absorption chart. Make sure you take in the morning afternoon and early evening because they have energy lifting supplements in them already such as green tea and you don't want to take them before bed!
