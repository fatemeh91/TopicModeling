review/text: Getting fiber in my day to day diet is not one of my strong suits, so I've been shopping around for a supplement to help out.This product is exactly what it describes itself to be. Scoop some into water, slug it down and, well, it goes to work.You definitely have to balance the amount you use with how much you can dissolve in the amount of water you want to drink. I don't like to let it bulk up which happens if you let it sit for too long. So I've been using a level spoonful, mixing it quickly in 16oz of water, then slamming it as quick as I can. I've been finding that I'm using less and less fiber, but haven't seen any decrease in its "effectiveness".My only disappointment would be that this doesn't dissolve very well in water, but I think that's a characteristic of all psyllium husk powder.
