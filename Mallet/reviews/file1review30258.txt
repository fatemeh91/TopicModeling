review/text: wish I had not bought this. The actual vacuum is fine, very strong, but the attachment is very poorly designed. The brush spins by suction and is easily stopped. the whole brush assembly completely fell apart the first time I dropped it, which is easy to do because of the awkward two-hand approach needed to use it.
