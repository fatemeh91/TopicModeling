review/text: I've only been using this for about 2 weeks now, but I do notice a difference. It's very subtle, gradual. I think that's because I read the dosage instructions wrong and have actually been taking less than was recommended (which I have corrected). However, it is helping a bit and I think that over time it will help even more. I'm a very strong supporter of herbal remedies and I definitely feel like this is a great alternative to taking mood stabilizers, antidepressants and the like.
