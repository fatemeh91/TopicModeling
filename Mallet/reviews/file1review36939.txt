review/text: This tape was way too wide for me. I have very close contacts between some of my teeth and I couldn't get this between them. It became stuck and I had to go buy other floss to get the ripped piece out. Maybe I got a bad batch but all the other reviewers talk about it being very wide as well. I always buy tape instead of regular floss because I can actually use it. This one was totally different than any other tape I've bought.
