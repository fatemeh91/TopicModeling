review/text: This stuff tastes Great ( I've used both Double-Chocolate and Strawberry mixed in with Vanilla Yogurt or Milk ). My only complaint is that they are sweetened with artificial sweeteners ( Sucralose aka "Splenda" for Strawberry, Acesulfame Potassium aka "Sweet One" for Double-Rich-Chocolate ). Amazon does not mention this and it is not spelled out on the container itself ( only listed under ingredients with their chemical names). I'm concerned as there have been no long-term human studies conducted to determine the potential health effects of Splenda on humans. Until long-term human studies are conducted, no one will know for sure whether Splenda is really safe or unsafe for humans to eat. Unfortunately, used in a Protein powder, a person is likely to consume quite a bit of this stuff (3-4 servings a day for me). They have a Natural Whey product with no artificial sweeteners that I think I will switch to ( contains natural fructose instead ).
