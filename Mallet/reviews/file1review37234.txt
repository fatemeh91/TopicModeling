review/text: I ordered small then found the size chart differs from most size chrats and should have gotten an extra small but they are okay snugwize.They seem to work.I wear them over night. My con is I don't like the material. It's scratchy rather than smooth. Also I did not recieve any reciept or return info with the package.
