review/text: This product is fantastic as is and there is nothing negative to say. It is wonderful mixed in milk, almond milk, yogurt and juices for a delicious shake. The problem I have is what the company has done by saying "new and improved" on the label with 20 g of protein. The older product has 16 g in a 20 g scoop. All the company has done to increase (improve?) the product is give you a bigger plastic scoop that contains 25 g of Whey-to-Go, which is 25% more product per serving which then amounts to 25% more of 16g in the old product equals 20g. This is a lame way of saying new and improved! This also increases the calories per serving from 70 to 90 and of course increasing how fast you will go thru the container of product. So, it is too bad the company has been deceitful with saying it is an improved product, but the Whey-to -Go itself is great. If you are looking for a high quality, tastey protein supplement this is the one. If you have used this product before, just keep the old scoop if you want to continue with the 16 g/ serving instead of 20.
