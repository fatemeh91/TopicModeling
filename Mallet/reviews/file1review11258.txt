review/text: I had been suffering from a really sore, swollen throat and irritating dry cough for a few days (which conveniently started up especially when I was trying to go to sleep). I had been feeling feverish, but strangely, had no other symptoms besides the aforementioned ones above. I teach middle school, so my throat tends to be sore when I come home in the evenings from talking most of the day anyway, and so I was attributing this to having to talk a lot (and really loudly) during the day for several hours at a time, but I began to think I was coming down with something when the sore throat persisted for several days. Anyway, I was in the aisle at a local CVS browsing various cough syrups when I ran across this on sale and decided to try it, not expecting much. As soon as I stepped out in the parking lot with my purchase, I began rummaging in the bag to get one out. I popped one into my mouth and savored it as I drove home. By the time I got home, it had dissolved and my throat felt remarkably better! I realized I wasn't wincing anymore when I ate or drank anything. It really takes the edge off a sore/dry throat. And here I was thinking I needed to make a doctor's appointment...I was like, really, is that all? I couldn't believe the amount of relief packed into such a small, seemingly unremarkable drop. It really helps with minor mouth irritation/coughs too. For a major flu/cold, I don't know...but I love how it's not overpoweringly sweet either and is made from mostly natural stuff. Now I keep the whole bag in my desk drawer at school. Will definitely be buying again! Only downside is it tends to be a bit expensive for a cough drop when not on sale...
