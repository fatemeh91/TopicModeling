review/text: I had a Remington MB-30 that I bought back in the 90s, and it lasted so long and served me so well that I would not buy any other brand. I was afraid that they might have cheapened their products over the years, but I was pleasantly surprise by the improvements instead. It's so MUCH quieter and has the same sturdy feel. In some ways, it feels even sturdier.Another nice improvement is that the middle teeth in the length guard (or whatever it's called) are now flexible to fit the contour of your face. The outside edges of the guard are still stiff to keep the beard at the chosen length. This did make it hard for me to remove the guard at first until I learned to grab the other sides of the guard when removing it.I highly recommend this product and I'll let you know if this one lasts 15 years like my old one did!
