review/text: This is an excellent resource for appropriate correspondence- from thank-you notes to birth announcements, issuing invitations (both formal & informal) and replying to same.Crane's throughly explains the difference in printing styles (flat-printing, thermography & engraving), and gives gender-specific sizing of social papers, as well as the rules accompanying them (personal stationery is for one person- therefore you should never use a "combined" monogram or "Mr. & Mrs. John Doe" unless, with the latter, you are issuing an invitation).The author covers appropriate wording for every conceivable invitation and announcement, and has a thorough listing of every form of address known to man.Announcements, greeting cards & social correspondence are detailed.There is a complete index for easy reference, and, contrary to one previous reviewer of Crane's Wedding Blue Book, only two sentences "selling" Crane's stationery.If you want to adhere to tradition & propriety, this and "Miss Manners" are the gold standard for the written form. Crane's has supplied paper for US currency since 1879 & is the stationer of choice for Presidents. You cannot get a more reputable authority.
