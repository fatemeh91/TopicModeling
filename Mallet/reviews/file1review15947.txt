review/text: I am 30 weeks pregnant and have been told by my OB I needed extra back support for the back pain I was experiencing. I looked online for the best reviews and went with this product. I wore a size 12 denim pre-pregnancy so decided to go with an XL it fits awesome! I have it on the tightest setting, but it feels strong and very supportive. I have PLENTY of growing room too. I am just totally impressed with everything about it. Even the seller. I ordered this product 3 days ago... and I am wearing it right now! It has not even said it has shipped yet in my orders! What?! That is awesome, so kudos to you guys! I have another 10 weeks and if it was anything like today I may not ever take it off it helped so much. If your in pain, spend the $40. I would pay $10 a week for a month to feel a significant change. My Son seems to enjoy figuring out what the heck it is. He continuously kicks at it! Due on 12.12.12 Tennessee.
