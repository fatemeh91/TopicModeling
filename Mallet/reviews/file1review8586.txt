review/text: This is a great brush for smaller tile areas, such as shower or tub walls. Probably not what you would use on a large ceramic tile floor, unless you are only going to spot clean an aria. Unless of course you don't mind being on your hands and knees cleaning a large area.Living in Florida I have over 2000 SF of ceramic tile area to clean, and I don't think I would care to do it on my knees. I am looking for a sturdy grout brush such as this but with a long handle. So far I have not been able to find one that suits me.This brush has a row of very stiff bristles in the center, and another row going around them that are not quite as stiff. The handle is quite comfortable to hold and work with plus feels sturdy enough to apply pressure. It did an excellent job on my shower wall grout, and some spot cleaning on my floor. This brush is also great for cleaning along wall edges and corners.Oxo Good Grips makes some great products at reasonable prices, I know since I have some other items from them. I would definitely recommend this brush.
