review/text: This powder tastes pretty good. I especially like it with a splash of milk (not too much to add many extra calories, but enough for that extra creaminess). It's quite sweet, but not cloying like some other powders and the texture is perfect even when made with water.It doesn't dissolve well if mixed with a spoon, so shake it or blend it. It will dissolve easily then.
