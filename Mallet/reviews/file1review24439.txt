review/text: If you want these for dog grooming, I highly suggest them. They leave a smoother finish and the blades glide through dog hair a lot faster than plastic combs. Do not use these blades under a 40 blade. Only use them under a 30 or 15. The 40 blade is too delicate for these and the mfg suggests not using the 40 blade.
