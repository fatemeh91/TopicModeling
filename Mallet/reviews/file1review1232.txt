review/text: I got these for my 12 year old daughter because her eyebrows were really getting "out there". I didn't want her to start trying to do it on her own, and get her brows all messed up and over tweezed, and manually tweezing took too long and hurt. We found these and thought we'd give them a try. NO pain whatsoever, easy to use, and got the job done wonderfully. She has perfectly groomed mistake proof eyebrows. I did it for her the first couple of times, and now she can do her own about every other month. We both love them. I decided to start using them myself!
