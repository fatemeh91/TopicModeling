review/text: Did good, got the aluminum tubed with small screw on cap. Fresh stock from the new manufacturer so looks like they are going to continue making the old style tube and cap. FYI guy's, dont ever send anyone those plastic tubes with flip top caps, they are worthless as they leak, ooze and backwash air into the tube thus contaminating the contents. Bad idea all around. P. B. is right on that one. My order was good product, as described, shipped fast and cheap(free). Ordering again today, keepin my fingers crossed.
