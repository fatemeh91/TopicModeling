review/text: I want to thank Therese Davis for her helpful tip on finding the Personal Touch razor at Hocks.com. Thanks so much! I too have been using my Personal Touch razor for over 20 years (I am now 39). It is the ONLY razor that provides a smooth shave without the worries about nicks and skin irritation. I LOVE my Personal Touch. I needed a second one because we redid our bathroom and have a separate bath and shower, so I wanted a razor for each. I've wanted a second one for months since we finished the bathroom, but I could not find another Personal Touch, only the blades! Thanks to Amazon's reviews, I found Therese's review of the blades and her tip on where to find the razor, so I just ordered one. What a relief! I wish Schick would wake up and smell the razor burn! NO OTHER razor works as well as Personal Touch. I've tried them all and they all end up in the garbage. I will never give up my Personal Touch. Thanks Therese and Amazon!!! Tina in Ohio
