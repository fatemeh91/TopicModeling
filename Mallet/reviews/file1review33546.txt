review/text: My first one served very well for over eight years before developing a leak. The basic system is superb on all my teeth and essential on those that snag uncomfortable bits of food. The new one offers more convenient (though not perfect) placement of controls and movable parts. The only drawback is more water splashing on my hands (over the bowl)-- which I can't explain.
