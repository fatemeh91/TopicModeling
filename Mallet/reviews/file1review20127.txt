review/text: I am a health conscious person and I don't usually take supplements (besides a multi-v). I have hormonal and deppression problems and I have been told to take birth control to help with that (NO WAY!). I've been searching the internet and I narrowed it down to this and Myomin to help with my hormones. Myomin is insanely expensive and I have yet to try it, but this is the right price! I ordered it right away and have been taking it since. There have been times when I forgot to take it and my depression/moodiness have been rampant. When I take it, I feel much better and for me, that's worth it! I love that it's derived from cruciferous vegetables!
