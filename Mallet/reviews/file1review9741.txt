review/text: I needed to keep our two-year-old out of the fridge. I tried the "childproof" locks that are designated for the fridge, the ones that come in two pieces that stick on and then clip together. Those are AWFUL. With a little tugging, your kid can rip them right off and break them. Pointless. This flex lock is meant primarily for side-by-side cabinets, but I figured it would probably also work for our side-by-side fridge/freezer combo, and it does. It's a good lock if you don't want to fill your cabinets with screws (or couldn't fill your fridge with screws even if you wanted to!). Contrary to the belief of a select few, it is NOT hard to figure out how to open this lock if you give it an iota of effort. I favor my right, so I hold the middle button down with my right thumb, the left button down with my left thumb, then pull towards my right until the left zip line is completely released. Presto! I'm in my fridge in under five seconds. It's a good lock because it's too complex for a toddler to figure out and too sturdy for her to break. My only criticism of this particular listing for this item is that you can find it elsewhere online for a MUCH better price. DO look for this particular cabinet lock, DON'T bother with the newer version - it has a poor reputation for breakability.
