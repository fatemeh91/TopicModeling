review/text: Ok so.. I have used this stuff forever.. and love it.. BUT recently I've found a problem..I'm a security guard and wear the typical law enforcement uniform..And I've noticed recently that it looks like I've got incredibly sweaty armpits.. but I don't. the underarms of my uniform look wet..I've decided that the only thing it could be is the deodorant.I'm severely obsessive compulsive and it bothers me to think that I may be sweaty and smell bad.. but it also bothers me that my deodorant is making me LOOK like I'm sweaty..but oh wellit's good deodorant and the only shirts I have this problem with are my uniform shirts..
