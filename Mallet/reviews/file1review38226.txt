review/text: Compared to the generic version available at brick & mortar retailers, this has no sugar or artificial sweeteners, so it has more fiber per teaspoonful, and so even with handling & shipping it's cheaper. However, the powder is harder to dissolve. I just put it in a jar with water & shake it like a cocktail shaker and it dissolves right away. The taste is no more unpleasant than the orange stuff and it gets the job done.
