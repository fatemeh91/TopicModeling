review/text: I started looking for powdered calcium/magnesium because of a friend's advice due to sleeping trouble. This product hasn't helped me with that, but I have seen and heard that others have had great luck with it. I still use it and plan on continuing to purchase it as an easy way to get absorbable calcium. I mix it with orange juice in the mornings. It mixes pretty well and I can't taste anything other than juice. Very convenient and healthy and economical way to get my calcium and magnesium for the day!
