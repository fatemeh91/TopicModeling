review/text: Other than chewable gummies, which aren't always potent enough to be true prenatal and mother vitamins, most vitamins smell and taste disgusting to me. This one is tolerable, makes my hair grow faster, doesn't hurt my stomach, has digestive enzymes, and has all the qualities I expect in a prenatal. I haveconfidently taken it through two pregnancies now and while nursing for one year.
