review/text: I have used the Hummingbird since it first came out, recommended by my dentist, and it is outstanding! Very easy to use, effective (my teeth and gums get top marks from my dentist and periodontist), and portable. About a year ago I discovered these were no longer readily available as they used to be, and tried a Waterpik flosser -- which was more expensive, poorly designed, and much less effective. I had one remaining Hummingbird that I was guarding, and occasionally would use it after the Waterpik -- it always removed stuff the Waterpik had missed. Now that I've found the Hummingbird on-line at Amazon (I should have looked sooner), I am delighted. This item can't be beat.
