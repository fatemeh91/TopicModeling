review/text: After many years of using the Braun "straight blade" electric razor, I was very pleasantly surprised by how well and easily this shaved. My only disappointment is that there's no LED display for when the razor's power is low--it just stops. I still hate to shave, but for the $70 I paid for this, its great and I highly recommend it.
