review/text: I bought the 500mg magnesium taurate supplement (from amazon.com partners vitaminshoppe.com) and I am very pleased with the results. There are 180 pills and I am taking 1 a day (though you can take up to 2). I noticed a lessening in the frequency of PVCs within 48 hours and by the 5th day they had all but disappeared from counts in the 1000s.I had finally gone to see a cardiologist and was told that I would be using a 30 day event monitor about a week before starting magnesium taurate. I mentioned this supplement to him and he asked me why I thought that this supplement was safer than FDA-approved prescription drugs. He said he might want to put me on medication to lower my HR (which was 109 in his office). I told him that the omeprazole I was on (for GERD) was making my HR faster (and nerves!) but he prescribed the 30 day event monitor (I had already worn the 24 hour Holter 4 years prior and was told 2 months ago - that's how rarely I go to the doctor - that I was diagnosed with PVCs hence my need to finally see a cardiologist).So, I started taking magnesium taurate the day after strapping on the 30 day event monitor. Day 1 my baseline resting HR was 105. Yesterday, after 2 weeks on magnesium taurate my resting HR was 72. My PVCs have all but disappeared. I had a few yesterday but that may be due to the fact that I just started my menstrual cycle yesterday. Today I am back to 0 PVCs and no tachycardic episodes (I have only had one minor one since starting magnesium taurate and registered it on the monitor but my HR was back to normal within 2 - 3 minutes and the HR was nowhere near as fast as it has gone in the past).So, coincidence or is this mineral supplement working? I want to think it's working. I feel like a black cloud has been lifted off my shoulders. I am hopeful that it's the magnesium taurate. I WILL be telling the cardiologist about these results. If it saves me from having to have a wire fed into my heart then it works for me! :o)
