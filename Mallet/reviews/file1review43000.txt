review/text: I was looking for an environmentally friendly alternative to those other "Clean Shower" products. I have an enclosed shower and, when used daily after my shower, they really help prevent soap scum buildup and hard water stains on my tile and glass. However, those "other" brands have such heavy fumes that I can't stand using them. I spray this stuff when I am still in the shower, and it's just too small of a space to be in with all those fumes! Mrs. Meyers Clean Shower is light and fresh and it doesn't fume me out of the bathroom. One bottle does not last a long time though. If I'm lucky, it lasts for about 2 weeks (but me and my husband use it, and sometimes my husband showers twice a day). It's worth it though -- my shower looks beautiful, even if I haven't given it a good scrubbing in a month. Shhhhh.
