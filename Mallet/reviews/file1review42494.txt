review/text: I bought a 2-lb jug of the vanilla at the Vitamin Shoppe locally. What sold me on this brand over the ON brand, which was the same price, was the lower cholesterol count...everything else being essentially equal. I was not disappointed with the taste..it tastes just fine for a protein. It looks like a high quality product to me. I'll be buying more.
