review/text: Every review I have read regarding the Gillette Fusion razor and blades has been from a male. I am a female and love this razor for my legs and underarms! I received mine in the mail as a promotion about a year ago, and am still on the original blade! I often use my Remington electric shaver, but when I want a really smooth, close shave that lasts almost a week, I use my Gillette Fusion. So, while I've had it a year, I've probably used it a couple dozen times and the blade is just now starting to dull. I agree with others that the trimmer on the reverse side is a gimmick, especially for a female who doesn't shave sideburns or nose hair. My only complaint, like many other users of the Gillette Fusion, is the cost of replacement cartridges. Thankfully, one or two cartridges will last me a very long time!
