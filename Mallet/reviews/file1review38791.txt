review/text: It's what I drink immediately after working out, following the "Golden Hour" rule (have a carb/protein snack within 1 hr. after heavy workout, helps with recovery, building muscle, metabolism...). I could have a peanut butter sandwich, or even chocolate milk, but this is full of vitamins, goes down quickly and has fiber!
