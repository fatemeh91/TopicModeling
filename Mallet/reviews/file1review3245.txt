review/text: These tweezers cost more than the ones at the drug store but they are so worth it. In an effort to save money, I have not been waxing my eyebrows as often. These tweezers may it easy to keep up with my eyebrows in between waxings. If I leave this tweezers out on the bathroom sink, they are known to disappear - My husband loves them and he normally does not comment on mundane things such as tweezers. Great purchase.
