review/text: I love the Derma E skincare line. I've been using this product for two months of my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks. Approaching the eighth month and not a single sign of a stretch mark - highly recommend! Not to mention a little goes a long way, so the jar lasts a long time. Good price for a great product.
