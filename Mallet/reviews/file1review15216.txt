review/text: I've tried almost EVERY bar there is out there! Learned the hard way not to JUST look at the protein to carb,to fat ratios!Watch out for the myriad of bars with sucrolose & other "BAD" sweetners! If you aren't up on them, do a google search & read the negative side effects instead of the advertising hype put out by the manufacturers!The balance bars have NO SUCROLOSE or artificial sweetners !! YAY!!Even though I PREFER the protein to be from ANYTHING other than soy.... which sadly these are.........I cannot help but buy cases of these that I "rotate" with my 'healthier" non-soy" bars WHY?? You might ask............it's because they taste so GOOD! I absolutely LOVE the latest line up of "Bare Bars" so do my kids, we take out 4 different bars EVERY morning & cut them up so everyone gets some of each flavor, YUMMM!! then somedays we cannot help ourselves & have to open up 4 more!! LOL :-)This is what we refer to as our 1st breakfast VERY eary in the morning when we all gather for a cup of tea or milk, & have family devotions, then after household chores are completed & our school day begins the kids have their second breakfast, I go off to do my workout, usually weights for 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes, then I get my second "breakfast"of a Bare bar, currently LOVING chocolate almond or a mix of pieces of Balance bars & others like the Cliff Builders bars (the Vanilla Almond is my fav there) or a thinkthin chunky Peanut, to keep my muscles refueled to rebuild & keep my metabolism boosted!It works well for me, I am 50 years old 5'5' (about) & weigh 110 to 115, & a size 4! There are other foods that can do the same thing, but they don't satisfy a sweet craving like these babies do! I just have to hide my fav's from the kids!!
