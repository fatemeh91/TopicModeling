review/text: I have been using Smooth Move for about 7 or 8 years. I was having problems with constipation and found nothing would work for an extended length of time. A friend suggested Smooth Move, I tried it and the rest is history. I have a cup of Smooth Move every evening between 8 and 9 pm. In the morning it serves it's purpose and has been year after year. I love it and I still enjoy the taste. Consider me a lifer.
