review/text: I purchased these bars to use as a meal replacement when I didn't have time or was not in a place where I could get a meal. I read other reviews and went with the choc. choc chunk and they were right; this is better than the other flavors. It's like eating dessert for a meal and still not cheating. I like that there is no soy in it also.
