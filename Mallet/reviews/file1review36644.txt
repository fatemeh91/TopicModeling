review/text: I've always liked the scent of Irish Spring very much. The soap lathered very well, in comparison to the liquid soaps I've been using. It worked much better for shaving than the liquid soap -- the lather was very thick and smooth. Also, I felt nice and clean after using it. It's too early to tell, but so far it even seems that the bar soap will last longer, and be cheaper to use, than the liquid soaps.
