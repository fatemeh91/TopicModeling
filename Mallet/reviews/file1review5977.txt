review/text: My wife and I were looking for a wrist model pressure monitor that was accurate and reasonably priced. I did a lot of looking at reviews here and other sites. I also looked in local stores as well. I found this model in one of our big-chain pharmacy outlets for $69.95. Just for the heck of it, I came here and looked and found the same unit for $45 with no shipping costs. It was a no-brainer and we are very pleased with the unit we bought here. Aside from the cost, which was secondary after deciding on this particular unit, it was the reviews by previous customers, including a nurse that convinced us to take a chance on the Omron HEM-629. It is reasonably priced, is accurate, and you don't need to be an RN to operate it. If you are looking for a wrist unit, and do not need ultra-tech stuff, then this is a good buy for the money.
