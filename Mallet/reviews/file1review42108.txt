review/text: As a Physical Therapist, I knew I would need some extra support to stay on my feet helping patients. That was 4 pregnancies and 2 garments ago. Each of my Cradles have been loaned to friends, and wear well through 3 pregnancies!Once I hit 4 months pregnant, I really appreciate the support it gives me. Other, smaller straps just didn't contain my tummy, and I like that I can just slide it up or down as my activity requires. Occasionally I get impatient with the shoulder straps, but when I am REALLY big (after 30wks) the straps are indispensible.
