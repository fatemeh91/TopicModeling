review/text: The balm melts a bit when applied, coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but isn't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents aren't as strong as others but they're pretty true to their name :) Dessert/creamy ones tend to be "weaker" and citrus/tangy ones are stronger. My favorites (I'm a fruity/tangy lover) are midori and gummy bear.
