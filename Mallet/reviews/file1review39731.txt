review/text: I take one capsule every week night to help me get a good night's sleep. I still have an occasional sleepless night, but many more good nights than bad nights now. Also, the quality of my sleep is better. I also like this product because it's difficult to find just 1 mg; most brands have 2.5, 3 or 5 mg. My husband takes two capsules, or 2 mg, and I take one, so it's perfect for us. And I prefer capsules to tablets, so it works for me on that score, too.
