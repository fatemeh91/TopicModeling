review/text: 5.0 out of 5 stars don't think I can live without!, October 5, 2010By Samantha Addonizio - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Solgar - Formula Vm-75, 180 tablets (Health and Beauty)I've been taking this vitamin since about 2000...when I run out and stop taking the vitamin, the change in my energy levels and general feeling of well being is extremely noticeable. I finally got my husband to start taking these a few years ago (he did not believe in vitamin supplements) and he is a convert. We make sure not to run out anymore. I do not think I could live my life without them....between working full-time, raising two kids, working out...I need as much energy as I can get and these really help. I am glad to see other reviewers feel the same. Studies have come out that say vitamins don't do much but I don't think this particular vitamin was included...because anyone who has used regularly will tell you it DOES make a difference. Btw, if taking the pill first thing in the morning bothers your tummy, try taking at night after dinner.
