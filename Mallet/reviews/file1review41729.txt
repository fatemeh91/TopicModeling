review/text: If you have children that always seem to cut short the time spent brushing, this is a great toothbrush. The toothbrush splits the time spent brushing into 4 time periods. After 30 seconds of brushing the top front, it will pause slightly so you will then go to the front back, etc... It is great for my children because not only does it remind them to change parts of the mouth, but it also gives a happy face on the screen if they complete the entire 2 minute routine. My kids love to tell me that they have gotten the happy face! I also have a happy face knowing that they are getting cleaner teeth!
