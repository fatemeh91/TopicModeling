review/text: The product works very well. Some of the design functionality could improve. The cord wraps on the bottom so you have to lift and turn over before and after use to unwrap and rewrap the cord. It easily fills with pitchers of water (to avoid filling and carrying to where you wish to sit) but to drain the water you either have to lift it (and it isn't light when filled) or put on pedestal to allow to drain into a basin so you don't have to lift to empty out. Other than that it is fine.
