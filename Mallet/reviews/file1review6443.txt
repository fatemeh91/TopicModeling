review/text: I am a massage therapist. This simple versatile tool, used correctly, is invaluable for relieving tension and pain. You can be as inventive as you want with it. I personally like to lay on the floor and lever my body against it to break up really hard areas of tension, such as the quadratus lumborum (the source of many people's low back pain). With this tool and some practice you can get to a lot of muscles that you just wouldn't be able to get to without a massage therapist doing some deep tissue.Here is how I recommend using it: an inanimate object is no replacement for hands, so if possible, feel the area of tension with your fingers and figure out which angle (important) to apply the pressure. Then just maneuver the tool around to that spot, and dig in slowly, making sure not to engage the same muscle you are digging into. Muscles under tension take time to relax, so be prepared to spend some time on that spot, gradually increasing the pressure while breathing, and feeling again with your fingers for progress afterward. Less tension or pain, better range of motion, and improved blood flow to the area are all signs of tense muscles releasing. The spot might be sore afterward which is normal, so don't overdo it.Helpful notes - Tingling and "falling asleep" feelings are signs of impeded blood flow (oops, you're on a blood vessel or vein). Pain that shoots down a limb and gets worse with sustained pressure is a sign of nerve irritation (oops, you're on a nerve). Numbness in the area, even after you are off the area, is a sign that you disturbed the nerve by trying to go WAY too deep.I've been using it now for over a year.... the more you use it, the better you get at it, and therefore the more effective it is.If you always find yourself trying to rub "that spot" after a long day, this will help you.
