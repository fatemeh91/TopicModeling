review/text: I love this detergent! Our clothes are brighter & stains don't stain! On a recent trip to my mother-in-law's she commented on how clean & bright our clothes were (we have a toddler & a baby) we washed our clothes in her (brand name) detergent & I was shocked at how dingy they looked after coming out of the dryer. We came home & re-washed them in BioKleen & they were as good as new again. I can't recommend this enough! And at only 2 Tablespoons per wash it is extremely cost effective.
