review/text: Cleans well, smells great, and is safe for all surfaces. This is the only cleaner my husband has commented on, saying he likes it AND which he often sprays and uses himself happily. Normally, he wrinkles up his nose at chemically things and avoids them like the plague. Not this.Smells clean, not chemical-y, and leaves counters smooth, vs sticky or covered in residue.I use it daily on my granite countertops, on my stainless steel faucet and sink, as well as on my induction glass cooktop and also inside and outside my convection microwave unit. Haven't tried it on my stainless steel fridge or stainless stovefront, as I had been using something else prior and am going to use that up first. I use it on my ceramic bathroom sinks and compositione countertops, too.You can use microfiber cloths, sponges or paper towels with this spray-on cleaner; all work equally well.Love this stuff.
