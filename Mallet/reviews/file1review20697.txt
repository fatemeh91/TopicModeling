review/text: This is my third replacement cutter/foil combo since I started using the Braun Shaver in Jan. of 2006. I replaced the first set on schedule after 18 months of use but the second set only lasted 12 months when the foil wore through and began nicking my neck. I really can't blame the quality of the product as I shave every day and have a thick growth. A year of service is very good when you consider the amount of work it does.
