review/text: I have bought two BabyBjorn Toilet Trainers for my elongated toilets...they are a bit more expensive but so worth every penny...they don't shift when tightened onto the toilet seat...I have tried other seats & they moved all around which scared my son...my son can easily put it on and off the toilet seat himself...it has a convienent loop on the end that I can attach to a hook for easy storage...it works great for little boys who need to sit down when first being train...the tinkle stays in the potty. I highly recommend this potty seat especially if you have an elongated toilet seat and/or a little boy!!!
