review/text: This stuff is just plain gross. I can't even get past the smell of it, or the bright red (obviously artificial) color of it. And, you have to take a full TEASPOON of it! I tried to keep it in my mouth for 30 seconds, and made it about 5 before gagging and spitting it out! The container leaks while standing up too, so if you don't want anything stained bright red, put it into a bag or something. Being on Atkins, I needed a "pick me up" vitamin, and this is not it. Has 2 carbs per teaspoon, which likely means SUGAR...which is not listed in the ingredients. I threw this in the trash after one try. Don't waste your money. YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!
