review/text: Even after reading some of the weak reviews, I figured there would be no harm in spending about $30 on a beard trimmer. Howeverm like a lot of the other feedback, this shaver worked about 10 times, before promptly dying after being turned for 3 seconds each time. I do want to note that I charged it overseas (where I live) using an adapter. This has never impacted any other appliances I've purchased, but I did want to note it. My recommendation: spend a few more $$'s, and get something that will last
