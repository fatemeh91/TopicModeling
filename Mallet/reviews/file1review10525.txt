review/text: We bought this for my wife's grandmother after pricing a similar cane offered directly from her HMO. The HMO wanted 70 dollars for the same cane. My wife's grandmother loves that it is lightweight and offers her stability. She attends an elderly facility a few days during the week. All of the staff were impressed and are interested in ordering for other patients. Highly recommended!
