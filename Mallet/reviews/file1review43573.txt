review/text: Nothing fancy here, just good functionality. The memory and average functions are useful for reviewing BP trends. The best thing about this monitor is its simplicity: just stick your arm in the cuff and switch it on--in a few seconds your BP is displayed. Note: If the circumfrence of your upper arm is more than 13 inches you will need the larger arm cuff. I have only had the machine for about a month so I can't speak to its durability.
