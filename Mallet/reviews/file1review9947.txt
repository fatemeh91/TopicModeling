review/text: I purchased a pair of these tweezers to help me fix a very delicate gold chain necklace that had gotten tangled. No other tool in the house was effective, but once I got these, I was able to fix the necklace very easily.What makes these tweezers so great is that they have a sharp tip that is very good at holding on to whatever it grabs. They also hold their shape (i.e. they don't bend) like other tweezers do. I use these tweezers now for all my "tweezing" needs.I think everyone should have a pair of these tweezers on hand.
