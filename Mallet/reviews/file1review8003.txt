review/text: I've used my 10 year Ettore 18&#34; squeegee for 10 years; mostly for the shower stall but also for cleaning the outside windows every year. The blade was going bad; I tried to clean it to no avail. The squeegee itself was not available through Amazon and the local box stores didn't carry it either but luckily Amazon stocked the replacement blade. I'm good to go for another 10 years.
