review/text: My doctor told me to buy this because my back pain was so bad by my 3rd month that I couldn't stand upright without a pinching pain in my lower back. Within two days my back pain was at a tolerable level, and now I am even exercising! It is a little difficult to get on, and it shows with ALL of my maternity clothing, but it is worth it. I tightened two straps with safety pins so it is a lot more comfortable for my growing belly. This is the exact invention that I needed. With a toddler running around I couldn't be laying in bed all day. If I have any more children, I will definetly use this.
