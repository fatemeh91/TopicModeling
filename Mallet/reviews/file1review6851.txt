review/text: We purchased this magnifier to use with our photo negatives which were getting harder and harder to review. We use a lighted screen to view our slides and negatives and though this would be a good addition to see some of the detail in the films. We did not expect it to be super great mainly due to the cheap prices. The magnifier is worth what we paid however it is not a top notch quality piece of glass.If you need really fine details in whatever you are magnifying you would be better off paying for a high quality magnifier. If you are not concerned about finer details then this glass might serve your purpose.
