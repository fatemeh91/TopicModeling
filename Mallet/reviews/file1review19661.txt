review/text: I have two of these. One for home one for Nana's house. My son feels comfortable on it. It is sturdy and easy to clean. No creases for urine to get stuck in. No removable pieces.For now, my son straddles the seat and puts his hands on the raised area in the front meant for catching little boy's stream. This position allows him to lean forward and get everything in the water.
