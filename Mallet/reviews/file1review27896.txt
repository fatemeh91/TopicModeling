review/text: I used to get by just fine on the good old Body Fortress whey they sold at Wal Mart. Then, they changed it from 3 carbs a serving to 7. So after looking at the 1500 positive reviews on here, I decided to try this. I am a little disappointed. I like to make baked goods like cookies and protein bars out of my whey protein, and this stuff was just OK. The texture is pretty gritty and it doesn't have much vanilla flavor at all. It's bland when you get right down to it. It's also not sweet enough, and I have to add some other form of sweetener whenever I use it. It doesn't taste great in shake form, either. Just a big glass of bland blah-ness, but at least it does dissolve pretty well in a shaker bottle. It's definitely cheaper on here than it was at my local GNC, but in all honesty, I wish they would've just left my Body Fortress alone. It may not have been as good a quality whey protein as this is purported to be, but it sure did taste a lot better. I have not tried the other flavors, but to me, Vanilla ice cream was a DUD.
