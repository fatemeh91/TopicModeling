review/text: I purchased this tub for my 5 month old daughter and LOVE it! This is the perfect transition from infant tub to full-size tub. I would highly recommend the Snug-Tub over any bath seat. It is so much easier to clean baby's bottom in the Snug-Tub than in a bath seat. Rinsing hair is a breeze and there is plenty of room to grow!
