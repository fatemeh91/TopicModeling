review/text: I used to be able to find Dip-it at the grocery store. I have been using it for years because I love the old-fashioned coffee percolators. The last few times that I looked for it in the stores, they had Dip-it, but all they had was the liquid. I needed the powdered version in the box and I was really excited when I discovered that Amazon.com carried it. I ordered a box, received it very promptly and used it to remove all of the built-up stains in my coffee pot. I just can't get over the difference in my coffee pot before and after Dip-it. This product is so easy to use...I just filled the coffee pot with water, put a couple of spoons full of the product into the basket where the coffee would go, plugged the pot in and let it go through 1 brew cycle. The next time I took the lid off of the pot, took everything out and rinsed it thoroughly, the pot looked brand new. It was just as clean and shiny as it was the day I first bought it! I'm very impressed with Dip-it...it does a great job!Thank you, Amazon.com, for carrying this product.
