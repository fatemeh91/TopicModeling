review/text: I love this potty seat. I can't even begin to tell you how great it is. It's made out of sturdy plastic that seems as if it will last a long time. It fits snugly in/on the toilet with no problems. The adjusting mechanism is genius. It's super easy to clean and I don't have to worry about the seat absorbing any bathroom nastiness. It comes off the toilet quickly and easily for adult users and the handle allows for easy hanging. My son loves sitting on it and hasn't looked or acted uncomfortable during use. He has great confidence sitting on this seat. The splash guard isn't too short or too high and the hole is just the right size for my potty-training toddler. We haven't had any issues as of yet and I am thrilled to own this. We tried self-standing potty chairs as well as the seats that attach to the toilet. This is by far my favorite.
