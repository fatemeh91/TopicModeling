review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I used the Old Spice Deodorant. I didn't think I was going to like it -- but I DID!! It was a great compliment to Old Spice After-Shave and Cologne. I'll be buying this product the next time I need deodorant. My wife also liked the smell of this product.
