review/text: We have been using this seat for about 6 months with our toddler boy. I love how it attaches to the seat easily and securely. Once it's on, it doesn't budge, but it removes easily. However, if our son sits down to pee, he gets pee all over the place. Even with him holding his private part down with his finger. The cheap "bob the builder" toilet seat does a better job of keeping the pee in the toilet while he is sitting. I wish they would make the seat more compatible with boys.
