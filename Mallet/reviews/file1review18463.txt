review/text: I have owned several Cross pens since graduating from high school in 1968. I have owned this Townsend pen for many years and paid about $100. The refills are expensive but that comes with the territory. However, the friction fit cap is problematic. There is a nylon or plastic liner in the cap which fails to grasp the pen over time. I have had it replaced once, and now need to do it again. Good news is that Cross offers a "free lifetime" repair warranty. The bad news is that Cross charges $10 "handling" charge for this free service, after the customer pays to ship it back to them. Free ain't what it used to be. Sorry, Cross, but I would not recommend the Townsend series in any flavor.
