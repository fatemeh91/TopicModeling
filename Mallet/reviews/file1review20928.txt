review/text: After 30 years of shaving with a blade, I have finally found an electric razor that works good enough to abandon the blade. I have been using this for over two years now and I am very pleased with the results (so is my wife!) As long as I use it everyday, or maybe skip one day once in a while, it works great. After a vacation from shaving, I need to get out the blade again or go to a barbershop.
