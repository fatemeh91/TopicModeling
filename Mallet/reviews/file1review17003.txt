review/text: I had a rather bushy goatee and decided to trim it down to professional level. When using this product as advised I found it quite difficult to get through the hair. Using it in reverse of recommended works, but then you're not really able to pick the length. It definitely seems to struggle with hair of any real length or thickness. I'll be getting a different one for Christmas.
