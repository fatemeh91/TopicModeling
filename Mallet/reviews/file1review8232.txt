review/text: I'm not sure which brush some of the other reviewers were using, but it clearly isn't this one. It easily fits into narrow necked bottles. Our family uses SIGG bottles and it does an excellent job with both the .6L and the 1L versions. Though it's barely long enough for the full size 1L bottles, it does work well. As other reviews have said, the neck of the brush is flexible, but that may be misleading. I was concerened when I read those because I thought that it was "pose-able", but no it just bends under pressure and straightens back out. The bristles are probably soft enough for plastic, but are stiff enough to clean around the small dents in an aluminum bottle. Really the biggest problem for me is; where do you store it when you're not using it? :)PROS:OXO tactile rubbery gripExcellent balance between too soft and too firm bristlesLong bristles and narrow head to clean almost any type bottleCONS:VERY close to being too short (effective length 8)May actually be too short for some of the klean kanteen bottles I've seenTHE BOTTOM LINE:Great Product!
