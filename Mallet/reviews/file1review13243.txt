review/text: My husband and I have been very pleased with this pad. It washes well and holds up. It can hold a lot of liquid, throw-up, pee, etc. without ever going through. We wish we could find a full mattress cover that we are as happy with as this pad. It is a tremendous value considering it's quality and durability- and, we have put it through about everything!
