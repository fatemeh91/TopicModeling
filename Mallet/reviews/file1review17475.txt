review/text: I bought this in may of 2012. I use it once or twice a week to trim my beard. The battery now dies after just one or two uses and needs to be recharged. You can't use the clippers while they are being recharged. This has made me late on a couple of occasions because I get half way through trimming my beard and the battery dies. Then I have to wait for it to charge before I can finish trimming my beard. I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted 5 years before I bought this one. I don't see why this one only lasted 3 months.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT LASTS!!!
