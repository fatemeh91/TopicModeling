review/text: Phenomenal, Son loves it when cold, never had an issue with this.Product itself is a little expensive, but then u get what u pay for.One major issue with fish oils is that the fish that give these oils tend to build up concentrations of Mercury, this product is clean of all harmful toxins, and never ever had an issue with it, Definitely noticed a lot of good progress in 3 yr old with this.Just need to be regular.
