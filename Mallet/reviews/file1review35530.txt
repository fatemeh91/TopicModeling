review/text: After hearing about this product, I was prepared for a horrible taste. It's not so bad - tastes like balsamic vinegar salad dressing. I know that I sure feel better since I've started taking it. In the first week, I lost which I can only describe as the bloat in my stomach. I feel slimmer and trimmer. Good stuff!!
