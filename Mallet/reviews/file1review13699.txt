review/text: I can't rely on it alone. I still have to take lots of tryptophane and melatonin too. But it helps promote a more relaxed sleep. I've suffered insomnia for decades so I'm a difficult case. I've found when I try something new to help sleeping it only works for a few weeks then my body seems to get wise to it. But this seems to keep working.
