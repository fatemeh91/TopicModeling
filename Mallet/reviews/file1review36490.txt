review/text: Okay, not to turn into a Calgon commercial here, but I really do LOVE this deodorant. It works well, and best of all, it smells (to my nose, at least) simply wonderful! ( I know, I know, cue the music, and the soft twirling of pettycoats!)Can you tell I love the smell of roses? This is "wild rose" and the Weleda take seems to have a hint of citrus in it as well, but it is fresh and lovely, and again, to my nose, not very cloying, or overly sweet as some rose scents can be.I can see here on the reviews that some folks didn't really care for the scent. If you are in doubt, I know that most natural food stores (i.e. "Whole Paycheck", "Wild Goats", and "New Sneezins",(PDX)) carry this in the natural beauty sections, and often have a sample open. And since the price in these stores is often double what it is on Amazon, this is a real treat for me to order it here! ( I mean, $16 for deodorant? That's enough to wilt even the heartiest of "Flowers"...) Woo-hoo!
