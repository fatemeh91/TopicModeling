review/text: The Back Buddy is a large double hook-shaped device made of sturdy plastic. You use it to release tension in your muscles, specifically your back and shoulders. But I've watched instructional videos that show it being used on other parts of the body. I get super tight muscles in my back, shoulders and neck. I think this is pretty typical. The Back Buddy allows you to put the nodules directly on the muscle that is tight and hold it till it releases. I think it's important to breathe when you are holding it. I also use a foam roller for my back. The Back Buddy is a very different experience. But I think I need to practice more with the Back Buddy. I've had it for several months. The AccuMassage that came packaged with the Back Buddy is another plastic device that closes with two golf ball type nodes at the top. You line it on the back of your neck and squeeze the two bars together to target neck muscles. You can use it in other ways as well for muscle release. I was less impressed with AccuMassage. I think it is less effective and less versatile. It does seem to be well constructed. I will continue to use the Back Buddy, especially around my shoulder blades for small tight muscles that need to loosen up. I will also continue to use my foam roller, which is more like a rolling pin for your back and hits more areas more gently.
