review/text: I had found these inserts at a local retail store about 3 years ago and thought they would never work because they were hard plastic. I had tried everything I could think of for my plantar fasciitis and nothing worked until these. They relieved my foot and arch pain almost immediately.I just bought 2 more pairs after completely wearing out my original pair after 3 years. I use them in any enclosed shoe (thin and easy to insert into any shoe). I'm at the gym 6 days/week and these inserts are awesome!
