review/text: I have contacted the seller and he argued with me about what I ordered. I ordered and paid for Protein powder drink mix but got personalized protein powder. The seller argued with me about what I ordered, even though the picture, the price and the description said drink mix. I did not return my order because I didn't feel I could trust the seller after our communications.
