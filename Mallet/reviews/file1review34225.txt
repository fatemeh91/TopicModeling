review/text: I have had severe internal and external hemorrhoids for over 2 weeks. Using traditional products, I have brought the discomfort level from an 8 on a 0-10 scale down to a 5. It is still unbearable. I have used multiple different OTC ointments and my physician could offer no advice other than "keep doing what you're doing." I used this for the first time just a few minutes ago and applied only a very small amount (less than 1 gram) to the external and internal area of the sphincter. Within 1 minute, I got complete relief and am sitting here without a pillow or a doughnut totally pain free.
