review/text: This product works well for travelers using rental cars or airlines. I gave it four as opposed to five stars because the adjustment process (blowing into a tube then trying it) is inherently a litte tedious. And over-inflating can be bad for your back as well.On the other hand, it stuffs into your carry-on/briefcase with no problem and works well once adjusted. So the ability to deflate it completely is also inherent to its value.
