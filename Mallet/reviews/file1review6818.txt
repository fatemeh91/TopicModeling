review/text: I like the size of this magnifier for checking out old family slides and negatives. It fits nicely over the neg/slide so that I can see all of it in one view. However, it does exhibit considerable pincushion distortion at the sides of the image that you're viewing. Other than that, I really like it for checking old family slides and negs before I scan them into my iMac.
