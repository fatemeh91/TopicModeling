review/text: Tea tree oil is indeed safe in small amounts. I admit I have taken up to double even triple doses of this product in desperate times on antibiotics with AMAZING fast results, haven't had not one bad effect from it. I take many soloray products and have better health then anyone I know. My opinion on reviews of this product warning stomach bleeding- you take more risk with your everyday pain reliever/ aspirins.
