review/text: This liquid soap is great for washing windows. You don't have to rinse this off. It is great for getting stains out of clothing. It cuts through grease in the dish water. It isn't hard on the hands, doesn't dry them out like some harsh cleaners do. Why can't we buy this in the stores anymore? I've looked all over for it and can't find it anywhere!!!!!
