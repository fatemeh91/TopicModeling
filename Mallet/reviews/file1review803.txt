review/text: This repair kit has an excellent selection of lots of various screw sizes and had just what I wanted for my glasses. The cost was not expensive and delivery was fast. I have to use a walker or scooter so going to the store to fix my glasses would have been a big chore. This kit enabled me to do everything at home quickly.
