review/text: I dont get it. I read the reviews and and was really looking foward to trying this. I have alot of trouble with stress-related headaches and neck soreness from tension and I really wanted to love this. It was..usless. I threw it away after the third attempt. The buckwheat does not heat evenly. The heat doesnt get held for more than a few minutes. The scent of lavender..well...it smells really off and I dont know why. I really was disapointed.
