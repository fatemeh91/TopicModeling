review/text: Great product and great price. Have not stopped using this since it arrived! Warms easily and heat is moist (the best). My son used it to warm his bed one night and now I'm probably going to have to buy another one. It is cold here in the midwest and we warmed it up one morning to use in the car on the way to school. Kept him toasty warm!
