review/text: I researched for quite some time on the internet about add and adhd symptoms. My 13 yr old son posed enough of the symptoms to make me believe this is why he behaves the way he does. I have always been a fan of natural remedies over meds. There are so many that work. I found this site and was immediately excited to try it. I had it overnight shipped and started my son the next day. There are no side effects. He definitely has no more night terrors and doesn't talk in his sleep all night. He sleeps through the night quietly. He says he never would have been able to study for test in class and make b's on them without this bright spark. He also takes brain tonic and the focus formula. There is a difference when he is on break from school and slacks his normal dosage. But definitely worth the money. It also may take several weeks to see full effects.
