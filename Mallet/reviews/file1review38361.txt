review/text: I bought my first epilator six years ago. My old Satinelle is still working but it's slow, so I bought this model and it's really faster as promised. If you are not satisfied with your epilator's performance, I recommend this model. The only thing that I didn't like is that the cord is attached to the side and sometimes it gets in the way.About epilators in general, it's the best method I found to keep my legs smooth. Shaving is cheap but the results won't last and I always end up cutting myself. Waxing gives long-lasting results but it's expensive and when I'm over, my fingers are all sticky. Also waxing doesn't work if hair is short and while I'm waiting for it to grow, my legs don't look their best.On the other hand, epilators work best when hair is short (1-2 mm). Never try to use it on long hair, because it hurts a lot and the hair will break before it gets pulled from the root. If your hair is long, it's better to shave it first and wait for two days before trying this product. Pulling hair from the root always hurts, but it will hurt less and less with time. Hold your skin taut and use this product frequently to keep your hair short and your legs smooth. You will save money (compared to waxing) and time (compared to shaving). And don't be afraid to try it on your underarms and bikini area. You may find that these areas are not as sensitive as you thought they would be and epilated underarms look smoother than shaved ones.
