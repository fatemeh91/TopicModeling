review/text: At $9.89 a bottle for twice the amount (Boston cleaner costs this for one ounce), including super saver shipping, plus the positive reviews, I decided to try this product and have been using it for the past three weeks. I have been wearing hard contact lenses since they first came out. When was that? Okay, I was about 15, and it has been 49 years since they were invented (don't do the rest of the math). Suffice to say that I have tried a lot of cleaning products. The one thing that I have particularly noticed is that the cleaner takes any deposits off the lenses and keeps them clear throughout the day. I'm so pleased with the performance of this cleaner that I'm about to order another bottle while the price is low.
