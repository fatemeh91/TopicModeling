review/text: My husband owned a Wahl & had it for years. At least 10. It finally wore out or got damaged in the many moves we did; although he was still using it just fine. I surprised him with a very expensive Norelco (on sale) which he tried and just mentioned that he really liked the Wahl better - trying not to hurt my feelings. He swapped his father for the expensive Braun, with the cleaning system, that dad got for Christmas and STILL wanted another Wahl. So we gave the Norelco and Braun away & I bought this Wahl for him. He likes the different heads & the overall handling of it fits his face with a good shave (as he puts it). I even went so far as to buy him a second one to keep on our boat when we're traveling.
