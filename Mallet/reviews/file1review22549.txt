review/text: I received this as a gift before my daughter was born and thought it was a pretty neat idea. After she arrived and I tried to use it one night, I found out quite differently! When I placed the pacifier in her mouth, if she'd been able to speak, she would have said something like "What is this?" and proceeded to promptly SPIT it out. I tried a second time and got the same response. We have always used the Avent pacifiers and this thermometer is shaped quite differently. If you have a baby that isn't used to this type of pacifier, buying this thermometer will be a waste of money. Ours is in a drawer and will never be used. We're sticking with the regular thermometer.
