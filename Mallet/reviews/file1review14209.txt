review/text: I am not naturally well-lubricated, so my husband and I rely on personal lubricants for pleasurable intimacy. This is my very favorite so far.I am sensitive to many lubes I tried before (they gave me yeast infections), but this one has never presented me with any problems. It is also the best-feeling for penetrative sex. The only drawback is that it doesn't taste great. I still rate it 5-star. My sex-life would not be half as good without it.
