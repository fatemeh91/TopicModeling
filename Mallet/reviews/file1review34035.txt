review/text: I purchased this product from another site, but it's the exact same product. I left a review there, but I want to leave one here too. This would be a great product if it was made better. This lasted two uses for me, and then the red brush part detached. No, I wasn't trying to remove back from a tree or anything, just lint and pet hair from my clothes and futon. Save your money, don't buy this product. Buy the sticky rollers, or (I can't vouch for this but) 3M has a brush, I'm going to try that instead. If that doesn't work it's back to sticky rollers..
