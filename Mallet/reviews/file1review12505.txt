review/text: I believed all these great reviews. I am sure some people like this product, but I found it toxic. I also do not appreciate the fake reviews.If you want rampant diarrhea and cramping, this is the product for you.To say this cleanses the colon walls when nothing else does is a joke. You need to take extra pancreatin or other enzymes for that. Just having rampant diarrhea will not cleanse your colon walls.This product is really overpriced. I rarely throw away supplements, but after trying it twice, I could not bear a repeat.I recommend doing a regular colon cleanse, taking triphala and also taking pro-biotics for chronic constipation. A good colon cleanse will also help to purify your blood and liver also. This product just cannot do that.
