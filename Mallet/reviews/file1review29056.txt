review/text: I have battled with blades, razors and beard trimmer for years. Finally, here's a machine that does it all. This not only will cut through your mangled, knotty beard to a nice stubble, it will also take that stubble down to nothing. The single foil edge makes shaving a breeze. My entire chin gets cleaned up without a problem. I highly recommend it.
