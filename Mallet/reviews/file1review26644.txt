review/text: This cushion lasted just long enough that I couldn't return it to Amazon. It developed a severe leak, and would not stay inflated for more than a few minutes. In looking at the reviews, other people experienced this same problem. Buyer beware. Don't waste your money on this product. It was a good cushion while it lasted, but one does expect something like this to last a bit longer than 40 days.Update 02/2008: The manufacturer saw this review, and sent me two replacement Back Boosters at no cost to me. I must say that I am impressed with the company's extremely proactive willingness to make things right. I will test out the replacement, and post a further update.03/28/2008: I would agree with the review from "Cat's Meow" posted in January, 2008. Three stars - it's an adequate product, but not too helpful for someone with severe chronic back pain.
