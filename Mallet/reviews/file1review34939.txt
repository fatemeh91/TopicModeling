review/text: The sublingual form is much more effective, sooner, than the oral. They made a 5mg one for awhile & that was even better than the 3mg but it's not available anymore that I know of. It helped me fall asleep but that wasn't the real problem. It was staying asleep. I now use an oral 5mg melatonin as a supplement because older people don't usually produce enough. I just get it locally & it works well now that I've solved more of the other sleep problems I had.
