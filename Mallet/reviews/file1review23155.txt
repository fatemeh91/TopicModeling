review/text: This is the only sweeper we would buy. They don't build them any better. We had the first one for seven years of commercial use, then brought it home for two more years. This time I bought two Bissell 22012 Swift Sweepers. We use one in the garage, one in the basement and one on the main floor for quick clean-ups.
