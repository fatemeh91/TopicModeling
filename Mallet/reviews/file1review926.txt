review/text: I got these to use to massage my feet at the end of the long work day....they are great, not too hard or sharp, just the right texture, esp for the arch. If have ticklish feet, try first while wearing socks to get used to it. I also keep one on my desk near my keyboard, feels great to massage my palms intermittently while working on the computer.
