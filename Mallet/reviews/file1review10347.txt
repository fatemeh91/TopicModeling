review/text: I originally bought one of these to store vitamins and meds for my kids when we travel. One at a time, I've bought several more, since they are so very useful. I keep the jewelry I wear most often in one, and it's so easy to pack up and drop in my toiletries bag when packing. It's great for keeping almost any small items in. I'm so glad I have them.
