review/text: I wear these every day. They're thick and absorbent, and soft on my skin. I much prefer them over theNUK Reusable Nursing Pads, 6 Packwhich I bought at a local store to get me through until these came in. The NUK pads were too thin to be useful.If you care if they show and you wear form-fitting shirts these might show.Apparently I'm a "heavy leaker." At night these pads are too small to stay in place as I toss and turn, though they are the standard size (a little over 3 inches in diameter). I ended up making myself some 5-inch x 5-inch square nursing pads to use at night.Nursing Pads Ekstra Style, Smalllook like they might be large enough, and LANAcare also has larger sizes. I can't use wool though.I ended up buying 3 sets of these, so I can wear a clean set partway through the day if necessary, a clean set at night, and not end up doing the wash every single day.
