review/text: I have a 5 year old, 3 year old and 17 month old. For the past 2 years I have tried to get an accurate reading with this Vicks thermometer and the Safety First digital thermometer. They are both awful! I thought I would get a quick, accurate, painless reading- not at all! My kids squirm they can't stand the feeling of this under their arm, when I do get a reading it reads a temp. of 97.1 to 98.9. I know by feeling their forhead they are burning up, complaining of any variety of symptoms from earaches to sore throats or naseau. I'd just like an accurate reading to now if they have a 101 or 103 fever. Don't wast your money. (I end up using a rectal mercury thermometer on my 17 month old to get it right.) I just read the many good reviews for the Exergen Temporal Scanner Temporal Artery Thermometer so I'll invest some money and purchase it. Let you know in the future if it is worthwhile.
