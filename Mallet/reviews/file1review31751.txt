review/text: I've been looking over Doug Ritter's website for a while and finally broke down and bought two of these kits. In short: this is a fantastic bargain, and is truly a useful set of things to have with you if the poo poo hits the fan near you. The spark-lite sparker and tinder is worth $8 alone, the signal mirror is worth another $6, and there's half of the purchase price covered right there. All of the components are very deliberately selected to be easily useful, to work together to improve your chances, and to be impressively affordable.I found that there is enough extra space in the pouch for a keychain LED light, six hurricane matches with striking strip wrapped in foil, and 10 Potable Aqua tablets in a perfume vial. You lose the ability to fold the top over when you add these things, but I'm keeping my kit in a backpack pocket, not in a pants pocket. So, not a problem for me.I also decided to make a more substantial survival kit for when I'm backpacking. After doing a little looking around and checking prices on the individual bits and pieces, I chose to use my second Pocket Survival Pak as the starting point. This saved me a bundle of time and effort, knowing that all of the components were very high quality and already configured to be compact and ready to go. The only thing I didn't use in the bigger kit was the tiny compass. Even the vinyl pouch became the first aid kit holder in the bigger survival kit.In closing, this is an amazingly well-conceived set of items that you may need some day, packaged in such a way that you're likely to have them on you when that time comes. I can't say enough about this kit. Truly amazing.
