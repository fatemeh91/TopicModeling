review/text: This thing was designed to facilitate open-eyed darkness meditation. Only later was it marketed as a sleep mask. It is excellent for its intended purpose: inducing partial sensory deprivation. I believe visionary painter Alex Grey once endorsed this item for enhancing one's visual imagination. For sleeping, some find it comfortable, and some do not. Of course you must sleep on your back, or partially on your side, for the design to fit comfortably.Its unique feature is simply that it allows you to keep your eyes open while seeing no light. This may seem like a trivial difference, but neurologically and psychologically, there's a big difference in the shadows and shapes you'll perceive when your eyes are open versus when they are closed. With your eyes open, your visual system seeks out concrete shapes in the noise and shadows that make up the blackness. With your eyes closed, you tend to ignore the eyelid movies.
