review/text: I love these heat packs by herbal concepts. I have the neck wrap as well and both are fantastic. I use them for everything from neck/shoulder pain, back pain, cramps, and muscle soreness. The heat is a moist heat so it penetrates to the muscles. They heat up in the microwave in 5 minutes (I have found to get them to heat evenly it's best to shake the pack up every minute) and the heat lasts for 20 minutes or so. I highly recommend these.
