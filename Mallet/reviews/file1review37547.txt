review/text: I had never used a sleep mask before, but I was having trouble sleeping past 6:30 am -- the shades and drapery in our new condo didn't block enough of the morning sunshine. The Escape Travel Sleep Mask really does block the light and I'm able to sleep as long as I need. It took about two nights to get used to wearing the mask and figure how snug to make the strap, but I find it very comfortable and worth the extra money for the 3-dimensional fit.
