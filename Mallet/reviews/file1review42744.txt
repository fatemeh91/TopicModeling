review/text: Although it's only a two screen head (vs my old 3 head Remington model) it shaves faster and better than any electric razor I've ever purchased. When I received my Remington electric razor I charged it for the required 24 hours. Since this initial charge, over 3 weeks ago, I haven't had to recharge, and that's using the razor 6-7 days a weeks! Unbelieveable battery capacity! Note: my old Remington recharageable razor would only run for 5-6 shaves before recharge.
