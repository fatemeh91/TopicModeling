review/text: I primarily bought this to help clean my VItamix container. I have large hands, and getting them down in there is a no go. Up till now, I've been hesitant to use anything in the container for fear of scratching or &#34;fogging&#34; up of the plastic that people talk about. What I have found is that I do get some film that builds up over time, but this brush, and some elbow grease actually gets it off and doesn't scratch the plastic at all. In fact, as I've been using this exclusively, my Vitamix container looks new after the last year of use and abuse. I'll buy another when this one wears out.
