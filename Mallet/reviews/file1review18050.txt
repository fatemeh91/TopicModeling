review/text: Good, comfortable product. I purchased it since my husband has to have the fan running at night (on super high) and it drys out my eyes. I have used many masks before but I feel that because they were flat on my eyelids, it didn't give my eyelids a chance to do what they need to do to keep my eyes moist during the night. This one works well because I use it when the lights are already off and it allows my eyelids to breath while keeping the air flow from coming in direct contact with them.If you are purchasing this and do not want ANY light in then be careful. Note: my face is shaped a little funny (swim goggles never work for me...my nose is to pointy at the bridge i think) which may lead this mask to not be as tight as it was designed but on me it does leave space where the light will come in at my nose.
