review/text: nice product for beginners. the past is the right consistency but the product overall seems to dry to fast even with some of the oil. its better to use some lemon juice and honey mixed together about 10 minutes after you apply it, otherwise the product just dries out way to fast and you'll never get a good stain that way. the tips that are for the tube are very large so unless a design is large its better to buy a henna bottle with the tiny needle type applicator tip. the cone i used for a larger area/fill in areas. it doesnt say but its better if your not going to use them right away they will store in the frezzer for a while and then just let them thaw to room temp before you use them.for the tube its ok if you make sure and just cut a tiny hole in it, the hole shouldnt be large than a pin head for good designs. and since the cone is a metal/plastic type material make sure and use sharp scissors. when you cut the hole the papers that left shouldnt be bigger than may a ball headed pin. and that would be considered med/large.for the henna cone, make sure if you didnt use it all to use a little tape to seal up the hole you cut and put it in a plastic bag with the air pressed out. and make sure and put that at least in the fridge/freezer if unused otherwise it will dry out.
