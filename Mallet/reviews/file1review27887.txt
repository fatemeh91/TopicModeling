review/text: The name, double rich chocolate, makes it sound like it would have a strong chocolate taste; but it doesn't. While the taste wasn't bad, it was barely there. Using the recommending amounts, I found it hard to drink with water. I had to use less water or more powder to make it drinkable. Not bad, but I but a different flavor next time.
