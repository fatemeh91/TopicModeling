review/text: This is one of the best tasting energy bars that I have tried. I take a couple of these with me on my 30 mile bike rides, days at the gym, or paddling down river, and they do the trick, high in carbs, proteins, & sugars. It has quickly become a staple on whatever the activity is at the time.
