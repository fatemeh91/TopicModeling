review/text: So far I like it. I have used it for about 4 weeks but hard to say yet if it has made a difference. I noticed a difference in my gums in that they seem to be healthier. Some reviews I read before purchasing the product said the taste was strong. That is just not true. It tastes pretty much like water and is very easy to work into the brushing routine. Who doesn't have exactly 1 minute in the morning and night for a cleaner mouth?
