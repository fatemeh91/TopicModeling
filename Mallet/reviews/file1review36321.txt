review/text: I've been using this stuff for years and it works for me. It usually takes about 15 minutes to start to work and lasts about 1.5 hours. The problem I've had was using too much will leave you limp and using too much with a condom is even worse. I wouldn't recommend using more than three sprays with a condom. I usually use four or five sprays and I can last for an 30 mins at a rather vigorous pace. I love how it works but sometimes it works too well and I don't get mine but she still hers, but that's most important to me.
