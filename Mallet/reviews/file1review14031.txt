review/text: I received 2 vanilla, 4 strawberry, 4 banana (All were LifeStyles). Those were the ONLY flavored condoms sent.I also received:10 LifeStyles colored condoms10 regular Durex condomsand 10 Unil@tex regular condomsSo I received 40 total condoms; but only 10 were flavored, they were all the same brand and there was only three different flavors. For someone who was ordering this to see if there were certain brands of flavored worth purchasing long term....this was a hugely failed purchase.
