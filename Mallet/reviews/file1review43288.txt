review/text: while this offers some support, i hate the criss cross on the neckline. It does not sit like in the picture shown, the straps creep closer and closer together until they are literally touching your neck. Wearing V necks, Scoop Necks or anything other than a crewneck/turtleneck is out of the question unless you want to explain why you are wearing a harness under your clothing...I will keep mine though because carrying twins requires support at all times and this does the job well.
