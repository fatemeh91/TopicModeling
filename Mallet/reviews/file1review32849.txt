review/text: These shakes are mmm mmm good. As an athlete, I try to get extra protein in my diet. As a female athlete serious protein at GNC etc freak me out. The powder has a decent (10 grams) post-workout protein "boost" verses say, the bowl of cereal I'd eat instead. plus, you can use non-dairy milk (I use soy) and toss in mix-ins. My current fave s the chocolate royale mix with a cup of soymilk, four ice cubes and a half cup of strawberries.These shakes just mixed with milk are pretty gross, but if you pop it in the blender and sneak in some fruit, it almost tastes like a smoothis from jamba juice. except less bad for you.I don't follow tho weight-loss plan, so i can't testify to the weight-loss properties, but I can say this doesn't taste like diet food and overall, s a tweakable product that is pretty darn good.
