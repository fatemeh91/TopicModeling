review/text: I needed something for work that was high in protein so my blood sugar wouldn't drop before lunch. I tried a lot of protein/energy bars in the stores. They either tasted bad, gave me gastric upset or contained chocolate( which I am allergic to). Then I remembered Tiger's Milk bars from my childhood that GNC General Nutrition Center used to sell. They are coated in carob and filled with peanut butter (my favorite). I found some at a local nutrition store. They don't taste like a candy bar, but compared to other energy bars they taste great!!! I love the peanut butter crunch the best. They keep me satisfied until lunch and the added vitamins give me an added energy boost. Also they are not full of fillers that can give you gastric upset. I love them and I hope they keep making them forever and ever.
