review/text: This is convenient and keeps a charge very well. I gave 4 stars because it is a hassle to clean. I wish I bought one years ago. Excellent quality as well.Update:A few months short of the 2 year mark it suddenly decided to not want to turn on. Dropping it probably doesn't help. Oh well.
