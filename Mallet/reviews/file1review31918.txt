review/text: First I have to say that I have tried over 5 different greens products. Although some of them have been quite tasty and some hard to swallow this one is in a league of its own. Extensive search for the best ingredient has lead me to try this one. The sprouted and raw ingredients were unique and hard to pass up, and prime shipping was an added bonus. But honestly my wife and I do not know if we will reorder, its that bad tasting. The first time I tried it I was shocked how bad it was and actually gagged on it halfway through the cup, up it came all over my work clothes, its that bad. I found like others that juice masks it well, although this is really not the most healthy and pretty counter productive. The healthy and best method I found so far is a mixture of 75% water 25% lemon juice, masks it pretty well but it still a pinch your nose and down it experience.
