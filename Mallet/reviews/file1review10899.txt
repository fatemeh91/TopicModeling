review/text: I started taking Zumba classes and I loved them, all of a sudden my left knee started hurting to the point I couldn't do it anymore. :-( I saw this knee strap and I figured I would give it a try. OMG it was a miracle. The fit was perfect and I noticed an immediate difference. I was able to walk up and down stairs and jump. The only thing is when you are finished working out take it off or it can start hurting cause it is cutting your blood circulation. Thanks to whoever invented this product.
