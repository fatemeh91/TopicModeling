review/text: I love this sweeper. I like to stay up late at night to clean when the babies and hubby are have gone to bed. I needed a sweeper that was quiet so I could sweep the area rugs. This picks up the lint, playdough, glitter, crumbs and anything else that kids drop during the day. We have distressed hand-scraped hardwood floor, it does a good job sweeping up crumbs, but does leave the flat stuff like bits of paper behind.
