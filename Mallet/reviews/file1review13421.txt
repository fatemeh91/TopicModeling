review/text: After having purchased this Priva Ultra Plus protector 34x52 in Early May of 2011 we used the pad daily, washing it daily ( a few times twice in one day). The pad was buttery soft with quilting that held up beautifully. I have not had another sheet protector last anywhere nearly as long as this one.It was used with an air mattress style hospital bed for my wife, and it held up to the stress and tugs superbly.223 machine washings later...the backing sheet finally developed micro tears.As long as they make these sheet protectors, I have no reason to buy anything but this one:Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector, 34" x 52", White
