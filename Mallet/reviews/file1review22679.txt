review/text: The picture of the product online isn't good enough to see that it doesn't actually fit most tub spouts. To make matters worse, read the fine print - most sellers won't accept returns of this item for "hygiene reasons" - even if you didn't open the package. If you do get them to accept a return, you'll pay the return postage and a restocking fee. I won't make a mistake like this again - hope you don't have to.
