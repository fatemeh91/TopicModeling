review/text: If I had kids, I'd be stealing these out of their lunch bag. Cheeky bastards!I get afternoon chocolate cravings and can't scarf down Snickers bars everyday (at least not if I'm spending most of my day sedentary in an offic chair). The zBar Brownies offer all the satisfaction of chocolate with the wholesomeness of oatmeal.Ok, so it's not as rich and creamy as something from Hershey. But they are damn good without olestra, saccharine, and other ingredients that will embalm you. And the #1 ingredient is Organic Oats. The #2 ingredient is organic chocolate chips. If that wasn't a good enough start, all the other ingredients are organic too.1 bar = 1 serving120 calories25 calories from fat1g of saturated fat0g trans fat0mg cholesterolThe biggest downside is 12g of sugar, but that's still doing better than most sweet snacks.I love these bars because they are tasty and filling. They are a "healthy" alternative to the tempations in your local vending machine.Cheers!
