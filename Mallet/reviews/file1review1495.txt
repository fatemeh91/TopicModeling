review/text: great stuff, and to think it's so cheap! i'm unfortunately prone to getting warts on my hands and feet. i've tried everything from store bought remedies to the full grade freezing at the doctor's. nothing worked for either the plantar or the common warts. i eventually got them burned away by laser. that was a pain! plus we're talking about maybe four a year and i don't always have a lot of pocket change to do that. a common wart on my finger was visibly gone within a week but i still used it for some time afterward to make sure the root was gone too. as for some plantar warts on my feet, i can't really comment on because i'm still in the process of removal. the plantar warts must be rooted a lot deeper, but i'm confident this stuff will do the trick. bottom line is this stuff is great! not dangerous at all. use as needed.buy it!
