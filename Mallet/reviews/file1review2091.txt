review/text: As a wheelchair user, I am always looking for a bag or pouch that I can use on the sides of my chair so when I saw these, they looked like they might work. On the plus side, they attach easily over the chair arms with velcro fasteners and are sturdily made from denim. On the minus side, the pocket is not deep enough and the bag tends to hang over the wheels, getting in the way when I'm trying to push myself around. The product description says they can be used for wheelchairs, walkers and bedrails. I think these pouches would work best on walkers. On bedrails, because of the shallow depth of the pouch, when the bed is raised to a sitting position, the contents of the pouch might fall out. It's a good idea but I think it needs a redesign. I would recommend them only for walkers.
