review/text: I have used dozens of men's fragrances over the decades (I'm nearing 50) ranging in price from a few bucks to tens of bucks and there is something in Aqua Velva (I think it's the oakmoss?)that really blends well with my body chemistry. I even used it while working out (HARD) and while I don't necessarily recommend it, it definitely worked for me. I also have a male relative who wears it and when he does, I give him two thumbs up which is our little personal communication that I know what he is wearing and I like it. Fellas, give it a shot.
