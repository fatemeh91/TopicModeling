review/text: I have been using this medicine chest for 7 or 8 years. I take a plethora of vitamins and supplements, including the big pills like fish oil. I have never had a problem with all my pills fitting. There is a smaller version of this product, which also has removable sections, and my pills would not fit in that one.Each morning, I pull that day's section and take it to work with me. After a number of years, I noticed that some of the "doors" on my original chest didn't click closed and hold as securely as they did--sometimes a door would pop open and spill in my purse--not a big deal to scoop up 4 or 5 pills. Nevertheless, I purchased another. If I am traveling, I take out the days I don't need and leave the rest in the tray, then put the entire tray in a ziplock bag.I found the advantage to having 2 units was that I didn't have to fill as often (which I hate to do--not a big deal to most people, just one of those chores I don't like doing). I've considered purchasing a 3rd and probably will at some point.I cannot find this exact product anywhere but on Amazon. I purchased my original years ago in a drugstore, probably Rite-Aid, but have never found it since. I LOVE the convenience.
