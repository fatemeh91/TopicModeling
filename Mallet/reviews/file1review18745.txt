review/text: Received this one item of my order, which arrived March 14, 2012 via U.S. Mail sooner than expected in separate package. The Oster Premium Lubricating Clipper Oil appears to be in good order in single package, but unable to use until the clippers & comb set in another part of the order's shipment arrives, hopefully tomorrow.
