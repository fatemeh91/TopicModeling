review/text: I decided to give this a try after I used a 500g bottle of the Vitamineral Green (VG). I couldn't afford to take 2 tablespoons of VG. Green Vibrance is more affordable, while not as fine a powder as VG, but seems to do the trick. I can take 2 tablespoons of this stuff, which I think balances out the filler that it has.It tastes better than VG as well (more earthy than swampy).
