review/text: I have purchased several sinus/headache packs in the past, and my main complaint was always that it did not hold heat. I do not use it as a cold pack although I may do so in the future.However, I am so pleased with the Original Bed Buddy Sinus Pack. It is weighted so that it stays in place without slipping. It is both comfortable and comforting. I think it might be handy to have a strap, but, really, one is not needed.I'm very happy with my purchase. I heat mine for 45 seconds and it stays heated until I have gone to sleep. Again, I'm very pleased.
