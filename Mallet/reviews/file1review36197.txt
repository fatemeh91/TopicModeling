review/text: I have used this ointment on my german shepherd's ears for years now and it works great. I was happier before when it came in a white cream, but for whatever reason, the formula is changed to a bright pepto bisthmal pink! Quite a shocking look on my black german shepherd's ears. It still works as it did before but a note of the formula change to the hot pink color in the product description would have been nice. Otherwise, it does repel flies from eating my dog's ears and it's easy on the sores if the flies have already bitten enough to make them sore. I have to reapply this every 3 to 4 days to keep the repellant properties working. I can look past the pink to keep her ears healthy. Seller ships quickly.
