review/text: i'm in between neck surgeries and this thing immediately provided me just enough relief to change my day from aweful to bearable. o! The weight of if and the fact that it rests and cools or warms up the entire shoulder girdle and neck area is beyond helpful. I am immediately ordering another one so that i can keep this one in the freezer and have the other one ready to pop into the microwave. I would give it 10 stars if i could. ahhhh the relief.
