review/text: I just got the .9 kit in the mail yesterday and everything is as advertised. I was not missing any supplies listed on the package nor did they substitute for anything on the list. I received the exact product shown in the pictures with the yellow exterior bag and two interior bags. All medications had expiration dates from 2013 to 2015.I would recommend adding a good pair of medical scissors, neosporin, and some additional bandaids to round out the pack. I also added some additional gauze even though the pack comes with a good variety and amount. You can go through gauze really quickly when dealing with an injury that involves heavy bleeding.I will carry this with me in my cycling backpack and I recommend that you add a first aid kit to the standard supplies you carry when riding (spare tube, tire patch kit, tire pressure gauge, multi tool, ect...). You never know when you are going to take a nasty fall and need this stuff or may need to assist another rider who has wrecked and needs some attention.This is lightweight, small, and waterproof and is the perfect kit to carry for outdoor sports. I tend to be OCD about being prepared and probably didn't need this big of a kit just for riding, but it makes me feel better knowing that I have more than neccessary to take care of myself and someone else in case of injury while out and about on my bike. In summation, this product is great for anyone who engages in outdoor activities and I would highly recommend it.
