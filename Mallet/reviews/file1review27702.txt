review/text: As a first-thing-in-the-morning, pre- and post-workout supplement, Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Standard is hard to beat. And, given its quality and effectiveness, it's the best protein powder one can spend their money on.Before I became a regular user, I'd read a lot of reviews that said this product was great, and I couldn't agree more with those reviewers once I tried it out for myself.And though I first started to take it only as a post-workout supplement, I've recently found that combining it with plain and strong black coffee (without sugar) about 20 minutes before a training session can work wonders for me when it comes to endurance and stamina. In my opinion, it even beats supplements that are to be taken specifically pre-workout in terms of effectiveness.I usually try to keep my weight-training sessions within a one-hour time limit, and if I start training without having taken my scoop of ON Whey, it's a lot harder to keep things going with mad intensity (as I like to train) after the first 30 minutes. If I do take it, then I can rest assured that there's going to be no crash or burn-outs before I'm done with all of my sets.
