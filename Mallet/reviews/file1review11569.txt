review/text: These are absolute garbage for photography. I read the user reviews about the long shelf like and liked the high capacity rating, but my experience has been the opposite in the 3 months or so I've had them. It seems like they can't hold a charge for even a week, after an overnight charge. I bought them for use in a Canon 430EX II Speedlite and often times find that my flash is useless because the batteries are dead. I'll try the Sanyo Eneloops of Panasonics next time.
