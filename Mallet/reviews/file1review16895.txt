review/text: I just bought this potty for my 22 month old. She loves Elmo so I thought she would be more likely to use it since Elmo is on the front. The Pro's to this potty is that it is a good height for my toddler to sit on with her feet flat on the floor. The 3-in-1 feature is also nice.Cons: I agree with the other reviewer that Elmo's hand is right by the child's leg and she is constantly hitting the hand which sets off Elmo's voice. Being the curious toddler, it distracts her and she bends over to look at where the noise is coming from. A simple removal of the batteries can remedy the situation. Also, the "pee guard" is easily removed. I chose to keep it off since my daughter was very opposed to it being on and kept pulling it off.All in all, this is not a bad product and we will keep using it.
