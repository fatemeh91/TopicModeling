review/text: I've been using ON Whey Extreme Milk Chocolate for a while, getting great results. The flavor was okay, but quite heavy on the sweet side, so I decided to switch to Double Rich. Ugh. That first taste was disgusting. I nearly spit it back out. But you know what? I decided to give it a few days. I don't know what happened, but now I LOVE Double Rich. What a difference between today and that first taste. It's much less sweet than the Extreme, and seems to dissolve better in water for some reason. I'll probably stick with this, but may check out some other flavors in small sizes.(01/06) Update: WOW. Just tried Chocolate Malt and the taste is incredible. Most malted protein shakes don't have much malt flavor, but this stuff is great. Perfect texture too.
