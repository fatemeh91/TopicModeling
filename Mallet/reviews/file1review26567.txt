review/text: Back Booster provides great lumbar support!Lasts long (over a year) - more than most inflatable lumbar supports.. and definitely worth the convenience!Everyone needs better lumbar support or you will inevitably end up with low-back pain and tight muscles.Stretch daily, Take breaks often (i.e., don't sit for more than an hour at a time), and don't slouch! (you can't slouch if you have lumbar support :)
