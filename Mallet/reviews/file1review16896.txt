review/text: The pee deflector does pop right off. My son promply put it on his head! (before using the potty). My husband super-glued it on and now it's fine. It's better than another potty I bought (after the deflector came off this one), the other deflector was too small and pee went everywhere. So we went back for this one. Elmo's voice is a bit annoying, we're taking the batteries out.
