review/text: I recently received both the single speed and variable speed Jeanie Rub massagers and am incredibly thrilled with the results! This product is a powerful tool to break up muscle tension throughout the entire body. The variable speed model is helpful because as one moves over the body it is nice to increase and decrease the intensity of the oscillation. I would recommend this product as best utilized when someone else is using it upon you and would be a great addition for professional body workers. It is well designed, for professional or home use, with a sturdy double grip for controlled movement and a smooth surface that works well over clothing or directly upon the skin. The company, AllAboutMassagers, sent the package immediately and it arrived in perfect condition. I would definitely order with confidence again in the future and highly recommend this product.
