review/text: I bought this because I liked emjoi's older eplilator products, which I used to own. Well, this emjoi is a replacement for my older emjoi, and now I wish I kept the older one. The optima is harder to handle, (no grips on it) my hand slips down it all the time turning the unit off, so I have to turn it back on again. I have small hands so I find it harder to manage.Anyways, it does the same job my older one used to do, and I must admit I have gotten used to it.
