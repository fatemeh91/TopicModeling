review/text: I bought a box of these elsewhere on an impulse. Now, I find that they are actually cheaper than Basics type regular paper towels, as they are reusable. I have used them with various hydrocarbon solvents and they hold up very well. I also found them great for rubbed finishes, such as wood stains.
