review/text: I found that the bars had everything you needed vitamin and mineral wise. The taste, however, wasn't that appealing to me. It was somewhat chocolatey, but it also had that fibery taste. It did fill a void when I needed a quick meal on the go however. I think taste for taste, if you are dieting, the Slim Fast bars have a better overall taste. I'm not sure if I'd recommend this product.
