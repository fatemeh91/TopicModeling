review/text: Being in the military we have to shave often, and being black, I get razor bumps (our hair is curly and when you cut it, it regrows under the skin causes irritating bumps also visibly unsightly) so this razor along with the battery powered razor helps reduce razor bumps greatly!For those looking to buy, buy a 4 pack and they should last a year, that green strip doesn't really mean anything at all, you can put on whatever aftershave or lotion on your face when that wears out, and you are not Chuck Norris, your hair doesn't damage the blades, what damages the blades are the minerals in your tap water. So just get a 50 cent bottle of alcohol to rinse the blades after you are done shaving, and this product will last you a while. Just think how often do you sharpen your lawn mower? And sometimes those blades nick cement!
