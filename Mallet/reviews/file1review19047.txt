review/text: I bought this product for my father. He has a colon condition which requires him to have runny stools ongoingly. A nurse from a recent hospital visit suggested this equipment, ultimately gave it to us as long as we purchased the bags to go with it. The Amazon pricing was better than the manufacturer so I'm glad Amazon sells this product.Now for whether it works or not....It works fairly well if the person has very watery and loose stools. You can change bags after 10 days of use. If stools are forming or solid in any way, it wont work because the hole in the device is not large enough for the contents to slide through. Even with the loose stool, it wont capture everything but it may help.
