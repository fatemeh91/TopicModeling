review/text: Loved this tub. It's soft and cushy in case baby slips, although mine never slipped in this tub. The back of it let my baby lie down comfortably while rinsing her hair. My daughter used this tub from six months to 21 months. Perfect for when baby is sitting up but still too small for the big tub.
