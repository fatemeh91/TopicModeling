review/text: i tried at least a dozen therapies and treatments for my shoulder pain after a roll-over car accident, and this is one of my favorites! if you already know that deep pressure on the part of your body that hurts causes you to jump a bit...but ultimately provides relief...this may be the gadget for reaching those difficult places.in case you're on a search of your own for dealing with pain and are interested, the other things i tried were: chiropractor, orthopedics, physical therapy, massage therapist, massage devices, trigger point injections, creams, patches, pills, ice, heat, balls, stretching devices, slings, posture braces, foam mattress pads, special pillows...and ultimately surgery a year and a half later. i still use this regularly on my shoulder, back and neck, for those relentless trigger points that never seem to completely go away.
