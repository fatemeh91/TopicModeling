review/text: My son introduced Lavilin me. Paste or roll-on, you can't dress until dry! Put on before bed, get up, shower & get dressed! How often depends on the person a& weather. My sister said, I don't need deodorant unless outside working, but when I did, it didn't work. They say it may take a few uses for your body to become adjusted. This was the first product I ordered on line. About 2 years ago, I looked the company up on Google. Fortunately, I read more then their listing. I found the company was taking money & not sending products. What was I to do? I went to Amazon & did a search. THANKS AMAZON.COM MLWS
