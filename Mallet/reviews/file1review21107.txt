review/text: Great product! This is actually my second heating pad. The first was paid for by my insurance about ten years ago. It worked so well I sought out the same brand to replace it when it finally died. I periodically machine wash the cover and let it air dry. When my budget allows I plan to get the long, narrow pad for my neck.
