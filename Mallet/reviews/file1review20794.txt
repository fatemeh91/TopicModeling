review/text: I purchased this razor for my husband last year for Christmas. He swore nothing would compare to his infamous Schick Quattro Disposable Razor. The downside, terrible in-grown hairs every week, ugh and 15 minutes to shave. Although he fought with me every step of the way, he finaly caved and tried it. After a few days he was hooked! He gets a super-close shave in half the time and the *huge* bonus, no more ingrown hairs. If you hae sensitive skin or know someone who does, this is the model for them. The self-cleaning option is wonderful and a big key to the success. I highly recommend this model, so much so, I picked one up for my father-in-law this Christmas.
