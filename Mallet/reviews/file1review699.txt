review/text: These are a real hit with everyone, from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q's! Lots of fun,and different than most novelty items. Put them in your glove compartment in case you get stranded, next to your bed in case the power goes out, toss them in the pool, the tub, the punchbowl,the fun ideas with these things are endless. Incidentally, these work just the same as all the other &quot;Waterless&quot; drink coolers that we've had since long before the &quot;lighted&quot; ones arrived on the scene. Why-ever would you &quot;throw them out&quot; just because the light was done??
