review/text: Love Redkin Spray Starch! I can go to bed with wet hair and still style as usual in the mornings -- (and my hair doesn't break or feel damaged!) I would definitely recommed this product for women with longer hair styles - mine is about shoulder-length. Feels sticky at first, but the heat breaks the product down and hair feels natural.
