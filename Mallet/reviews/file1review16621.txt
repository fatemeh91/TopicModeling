review/text: Classic zippo with the classic design. This is the real basic metallic one. Gotta buy flint, wick, and oil because they do run out after constant use. I used it for light camp fires and all that fun stuff. Windproof as claimed unless you're in a blizzard or you try to blow it out like a candle lol. Smooth finish, maintain as needed. One con though i hate how the lid of allll my zippos tilt to the side a little, its not a big deal, its like a OCD thing for me. Any questions, or tips for me leave a comment ill try to respond!
