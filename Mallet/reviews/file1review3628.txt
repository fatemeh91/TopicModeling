review/text: The pad is just like every other pad and I kind of hate using them because they get icky very quickly but it's really fine. The scraper is very useful but sometimes you have to really get in there if something got burned and sat for a little while. I would have given this 3 stars BUT, the scraper works even better on my granite countertops than it does on the stove itself. For that alone, I use it all the time to get those little rough patches that are hard to scrub up without being worried about scratching or eroding the finish of the granite. Works especially well in our coffee area where the little bits of sugar get wet and stick to the counter.
