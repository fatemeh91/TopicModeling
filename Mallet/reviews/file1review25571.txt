review/text: It's hard to keep a straight face when discussing the personal grooming solution this little wonder offers -- but the bottom line is it works. Really.There may be some who have mastered the art of using scissors to remove nosehair, but I'm not one of them. No matter how hard I've tried in the past, I've never been able to quite get the job done. Not even close. And I figured the $15 price tag was worth it if only to satisfy my curiousity about how these things actually operate, or at least be good for a laugh or two from my wife or kids.Well, it's no joke. Yeah, there's a minor tug or two during operation as some have noted, but the inside of my nose is as smooth as a baby's bottom. My advice is to give it a shot. What have you got to lose? Well, other than the obvious, that is.
