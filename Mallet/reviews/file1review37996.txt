review/text: I just did CPR training today and we also trained on an AED. They are incredible and VERY easy to use. If one of your family members or loved ones has a condition requiring one of these or has leanings toward potential problems, you should have one of these. You should also take the CPR training to enhance what these wonderful machines can do as well. These work wonders when TIME is of the essence! : )
