review/text: I was buying this from amazon at a cost of less than $50 delivered with auto delivery. Now they cancel my Subscribe & Save order and now the new price is about $70 for 5LB. WAY TOO MUCH for this product - There are much better protein powders out there in this price category. Stay away from the chocolate all together - it is aweful. I only used vanilla and blended that with banana or blueberries, which tasted pretty good.
