review/text: Moccha Cappucino is mediocre. There's no way around it. The taste best compares to a packet of Swiss Miss hot chocolate with a hint of coffee. It mixes reasonably well, however it does clump somewhat, even when mixed with milk in a shaker bottle. It tastes fine in water, and also in Oatmeal.If you're interested in trying out new flavors, give it a whirl. It really isn't bad, and you will definitely finish the whole five pounds. It's not one of their more stellar flavors. It's not bad. It is simply a very mediocre from a brand that strives for excellence.
