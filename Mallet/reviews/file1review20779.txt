review/text: I've had my Braun 8585 for just under 2 years now and I continue to swear by it. This spontaneous purchase raised the bar for what I expect from my morning shave. The unique shape of the foil and the cleaning system were the main draws for me while I was comparison shopping. I decided to spend the extra money and I have no regrets.I find the cleaning solution (which has a light lemon scent) needs to be changed about once a month, and 3 packs cost somewhere between $15 - 20. The cleaning process is a breeze and takes about 15 - 20 minutes. I just pop it in the stand, push the button, and walk away. The stand lets you know when your razor needs a cleaning or a new container of solution.I recently ordered a new set of foils & blades, (after about 19-20 months) and while the shave is obviously not nearly as close as it was the day I got it, the shave with dull blades/foils is still better than what I was getting with my past razors. My neck is prone to irritation and nicks, and my stubble is thick, so this has been a huge improvement across the board. If I get a new razor at any point in the next 1-3 years, it will definitely be the Pulsonic or another Braun razor that builds upon the strengths of this model.
