review/text: These blades fit well into the long handled razor of the same name. Tolerances on the blades seem very tight when fitting it into the razor, and the blades are very sharp. They might not be as sharp as the &#34;Feather&#34; brand, but they do their job correctly and efficiently. Well made, just like their razors.
