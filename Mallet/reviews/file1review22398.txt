review/text: We have two of these (I recommend at LEAST two!) in yellow and light blue. Both have been pooped on (you can't even imagine!) and peed on...all stains washed right out with no pre treatment. Only once did I pretreat the yellow cover. Both wash up soft and cozy.We have been using our covers for double duty...our son has a reflux issue and needs to sleep sitting up for at least 30-45 min after a feeding. I cover our car seat with one of the covers (it wraps around the edges and clings to the outside of the seat) and it makes it a cozier place for him to rest before being placed in his crib. With that said, NEVER leave the cover on while using the car seat in the car or as a safety seat!!!
