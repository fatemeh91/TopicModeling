review/text: I bought it to wash the Stanley Overtime Food Jar. I ended up using it to wash bottles, glasses, pots and all kinds of stuff. It is very effective in cleaning things and it is soft enough that it does not scratch or hurt. It would be better if the bottom is flat so that I can put it on the counter.
