review/text: This was a very good low carb bar, with a flavor that I could not differentiate from regular caramel. (Although I must admit I am not traditionally a huge caramel eater) Very creamy and slightly tacky but not so gooey that it stuck to my teeth. The chocolate covering was ok too. I will definitely be buying more of these.
