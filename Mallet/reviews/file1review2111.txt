review/text: I have been using the powder form of Dip It coffee pot cleaner for years. Lately, the powder has been turning into one large rock very soon after opening the package. I presume the box has been in some damp warehouse for a long time.The boxes I ordered and received from Amazon.com were well sealed-individually. I should not have the problem with any of these boxes.Incidently, the coffee pot cleaner works very well on my Corming perculator pot. I intend to use it soon on my Mr. Coffee iced tea pot.Jim C.
