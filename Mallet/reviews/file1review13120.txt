review/text: This item has a couple of faults, which is why I only gave it two stars. The first, glaring weakness is that it doesn't get cold enough to consider it ice therapy. I didn't purchase this item with heat therapy in mind, so if that's what you're looking for then this review is not for you. But if you are looking for the same type of therapy as putting an icepack on your neck, then look elsewhere. It gets very cool, but not ice cold. The second problem is that this thing is a little too large, and I have a larger than average neck for a man.
