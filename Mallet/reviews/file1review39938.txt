review/text: I thoroughly recommend this product. I found it on consumer reports in the July 2009 issue. This product has no heavy metals associated with protein shakes. When I tried other protein shakes I always got ssick after a few days and from reading the consumer reprots article I found out it was probably due to the heavy metals (arsenic and chromium, etc) that are found in most protein shakes. This product did not have those. It costs more but if you care about your health you know its worth it.
