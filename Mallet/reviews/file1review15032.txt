review/text: I have been using the patch for about a month now and I love these!! I was hesitant about trying a lesser-known brand but I wanted to save money, considering I did not know if they would even work. The best part is they DO. If you are serious about quitting smoking then you should have no problem doing so on these. I started with the step 1 and stepped down sooner than prescribed -- I would recommend doing it exactly as directed because it was a struggle. As an added note: I ran out of these before I got my new ones and opted to try the more expensive Nicoderm brand because of prime shipping availability -- mistake!! Nicoderm is ineffective compared to the Habitrol. Nicoderm is also much more itchy and HURTS when you remove it, not to mention it does not seem to stick as well either -- go figure! I'm not sure how the extra price tag is justified. Order these or the 14mg ones (whichever is appropriate for you) and try them. You will know within a few days if it's going to work for you. If so, buy the rest of the program asap so that you don't run out! Quitting smoking feels amazing...and I look so much better, too! Whiter teeth within a week!! I cannot recommend more highly.
