review/text: We have been very frustrated with the last couple of vacuums we've had and really don't need one as we have hardwoods throughout the house with just a few rugs. We decided to try this Bissell sweeper and are very pleased with it. We have not had any problem with the handle as some have mentioned. The sweeper picks dirt up off the rugs as well as a vacuum. It's quiet. It's light weight. It's small and takes up less space in the broom closet. It's very easy to empty. Even my 4 and 2 year olds love to use it. I still prefer to sweep the hardwoods with a broom so can't really speak to its efficacy in that regard. We consider this sweeper an excellent purchase.
