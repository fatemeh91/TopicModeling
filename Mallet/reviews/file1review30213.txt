review/text: I got this handheld vacuum specially to deal with my cat's shedding and the mess she makes when she uses the litter box. Before, I was just using a broom and lint rollers on my furniture but just couldn't take it anymore. This little vacuum does it's job and it does it well. When I use it on my area rug though, my back does start to get tired, but I really can't complain too much. I live in a small apartment and didn't want to buy an upright vacuum, which would just take up even more room that I probably don't even have. Anyway, I'm really glad I gave in and bought this because it's making the upkeep of my apartment way more bearable!
