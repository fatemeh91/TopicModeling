review/text: We've had this clippers for four years, and I have cut my sons' hair and my husband's hair with it. I am not an expert by any means, but this clippers makes it very easy to not know what you are doing and still end up with a good hair cut. When I look at the price we paid, I laugh out loud. I just spent more money at one visit to the salon to get mine cut. You can't find a better deal.
