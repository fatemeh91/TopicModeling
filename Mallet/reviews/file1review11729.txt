review/text: My child is pretty picky and has tonsillitis so any little infection , he won't eat anythingPediasure comes so handy during these times. This tastes great and my child asks for it too. It says to serve it very cold but he prefers it at room temp or even warm , so I do warm it in the microwave for 20 to 30 secsThe costs of this can add up though and it's best to buy them in bulk, samsclub only carries vanilla and I like to mix some flavors up. Thanks to amazon you get the flavor variety in bulk and with Subscribe and save it's the same price as in SAMs club ( but with additional flavors)I would give this a 5 star review but for the prescence of BPA in the cap which they say doesn't come in contact with the milk (?).
