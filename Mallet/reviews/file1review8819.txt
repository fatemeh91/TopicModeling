review/text: I have several stomach issues: irritable bowel syndrome, acid reflux, esophgitis, diverticulitis, constipation/diarrhea, lactose, fructose, sucrose intolerance. I think that is about it. Within 2 days of taking Green Vibrance, I was having significantly better bowel movements. My pain is greatly reduced and I am functioning better on a daily basis. I still take Nexium for acid reflux, but that is the only pharmaceutical I take. I can't say yet if it is helping the diverticulitis.There is one down side. It tastes terrible. I mix it with Berry flavored Juicy Juice and it is tolerable. But the better it works for me, the better it tastes. I would never consider skipping it for even one day.
