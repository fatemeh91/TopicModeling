review/text: My dad insisted that I take this the last time I got a cold (and I did take it, with no noticeable effect), so I did a little research, and found out what this is. They use pseudo-scientific jargon to disguise the fact that this is quite literally a sugar pill. The active ingredient is "Anas barbariae hepatis et cordis extractum HPUS 200CK". "Anas barbariae hepatis et cordis" is Latin for duck heart and liver, HPUS is the acronym for a reference book that defines the ingredient. But don't worry about consuming duck organs, the "200ck" describes the method of preparation. They puree the duck parts in water. Then they actually completely empty out the bottle and refill it with pure water, and whatever is stuck to the side of the container is then presumably absorbed into the new water, thus quickly and drastically diluting the solution. And then they repeat this process....200 times! They take the final "solution" (pure water) and put it on little balls of sugar. Statistically it would be like winning the lottery if even one molecule of duck was in your dose of sugar. Basically they could be using the heart and liver from the same duck for every dose they make until the sun explodes and they would have plenty left over. True, if you take this medicine your cold should be better in a few days. However, if you don't take this medicine guess what? Your cold should be better in a few days. These people are immoral crooks, and France out to be ashamed that they haven't put this company out of business.I am sorry for the negative review, it just makes me very upset to see such a deliberate, organized, long-lasting scam that has been accepted by so many. There is no cure for the common cold yet, just stick to medicines which help your symptoms, and if it makes you feel better to take this, go ahead, it won't hurt you, it is probably the safest medicine on the market.
