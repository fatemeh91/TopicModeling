review/text: This is an amazing piece of equipment. I have been living somehow with vulvar varicosities for a while now and was finding it hard to stand by the end of the day. Now I can do all that I need to do! I cannot say it is flawless as I did have to purchase new underwear so that I could avoid chafing from the hip brace part and between my thighs (yes, they touch). A few days into use and it's held me up like a champ! There's definitely a learning curve on the adjustments, but once you get it set/figured out, you will be in great shape! I am also considering getting the V2 without the hip brace to see if it's a little more comfortable and so I can have one to wear while one is being washed/drying.
