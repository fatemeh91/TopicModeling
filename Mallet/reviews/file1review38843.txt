review/text: Even fresh out of the package, these blades aren't as sharp as Fiskars or Olfa blades, and both of the blades in the package I purchased developed mysterious dings and dull spots literally within minutes of their first use on a clean cutting mat free of pins or anything else that would have damaged the blades. I'm not buying these again.
