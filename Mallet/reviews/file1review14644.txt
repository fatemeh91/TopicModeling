review/text: GNC stopped making an herbal allegy pill that STOPPED my allergies when perscription meds could not. I searched and searched for a replacement and finally found it at Whole Foods: Aller Max; it cost me $32 for a bottle; one months supply. I searched on line and found Aller Max on Amazon from Swanson Health Products, the exact same bottle and it only cost me $8. I could not believe it. Swanson is a great company and great prices. I have compared my other herb and vitamin pills: GNC with Swanson. I am switching to Swanson. THANK YOU AMAZON. The quality is the same or better and the prices are always one-thrid the price of GNC; and they have great buy one get one free offers.
