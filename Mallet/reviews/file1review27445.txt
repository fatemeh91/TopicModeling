review/text: The banana cream flavor tastes quite good with 1% milk. I am truly surprised by how good it tastes. Highly recommend!The Chocolate Malt was quite disappointing. It's drinkable, but not enjoyable by any stretch of the imagination. If I had a way to exchange it for a Banana Cream, I would do so in a heartbeat.Average score of 4 stars: 5 for banana cream, 3 for chocolate malt.
