review/text: Whereas Bounty 2-ply is exalted by both Procter & Gamble and everyone that uses it, this product is basically not up to the same par. If you want an excellent 1-ply product buy "Viva". If you are simply looking to pay as little as possible, try something like the "KROGER PREMIUM BRAND", Winn-Dixie's "Deep-South" or the "SHOP-RITE BRAND".To their credit, however, Bounty makes NO GRAND performance claims about this "Basic Bounty" 1-ply product.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]
