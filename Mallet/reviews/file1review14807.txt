review/text: The emWave PC SRS monitors and reports heart rate variability - your pulse rate as it changes every half-second. When a person is "stressed", your pulse changes suddenly and your pulse rate plots as jagged lines; when a person is relaxed, these changes are smooth and plot as rolling curves. The difference is quite striking."Coherence" is simply smooth changes of pulse, which are correlated with relaxation. The emWave reports this cardiovascular measure of your emotional state, providing unambiguous and detailed feedback in real-time of how stressed or relaxed you are.To _achieve_ relaxation, the emWave PC comes with instruction for some basic calming techniques, which are effective. The emWave can also be used as an adjunct to other techniques, including meditation, guided imagery, relaxation exercises, etc., to provide feedback on their effectiveness and get the most out of these activities.I've owned the emWave for a couple of years, used it on-and-off, and found it to be an effective tool that helps me get the most out of meditation. I recommend it highly, but also suggest that you not limit yourself to the stress-reduction techniques included with the unit.
