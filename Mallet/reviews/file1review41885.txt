review/text: My orthodontist told me to by a toothbrush for my braces. She said either sonicare or Oral B. I looked into sonicare and it never real made me amazed. Then I came across the Oral B Triumph. It amazed me, not only the design and the LCD screen, but the power! I put it in my mouth and it blew me away! Plus the message buttun for my gums is comforting.Pros:Lcd screen with 2 min timer and 30 secong quadrent warningall different brushesamazing powertravel kitGood designdifferent modesCons:very expensiveTHATS IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!My teeth feel better and look better, THANKS TO THE ORAL B!!!
