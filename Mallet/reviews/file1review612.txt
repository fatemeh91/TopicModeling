review/text: The awesome Cosco Ability Care Traveler Syle Rollator is the very best. It is very sturdy and easy to use. Easy to adjust handles and very comfortable seat. Also come with a back rest, that can easily be attached if you need one. This has sturdy oversized wheels and easy to use hand brakes. Rolls smoothly on any surface or yard and is not tippy like some. Easy to fold and put in your back seat or trunk.It is good for any height as the adjusting handles accomodate all. I recommend this rollator to anyone who is looking for a very sturdy piece of equipment. You will not be sorry if you purchase this item.
