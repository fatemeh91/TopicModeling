review/text: Mine stopped working after a few months. Now it resides in a landfill somewhere. (*sigh*)To replace it, I bought an all-metal, mechanical nose trimmer from Vermont Country Store. No batteries to wear out, and no cheap plastic to break. It works just as well and, best of all, it cost the same price!
