review/text: I have tried several different products to tweeze the hair from my underarms and legs. This is the best product I have used. It is far from painless, but it is also effective and quick. I feel confident enough to use it on the delicate skin under my arms and know that I won't hurt myself. I have worn two of these out over the years and given others as gifts. I rate this as highly as possible. Forget razors. Forget the splashy ads that tell you that their product works under water (it doesn't, I own it), or a spring works (it doesn't, I own it), or a sanding disk works (it doesn't, I own it, and you don't want to see my legs after that fiasco!), or a green gel from Down Under will pull your hair off (it didn't pull the hair but it did pull the skin!). This is a good product, sturdily made, that will last for years.
