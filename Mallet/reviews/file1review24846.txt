review/text: My husband and I have been TTC for 6 months now with no luck. We decided we were going to try one more month and then take a break for a while because it was mentally and emotionally exhauting getting a negative each month. I thought "what the heck, I'll give this stuff a try. It can't hurt right?" AS it was being shipped I read more reviews that said not to use it if you had a regular cycle because it would mess your cycle up. I decided to try it anyway. After takin gthis for 2 weeks I finally got the "egg white" CM that everyone talks about, and when I ovulated i KNEW it. I went against my best judgement and took an HPT on 9 DPO, and it was negative. I was down in the dumps and just waiting on my period to start. The day my period was due I waited around all day, and nothing! I took another HPT the very next morning and low and behold POSITIVE! Took another one the next day and it was positive too! I am a believer that Fertilaid really does help! I took it for 2 weeks, and now I'm giving the rest to a friend who is also TTC.
