review/text: It arrived fully assembled in a large but thin box and all of it was lightweight. A solid yet light piece of durable equipment with 11 therapy knobs, allows me to use 2 pointed knobs to get back under my shoulder blades and apply continuous pressure, almost effortlessly, on knots-trigger points that develop following strenuous work done by my arms and shoulder muscles. Almost instantly pain dissolves as trigger points are released. I've received nice deep tissue massages many times before and in my opinion this tool provides equally as effective results on the specific muscles that its used on. Consider that your pain may in fact indicate the need for a full body alignment to be performed by a decent Chiropractor especially if the trigger points recur in the same area. Still this tool allows for a quick and convenient solution for curing pain effectively before you're able to get Chiropractic care. The bodybackbuddy should easily fit in your check-in luggage. Makes for a nice gift even more so for single folks who don't have a spouse-buddy to request/trade the favor of a love filled massage. Now off to get a back-scratcher ;-)
