review/text: I have been on the Slim Fast 3 2 1 diet for a month and have lost 8 pounds. My goal is to lose another 12 pounds and I feel confident that will happen with this diet. It's a very easy diet to follow and I don't feel hungry or deprived of food. I make sure to eat a good, balanced dinner once a day, and don't feel the need to overeat at this meal. My breakfast (brunch) is a shake and a meal bar. For lunch I have a snack bar and then in the evening two snack bars. It's that simple. One reason the diet is pleasurable for me is that I happen to like chocolate, and don't mind eating the chocolate Slim Fast products several times a day. I prefer to use soy milk with the shakes, although they still taste good and are filling enough for me when using skim milk.If you like to eat at restaurants, as I do, that's no problem. Just make your restaurant meal the main meal of the day and eat the Slim Fast products the rest of the day. Although the Slim Fast products may be a bit expensive, I find that my grocery bills have gone down about as much as the cost of this plan. This diet plan may not work for everyone, but it certainly has worked well for me.
