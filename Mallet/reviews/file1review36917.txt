review/text: I found the floss to get between teeth well (even tight fits) and not to snag like other flosses. Great for bonding and other cosmetic dentistry which may not be as smooth as the real thing. You get a great clean feeling after using it too. I would buy it again and would recommend it to family. The product lives up to its claims. It glides right in.
