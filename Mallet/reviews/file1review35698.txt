review/text: I found Similasan eye drops after doing some research and having previously bought all the big brand name eye drops that either stung my eyes or didn't work at all. Occasionally I wake up with extremely dry eyes, so bad that my eyelids have stuck to my cornea which can tear (as in rip) them open. This is not only extremely painful, but also pretty much renders you useless until it starts to heal. And that can take a day or two.These Similasan eye drops have pretty much eliminated that completely. I keep the bottle by the bed now, as it is important to lubricate the eyes before opening them up if they are dry to avoid a torn cornea. In addition to the effectiveness, there is also a unique squeezable dispenser tip that I've found makes it easier to apply the drops.If you suffer from dry eyes, you'll definitely want to give this brand a try. I was planning on giving all the recommended brands a go to compare, but Similasan (the first one I tried) worked so well my search ended with this product.
