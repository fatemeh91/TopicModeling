review/text: The 10# whey is a great value as well as great tasting and great blending. I have used other wheys that do not blend as well and leave some clumps of whey. I put this in a nalgene bottle half milk and half water, volume roughly per directions, and shake. No need for a blender or a shaker. The quality of protein is ok. I prefer the isolate but you can't beat the value
