review/text: This item is billed as a tablet splitter/crusher. It may do a good job of crushing pills, I don't know because I didn't try that. However, as a splitter it is a failure. There is no way to center the tablet, so you can not split it into equal pieces. The blade is too short and doesn't reach the entire cutting area, so you may miss the tablet you are trying to split. In addition, it doesn't cut cleanly, so you have lots of lost powder and "shards". If you are after a splitter, get a real one.
