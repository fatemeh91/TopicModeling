review/text: This product does not work. I've had tinnitus for about a year now, and all the books I read about it said that pills don't work to help reduce or eliminate tinnitus. But, I was desperate to try anything after other treatments had failed. I tried Ring Stop, taking 2 capsules twice a day for two months, as they recommended. It had absolutely no impact on my tinnitus. There was no reduction in the noise in my ears. This product does not work, it does not reduce one's tinnitus (at least in my experience) and I would strongly encourage you not to waste your money on it, as I did. I wish it would have worked, believe me, but as all the books say--and which I now must disappointingly admit--taking pills will not eliminate tinnitus. My experience with Ring Stop certainly proved that.
