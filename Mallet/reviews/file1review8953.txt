review/text: I just starting using this item about 5 days ago. I haven't noticed much on increased energy level, but I am starting to feel better in general. I was surprised that it is not gritty - I mix it was some unfiltered apple juice and drink it. It does have a slight odor, but it tastes just fine. The color is not too appetizing either. It tastes much better tho than things I have used in the past in an attempt to get the same nutrition. I have already recommended it to a co-worker and she is going to try it.
