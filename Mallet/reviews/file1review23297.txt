review/text: I have used my sweeper about 3 times now and it works quite well on our Pergo (laminate) floors...it picked up cat hair, crumbs, small leaves with no problem. It also works pretty well on our low pile carpet (again, crumbs, cat hair and grass) as well as the throw rugs in the kitchen (dried coffee grounds). As another reviewer mentioned, the handle fell apart the first time I used it, but black electrical tape is a good fix. I like the fact that I don't have to drag out the big, heavy vacuum cleaner and scare the cat (due to the noise)!
