review/text: Irish Spring Deodorant Bath Bar is a fresh-smelling soap that leaves you feeling rather clean and refreshed. However, I didn't particularly like this scent. I think that this is a more manly soap and I would recommend it to any man looking for a great soap! The only reason I wouldn't use it would be because I didn't like the scent. I would recommend this soap only to men!!
