review/text: I originally bought the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor at a local shake store and was impressed by the flavor and consistency. It really tasted like a good milkshake. I bought my next container from Amazon because it was a little cheaper and I wanted to try a different flavor. The Double Rich Chocolate is okay but not as yummy. It tastes slightly bitter and not as sweet as the Extreme Milk Chocolate. When I finish the Double Rich Chocolate, I think I'm going back to the Extreme Milk Chocolate.
