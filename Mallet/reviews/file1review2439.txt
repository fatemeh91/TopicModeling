review/text: My wife and I stumbled across this gem when we were seeking to spice things up. We're both pretty sure this resulted in our first child. We've loved and enjoyed this product so thoroughly that it has become a staple in our bedroom. We have also purchased it as a gift for others. I hope you take the chance to discover the wonders of this lubricant. A little goes a long way, and a 250ml bottle should last at least a few months (depending on usage). We're turning to Pjur to help us with child #2. ;)
