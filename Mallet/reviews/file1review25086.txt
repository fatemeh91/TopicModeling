review/text: This battery works great for my alarm system backup battery. My old battery went through its life span, resulting in the alarm system beeping at me every few days, sometimes even at midnight (very annoying, but I guess it served its purpose well). If you have an Ademco alarm system, "BAT" will show up on your display. I went to the Honeywell website (owns Ademco products), and the replacement battery was around $33 plus shipping! Needless to say, I ordered the battery here and it came in less than a week. Just put it in one day ago and it works great. Please note that it might take a while for the "BAT" error message to disappear. The error on my system took a little while to sense that there was a new battery installed. If you're reading this, you probably already know what you're doing, but the battery goes in a brown box somewhere in your house (you might need a key to open it). I will update if the battery gives me any problems.
