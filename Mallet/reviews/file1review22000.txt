review/text: I eat a Clif Bar every morning for breakfast before I exercise. They stop the cravings and fuel me for the duration of my work out. Good balance of protein to carbs with no refined sugar and NO corn syrup. Lots of added vitamins and minerals make it a great meal replacement also when I'm too busy to eat a meal. My favorite flavor is the chocolate almond fudge--it's chocolately enough without being sickly sweet. Perfect!
