review/text: This is one of several 7 day and 4 times a day medicine holders that are larger than usual. The chief disadvantages of this particular model are that the lids were hard to open - really tight fit - and the more critical, because of the fact that lids are back to back you can't open the lids as completely as I needed when I was trying to fill these containers. We found the large four times a day medicine holders that were in one line worked much better.
