review/text: This Koppla herbal beverage is a really nice product. As herbal products for stress and fatigue go, I rate it as one of the best. It is gently relaxing, does not make you feel heavy or drugged in the least, and tastes really good to boot, unlike some herbal products (kava kava tea comes to mind). This beverage makes a good addition to an anti-stress regimen that includes exercise, meditation, and a balanced diet.
