review/text: I enjoy these condoms. I have to rank it #2 though, reason for the 4 stars. There's a lot of good quality from this condom, being that its the most thin condom on the markety makes it great for pleasure. I mean, if there was stubs or ribs...it may be better for her pleasure, but as a personal pleasure it ranks at the top. "LIKE nothing is there at all.However, this condom is a little too snug. Granted being a snug on me which I'm no Mr ED, but with a girth 5"..it was a snug fit. With a snug fit comes advantages though such as, you know it'll never slip off. Also a tighter fit prolong the endurance.I still say Durex X-Sensitive is better. Just my opinion.
