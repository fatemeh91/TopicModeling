review/text: ...my stepfather swore by them. To me, they feel weird on your nose, kind of tickly and make me go cross eyed trying to look at it on my nose. Made it difficult to sleep. However, that being said, they do what they say they will do, which is to open up the nasal passages and help make breathing easier. I won't use them again, but my mother says my stepfather has stopped snoring because of them, and for her, that makes them nearly priceless.
