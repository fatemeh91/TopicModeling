review/text: I have tried many different protein/carb bars. Myoplex is mostly a very good bar, and this one is no exception. This is one of the better of the Myoplex series. The only criticism of Myoplex is that they will, at times, change the recipe in some of the bars; and so, it loses the taste that I liked in the original recipe. This cookies and cream carb bar is one of their best.
