review/text: I ordered this hoping it would live up to some of its reviews. As anyone with psorasis knows what works for one may not work for someone else. I have a good size patch on my ankle and across the front of my foot. My knee and my fore arm. Didnt do anything for my knee and arm these spots are not that bad small patches just kind of starting. However the hot spot on my ankle it ended up burning when applied. I figured maybe thats normal. But it actually got more red and irritated.
