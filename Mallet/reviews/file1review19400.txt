review/text: I purchased this multivitamin because i wouldn't have to purchase any extra supplements (C/D).. I realized that this is supposed to be 6 pills a day, which I have still never worked up to. I was taking 3 a day, which still felt like a lot to me... because......These pills taste AWFUL. These pills smell AWFUL. To open the bottle and take them almost makes me gag so I have to get the pills out and leave them on the counter for a few minutes for the smell to dissipate.Also, the pills aren't small, so if you have difficulties with small pills, these aren't for you.
