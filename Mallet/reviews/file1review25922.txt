review/text: the charger looks and functions good but the batteries are dont seem to be 2700mh,even when they're not used they lose charge .I am actually planning to return it.I used kodak 2000mh before and they used to last much longer.I haven't tried other model batteries so far so dont know if it's the batteries or the charger..
