review/text: All I wanted was simple and the T-Trove burner is just that. I only wish it was a litlle bigger. I have to snap the ends off of Satya's 1 gram sticks for it to catch all the ash.I do recommend this burner to anyone who hates cleaning up the ashes that fall from the wooden burners, and to those who feel the bottle burners just don't let enough aroma out.
