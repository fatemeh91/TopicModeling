review/text: This product is great! I received this as a shower gift to go along with my Simmons contoured changing pad. Its soft and washes well. Changing pad covers are must haves, and this one is truly great! We registered for three, in different colors, and all the colors are beautiful. I highly recommend these pad covers, and the Simmons changing pad as well!
