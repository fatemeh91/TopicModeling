review/text: I have taken this product for approximately 4 months. Before taking OmSana my Dr. had prescribed Avandia 4 MG. once a day. My sugar count went below what it was when taking Avandia. After a few weeks it more stabilized to what it had been while taking Avandia. I take one OmSana capsule, twice a day. If I follow my diet according to my Dr's meal plans and get proper exercise daily my sugar stays between 110 and 122. Most important I'm not taking a drug that may affect my heart.
