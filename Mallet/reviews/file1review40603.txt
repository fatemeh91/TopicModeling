review/text: -Doesn't get the dishes clean. (And, I always rinse them before loading the dishwasher.)-Leaves a residue on the glasses.-Creates way too much suds, which do not drain well, and can damage the motor.OTOH...hmmm. there is no other hand. Terrible product. Plain hot water would probably work better.
