review/text: I've tried so many different brands and kinds of Hoodia, and it's NEVER done anything at all for me! It does not curb my appetite at all, in fact, it's like I never even took a pill at all! So many reviews have said, "it has to be real authentic hoodia, or it has to be the expensive brand, not the cheap version, or it has to be P57," well NONE of it works because I've tried them all.....down to P57, Desert Burn, and now Hoodoba (which was VERY expensive but I thought it would work, so I spent it!) I wish that it did work, but unfortunately it doesn't.
