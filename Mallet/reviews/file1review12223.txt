review/text: Hubby and I are 'planning' my pregnancy and after much research on taking prenatal vitamins, I decided to take this. Have been taking them for 6 weeks, and I have noticed that:a) some bad stomach cramps when taken with yogurt drinksb) felt a little bit nauseous on the first few intakes, and have read that it's to be taken with milk or during meals; to which some light gas, maybe bloating is experienced when taken with milkc) slight constipation though additional water intake would alleviate this problem.So far, I have gotten used to the large pill, and thankful to be only taking them once a day. At the moment, I am taking them every other day due to the slight constipation, still experimenting how I would later adjust to the pill.It's not as complete as it promises, and would need to supplement more with Calcium and Omega 3 (with DHA and EFA, more importantly).I appreciate it being vegan, and will continue to take it as I can't simple find any other prenatals that's as good as this one.
