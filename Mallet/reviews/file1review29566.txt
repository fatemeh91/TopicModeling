review/text: This item says that it is a good supplement for a vegetarian or vegan diet. It contains Marine Fish Oil Concentrate. Do not buy this if you are vegetarian or vegan. And please, Being Well at Hillcrest, fix the product description. There is nothing vegetarian about this product. The description is deceptive and misleading.
