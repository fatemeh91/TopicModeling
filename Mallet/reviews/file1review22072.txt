review/text: These pads may be absorbent, but they leak like crazy. When I wear them, I still have large wet stains on my clothes. I fail to see the point of wearing the pads. I suppose they help soak up SOME of the leakage, but I certainly wouldn't trust these to hold back all leakage from coming through to clothing. There doesn't seem to be any waterproof part - both sides are a soft flannel material. I was hoping for something that prevented my bras from getting soaked at every feeding, and these pads did not do that.
