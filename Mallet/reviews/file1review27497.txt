review/text: When it comes to a no non-sense protein powder, one that has extras such as glutamine and BCAA's, and at the same time has a minimal amount of fat and carbs...this is the protein to get. This isn't a meal replacement or should be used as one, if that's what your looking for try muscle milk which is high in protein but also other calories as well.This is your post-workout protein shake plain and simple. I always add one banana either in the blender or just eat it separately, and when I'm in bulking phase I'll also add one tablespoon of peanut butter and bam, you have yourself a meal replacement too if that's what you prefer. Not to mention, its freaking delicious with the peanut butter!One simple thing I have been adding to each shake is Citrulline Malate and Beta Alanine,Primaforce Citrulline Malate 200 Grams + FREE Beta Alanine Powder 250 Grams. My recovery time has literally been cut in half since adding this to the mix, also worth looking into if you are involved in intense training of any kind.
