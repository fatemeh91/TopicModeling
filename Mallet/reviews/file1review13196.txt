review/text: These sheet protectors are great. I love the larger size and have ordered many for use with my elder parent's care. I recently purchased three more for use with my puppy. I put them on the couch when I want her to lay beside me; line her portable kennel when I'm in the car etc. Just love them. They wash great and relieve the worry about accidents in all the wrong places.
