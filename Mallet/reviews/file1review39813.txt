review/text: My 85 year old mother bought one of these about 15 years ago and finally wore it out picking up pine cones and little branches. She bought a different brand because the store in our area no longer sold the Gopher. She was never satisfied with her new one because she missed having those particular rubber tipped fingers. I went online and found "her gophers" here at Amazon. I bought two of them for her and now she has one for each hand. Sometimes I think she admires them more than me.
