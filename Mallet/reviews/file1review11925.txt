review/text: I have been taking these for a few months now and I was surprised to read some of the negative reviews on here. I don't think they have any taste at all and they do not bother my stomach thats why I keep taking them.If you swallow it with orange juice you don't taste anything. I do however do not like the size. They are very large so I cut it up into at least 4 pieces.
