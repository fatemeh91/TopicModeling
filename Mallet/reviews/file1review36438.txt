review/text: My ophthalmologist told me to take these to impede the development of macular degeneration. What's good about this particular brand is that the capsules are smaller than others and only two per day are needed instead of the usual four. Is it helping with my very early stage and symptom-less macular degeneration? I have no idea. Ask me again in ten years.
