review/text: I have asthma and bad allergies so my Aunt read about the benefits of N-A-C and suggested that I start taking it! I am not joking but my asthma attacks have decreased from once a week to once a month. I am not sure that I can credit that all to N-A-C but I am going to keep using it because I like the results!! I also, don't feel as congested, which is wonderful!
