review/text: My 3 year old was potty trained at 2. Then we had a newborn, so he went back into diapers :( bummer. We tried, and tried, and tried. Nothing worked.Then, slowly, he showed interest again. But now at 3 he is more aware, and his oldDisney Pooh Soft Potty Seatwas not satisfying the royal bum. So he was usingBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Little Potty - Whiteinstead.A quick search on Amazon, and bingo! BABYBJ&Ouml;RN makes a seat as well! Had the thing in our house the next day (thanks Amazon Prime) and a potty trained kid ever since! No kidding! Not even one diaper! My son even wakes up during the night and goes by himself to use the restroom if needed (too much watermelon anybody?)Buy it! Do not hesitate anymore.
