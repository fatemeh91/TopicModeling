review/text: The Walk Fit inserts felt like I was walking on a potato sized rock. I tried them in several shoes, tried the hour at a time break in and nothing helped. These were not the right product for my foot.However, I gave them to a friend, and she nearly wept with the immediate relief they provided from the pain of her plantar fasciitis. She hasn't worn shoes without them inserted since, and is telling all her nurse co-workers to get them. (She's nearly stopping strangers on the street to sing their praises.) They've continued to provide her blessed relief more than a month later.So, on a scale of 5 stars, I'd give them and 1 and she'd give them a 10. Guess that averages to a 5.
