review/text: I ordered it during $20 off $99 purchase promotion. It's a nice buy. Good product and thumb up taste. My only problem was Amazon's shipping.I ordered this product twice with 2 packs each. Every time, there was a bag leaking. When I opened the box, it had powder everywhere. It did smell good, fresh strawberry, but I didn't want to know before I opened the bag...Moreover, I discovered the two shipping contained different packages, I'm still not sure whether they are the same products so far...Besides, the two orders have different prices as well. The first one marked as $64.xx and the second one jumped to $79.xx in just 3 days. Luckily, I called Amazon and got refunded.I would say, the whey protein is good, but the shipping was a bad experience. Next time, I probably will go to a local shop and pick a good & right bag myself.
