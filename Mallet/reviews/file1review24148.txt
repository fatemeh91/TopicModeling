review/text: The AccuMassage is probably the best money I have ever spent! My neck and shoulder muscles are very painful and stay very tight. This had immediate results. The Back Buddy is terrific for trigger points. When I started using it I did not realize how many painful trigger points I had in my back. This really helped ease the pain.
