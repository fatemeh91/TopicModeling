review/text: We bought a blood pressure monitor at a local drug store and had problems with accuracy.(another brand)We sent it back and they sent us a new one but we seemed to have the same problem. I saw a review for blood pressure monitors in Consumer reports where this one we purchased at Amazon was mentioned as one of the top rated models so I decided to order one, which by the way was on sale. So far it seems fine. Readings seem to match what we get at the doctor's office. I gave it 3 stars only because I haven't had it that long.Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSense
