review/text: We liked this product very much. And, of course, having a Test Drive for Kleenex tissues during the cold and flu season couldn't have been better. My daughter, age 3 1/2, didn't complain one time about having to use a Kleenex tissue, due to its softness. And my husband mentioned more than once about its strong durability, unlike many other brands we've tried in the past. I would recommend this for anyone shopping for tissues, and I'll continue to buy this product.
