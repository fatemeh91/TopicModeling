review/text: Great clippers ! Although the plastic attachments could be better quality (but not given the very cheap price), I gave myself the best haircut I've ever had. At first couldn't get the hang of it, and didn't know what size attachment to use for the top and what to use for the sides... I soaked my hair with water then towel dried it and used one attachment (1 inch) all over for sides and top ... I cut from front to back, side to side, back to front, then took a small hand held mirror and used a bic razor to outline the back of the neck until I get more comfortable doing it with the clippers, I wet my hair again brushed it back and ... VOILA !!! ... THE BEST CUT I'VE HAD BETTER THAN THOSE $30 PLACES TOO .. WITHOUT THE WAITING AND AGGRAVATION, PLUS ..NO BARBER GIVES YOU THE SAME GREAT CUT CONSISTENTLY. NO MORE PUTTING OFF A HAIRCUT FOR WEEKS !! ... YEY HOORAY !
