review/text: This is a fabulous toothpaste. The taste is great and makes your mouth feel clean even before you start brushing. The whitening portion, well, do any of them really work? I'm sure it helps since my teeth are not tea-stained at the moment after using this but well, I'm just skeptical.Anyway, we buy this all the time and just love it. We have very low amounts of tartar on our teeth come time to visit the dentist and isn't that what it's all about?
