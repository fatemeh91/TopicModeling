review/text: I am almost finished with both bottles and have not seen an improvement in my 9 year old daughters behavior or attention span. She is very hyper and that hasn't changed either. I have been giving her 6 tablets a day and two doses a day of the focus formula nine drops each dose. Anybody have any suggestions? I know herbal formulas take longer to work so I'm willing to order one more bottle before I give up.
