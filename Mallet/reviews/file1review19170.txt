review/text: I used these tests as directed. I was quite excited to get a faint line for the first time after months of ttc. I was quite disappointed when that line couldn't be duplicated on any store brand test. The lines kept coming, even some darker than others but af showed on time. I then tried the test about a week into my next cycle and got the same faint line. These tests are duds and heart breaking. I am very sorry I wasted my money on them.
