review/text: This product was good and bad. It says it will made you're body cut,which is not entirely true..The good part of animal cuts is that it will give you energy to keep you going throughout a long day.The disadvantage of this product is it is only a temporary weight loss product because it causes you to lose water weight..which comes right back once you are done with the product. Possibly if you followed the method it tells you on the back (3 weeks on it,1 week off) and used multiple purchases of the product it would work,but with one i noticed very little results.Hope this helped!Perry,IL
