review/text: I have been buying rechargeable AA batteries since the days of NiCd cells. I have purchased many brands, including Energizer, Maha Powerex, Kodak, Sanyo Eneloops, and Duracell. All degrade slowly over time -- except some Duracells, which are prone to sudden and irreversible failure. I charge with Maha chargers, including the MH-C9000 which can also recondition and analyze. Several years ago, I bought ~20 of these Duracells. Fully half of them no longer hold a charge.I have many Energizer, Powerex, and Kodak cells that hold nearly their rated capacity for far longer than two years. To have 50% of the Duracells fail in this timeframe has convinced me to never buy a Duracell NiMH battery again. Ever.
