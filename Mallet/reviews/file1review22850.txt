review/text: I heard from a couple of my friends that animal cuts was awesome. Animal cuts is a trusted name so I figured I would give it a shot. It was ok. There was a huge amt of pills which was ok, but kind of annoying. I have taken a few different fat burners that I had far better results. Methyl burn elite takes the prize for me. With any supplement what you put into it is what you get out. You cant sit on your butt and expect to loose weight. I increased my cardio and tweaked my diet and had great results with methyl burn. I only lost three pounds with animal cuts
