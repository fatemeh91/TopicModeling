review/text: We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1) Fairly easy to clean, integrated design. Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2) Built in pee guard for boys... We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3) very sturdy and stable on toilet. This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one. Highly recommended!
