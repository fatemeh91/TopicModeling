review/text: I've been walking constantly @ 1.5mph for 8-10 hours a day at a treadmill desk for the past week and my heels have been killing me as I have flat feet and have developed a lovely wicked case of plantar fasciitis.Thought these would be the ticket, and for the first couple hours I use them everyday, they are. A marked drop in discomfort levels! However, after a couple of miles/hours, the heat generated by my feet seems to cause even these highly rated orthotics to fail. When I stop to check them, they are very warm to the touch and give and bend easily making them pretty much useless for the longer term arch support I need.Disappointed and needing a new fix, soon.
