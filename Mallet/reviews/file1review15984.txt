review/text: Without going into the unfortunate details let's just say I was able to compare the readings on the Alcomate with a device that was certified for legal purposes and it was INACCURATE by up to 50%!!(At least it tended to be off on the high side i.e. exaggerating your BAC but are you going to trust your legal liability to something that inaccurate?) I would love to hear a response from the manufacturer and any independent testing of this device. Is there ANY warranty of accuracy for this device? I think not,- and if there is- mine is defective and needs to be replaced. Don't even think of risking your legal liability by relying on this until this is clarified.In response to Willis's comments- no I did not get a DUI in reliance on this device. I would never trust it given my experience to give an accurate reading and neither should anyone else. Several other reviewers have corroborated its inaccuracy. If there's an objective side-by-side comparison to a legally recognizedbreathalyzer let's see it. Otherwise it's just an over-priced toy.
