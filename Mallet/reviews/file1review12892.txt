review/text: Just received the elasto gel mask today. I ordered it to relieve my dry eye problem as I read hot compresses (103 degrees for 5 minutes) is recommended. I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds per side and it got nice and hot. I placed it on my eyes and it stayed hot for the 5 minutes. It suited my purpose really well. It is a littler smaller than it looks in the picture but that worked great for me. I just need coverage for my eyes. I definately recommend it.
