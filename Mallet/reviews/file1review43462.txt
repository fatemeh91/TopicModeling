review/text: The HEM-711AC is accurate as confirmed against doctor's measurements, it has memory enough to retain a good history and can be powered by battery &/or A/C. However, the time & date function fails if the batteries are not installed and working.The "fuzzy logic" thing that helps the machine know how to pressure up and depressure accurately and consistently is a great addition to BP measuring. I was never very trusting of measurement taken by a series of different professionals who were in a hurry or overpressured the cuff.The only feature I wish had been included is the averaging of all measurements in memory. With this model the only readings that are included in the averaging feature are the very recent ones. Useful if you want to know what your average BP has been this morning but no good if you are interested in seeing a trend for the week. Given the state of consumer electronics where cell phones can cook breakfast, I'm sure a pretty nice suite of memory, averaging and graphing features could be worked out cheaply.That said, for about $50 the unit does what it advertised and does it very well.
