review/text: I dont know what all the other reviewers were raving about. I generously applied this product to my face and while it did feel amazing it didnt suck out all the blackheads as other reviews had stated. My pores did look a little smaller though once I washed it off and my skin was really soft. I felt absolutely no tingling, stinging or burning like some of the other reviewers and it took about 45 minutes to fully harden which is about average for products of this nature. I dont regret buying it, but I probably wouldnt buy it again.
