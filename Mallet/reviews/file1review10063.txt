review/text: The product is well worth its price because the stones heat to the exact right temperature. You would likely burn yourself (and your loved one!) if you tried to duplicate that temperature in a crockpot or on your stove. Should be standard equipment for all massage therapists. Buy one for your massage therapist for Xmas. I got terrific relief from it. A great product for the price.
