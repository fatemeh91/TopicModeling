review/text: These were a tight fit for me, they also don't slide all the way down. They get the job done and for the price they are awesome. I never had any breaking issues with these at all, even with the tight fit. They are pink (which is fine with me) and not very lubricated.Overall: Tight Fit, Pink, Lubricated Poorly, Gets the job done, Awesome price. I'm happy with my purchase.
