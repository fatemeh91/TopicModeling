review/text: After several months of suffering from bunion pain I decided to try this product. Overnight my pain was gone and after wearing it for several weeks I'm still pain free. It's comfortable to sleep in and has held up well. I no longer wear it every night but when the pain flairs up I put this on and I'm feeling great the next day. I highly recommend!
