review/text: My face is shaped like Joni Mitchell's: Prominent cheekbones and large teeth. It's really tight in there, and I guess I have been brushing my gums into thier own little resession! Since I have used the Triumph my teeth still feel smooth and clean as they did after my hygienist visit. As for the claim that it gets between your teeth, well, that depends on how crowded together the teeth are. The brush head is a little big to fit between my cheek and gums, so I have to pull my cheek out to give it room. It's also kind of spattery, especially when you are doing the backs of your front teeth. I guess I am still getting used to using it, but guess what...I actually look forward to brushing my teeth! It signals you to move every 30 seconds to a different area, but I am never finished in time because of the contortions I have to go through to get it to fit in my mouth. But it makes my mouth feel so clean that I hate to eat anything between meals- so maybe it doubles as a weight loss aid!!
