review/text: I am a true advocate for enzymes. They are great for helping your food digest and even better when you take them on an empty stomach. Our bodies don't produce new enzymes so if we don't get them from fermented foods, enzymes are very helpful. It is also helpful when my little ones have gas bubbles(just give it to them in proper quantities)!
