review/text: I bought this on Amazon as it is not yet available here in India. Purely as replacement cartridges they are very very expensive. (of course Amazon has it on sale right now). There is not much to review on the replacement cartridges.As far as the shaving experience goes, it is absolutely fabulous. It is extremely smooth and saves time while shaving. The lube strip seems to wear out faster than the Mach , but I could be mistaken there as I've been using it for a a few days only now.For the price, the packaging is pretty flimsy.
