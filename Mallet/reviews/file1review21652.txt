review/text: We really liked the size of this tub. Our 1 yr old has room in it and can use it for some time. It saves water. I wanted to push the tub toward the back of the larger house tub so that our son was not tempted to pull up on the faucets. I was going to use the shower hose to fill it. However, when I tried to drain the tub, the drain on the bottom of the tub would suction to the bottom of the house tub and it wouldn't drain. I'd have to hold the drain hole off the floor of the tub. It is too heavy to pick up with water in it. It will drain if you push the tub to the very front of the bathtub where the drain hole is over at least part of the bathtub drain. So the tub works, but you can only put it in one place in the front. I wish they had a little piece under the drain hold that held it off the floor of the bathtub. Other than that, it is inexpensive and keeps our son contained and safe.
