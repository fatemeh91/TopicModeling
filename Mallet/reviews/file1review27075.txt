review/text: A friend recommended this product to me and I'm so glad he did. I use 2 scoops of this Double Rich Chocolate flavor and add a cup of skim milk and about 7-8 ice cubes in a blender. I like that consistency the best. If I want a really thick shake, I'll add about 10-12 ice cubes. I also add a tablespoon of organic peanut butter for added flavor--that is REALLY good. I drink this within 30-60 minutes of waking and it keeps me full for about 4-5 hours. Great stuff!
