review/text: Vanilla Bean FlavorI usually make my own shakes with fresh fruit and milk (or soy milk). I wanted a protein boost without added sweetness or granular texture. This fits the bill perfectly. This product does not have any added sweetener and the overall flavor is very mild. This made my shakes taste richer but didn't really change the flavor. This probably wouldn't taste good with just water since it is very bland.It mixes very smoothly. Some people voiced a confusion about ingredients, serving size and such so I thought I'd include what it says on the powder i received (it is the same as Solgar's Whey To Go Protein Powder Natural Vanilla Flavor - New & Improved Formula as reported on their website).Serving Size: 25 g (approx. 1 Level Scoop)Amount Per Serving, Calories 90, Cholesterol 5 mg 2%** ,Total Carbohydrate 2 g &lt;1%**, Sugars &lt;1 g***, Protein 20 g 40%**, Calcium (from whey) 100 mg 10%, Sodium (from whey) 40 mg 2%**Percent Daily Values (DV) are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.***Daily Value (DV) not established.Ingredients: Cross-Flow Micro-Filtered Whey Protein Isolate , Cross-Flow Micro-Filtered Whey Protein Concentrate , Natural Vanilla and Caramel Flavors, Free-Form L-Glutamine, Free-Form BCAA's (Leucine, Valine, Isoleucine), Soy Lecithin, Hydrolyzed (partially predigested) Whey Protein Concentrate (supplying di, tri, oligo and polypeptides).
