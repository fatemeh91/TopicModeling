review/text: This is my first yoga mat and I thought having the blocks and the strap for this price should be a good purchase, and it was. I re-started yoga again, and I used a towel and a belt for the poses which did not help my back.I read most of the other reviews and this is my take:1. The product arrived a day early so that was a big yay!2. The smell of the mat is not as bad as reported in other reviews. I didn't even have to air it before using it so I used it right away. Then again, I'm a vet and I'm used to REALLY STRONG smells and this did not bothered me at all. I guess this depends on the person.3. The blocks are light and strong, and with the mat and the strap, all them fits inside the totem bag, plus other personal stuff like a small towel, wallet, etc.4. I do not like purple, but it the color didn't annoy me. I guess that's good.5. The mat does feels comfy under the fit, it does not "glues" to the floor but I did not slip once.6. Maybe I need a thicker mat since my back problem, maybe the product needs be more clear in the thickness like how many cms, etc. Maybe if its thicker then It may not be that sticky.I think that eventually I may get another but thicker mat in the future, but who knows, I may not need it as I advance in yoga if my body gets better, etc.Oh and something else, the first time I used it, I was doing some floor pose, and my cat thought it was a nice "new" place to scratch her nails...grr lol
