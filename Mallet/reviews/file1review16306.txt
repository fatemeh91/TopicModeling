review/text: Having been a devoted user of another competing product since I learned to cook several years ago, I was satisfied, but willing to try this product when the opportunity came along. Even so, how much better could it be? Sure it has a pretty box, pretty wrappers for each "dishwasher treat" (as I call them), and a red bead about the size of a marble that, if nothing else, gives the marketing/advertising department something new to crow about.Trial #1 was just a normal load of dishes. Everything came out really clean, with no residue on the dishes. So far, so good. . . Trial #2 I decided to test their "baked on lasagna" claim. I put in a lasagna pan that had not been pre-rinsed or pre-scrubbed and put it in the bottom rack, upside down with a pretty significant lasagna spot on the bottom. Just to be reasonable, I used the Pots and Pans setting on my dishwasher. I threw in an unrinsed pot that was used for mashed potatoes as well, just for variety. Once again, everything came out as clean as it ever was and no residue. OK, I'm impressed. . .If you're environmentally minded, you might object to the disposable box and the individual wrapping on every biscuit (that you have to remove, unlike some products), but that's really reaching for something to complain about. This stuff works very well and lives up to its promises. It leaves the competitor in the dust, and I can't imagine what another product could do to surpass it. Highly recommended.
