review/text: An AED is a wonderful item to have if you or a loved-one have an existing heart condition or significant family history of such (talk to your health provider), especially if you live in an medically underserved area.Agreeing with another reviewer, in many ways and in many places taking a CPR course may be more helpful (and economical). Take a training course in AED use prior to using this type of equipment. There are risks involved for the operator and patient if improperly used.Contrary to information provided in some of the reviews, AED's are designed not to shock on demand, but only when particular heart rhythms are recognized by the machine.As with any health care product, please speak with your health care provider (MD, PA, NP, ND, DO, etc.) prior to purchasing or using this equipment. It is not appropriate for every household.
