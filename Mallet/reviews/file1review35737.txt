review/text: I bought 2 ankle supports in hopes that they would help me stay on my feet for a week long vacation at Disney World. I can report that they made the difference. During earlier trips I was frequently forced to sit down and rest. Once I was sidelined and couldn't even walk for a day. With these ankle braces I was able to walk comfortably and still had energy left for the walk back to the bus at the end of each long day.The braces are difficult to get on and off and to lace up. There are also straps that you pull to tighten the brace once you have it in place. At the end of the day they are difficult to get off. I was grateful to have an understanding wife who helped me in the process.While I complained at the process I do recognize that the braces were designed to give me the support I needed. I already have a drawer full of easy-to-get-on support braces that don't work. These are sturdy and effective.If you have ankle problems and need solid support I can readily recommend these braces ... they served me well. And they will again.
