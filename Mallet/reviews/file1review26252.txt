review/text: The Obus forme seat and seat back appear at first glance to be just what is necessary to make a chair more comfortable. However, I have to report that if they did anything, they ultimately made my chair less comfortable. The product tends to slide around on the chair, and take so much energy to keep them in place that they ultimately become almost painful to sit in.I finally returned these products for a refund.
