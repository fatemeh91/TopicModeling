review/text: I almost didn't buy this product after all the negative reviews I read. However, I am glad that I did. I have not had a single problem with the velcro. It has been hanging on the crib for nearly a year without it falling off once. I have added cute bows as extra support but only becasue I wanted it to look "girly". This holds everything for me, wipes, diapers, ointments, soaps, lotions, nursing pads, toys, and much more. I don't know what I would do without it!
