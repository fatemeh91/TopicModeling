review/text: I purchased this device recently not because I thought I had high blood pressure but because I wanted to regularly check my BP to make sure it wasn't irregular or too high. I love this device because it is fairly accurate ( I say it's fairly accurate because I used it at the hospital to check if the BP was the same as what the nurse recorded). This device is convenient to carry around if you need to check your BP on the road. I believe it is very affordable for what it is and it's a great way to stay on top of your blood pressure!
