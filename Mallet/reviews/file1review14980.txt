review/text: Great product that really does make nails longer, hair healthier and skin brighter. While I have seem small improvements in my hair and nails, I have noticed the most improvement in my skin. My face seems brighter with a more even skin tone. It makes me reconsider wearing makeup. While I don't enjoy having to take three a day, there a great nutrients packed in the vitamins and I feel good about what I'm putting in my body and what I'm getting out of it.
