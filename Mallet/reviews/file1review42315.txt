review/text: I absolutely adore these vitamins. Liked them so much I bought the child version for my son.Since I have been taking them I do not have the urge to drink coffee- of course the down side to that is fighting thru the ensuing withdrawal symptoms. Otherwise I feel great and maintain a steady energy level all day. The taste isn't all that pleasant sometimes but it's mostly a kinda vitaminy aftertaste and is hit or miss. Totally tolerable.I noticed no one mentioned the effect Source of Life has in the digestive tract: these keep me on the go. Hopefully that isnt tmi but its important to know. If I eat an excessive amt of junk food, the next day will not be comfortable after i've downed my source of life dose. You'd think that would keep me off chips n brownies right?
