review/text: At first I thought that there was something wrong with the battery because it quit on me while my wife was triming my hair. It just wasn't charged properly at first. Now I don't have any problems. I don't use it every day but I haven't needed to charge it since. I bought because it's cordless and easy to use. The guard is easy to use and stays how you set it. I'm glad I got it and Amazon is great to work with.
