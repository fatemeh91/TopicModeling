review/text: They were exactly like the ReliaMed Pads that came with my ReliaMed TENS unit. Fits exactly. You may get two uses out of each set, but I don't bother trying. If you're not moving, and they aren't going to be hanging upside-down, you can probably get two uses. Prep the skin with alcohol first.
