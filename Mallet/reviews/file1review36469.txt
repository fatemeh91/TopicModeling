review/text: I'm usually prepared to be somewhat disappointed with items purchased sight-unseen, but I am completely satisfied with this product. I have degenerating disks in my neck, and was looking for a bookstand that I could use while nestled in an upholstered chair without a table in front. Not only does this accomplish what I need perfectly, it is also compact, lightweight, and very quick and easy to set up and collapse. The pole stays exactly where you place it. I need to read without lowering my head at all, so I put a pillow on my lap and this raises the book to eye level with my neck straight. I haven't seen anything else that can do this. Highly recommended.
