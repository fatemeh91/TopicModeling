review/text: I used the original HeadBlade for about a year, and although I preferred it to a regular blade, I was never very happy with the blades it used, because they had a tendency to nick my scalp if I wasn't paying attention. (an easy thing to do 1st thing in the morning) I was quite happy when I received the HeadBlade Sport as a gift, and have found that it is a vast improvement on the previous design. I can shave my head in a fraction of the time of using a traditional blade, without any nicks at all.Yes, I still use a normal razer for my face and some of the places like above the ear, but I still count it as a major time savings. Can I get a closer shave with a normal blade? Probably, but I'll most likely nick the heck out of my head in the process.The one word of advice I would give someone contemplating using this versus a regular blade is to use it in the shower. Having your scalp "conditioned" by warm water really improves the closeness of the shave.Thank you, HeadBlade for saving me precious minutes in the morning for almost 2 years now.
