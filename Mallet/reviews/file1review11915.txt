review/text: This is day 3 with these and the 2nd day in a row I've gagged and thrown up in the sink. I had been using another kind, but the iron was too low so I switched. It's been AWFUL! Like another reviewer said, its the taste/smell/size combo. It's not working for me AT ALL. and I can take large pills just fine normally, and my other prenatals weren't particularly small either. But they didn't smell or make me gag. Tonight I cut them in half to see if that would help. The first half went down fine. The second I gagged again and threw up in the sink. I give up!
