review/text: I am a gym fanatic and I don't believe in taking a bunch of chemical crap....good ole protein and smart eating. This goes in my protein shake every morning. There is a slight "veggie" taste to my strawberry shake but it still is tasty. Highly recommend this product. I have tried others and they taste waaaay worse and don't have half the stuff that this has in it.
