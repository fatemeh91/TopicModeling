review/text: product works as promised ... can't really eat one every day since you get tired of the taste and the stickiness of the bar when you chew it... however, having one every couple of days is tollerable and works great... you feel much better... I think this bar is great to have as a set of fiber tools you are using to stay healthy... not as the ONLY way to stay healthy...
