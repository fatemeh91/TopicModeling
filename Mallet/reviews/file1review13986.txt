review/text: Let me start by writing what I did. I boiled water. As I waited, I took out a tray and tried it on. I practiced sucking the air out of it as mentioned in the instructions here in the product page. After the water started to boil, I turned off the stove and transferred the water to a pan. I immediately dipped the tray, waited for about 3-4 seconds and then placed it around my teeth. I tried to mold it as much as I could but it wasn't enough. I repeated dipping into hot water and molding for about 5 times but I could never get a good impression. I stopped because I didn't think it could get any better than that.This DIY tray is quite cheap so I didn't have very high expectations. Nevertheless, I expected it to at least somehow follow the contours of my teeth. One of the reviewers mentioned that you should cut it around the gum-tooth border. How can I when I can't even see where it is? The impression on the tray wasn't enough even though I tried to reheat and remold it a couple of times.After trying to mold it, I thought that maybe it will be enough to keep the whitening gel in contact with my teeth. It looked like it did when I examined it in front of a mirror. Unfortunately, the trays were really uncomfortable. The gel I have requires 8-9 hours of use so I use them overnight. When I tried to sleep, I couldn't close my mouth because the trays were too thick. However, if budget is a concern, this is tolerable enough. If you're using it for a much shorter time, I think it will work too.All in all, it just depends on whether you want to shell out the extra money to get something that fits your teeth better. This does the job of keeping the gel in place but there's no comfort whatsoever.
