review/text: These chocolate mints are great tasting caffeine snacks! It takes 3 mints to equal a can of soda .. and about 4 cans of soda to equal a cup of coffee ... so it's a small amount of caffeine, but a great option so you can decide just how much caffeine you want. They taste great, too .. sweet, chocolately and minty but not overpowering at all.
