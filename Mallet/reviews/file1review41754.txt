review/text: I just got this for Christmas, so I'm still getting used to it. It is easy to use. I like that it has a covered compartment for the different toothbrush heads. There is a 'soft' speed, but I wish it was a little more gentle. Overall, this is a great toothbrush. It came with the flossing head and the polishing head and I also got a pack of the regular heads. The flossing head was a little harsh, I was scared to use it on my front teeth, but the regular heads worked fine. If you are planning on purchasing this particular toothbrush, I suggest picking up a pack of the 'Oral-B EB17 Flexisoft' heads as well.
