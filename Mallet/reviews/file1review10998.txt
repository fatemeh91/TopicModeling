review/text: Horrible product. I'll never buy it again. I purchased multi-pack and threw the entire lot in the trash after about 5 minutes trying to use the first roll.The adhesive paper has more of an affinity to unrolling and sticking to itself than anything else. The roll was poorly perforated so removing a used strip resulted in little gaps in the smoothness of the roll. This caused it to roll back on itself and proceed to unroll 3 or 4 unused sheets in one single swipe.Before I tried this product I always used Evercare lint rollers. I'll go back to those rollers as they are much better product.
