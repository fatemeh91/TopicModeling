review/text: I went in search of this product when my son got a cold. I remember the pleasant taste and used to love to get it from my mother. This is not the same one. It appears that they added more cod liver oil and that is the taste that seems to stick with you. To help with the cough - I don't think it really does anything that the other brand of children cough syrup does. My son hates the taste and calls it his yucky medicine. We have come to the conclusion that if you take it off the spoon and hurry up and swallow it - it's not as bad.
