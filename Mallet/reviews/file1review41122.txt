review/text: I really wanted to like this product. Like the previous reviewer, I like that it's made by a small company. Plus, the packaging is adorable and very convenient. The gum, however, gets almost unusable if it gets cold at all. I keep it in my purse which is always with me and only exposed to the cold for a few minutes at a time. I nearly broke a tooth trying to chew it! And, in the same container, some pieces are fine, others are not. The flavor is pretty good but the pieces are tiny. I don't know about the caffeine...I don't feel much different after chewing it. I guess I was hoping to get a surge of energy similar to a cup of coffee, but it's just not there...and (out of desperation) I've even tried 5 or 6 pieces at a time. Oh well...back to coffee and no-doz for me!
