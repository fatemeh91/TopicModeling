review/text: This paste is incredible! You put it on at night, and scrub it off in the morning. Presto, no underarm smell. For DAYS afterwards. I don't have bad body odor, but this makes it so I have no underarm odor at all. Other pluses are no toxic aluminum, no anti-perspirant yellow stains on clothes (that are impossible to remove, especially on white blouses), no icky fragrances, no stickiness during the day. One caveat is that it is a white paste, and will rub off on your pyjamas (you wear it overnight). But that washes off easily with no staining left. Just be careful not to get it on something black that you can't wash with soap and hot water, like a cashmere robe or something. I think the main ingredient is zinc oxide, something non-toxic but antibacterial, in a corn starch paste. P.S. It is NOT an anti-perspirant. It just takes away all the odor.
