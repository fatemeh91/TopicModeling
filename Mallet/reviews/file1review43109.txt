review/text: It is a good support,but can wear only underneath crew neck shirts, else visible and hence cant wear in office or outdoors.I ended up wearing for few hours at home for few days and since most of the time couldnt wear it, it has ended up at some corner of my closet.It did help for whatever few hours i wore it.
