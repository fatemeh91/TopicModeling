review/text: I tried various wart removal products over the counter and online. I had a quite a big size wart on my left hand. I tried Wart Stick for few times then quit using it because I thought this won't work either like other wart removal. Few months later I started using this product again and now after about a month of using this my wart is almost gone. I usually use about 3-4 times a week and its working. I hope it won't come back again.
