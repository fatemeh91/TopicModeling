review/text: I have ADD. I realize, looking back over my life, that is was a hindrance to my complete success. I am not making excuses, but going by what I now know to be true.Well, life is unlimited. And now that I have found a way to truly FOCUS I am unstoppable.Please try this if you just need to focus and definitely if you are ADD. You will get more done and be more organized.There are other pills containing DMAE and Huperzine, etc. but these are cheaper and due to Irwin's delivery to the body, take effect better.Keep in mind that you should not take these if pregnant. I did for a while (because I didn't know I was pregnant) but I found out that it was possible that one ingredient in these pills could possibly give neural tube defects in baby. My baby didn't have these, thank goodness, but it is good to heed the warnings. Also, other items in these natural liquid soft-gels are simply not proven to be safe or not safe for PREGNANT women. Again, my child was okay but don't chance it if you KNOW you are pregnant.But barring that, this will work for anyone. I have a baby sister that is bipolar as well as ADHD and they help. They help my aging mother and my &#34;normal&#34; minded husband.At least give them a try and it is good that AMAZON carries this larger bottle. So many health food stores don't have it or it gets out of stock quickly.
