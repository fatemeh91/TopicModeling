review/text: I opened the box containing the TWO pads that I purchased and on both packages is a sticker stating: "Warning: Not suitable for use by children under the age of 12." I am unclear as to why this is not clearly stated in the product description. There is no reason given, though I'm assuming that the pads are not "breathable" and young children can suffocate. Looks like I will be returning these.
