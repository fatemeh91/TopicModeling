review/text: My wife purchased this digital thermometer after pouring herself over hours of research and reading. Being an audiophile and a Registered Nurse, she's one of those people that reads the manual on everything first, never makes an impulse purchase and often times calls the company directly via the phone numbers listed on the packaging (which she usually copies down in the store).I had purchased a different thermometer for her as birthday present, but that's a whole other story. Needless to say the Braun Thermoscan Thermometer was her preferred choice. The reasons are thus:1.The readings this device give are the most accurate for any ear thermometer on the market at any price. This should be the most important reason - all - the time.2.The sterile caps are a necessity and even if you're only using the device on one child you should do everything in your power to cut down on ear infections.3.The reading it takes occurs very quickly.4.The beep is more for me than it is for her, which she thinks is a must. Removing the device early is a common mistake.5.The 'ease of use' makes taking an ear reading a simple matter. Easier than oral, rectal or armpit and a world of difference over the newer Temporal Thermometers.6.The storage of 1000 readings which is a blessing when you have to look back at the data, and some of us do.My son likes this thing so much he quickly figured out how to stick it in his own ear a few times and press the button and wait for the beep, which caused my wife to scowl and panic, but of course I just thought my son was gifted like all foolish parents out there.The cost of the small plastic filters is incredibly minimal as is the actual cost of the device itself. Sure, you can go to Target or Wal-Maze and buy yourself another cheapie, but then you'll be back exactly where you are now sometime later ... looking for a dependable and accurate ear Thermometer.This is currently the best.
