review/text: This is an okay product for the price but it is wobbly. I have tried to learn to set it in such a way that all 4 legs land at the same time but I gave up. Also the legs are not equidistant from the center so when walking with it in my left hand, I had to turn the handle backwards to avoid tripping over it.
