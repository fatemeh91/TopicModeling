review/text: What are your intentions with this product?! Are you trying to smoke some stuff and then go on a vision quest for about 15 minutes and use this mask to shut out light so you can explore the inner cavities of your mind? That's not what I use this product for, however I've heard of that, and if those are your intentions, then this product is probably great for you. However if you have to sleep in the daytime a lot I wouldn't really recommend this mask for 3 main reasons. First and foremost, its VERY uncomfortable. I mean seriously, who the heck designed this thing, it is TERRIBLE. it will hurt your nose, the area under your eyes, and especially around your ears. To really block out the light you kind of have to strap it against your nose so that it is difficult to breathe through your nose. Even then there are certain angles at which light can get through, so that finding the perfect angle is a kind of game. If you need to sleep in the day time and are as much of a light sleeper as I am and have as many insomniac tendencies as I do, then the few minutes it takes to wrestle with this stupid contraption to get the lighting right and the comfort level tolerable, could be the difference between a good night sleep and NOT SLEEPING AT ALL and being resentful that you bought such a stupid product. Research around, there are far more comfortable masks out there, albeit, more expensive, but then again you get what you pay for.
