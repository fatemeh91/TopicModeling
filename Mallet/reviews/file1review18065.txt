review/text: I've been using the sleep masks you get on planes, which don't last. I bought this a couple of months ago and like it so much that I am immediately replacing one I have misplaced.It was a little stiff the first night, and it took a day or two before I figured out the best way to adjust the velcro (and, I think, for the fabric to mold) but then it was just perfect.I highly recommend!
