review/text: I purchased these as dish rags for the kitchen because they dry out very quickly and don't get that nasty stink when rags stay damp for a long time. They work very well to wipe up spills and are very absorbent. The only complain I have is that they stick to other clothing items when I do the laundry and sometimes I don't find them until someone tries to put that shirt on!
