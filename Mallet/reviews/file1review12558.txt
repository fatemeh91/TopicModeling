review/text: To put it simply, this product really works! I am 37 and in great health. I try to take care of my body as much as possible. With that said, over the last couple of years I had begun to get bloated after eating my evening meal. It got to the point of being ridiculous. I have a thin and athletic build except in the evenings when I would become very bloated. After months of intensive research into various colon cleansing products on the market and various causes of bloating I determined that parasites were probably my problem, especially since constipation is very rare for me. Colon cleansing was a big part of the process of a parasite cleanse.After another month or two of studying Oxy-Powder and reading all of the reviews on Amazon I finally bought the product and was absolutely amazed. I haven't felt this good ever! I did follow up my colon cleanse with Paratrex but keep in mind that I felt much better after using just the Oxy-Powder. Be forewarned, this product will create liquid stools as the product label says but it is very effective and as near as I can tell very safe. I am very picky about what I put into my body. I won't even take an aspirin. After taking Oxy-Powder for over four months I have found it to be most effective for me to take five capsules daily right before bed with lots of water on an empty stomach. Dr. Group's website says it is safe to take every day but only recommends twice weekly after the initial cleanse. I can't recommend this product enough! I will take it for life.
