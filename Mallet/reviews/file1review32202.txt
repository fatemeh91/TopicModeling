review/text: Pros: Cheap, reasonably durable, washes about 10-15 times before turning into unusable frazzle. Velcro closures are a big plus as most people who use these for low-level leg compression cannot suffer wounds from those horrendous shark-toothed metal clips.Cons: The velcro is low quality and wants to bunch-up after a few washings. You will have to do some home-maintenance (i.e. picking the velcro apart) to keep the corners functioning properly. After about 5-10 washings, the elastic in the end 6" to 1' tends to wear out pretty badly, while the interior of the bandage remains sound.ALL IN ALL: Since these are so doggone cheap, and since similar bandages retail for $7-$10 in drug stores, I cannot afford NOT to buy them! :-) **** Four-star recommendation ****
