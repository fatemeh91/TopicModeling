review/text: Nu-Cat vitamin pills were recommended for my two cats, now sixteen years old, by my vet. My cats like to eat dry cat food. When I put the pills in the dry food, the pills disappear with the food. The pills are mostly eaten by one cat, Brownie, and only sometimes by her brother, Pi. It does certainly improve Brownie's fur.This is much easier and safer than trying to give the cats liquid vitamins with a dropper. However, Pi gets the liquid vitamins. He getsHi-Viteliquid vitamin drops. The drops do give him more energy, but are difficult to give to him. If your cat will eat the Nu-Cat tablets, I recommend them.
