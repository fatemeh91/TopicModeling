review/text: My husband and I had tried unsuccessfully for ten months to conceive our second child. My periods were very regular, but I was 39 years old at the time and we were in a hurry so I ordered some FertilAid. After just a month of taking the supplements as directed, I got pregnant. We lost that pregnancy in an uneventful miscarriage at 9.5 weeks. I gave my body a month off, then started taking FertilAid again. By then I had turned 40, but within two months, I was pregnant again. It seems that FertilAid gave my body the extra boost it needed to get pregnant and stay pregnant. Our beautiful, healthy son is now six months old and I give FertilAid credit for helping us to complete our family. I would recommend this product to anyone who does not have major medical complications, but rather just seems to need a little extra help in getting pregnant.
