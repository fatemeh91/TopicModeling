review/text: This is truly a great shaving cream. It is on par with the best English creams out there; Trumpers, TOBS, Truefitt and Hill. As well cushioned and conditioned the shave is, the smell is even better. By far the strongest lavendar smell I have ever experienced in a shave cream.I was told to try the Art of ShavingThe Art of Shaving Shaving Cream, Lavender Essential Oil, for Sensitive Skin, 5.3 oz (150 g)as well if I enjoyed the Castle Forbes.The price is fairly high for a shave cream (by far not the most expensive) but this tub should last me about a year of daily 3 pass shaves. So the cost of about $3 a month is not a deal breaker for me.
