review/text: This protein is probably the best out there. There isn't anything bad in here, not too much sugar and it's a great way to supplement the diet to get extra protein in and fast after a workout. I find I'm a lot less sore taking it right away after the same workout than without taking it. After trying a dozen other proteins, this one can easily be called my favorite.
