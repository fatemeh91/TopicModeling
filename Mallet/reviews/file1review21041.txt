review/text: Excellent ear plugs!! I have used these daily for years (really), and they have worked extremely well for me. I also have smaller ear canals. so most other ear plugs are more uncomfortable. I worked in a production environment where earplugs were required and MANY varieties were available. After trial and error, I found these were the best for me.Also to those that are bothered by the strap, it can easily be completely removed. The usual need for a strap is to keep the plugs from getting lost or dropping into food, etc on a production line. The strap also gives visible evidence to supervisors that proper hearing protection is being used.
