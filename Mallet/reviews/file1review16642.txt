review/text: This lighter isn't a cheap knock-off, but instead is a genuine Zippo pocket lighter. It comes in the Zippo box and everything. It works flawlessly, all you need to do is add lighter fluid into the base and you're good to go. I would recommend investing in some spare Zippo flint and some extra length of wick, as the wick and flint will eventually need replacing. The lighter is guaranteed for life and for around ten dollars is a great deal!
