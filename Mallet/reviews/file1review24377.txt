review/text: This tastes great, does not require mixing with water, is low in sugar, and for only 90 calories per serving gives 23 grams of carbohydrate.Often I go straight to the gym from my office in the evening before I eat dinner. I used to eat a protein bar to get me through my workout and then 5 mile run on the treadmill. Now I just take one serving of gel before my workout, and another serving before my run, and I am fine--no hunger pains, and much less calories and sugar, but more carbohydrates, than a protein bar.When I do my 10 mile runs outdoors, one serving before and one serving midway gives me all the energy that I need. I noticed a difference right away from the energy level from the protein bars that I used to eat. The gel is superior, and requires no time to digest.I highly recommend this product. I also suggest buying the regular flask (not the more expensive pliable one) that Hammer Nutrition sells for as an easy way to carry and consume this gel.Update October 25, 2011: I recently bought a jug of the chocolate gel, which previously I had been using in individual packs. While the gel itself is great, unlike other flavors that I have used in a jug, the chocolate is very thick and a bit more difficult to dispense. Also, I usually put the gel from a jug into a container with server markings. But I gave up doing that with the chocolate gel since I had trouble measuring out the servings since the chocolate gel is so dark and coats the sides of my container.Bottom line: Hammer Gel is great, but I probably will not buy a jug of the chocolate again since I did not realize how thick it was compared to other flavors.
