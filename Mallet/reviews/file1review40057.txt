review/text: Flossing is hard, and unfortunately, this product doesn't make it any easier. First, the floss sections are too short. After wrapping each end around two fingers on each hand I had only about eight inches left. Second, it broke pretty easily. I needed to use three or four to get through all my teeth. Last, the wider section is a good idea, but when you pull on both ends of the floss (which you have to do to get it through your teeth) it disappears!
