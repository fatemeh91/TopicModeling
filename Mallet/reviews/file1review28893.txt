review/text: If you're looking for a protein supplement to add to your workout/muscle building routine, I highly recommend this on multiple levels. 1) Price - I think I bought the 5 lb jar for about $45 on Amazon. At other health retailers, that price is easily in the $60-75 range. 2) Taste - This is my second 5 lb jar. The first was milk chocolate, which I generally liked. The cookies and cream that I'm on now is OK, and is the only reason this isn't a 5-star review. I had heard good things about this flavor, and figured I'd try it, but it's very vanilla-y for me. Finally, 3) Results - I've only been doing weight lifting/resistance training to bulk up for about 4 months now. The mornings on my workout days I drink a serving of the protein powder and then another serving after the workout (usually within 30 minutes of my cool-down); and in those 4 months, I've gained 15 pounds of muscle. I had seen other products boasting "16 pounds of muscle in 4 weeks," but I wanted gradual change. The combination of a consistent workout schedule and this protein powder are definitely helping me achieve that.
