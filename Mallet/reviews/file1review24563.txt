review/text: I always use these types of drugs for energy boosts, not as a daily supplement for weight loss. One capsule will keep you alert with no noticeable effects, where 2 will give you that jittery feeling for an hour or so. If taken before exercise, I tend to feel extremely warn out afterwards, but in a good way, like it just really enhances the burn. My water in take definitely increases when I take it. As far as other types of similar drugs, this pretty much falls in line with the rest.
