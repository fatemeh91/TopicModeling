review/text: I have had a massive planters wart on the bottom of my foot for years now and have tried everything to kill it. I went thru bottle after bottle of salicylic acid w/ no results. I decided to give this a try after seeing that it was 40% SA. The highest I've ever seen w/o an RX script. I have been using it now for about 2 months and am so surprised with the results! This stuff has killed the wart significantly. I lather the stuff on after a shower and using a pedi-stone to take off any dead skin. I then place a large band-aid over it. I didn't have a problem with having it effect the area around the wart because it's such a large area that I'm treating. This stuff is awesome!! Will be purchasing again if I need to! Don't waste your money on small percent salicylic acid products that cost double if not triple the cost of this thing! Worth every penny!!!
