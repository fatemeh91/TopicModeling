review/text: I am 30 years old and for the past several months I've been waking up in the middle of the night with a pounding hearbeat after drinking alcohol. It is very annoying. I only drink socially, am otherwise healthy and do not take any medication. After a lot of research I decided to try out magnesium taurate and it has helped tremendously. I no longer wake up with a pounding hearbeat after a night of drinking, whether it is just one drink or a few. I also suffer from anxiety and I wouldn't call this a miracle cure for that, but it does help me feel a little more balanced.
