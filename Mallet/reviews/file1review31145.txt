review/text: HORRIBLE! Plastic on inside MUST stay covering inside or once u put batteries in it wont turn off! DOESNT last LONG! like serious, 4 minutes! runs outta battery power before u even get to enjoy it. i got a 50 pack of batteries thinking i can have it for a long time. went through half the pack so i threw it away! NOT strong at all! 7 speeds but not powerful. can barely feel it! i would have loved to have a working toy! and, didnt come with instructions. had to google how to take out batteries
