review/text: Generally there is some disappointment when ordering online. However, never with Amazon and not with the Balck and Decker hand-held vacuum I received. It's easy to work, store and the suction is incredible.I have been using this little gem more than my regular vacuum. I may order another one for the house as this one is used on our motor home.LOVE IT!
