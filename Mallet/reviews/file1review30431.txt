review/text: Pros: Rinses off beautifully; gentle, non-irritating; did not strip my skin or dry it out; natural, unobtrusive fragranceCons: The cleansing action is not very powerful or effective -- left what little makeup I had on my face more or less intact; did not leave my face feeling squeaky clean; although the bottle is rather large, I found that it only lasted for two months; hefty pricetagThere are better, cheaper cleansers out there. In fact, every aesthetician I've known has expressed lukewarm feelings toward the Special Cleansing Gel, offering many more effective alternatives. The search for the perfect cleanser certainly does not end with Dermalogica.
