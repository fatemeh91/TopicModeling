review/text: Go Green Mini Slant have been my favorite tweezers since I found them a few years ago. I've tried the drugstore tweezers, revlon etc, but none lived up to these.Tweezerman has a great reputation and a high price. The Mini Slant makes Tweezerman tweezers affordable, and they work extremely well. No misaligned or dull edges here. And the price is reasonable for a high quality pair of tweezers + they donate to the environment with every purchase of these "go green" tweezers. I am on my third pair now - lost one, and I'm buying a second to have one for home and one for travel. At this price I don't have to worry so much about losing them (face it, tweezers are tiny and easy to misplace) and I can still have the precision, quality, and guarantee of the larger tweezerman while helping the environment. Plus, I like the color and it pops out in my bag or on my counter.
