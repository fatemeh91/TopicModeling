review/text: I am a very healthy and very active woman in her later 30's. In addition to a full time, stressful corporate job, I also play the role of Mom to my 3 kids (all under the age of 5). So, yes, I am VERY busy and often very tired. Eating well and getting lots of good exercise is key to maintaining my energy levels but I have discovered that a daily dose of Green Vibrance is essential to my daily regimen. Raw foodists know first hand the benefits of eating green, but the rest of us quickly dismiss this important food group and point the finger at other areas to justify their low energy. No folks... its the GREEN. Green Vibrance tips the scale on many competitor brands with loads of probiotics and organic ingredients. I have not found another similar product that has given me the same results. (the taste is not so great, but I mix my dose in a 6 oz glass of juice and shoot it quickly, and then chase it with 2 oz of plain juice OR I incorporate into a smoothie)
