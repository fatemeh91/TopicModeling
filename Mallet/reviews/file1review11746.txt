review/text: About thirty years ago I injured both knees during a fall and until several years ago, had no problems. Age, weight gain, and osteoarthritis have made my knee problems worse. Consequently, I have a drawer full of various kinds of knee supports-adjustable wrap arounds and sleeves and not one of them is as supportive and comfortable as Safe-T-Sport Neoprene Knee Supports that come in larger sizes (up to 24-25 inches) that cannot be found in most local stores. Even the catalogs offer the largest size of X-Large. Thankfully, I ordered two knee supports and after wearing them for many hours-walking, sitting at the computer desk, playing fetch with our pup, and standing-I can honestly say these supports didn't bunch up or feel like they were cutting off my circulation and they seem to stabilize my knees better than the other brands of knee supports. After one whole day of wearing both knee supports I am ecstatic to report that they absolutely do not bunch up and feel just as comfortable at the end of the day as they did when I first put them on in the early morning. Already my knees feel so much better during my daily regular routine!An added note: with sleeve type knee supports, it is very important that you measure your knees with a tape measure about 4-inches above the knee for the correct size. If your knees tend to swell, then get the next size larger. If you don't take the time to measure, the supports may be too small causing extreme discomfort and can be dangerous to wear.
