review/text: Excellent value for the money but watch out if you have thick/fat legs at the knee. My leg measures 22 inches circumference just below the knee and I found these socks too painful to wear for more than a couple of hours. I suspect they would be just fine for someone whose below-the-knee measurement was 18-19 inches. Otherwise the socks are well made and quite comfortable. I ended up switching to Jobst socks -- pricy, but good for a big guy to wear all day!
