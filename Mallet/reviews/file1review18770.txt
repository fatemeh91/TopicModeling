review/text: My clippers have always heated up mid-trim, and I used to cool them on ice in a freezer bag. Then I discovered Oster Kool lube which cools them right down much better than the ice bag. But I mistakenly thought that the &#34;lube&#34; in Kool Lube would protect my blades. But no-- they began to get grime in between the tines of the blades, which turned out to be rust. My blades were ruined.Now, I apply the Blade Oil at the end of each session, before storing my clippers. The Blade Oil works great as a lubricant and protectant, and I use the Kool Lube during the clip to cool down the blades. Blade Lube is wonderful oil and everything runs much better now. You can feel the difference from regular mineral oil. This is much finer quality.It is great to have plenty so I am not stingy with it, fearing I will run out like I did with the little tube that came with the clippers. But now that I know Amazon carries it, I won't have to worry about having to find a store who carries it. Man, do I love Amazon!
