review/text: I bought this product maybe five or six months ago and I swear it tasted fine when mixed with milk. I bought another canister recently and now it tastes cardboard-y. Almost like sawdust. Honestly I thought my milk had gone bad, so I tasted the milk separately, tasted fine. What happened :(Update: Tastes OK in chocolate milk.
