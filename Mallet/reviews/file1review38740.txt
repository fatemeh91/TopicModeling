review/text: Product was packed well, however, plastic case for razor was open when received. Simply put, my criticism is harsh for this product, it didn't work at all for me, and my beard and mustache aren't all that thick. New blade on razor was too dull. Don't waste your money on this razor. I also bought a pack of extra razor refills for the handle, and still found the blades too dull and useless. I should have been given the option to give zero stars for this product.
