review/text: I have had this product for about a little more than a month. I hated waxing and this is a perfect alternative. No mess, easy to clean and works really well. I used it on my legs first and barely felt the pain there. Underarms were a whole another story. It was very painful the first time but somehow I managed to get through it. The results were well worth it! They remained smooth for such a long time. I no longer have to worry about next day stubble like shaving. Also, its no longer painful since I keep using it as the hairs show up. Its a great device and I can't imagine being without it now!
