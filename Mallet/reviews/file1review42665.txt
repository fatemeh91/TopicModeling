review/text: Technology Galaxy is a great store and they have great customer service and they do everything they can to make sure you are happy with ur purchase but unfortunately Sony failed them with this item..Sony needs to stick to TV's these are the worse batteries every they run out fast the pre-charge after that they never charge up all the way. i dunno if i got a bad batch or what but i would say stay away from sony rechargeables they suck.Sony Cycle Energy AA Ni-MH Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack)
