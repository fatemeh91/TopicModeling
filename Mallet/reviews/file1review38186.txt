review/text: The bandages worked fairly well but I didn't really find them terrific in the water-block area. I've used other brands of waterproof bandages that I believe resisted water better. They lasted through several hand washings, but later on in the day I had trouble with them staying on. They were good at not sticking together while putting one on. They were also good at going on parts of the body other than the hands.
