review/text: To be honest, you shouldn't use anything else but these deodorant. Just pick your scent. Old Spice has taken their success in lotions to soap and deodorant and have outdone all of their competition. This stuff lasts forever, keeps you dry, and even compliments their soap and lotion products. It's one of two that I'll ever buy because it's really that good.
