review/text: I bought BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son. He likes using it, and the splash guard in the front works. There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat. We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations. Now if I have to reinstall the seat, I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat.
