review/text: I am extremely disappointed. I had ordered a quantity of TWO! 12-Count packages FOR A TOTAL OF 24 CARTRIDIGES and ONLY recieved one 8-count and one 4-count packages for ONLY a TOTAL of 12- cartridges. I would like to receive My remaining order as I had paid for. I paid over $50 for this order. Be careful when ordering with these guys, cause you may not get what you paid for on time. I am awaiting a response and will file a claim against Jerry TF Liquidators if they do not either return half of my money or send me the other half of my order.EDIT/UPDATE: Seller honored his/her part and sent the other half of the order by Priority Mail, with apology. Thank You. Good Deal.
