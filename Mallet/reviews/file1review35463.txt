review/text: I love love LOVE Dishwasher Magic Dishwasher Cleaner. Prior to looking up products to try and get my dishes cleaner I have tried things like the Oxi Clean Booster, Finish Dishwasher Cleaner and Finish Power Up Boosting Action. Dishwasher Magic Dishwasher Cleaner works the best whenever I feel like my dishes are getting "dingy". I use it once every 2 months and it is very inexpensive. Don't be fooled by those higher priced guys this works the best and my dishwasher smells great after each use.
