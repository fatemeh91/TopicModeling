review/text: I'm not a smoker, primarily just a pyro... lol. I always wanted a zippo, and I freaked out one day because I couldn't find any matches to start a fire in my wood stove... so I decided I needed a lighter, and what better than a zippo!A week later, filled it up with zippo fluid and it works like a charm.
