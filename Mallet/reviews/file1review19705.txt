review/text: This is great seta, for us, and my son. I love it because it stays put on the toilet, and eliminates cleaning out a little potty. My son loves it because it fits him and he can use the "big potty" . He has a little potty too, and he most always chooses this instead. I also like that it is small enough to travel with easily (stuff it in your diaper bag and fear not public bathrooms!).
