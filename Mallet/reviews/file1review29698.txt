review/text: I wish that I could give these pads less than 1 star! I bought them because they seemed like such a good deal. A friend had given me the Dr. Brown's washable nursing pads and I loved them and wanted to get more. The packages looked similar and you got two extra pads for less money than the Dr. Brown's. The catch--these pads were much too small! I wear medium-support style nursing bras with stretchy spandex cups so it matters what the pads look like underneath my bra and clothing. These pads made me look too weird so I could not wear them in public. I took back the unopened packages (don't know what to do with the opened one--burn them?) and spent the extra $ on a quality product. Just wanted to give a fair warning to you who are buying them on the internet. Happy nursing!
