review/text: I've been on a low calorie diet and found it difficult to pack in the macronutrients necessary for a healthy, balanced diet while keeping my calorie intake low. Hammer is a great source of complex carbs with no harmful additives. I take it just before my evening cardio workout and I feel terrific. I use this in combination withOptimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standardprotein supplement as a post workout recovery beverage. I also take both soluble and insoluble fiber supplements to supply what Hammer lacks.If you're planning a low calorie diet, please note that none of the supplements I have mentioned are all-inclusive sources of nutrients. Your needs may vary depending on your weight and other factors. Be sure to consume nutritionally dense, whole foods as part of your program and use good judgment. :-)I chose Hammer Gel in Montana Huckleberry. The bottle arrived sealed and fresh. The product was sold by MadAthlete and fulfilled by Amazon. Good stuff.
