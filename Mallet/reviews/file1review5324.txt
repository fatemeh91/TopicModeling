review/text: I won't go on about its attributes, but it was recommended to me that I take it, not just a calcium/magnesium supplement, but exactly this form, not necessarily brand, because of the natural state and balance dolomite is in. I think it helps promote serenity, has a calming effect on me, even helps me sleep. I take it at night along with D3 which is needed to promote absorption of calcium. It's a very fine smooth powder. I like to mix it in milk and it's almost like its not even there. I guess iI'd give it another star if the container weren't almost twice as big as it needs to be.
