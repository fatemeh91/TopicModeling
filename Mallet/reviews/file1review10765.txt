review/text: I have experienced problems with Rayovac Ultra Pro batteries leaking. When I first experienced the problem a couple of years ago, I assumed that it was just a bad battery or a bad batch. I understand that no product or manufacturing process is going to be perfect every time. So, I decided to give Rayovac the benefit of the doubt and I continued to purchase their Ultra Pro batteries for my electronics. Since then, I have continued to see the problem happen. It has now happened more than once with AA, AAA, and D cell batteries. I have never had the problem with their 9V cells or C cells, but I don't use as many either. All of the batteries that failed were well within their expiration period, stored and used properly, and most were purchased at different times. Tonight it was my 3-Cell MagLite - and this is the last straw for me.Rayovac does provide a warranty/guarantee against battery leaks and product damage, but they require the customer to mail the damaged product and the leaking batteries to them. I think it is unreasonable and potentially hazardous to mess around with the corrosive batteries that are leaking in order to package them up for shipping. Warranty or not, with the frequency of failures that I have experienced, I will not be putting Rayovac batteries in any product that I own again.
