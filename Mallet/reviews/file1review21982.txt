review/text: I have been taking these for a few years. I need them as I do not have adrenals and my doctor told me to take unbuffered salt tablets. I use them to help raise my low blood pressure and keep my renin in the proper range.They do end up having a bit of breakage in the large size but the larger size is more economical than the small when you have to take them daily.
