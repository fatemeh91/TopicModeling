review/text: This protein powder was not a disappointment, I enjoyed the fact that it was neutral, not flavored. I recommend this product if you are looking for a protein powder that has high grams of protein, with no after taste and in a neutral flavor. I ordered the small size to try and ready for the larger size. Also use it in your recipes, like cookies, etc. There are great recipes out there with whey protein - go check out! Replace that power bar with one of your own!!!
