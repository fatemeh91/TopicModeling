review/text: Recently bought it...too soft, too big , too smelly and can't return it so better stay away from it.so Journey of this rubber starts from Amazon warehouse to post office to my home to garbage can...God knows where it ends next..There goes my $17....Could have bought plenty of unripped banana for $17 and it comes all sizes and shapes ....;-)
