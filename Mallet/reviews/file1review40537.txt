review/text: I have tried many, and the reality is; if you need calcium/magnesium/citrate and have that chalky constipating style that pills come in. Maybe seems that you are taking a product that is not being absorbed, then this is perfect for you.You can even add it to your cereal and shakes. I love the flavor off a spoon. Don't ship where it freezes and will stay outdoors long enough to freeze as it will break in the bottle. I learned the hard way.
