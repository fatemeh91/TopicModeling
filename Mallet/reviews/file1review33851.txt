review/text: This stethoscope is beautifully made, and looks to be a clone of the Littman Classic II SE. This stethsocope has been independently reviewed at http://www.forusdocs.com/reviews/Acoustic_Stethoscope_Review.htm which rated scopes on the basis of loudness and clarity.Sound clarity on this scope is good but loudness is poor. You will need good hearing to use this stethoscope.
