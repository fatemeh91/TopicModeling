review/text: Love that these are cotton - texture is great and they are actually much softer than they look. We don't actually use these for diapers. I bought them as "temporary burp cloths" while deciding on some others. I now use these exclusively. One thing I love about them is that they wash very well - I don't spray them with any stain remover and they come out clean every time simply using Dreft detergent.We also use them to "catch" my little boys' geyser, as my husband refers to it, during diaper changes. I think these would also be great for household cleaning as well (I'd use separate ones for those). These also make a great light-weight, breathable blanket for blocking the sun - we live in Texas, so this is a huge plus!
