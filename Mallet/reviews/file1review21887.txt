review/text: I agree this product is a little difficult to get on the first few times but after that it is perfect. It stays snug and cold. I bought the other shin ice that wraps around and it doesn't seem to be very cold. This one stays cold longer. All it needs is a couple times of stretching it around your calf and it will fit. I have large calves for a woman and it works great now
