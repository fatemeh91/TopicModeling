review/text: I've never really taken nutritional supplements but last year when I was suffering from a cold, I was introduced to the Wellness Formula and after taking it for two days, I recovered. I thought it was a fluke so the next time I had symptoms of a cold coming on, I bought it and tried it again and it worked. Now, whenever I have symptoms of getting ill, I take it prophylactically and I haven't suffered from a cold yet. I've told others about it and they state the same. I'm not sure what's in this stuff and how it works, but it works.
