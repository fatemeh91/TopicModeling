review/text: Massage has long been known to be able to rejuvenate. Through the simplest touch you can show the hidden powers of your hands. These massage oils are the best I've found. They are silky and sexy and have scents that are quite exotic.These oils are inspired by the ancient Indian guide to lovemaking and the products were developed to help couples create intimacy. They have many great products, but these are the most practical.Each oil in this therapy kit is specifically blended to suit a mood. They are light, non-greasy formulas that have been infused with the pure essential oils of Kama Sutra's exclusive Aromatic Botanicals. They are artfully blended for an enticing fragrance and uniquely powerful effect on mind, body and spirit.This is the perfect kit to take with you on a weekend or to keep next to your bed.
