review/text: This item has certainly saved my daughter's mattress from getting ruined. She is a two year old going through potty training and have had a few accidents along the way. The Priva Ultra Plus has certainly stopped any accidents from going through. I've also washed it a few times and its still in great shape. Happy with this item.
