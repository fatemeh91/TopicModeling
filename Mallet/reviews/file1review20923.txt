review/text: My 12 - 15 year old Braun needed to be replaced, so I tried this one. Very Happy with it, feels great, the cleaner is cool. Some have expressed concern about the cleaner fluid evaporating. I only clean my razor when it needs to be charged (which is a huge jump from never), and I remove the fluid and re-cap it to make it last longer, seems to work.
