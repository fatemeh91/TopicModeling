review/text: When I first used this product 5-6 years ago and after being on it for six months my total cholesterol went from 281 to 220. Back then I bought the 44 serving size from a local health food store and paid about $22-$23/canister, even after taking advantage of their in-store coupon. This time I bought my ProFibe through Amazon.Com/The Vitamin Shoppe the same size container for $13.66. Guess you know where I'm going to be making my future purchases.K.Emerson
