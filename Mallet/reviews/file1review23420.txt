review/text: I was really worried when I ordered this stethoscope. I was concerned that I would be sacrificing function for fashion, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the sound quality was actually better than the Littmann stethoscope that I have been using for years. The heart shaped casing actually works as a sound barrier and muffles outside noise. Definitely would recommend this product.
