review/text: Why is there Soy and Fructose in this? Soy is much less expensive than whey isolate or the like. I was about to purchase this and noticed some of the other reviews. I noticed this product due to the Consumer Reports article. I guess I will be going back to ON whey, but this time the platinum I suppose. Was looking for the safest alternative but also dont want to spend extra money on inexpensive soy product. I read the ingredients list and it says "++contains whey and soy" on the "whey" ingredient. Ok, its one ingredient, how can a single item on an ingredient list be two things? List it seperately so we know what amount is in there. Solgar please respond.
