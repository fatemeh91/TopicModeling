review/text: I had a similar product from Panasonic that had a lot of power and cut really great. It gave out so I purchased this model and I don't like it at all. With new batteries, there is very low speed and the cutters don't do an adequate job in cutting. I am very disappointed in the Groomer. I would recommending that you purchase this groomer locally so you can return it to the store and get your money back or try a different one. Maybe I just got a poor quality product.
