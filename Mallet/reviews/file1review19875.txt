review/text: These are wonderful. They're lightweight, adjustable to fit any shape of toilet seat, and has a pee-guard molded in as part of the seat so there are no parts to fall off and no seams that will catch yucky stuff in. The smooth plastic is a cinch to keep clean and the molded shape is pretty comfortable (certainly not any worse than the regular seats that adults sit on). My daughter would sometimes sit on these for 15-20 minutes at a time and never complained.I especially liked these because the hole is oval instead of round. The extra length of the hole gave my son the clearance necessary to "point down" to pee while sitting to poop. (The round holes are often too short front-to-back to allow this.) The molded shape and built-in pee guard was also good for my daughter. With the raised guard in front and a slightly raised back, positioning herself correctly was very natural, like sitting in a shallow saddle. (With the plain round holes, if you're sitting even just a bit too far forward, pee goes all over the front of the seat (and down the legs) instead of into the toilet.)
