review/text: I am a RN, PALS and BLS Instructor Trainer, PHTLS, Trauma AIMS and EMT instructor. I work as a Hospital Educator. I believe that it is wrong to sell this device to anyone who does not have a Rx from a physician and recieved training to the level of BLS Instructor. The greatest risk with AEDs is to the rescuer. If an individual needs one of these at home, why have they not been fitted with an implantable?This is a very dangerous device when used by the untrained.
