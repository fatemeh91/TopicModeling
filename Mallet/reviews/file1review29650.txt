review/text: I am currently breastfeeding my 4th baby and have breastfed my first three children each for over a year. These Avent washable pads are the BEST I've found. They are very absorbent and waterproof. They stay in place due to the lace cover. They do not show with the nursing bra I use - they just need to be placed high enough in the bra. Other washables I've tried either have no outer waterproof barrier or don't have enough absorbancy and therefore leak. I've just bought more Avent pads because they work so well for me!
