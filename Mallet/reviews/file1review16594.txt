review/text: I must have got a used one because it has hundreds of little scratches all over it. I don't understand.Update: I have recently been informed by representatives of the Zippo corporation that the scratches on my lighter were placed there on purpose. They also offered to send me a custom edition polished brass zippo with a years supply of lighter fluid, wicks and flints if I change my review from three stars to five. I am happy to oblige!
