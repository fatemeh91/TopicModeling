review/text: I started taking this product in hopes that it would help me better control my IBS symptoms. I found it to be extremely helpful, soothing much of my digestive discomfort. I take three pills a day, between meals. I noticed a change within less than a week. I highly recommend trying this product, particularly if you have IBS. The information I read about peppermint oil did indicate that it should NOT be taken if you have heartburn or acid reflux problems as this product may actually worsen those symptoms.
