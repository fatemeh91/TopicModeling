review/text: A few other reviews mentioned that the height fit them, but the waist did not (or the other way around). I was hoping it wouldn't be this way for me since most of the reviews were positive, but it was - height was perfect, but the waist was too tight. Oh well. I was already 7 months along when I began using it, so maybe it would have helped more if I had started using it from earlier in the pregnancy? It aggravated the pain I was trying to alleviate, so I ended up returning it and using a velcro adjustable one.
