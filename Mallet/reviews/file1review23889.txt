review/text: I got some of this for free at a medical fair. I have been taking it as soon as you start to get that "sick" feeling. and it works. I dont know what is in it but It kills the symptoms the day you take it. This will work after you are already sick too but just takes longer for it to work but it cuts the days of your sickness down. And there is no nasty taste. Its like chewing on candy sprinkles. I would stock pile this up if you have kids.Ive been using this for Years now.. It is the best thing to take if you are starting to get sick. I havent been sick in years. You can also get the store brand versions at CVS stores.
