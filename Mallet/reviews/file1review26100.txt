review/text: Not a smoker, I just got them to have something to do with my fingers and teeth and to look like Steve McQueen. It worked, this product made me arguably 10% more awesome. Also, I like the minty, homeo-mediciny natural flavor. Freshens the breath a little. And they're durable, so my coolness last longer than with normal toothpicks.
