review/text: I bought this thinking it was a natural & safe sleep aid. I read that it is supposed to help people suffering from IBS. Desperate times call for desprate measures & my sleep wasn't great, so I figured it was harmeless to try. Since then I have become a tad bit more educated on Melatonin. The main thing a person needs to know is that prolonged use of Melatonin can reduce the bodies ability to create it's own Melatoinin making you dependent on it for sleep. This hardly sounds like a good thing to me. I would like to hope that this is a least a safer alternative to those nasty prescription pills out there and if you truly need a sleep aid, then this might be your best & safest shot.Not Natural:On the Natrol Melatonin bottle in the Supplement Facts it saysMelatonin (synthetic) 5mg.This in combination of the possibility of becoming dependent on it for my precious sleep, has brought me to the decision to immediately stop taking these!On a final note: I didn't find that I slept any better or worse while taking these. You may want to consider buying one small bottle & trying it out first before commiting to a 3 pack here on Amazon if the risks mentioned above are not a concern to you.
