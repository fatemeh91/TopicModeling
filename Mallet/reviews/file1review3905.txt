review/text: I haven't yet bought the strips from Amazon, however, I have used them before. In fact, just a couple of months ago I did the entire 7-day process and within the first two uses (That's one day if you do it day and night) I saw results. There was a little mild sensitivity, usually immediately after use and would disappear throughout the day. Other than that I had no gum pain or anything, nor did it turn my gums white like it warns is possible. I'm someone who brushes my teeth daily and has good dental hygiene, but I'm also a coffee drinker. Over the years my teeth had built up yellow-ish stains and my smile was definitely not very white, though it wasn't terrible. I would usually smile with my lips closed or cover my mouth when I laughed because I wasn't confident of my smile. After using them, I noticed an immediate change in that I smile openly and more often than I have in years. It definitely gave me a confidence that I'm grateful of. The best part is that, even though I was skeptical about the label mentioning that it lasts for up to a year, I haven't used them since those first 7 days and, with daily brushing, my smile is still as bright as it was after day 7. After my year is up, I definitely plan on buying more and using this product again and I more than recommend it.The only downside to it is that I had a strange after taste from the chemicals, but I easily solved this problem by chewing minty-fresh gum daily, which is something I would have done anyways. The taste can last a little longer than the 7 days, but within the next week it was gone.
