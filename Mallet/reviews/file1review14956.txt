review/text: Yes, I agree. These little green (chewable) tablets are a great supplement and Amazon beats all the competition on cost AND delivery! (Subscribe and Save is your best deal.NOTE ADDED on 2-5-12: Unfortunately Subscribe and Save was dropped for this product.) Especially good if you don't get sufficient veggies in your diet. I like the taste of them too.
