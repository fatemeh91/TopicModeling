review/text: I'm not sure why this product has so many bad reviews but it worked really good for us. I had been using 7th Generation powder detergent, ran out and then starting making my own with borax, washing soda and citric acid. The homemade stuff was leaving my dishes very spotty so I started looking an environmentally friendly product. I use the Earth Friendly liquid soap and laundry detergent and have been happy with those so I figured I'd give this one a try. I picked up a bottle at the local store and I've run about 4 or 5 loads through the dishwasher now. I'm happy with the results and will keep using it in the future. It's really hard to find a detergent for the dishwasher that isn't full of chemicals and this one was one of the better I could find. I do rinse my dishes before I put them in the dishwasher but I don't go overboard cleaning them in any way and they come out clean, a few spots on the glasses here or there but for me, I consider that normal. Maybe it works better with different types of water, we live in CT, have well water, a water softener and a second system that balances the Ph. I do use vinegar in the rinse cycle. I would recommend giving it a try.
