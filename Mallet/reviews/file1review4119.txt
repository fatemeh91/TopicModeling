review/text: I was exceptical when i bought this pills cause of the low price. But after taking it before my aerobic training (mostly basketball) i nottice that i had less fatigue(more energy?) and i sweat a lot more than usual.The only down side is, like other reviewer commented, 2 pills are 500mg, not one, so it will run up quick if you take the recommenden dosis(between 1-2gr pre-wo) but for the price and quality, really cant complaint.
