review/text: I was so happy to finally find this product on Amazon. It's a bit hard to find in general and I don't understand why. Of all the floss I've ever tried, this is the best I've found.First you have the little plastic handle, which seems a little wasteful but it sure beats twisting floss around your finger or trying to twist it around some device and have it come loose half way through flossing.But the real reason this is so great is that it has TWO rows of floss. It gets way more nasty plaque out from between my teeth than anything else I've tried. I'm always like "whoa, all that was in my mouth? Gross!" It's pretty amazing how well it works.I highly recommend you try this and see if YOU don't get twice as much plaque out as you did with your old floss, too. (And if you still think your old floss is better, please let me know what it is!)
