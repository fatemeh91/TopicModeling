review/text: buy this item if u experience any difficulty swallowing. it holds enough to keep me satisfied all night. it's easily refilable,& gives me much needed independece (i can roll my weelchair up to my disability sink,& pour water directly into the drink spout) they're pretty durable(i need a new one about every 1.5 years,but i'm not a gentle customer, if it can hang a day with me it's a bit of awesomeness)
