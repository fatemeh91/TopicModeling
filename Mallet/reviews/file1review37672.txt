review/text: I am a woman and have used Mitchum Unscented Solid for over 10 years-recommended by a girl friend. I started having trouble finding it about a year ago. All the choices seem to be the new Smart Solid which is not so smart to me. It's sticky and doesn't go on dry like the Unscented Solid. I don't care about white residue-I've never had a problem with it. I don't want to have to use powder over top of my deodorant and that is what I need to do with the Smart Solid or Gel. I thought they stopped making the Unscented Solid and was not looking forward to finding a replacement-everything seems to be the softer, 'smart' formula now. I thank Mitchum for still offering this product. I don't like scented anything, since I like to choose what I will wear and don't need fragrance under my arms thank you. Worth the price to not have to think about ordor or sweating!
