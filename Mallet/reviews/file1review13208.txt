review/text: I bought these for my mother, who sometimes doesn't get to the bathroom in time at night. She needs a hip and a knee replacement so she can't move that fast or change the sheets by herself. I frequently go out of town so I am not always there to help her, but this product has made both of our lives a lot easier. It is wide enough to span across most of her queen-sized mattress and does a pretty good job of staying in place. It also doesn't rustle like my mom's previous mattress pad did,and it is soft to the touch. It is also manageable enough for her to change it herself. I bought two so she would always have a clean one on hand.It does bunch up a little, but my mom doesn't move around in her sleep a lot so it really isn't much of a problem. But, if someone is an active sleeper, I can see where there would be a problem. Overall, though, this product has given us both a lot of peace of mind and I am so happy that Amazon had it in stock and was able to get it to me quickly.
