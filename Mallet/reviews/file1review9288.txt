review/text: I read reviews of a number of pill organizers and decided on this mainly due to individual, daily pill pods. Before purchasing, I was concerned that since AM and PM compartments don't have individual lids, the AM and PM pills may accidentally get mixed together. So, far this has not been the case. The pills remain in their own compartment in the pod. Like others have stated, if the lid is opened too wide, the pod tips backwards, but this is remedied by leaving the lid at a 90 degree angle. I like that I can leave the day's pill pod on the counter top, while store the rest in the cabinet. I have had no problems opening and closing the pods, but I can see how someone with arthritis may have trouble. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product.
