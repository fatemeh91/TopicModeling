review/text: This could potentially be a very good vitamin however I could not stand the taste! It literally tasted like I popped a regular multi-vitamin pill in my mouth and chewed it up! Add to that the thick green appearance and I simply could not take it! My husband tried to take it because he didn't want to waste the money however he quickly found that no amount of money could get him to take this stuff! STAY AWAY! Buy Centrum Liquid vitamins instead -- still a little gross tasting (but honestly what vitamin isn't?) but at least its palatable and 1/3 of the price!
