review/text: I loaded my dishwasher to maximum load with caked-on, burned, crusted dishes. They had been left for a couple of days because I was out of dishwasher detergent. I was pleased to open up the dishwasher and find that the dishes and pots & pans were all clean and shiny. I didn't notice any orange scent, but everything looked and smelled clean. Finish products never disappoint me, but I put these Powerball tablets to my toughest test, and I'm very pleased with the results. I just ordered more.
