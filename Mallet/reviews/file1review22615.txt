review/text: This product was extremely helpful in achieving my weightloss goal. I had tried everything from fad diets to popping all kinds of pills. I had hit my mid 30's and the weight was sneaking up on me. I wanted to find something natural and safe that I could stick with and this is it! I started with the Ultimate 5 day Cleanse. The Craveless was a part of this 5 day routine and I found it to work almost too well. The Craveless along with the fiber powder fills me up so much that I forgot to eat! I went from being a snackaholic (healthy snacks) to being a meal skipper. I don't recommend skipping meals obviously, but I am not hungry at all. I have lost the weight I wanted to plus some. I will keep taking the Craveless and one teaspoon of the powdered fiber in the morning. I have been running and plan to do a 10 mile here in my hometown next July! I'm very pleased with this stuff!
