review/text: I would expect that this All-in-1 Cascade detergent would work equally well in most all dishwashers but, with the Miele dishwasher, it is imperative that you use only a powder detergent.Do not use liquid or any lemon scented products or you will need the repairman to visit you just after the Miele warranty expires.
