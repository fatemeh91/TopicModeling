review/text: I first ordered the Emjoi Gold Caress, which I found too curved to reach all areas.The Braun clearly does not have this problem, and reaches even incredibly short hairs. It does not seem to have as strong a motor as the Emjoi, but I am not sure that matters, because it does an excellent job.Plus, for the same price, you get a shaver-trimmer, which is necessary for those longer hairs.This one is a keeper, and it comes highly recommnded.
