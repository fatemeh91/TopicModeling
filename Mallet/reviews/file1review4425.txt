review/text: When I first used the Fusion, I thought this was the greatest shave I've ever had. It actually felt like the blades had taken off a layer of skin. Not to the point of pain, but a feeling I've never had before. Clearly the 5 blade system offers something others don't.Then came the realization that the shave went downhill after the 3rd use. The lube strip was virtually gone and I didn't get the great shave I had the first time I used it.3 shaves and I can tell a difference. Are you kidding me? No my beard isn't rough or super thick. But I'm not going to swap blades out every 3 or 5 days just for that great feeling of the 1st and 2nd shave. I've tried all the tricks to keep the blades in good condition and can not keep them sharp past a week.
