review/text: This pen is the best writing tool I've ever used.There is only one problem. I don't know what they use to decorate the pen, but the pen has a layer of decorative swooshes and logos etc that are printed or painted on.This layer flakes off in tiny tiny pieces, leaving your hands covered in what looks like glitter that is a pain in the ass to get remove.
