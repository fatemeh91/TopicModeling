review/text: I was frustrated with my shower tile. I bought so many products from grocery stores and home improvement stores to get the never ending black mole at my shower. Nothing worked! I rent; therefore, I was not investing the money to remodel a shower that did not belong to me. I bought this product and now my shower sparkles! I also use it in my kitchen, on my walls, outside, and the list goes on. It is a great investment.
