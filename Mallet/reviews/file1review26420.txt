review/text: It worked at first, then the switch began to fail. Changing the battery didn't solve the problem. I had it about a month. Now....this thing no longer works. I have no idea why.Maybe water got in while being washed. The top of it kind of separated, so maybe it allowed water to seep in.Why make a product like this that cannot be washed or that isn't at least partially immersable in water?Now, tell me, is it something that I can return to get my money back? I think not.Don't waste your money on it.
