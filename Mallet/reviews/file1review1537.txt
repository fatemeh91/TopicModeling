review/text: I was so worried I've have continuing wart problems, and I was worried that my big plantar wart would leave a large crater in my foot if I was able to destroy it. Neither of those things happened, and I am so grateful for this product because of it.I will tell you what I did, and perhaps it will be helpful. First off, I want to say what I did prior to using this wart stick because (a) I feel pretty sure that home remedies weren't working, and (b) home remedies might have softened my wart up a bit for this wart stick.I got a big plantar wart. It was very painful and I spent about three months hobbling around due to it. During those three months I tried diligently to drown the wart. I soaked it often to no effect. I also put duct tape on it for at least a month (periodically replacing the duct tape). This seemed only to make it angrier. The wart got bigger and grosser. The surrounding tissue got whiter and much more unhealthy looking. The strange thing is that while the wart got bigger, it also seemed to become more superficial. I wonder if it was coming up for air or something. In any case, it used to feel like I had big wedge in my foot, but as it got bigger, it just felt like there was a dime attached to it. I can't tell if this is just because the surface area of the wart got bigger or it really did become shallower.I gave up on this, especially since the wart was getting bigger and it was freaking me out. I bought this wart stick and here's how I applied it. I washed the area thoroughly, and dried it thoroughly, then I got some duct tape and made a hold big enough for the wart. I applied the tape and let the wart stick through. I then daubed a bit of this on the wart and covered the tape and wart with another layer of duct tape. I waited 24 hours and then took off both tapes and repeated the procedure. I did this a total of three days, and I was going to let my tissue rest a bit before attacking again, but this was it. The wart died after that.
