review/text: I have been a personal trainer for 12 years. Trust me, I have tried MANY types and brands of protein powder. Optimum Nutrition brand has the best tasting, highest quality powdered protein - bar none! I will never ask a client to try anything I haven't tried myself, so I can say with great certainty, the flavors are excellent. There is no funny "after taste" when you make this powder into a shake. I usually put a scoop of dry powder in a small shake container. The powder stays fresh in your car, messenger bag or gym locker until you are ready to use it. Try that with a bar!! Just add 16oz. of cold fountain or bottled water at the gym, for an after workout muscle recovery drink. At home, I use skim milk, but the shake tastes just as good with water and a good shaking. Many protein bars and powders cause excessive gas....bad news if you are going out in a public place after your workout! This protein powder is an excellent quality whey and does not cause tooting...really. Can't beat the nutrition for 120 calories. Chocolate mint is a fave. I keep trying other brands as my clients ask about them, but ALWAYS come back to O.N.
