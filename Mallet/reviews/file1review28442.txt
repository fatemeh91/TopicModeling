review/text: The first thing I want to say is that if you're mixing the product with just water and you expect it to taste great, then you are a fool. It's not hot coco, its a protien shake. BE REALISTIC!Personally I mix mine with a scoop of frozen yogurt(usually plain chocolate) and a cup of fat-free milk. I use a blender for about 30-40 seconds and it mixes and tastes great. YES, this does add a little sugar, a little fat and a few calories......get over yourself, its not that big of a deal. If you are really working out enough to be using this product to begin with then the few extra calories are not going to hurt you.My only other comment is that from what I understand the "Double Rich Chocolate" flavor is the only one that does not use splenda or one of the other major artificial sweeteners. I think that's a plus, unless there is something else they are using that I missed.Overall, I think it's a good product and I will continue to use it.
