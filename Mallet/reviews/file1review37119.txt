review/text: I bought this thinking it would be easier to use than a manual flosser, do a better job, or both. Was I disappointed. The floss is too loose to snap between your teeth, you have to constantly press the button to activate the motion (no true on/off switch), and it is too short. You have to have your hand in your mouth to use it on molars. I tried several times thinking I would eventually get the hang of it. Finally I gave up and went back to my manual Reach flosser. It's a much better product for half the price.Reach Access Daily Flosser Family Pack With 14 Refill Heads - 1 Each
