review/text: I bought these tweezers to replace my old Tweezerman Splintertweeze tweezers. They are not the same at all. The tips are not nearly as pointed (too wide to use precisely) or as flush (won't grasp well). I have always sworn by Tweezerman, but it seems like the quality of their products has really been declining lately. Being fairly clumsy I often ruin my tweezers by dropping them, and it seems like each replacement pair I buy is worse than the last. I bought my first Splintertweeze because I was sorely disappointed by a very dull pair of Point tweezers that I bought to replace my old ones, and now this new Splintertweeze is almost as bad as those Point tweezers were! I am sure that somebody who is used to drugstore tweezers would probably find these a nice upgrade, but if you're used to Tweezerman quality, beware. It ain't what it used to be.
