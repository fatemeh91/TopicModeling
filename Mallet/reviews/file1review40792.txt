review/text: I bought this about a month ago. The first shave was great, I didn't cut myself (unlike with a lot of new razors i've used) and it was a close shave. However it seems my hair grows back darker or maybe just faster now. Also I've noticed that not much soap comes from it which I'm not sure is a good/bad thing but it makes me uncomfortable that I can't see the foam and can't tell if it's working or not.I do like that it makes shaving easer in the shower, however I'm thinking of going back to my old razor &amp; shaving cream. Like only use the Schik razor for those in the rush shaving moments and to get a quality shave use the other one.
