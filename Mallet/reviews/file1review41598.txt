review/text: Once again, Braun has produced a fantastic power toothbrush. The excellent results I receive from using it twice a day are proven at every dental appointment. The new Floss Action brush head also feels and looks promising. I know it does not replace flossing, however, it does seem to remove more food particles. I am looking forward to trying the Pro-White brush head. I like the fact that there are different speeds and also the 30 second and two-minute timer.The only disappointment (for me) was the somewhat large storage tower. I am not able to use it since I keep the toothbrush on a "medicine-cabinet-size-shelf" in my vanity. The tower is too large and the door will not close, so I am only able to use the small holder and have to keep the extra brushes in another area.I also found the charger to be of an awkward size and shape. I have a custom configuration in my vanity (DIY) to allow easy plug-in of chargers without having power cords hanging everywhere. I used this frequently with my older Braun toothbrush. However, I cannot use this feature now because of the large odd-shaped charger.Even with the small disappointments noted above, I give this toothbrush five stars!
