review/text: I have a cat who chronically overgrooms. Something will set her off and she increases this problematic behavior. I have been using Rescue Remedy for about one month and it has reduced, but not eliminated the problem. I am seeing regrowth of hair, but there are still patchy spots. She is quite fussy when I try to administer anything, so I put a few drops on Temptation treats twice a day and she eats them up. I've tried the collar and other lotions, so short of RX medication, Rescue Remedy has produced the most positive results.
