review/text: I do not know about this particular product but someone needs to inform SI that charging state sales tax on federal postage rates is illegal. I am curious if the states have been collecting this illegal tax. Yes, I called SI and was told that not only are you charged state sales tax for handling but also for the postage as it says when one checkouts, and since states do not charge sales tax on stamps I am curious where this money has been going all these years.
