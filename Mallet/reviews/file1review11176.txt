review/text: I have purchsed these drops in the past and had to order them again because they really help clear his nose up before bed time and during the day. I use them on 'as needed' basis. My son has been using these drops since he was about 3 years old and I would not stop until I am able to find a better product or he is old enough to use stronger solution to help with the stuffiness.I tried a lot of other products on the market trying to find the best one to help him breathe easy through the night and get a good-night sleep with little success until I found these drops. You cannot find them in the stores, at least I couldn't and I looked just about everywhere.
