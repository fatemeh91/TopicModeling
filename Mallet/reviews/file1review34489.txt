review/text: The negative reviews I've seen here indicate that this supplement is a poor value, because they use 300mg capsules instead of 500mg capsules. Well, I don't think that more is always necessarily better. In fact, I tried another vendors 500mg Krill capsules, and quickly developed an adverse reaction to them (oxygen starvation). These 300mg capsules cause me no such adverse reaction. So that's a huge advantage as far as I'm concerned.Also, I believe that the scientific research that was done in the area of joints used a 300mg dosage, not 500mg.
