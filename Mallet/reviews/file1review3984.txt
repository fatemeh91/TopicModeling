review/text: The comapny claims these cartiriges are brand new in original box. However, my experience shows the following:1. The cartirges arrived in an opened package which had labels, probably from a retail store, removed from its back. It was obvious that this "original box" was previously used2. After using the first blade it felt like I am shaving with sand paper. It was a counterfeit. The top blue layer with soothing gel felt like rubber.3. I went to Target and bought true original blades to compare. The experience with the original blades was smooth and nice shaving.
