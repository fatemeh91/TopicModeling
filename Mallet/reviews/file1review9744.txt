review/text: I use this lock for my 2 swinging gate outside in the yard its been 2 years and I just now need to get them replaces due to cracking before they do and I have nothing to use to keep my little one in side the gates. yes they are hard to open but I love that fact. if they are had for me to open its hard for my child and that means I can do more yard work and less running after a child that has left the yard.
