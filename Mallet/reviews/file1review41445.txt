review/text: This is just an overpriced version of your drug store house brand, in an ampule that is hard to squeeze. If you are older or have a shakey hand, avoid this product, as some of it will land on your cheek, and you will run through it very quickly.It is a POOR selection for the typical senior with a limited budget who has other other health issues. If you got a sample, you need to understand that your Dr. might recommend the brands on hand, the ones where the sales reps gave his/her office free lunch and samples! For this product, Quality probably is fine, but it is definitely "QNS" - quantity not sufficient!
