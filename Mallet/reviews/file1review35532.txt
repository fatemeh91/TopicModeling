review/text: I am always skeptical about "herbal healing products" but for some reason I just love this stuff. I originally found it advertized in The Old Farmers Almanac and bought some just on a lark for nostalgia's sake. I told everyone "sure, it may be snake oil, but I've never seen a rusty snake!" (Actually I stole that line from Terry Pratchett.)Anyway - I pour an ounce into a juice glass each morning and top it up with water and down it, even before I have my coffee, and I swear I can sense this feeling of well-being spreading from my stomach throughout the rest of my body. For me that's good enough - but I also notice I have a lot fewer colds and sore throats than I used to, so maybe there's something to it. Averaging out at a little less than a dollar a day, it's worth it to me!
