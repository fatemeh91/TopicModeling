review/text: This is a very good product. I discovered it in trying to avoid a daily dose of chemicals, and it works just fine. I see from other reviews that some people might be expecting the perfect dryness they got from standard antiperspirants, and you just won't get that here--it IS a deodorant. It is very important to follow the directions for starting use, and in that transition period you might feel uncomfortable. There's nothing that says you can't wash more frequently or augment the Lavillin with corn starch or powder, so try that. Once your body adjusts, you will probably use it about twice a week, maybe three times in the summer. Give it a chance, and I think you'll be happy with it.
