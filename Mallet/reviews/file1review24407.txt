review/text: Out of all the natural sleep products I've tried that are not drugs and do not contain melatonin, this is the best so far. Even supplements with a higher dosage of valerian root did not work as well as Deep Sleep. (Valerian on its own still works, though.) From what I've read, in many cases a blend of sedative and calming herbs work better than a single herbal extract. This may explain why this product is so effective with me. (The same is true for the old formula of the Bob Marley Mellow Mood drinks.) Sometimes a single capsule is enough, 30 - 60 minutes before bed, and sometimes I need to take an extra one after the first capsule brings me to a calmer level. As always, if your house contains too many stimulants, the effect can easily wear off or not occur in the first place: Keep the lights down, don't have the television on, others in the house shouldn't be too loud, avoid sugary snacks and food, don't talk on the phone, et al.Either way, Deep Sleep doesn't have the side-effects of pharmaceutical drugs, and it does not have the risks and dependence associated with high doses of melatonin. If you take too much melatonin over a long period of time, your body may produce less of it in response, thus starting a dependence that you need to wean off of. Another downside of melatonin is that high doses (3 to 5 mg) can cause nightmares. This is also true for valerian with some people. If you are prone to getting nightmares from valerian supplements, then this product might have the same effect.In short, this is safer than drugs, safer than long-term melatonin use, and is quite effective!
