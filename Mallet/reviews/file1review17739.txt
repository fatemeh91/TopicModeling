review/text: My husband seems to have enjoyed this product while it lasted, but it didn't last very long. Not sure whether we'll buy another or upgrade to a more sturdy product. He's used it pretty heavily for about 8 months.UPDATE: My husband tells me he dropped it, which explains why it broke after only 8 months. But he also said that he didn't find the battery charge very good.
