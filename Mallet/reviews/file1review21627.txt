review/text: The Snug-Tub is great because you don't have to fill up the bath tub. My 7 month old loves it. The only concern I have is that she is very active in the tub and the bottom is quite slippery. I must have my hand on her at all times. So what we do now is I place the bath seat in the Snug Tub and let her play. When she is all done I take the seat out and rinse her off in the Snug Tub.
