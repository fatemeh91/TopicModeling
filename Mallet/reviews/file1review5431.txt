review/text: The nozzle is terrible because if you hold the bottle at even a little bit of an angle, such as when spraying into a sink or toilet, it will not work...it just drips out of the nozzle down the side of the bottle. Just to use it up, because I hated the nozzle, I tried pouring it straight onto a stain in the tub and that didn't work either. But I think the bad nozzle design is what did it for me, because maybe it would have worked on other stains - if it would have had a decent nozzle that would have worked while the bottle was tilted while I was trying to clean my bathroom! Save yourself some time, aggravation, and money and buy something else, like Tilex, Clorox Clean-Up, or Comet Spray Gel Mildew Remover.
