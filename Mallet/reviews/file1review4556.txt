review/text: I have been using the Gillette Fusion Manual Razor for years and have never been disappointed. It has consistently given me a closer, smoother shave than any other razors with no nicks or cuts. My wife uses Gillette Fusion as well citing the fact that it is better than any razors marketed for women.FYI from the manufacturer-Gillette Fusion Manual Razors offers:*5-Blade Shaving Surface Technology with 5 PowerGlide Blades spaced closer together to help reduce pressure - with more comfort and less irritation than MACH 3*Precision Trimmer on the back of the razor for those tricky spots like sideburns, under the nose and around facial hair*Flexible Comfort Guard for a comfortably close shave*Enhanced Indicator Lubricating Strip gradually fades to white when you are no longer getting your optimal shave, so you always know when to change the bladesIndications: Cartridges sold separately
