review/text: I've been using this product for over a year now and still enjoy the great feeling this balm gives my face after shaving. It feels so good when it's applied, no burning or bad smells. After five minutes I apply Suave UV Protective face lotion($2.50) and I'm ready to go. My face never dries out or flakes, yet it never feels greasy. Try both products and you'll thank me.
