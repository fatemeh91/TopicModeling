review/text: I was getting badly bitten by something in my home and I suspected fleas from my cat. I tried a number of spray products but I hated breathing the stuff and it seemed like the spray went all over the bathroom. These herbal wipes worked perfectly and stopped the bites completely. They are not greasy, and I don't feel like I am breathing the stuff. One added bonus - the wipes seem to stop the itching of existing bites. I recommend this.
