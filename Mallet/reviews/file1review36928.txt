review/text: This product actually worked and was a pleasure to use. It immediately lubricated my dry eyes and didn't burn or sting like some other products I've tried. I was able to wear my soft contact lenses comfortably thanks to this product. I'll definitely purchase it in the future and will recommend it to friends and family.
