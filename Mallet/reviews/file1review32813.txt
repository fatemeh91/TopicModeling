review/text: I am his wife and I am the one who bought Slim Fast. I used this product years ago and lost 25 lbs on it. I started using it again Dec. 25th and I have lost 5 lbs. so far. I have a shake for breakfast and a Slim Fast bar for lunch and normal supper. I love the way Slim Fast tastes. I put ice in the blender and make a milk shake out of it. It fills me up for at least 4 hours or more. I actually look forward to it in the morning. This is a good product and I recommend it highly....
