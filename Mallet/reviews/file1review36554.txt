review/text: My Irish Wolfhound has chronic ear issues and a friend recommended something called the Blue Power Ear Solution. Gentian Violet is one of the ingredients and very hard to find so I was happy to find it here on Amazon.The Blue Power Ear solution worked on the dog! However, a HUGE CAUTION--when you put liquid in a dogs ear they like to shake it out. Gentian Violet STAINS and STAINS badly. Once it is on your clothes you probably can write them off. If you are treating your dog, it is a really good idea to use the stuff outside and wearing old clothes.PLEASE NOTE: Before using the Blue Power Ear solution on your dog PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make sure a vet has checked the dog's ears to make sure there isn't a perforation!
