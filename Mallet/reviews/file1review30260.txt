review/text: We were a little hesitant to buying a corded hand vacuum, since it is so convenient to use one with a rechargeable battery. However, we have been very happy with the B & D corded model. It's more powerful than a battery one, it's very convenient to use and, with the attachments, is very useful. We saw some reviews that this model was a bit noisy, but it is nothing serious. The noise is probably due to the strength/size of its motor. We are very happy with this and would recommend this to a friend and we would buy another.
