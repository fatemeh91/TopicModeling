review/text: I am very happy with my purchase. the delivery was timely and the package was completely undamaged. the tweezers work GREAT and i dont think they're to small. I am able to handle and grip them very well. Also the tweezers come with a plastic tube to store them in. I guess it's just in case you drop them? they wont misalign? Anyways im very happy. No cons :D
