review/text: I've owned several pairs of the original green Spenco insoles (Running/Walking), and have loved them. I run several times per week to train for my job and they have improved the cushioning of the already comfortable Asics Gel-Nimbus 11's. However, these new gel models are terrible for running. They offer barely more cushioning than the stock insoles on a normal basis such as standing or walking, but when you begin running they just squish into nothing. Even for standing around I still would buy the green ones.
