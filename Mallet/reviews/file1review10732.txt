review/text: i really lke this for lots of pills.. if you are only taking 2 or 3 per day.. there are many cheaper and with less tall walls which make it easier to get a pill out.. but for someone taking 5 to 10 pills a day, this is great..lots of space even when the day is divided for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime.. built very sturdy.. the clasps stay closed unlike the cheaper models. each day is colorful and the plastic only fits in base properly..if i were taking a few day holders on a trip, i would enclose in a clear baggie or clipped storage bag so not to lose one of the days when out on a table or going through baggage claim
