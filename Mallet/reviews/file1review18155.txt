review/text: This is a great mask, the velcro strap is thick enough to hold the mask on all day ( I work nights) but not bulky. I move alot in my sleep and roll side to side, in the week I have had this mask it has not come off once. There is a tiny amount of light seepage around the nose, but adjusts fairly easy for complete blockage and the tiny bit does not disturb me. The eye "pockets" are great because I can blink without my eyes touching the mask and it does not feel confining to me. I hope the mask continues to be this great for a long time!
