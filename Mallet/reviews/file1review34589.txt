review/text: I had read in a health news letter that beet juice is helpful in lowering blood pressure. Since beet juice is only available in health food stores and is kinda expensive, I ordered this beet root supplement. It appears to be helping to lower my blood pressure, since I started taking this supplement my doctor reduced my prescription medicine. In addition to taking this supplement, I have lost 10 pounds so one or the other or both helped reduce the BP.
