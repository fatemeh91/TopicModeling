review/text: Please note this is for the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor.This powder is well worth it, at the time of this writing it's $53 for a 5 pound tub of it. That is an absolute amazing price for what you're getting. It's about the same amount, per ounce, as the Six Star/Body Fortress(Wal-mart) powder I used to get.The flavor I have is a bit average. This is both a good and bad thing, with one scoop per 8 fl oz of milk it has a very mild milk chocolate taste, it's not overpowering nor is it underwhelming. It's an average taste with very little after taste.I have yet to try it in water though, as I've never liked protein powder like that.It mixes extremely well with my Blender Bottle, within 5-10 seconds it was completely mixed and I had zero chunks leftover. I would have to highly recommend this powder.(And if you have the extra money, the Blender Bottle is a good pair with this.)One last note, be aware of the ingredients, there are artificial sweeteners in it. If you do not like this, I would recommend getting the natural whey from ON which is sweetened with a form of Stevia.
