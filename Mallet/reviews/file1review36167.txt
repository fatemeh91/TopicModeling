review/text: I used to get horrible rashes up both my arms from profesional dishwashing. After trying all manner of creams and lotions and going to 2 dermatologists, a pharmacist mentioned acid mantle cream. I used it, my rashes cleared up, and I was very happy. Now my son has started his restaurant "career" as a dishwasher and his arms are starting to break out, so I'm getting a large jar for him. This stuff is a miracle if you have dermatitis as a result from continual contact with cleaning products.
