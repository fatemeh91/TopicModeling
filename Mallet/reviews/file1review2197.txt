review/text: I love this Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar!! I keep it in it's original bag in the freezer, and it helps immensely with my neck, and I can lay down in it if I need to!! It doesn't 'choke' me, I don't feel like I'm stuffed into a tube, it's comfy, flexible and I've never heated it because heat is not good for my nerve damage, but from what I've read, it's great heated too! I'm getting another one for back up when my stenosis flares up. I'm getting the ones for the feet and the lumbar area as well...I cannot wait to get them!!!!
