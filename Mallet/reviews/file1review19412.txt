review/text: I am sure it repells all creatures it should repell, but unfortunately, it repells people as well. The whole family could hear the high pitch tone, which you can tolerate for only a few seconds. Unfortunately for us, this investment was a total loss. I purchased other similar Lentek product and it does not have this problem and seems to be working. Purchased through As Seen on TV, unfortunately contacted them after return period was over and they did not have any replacement products on stock. Nevertheless, they were kind to reimburse me for about half of my cost, which was a nice gesture, as the product malfunction was not their fault.
