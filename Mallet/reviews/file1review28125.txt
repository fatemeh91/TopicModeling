review/text: I have been using Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard for about 11 years as a meal replacement first thing in the morning. I especially love the Double Rich Chocolate and add frozen blueberries or strawberries in the blender. It is like having a treat that is so good for you! I have recommended it to all of my family and friends because it is good for them and the taste is wonderful. I love the fact that I am now on autoship and I don't have to worry about re-orders.
