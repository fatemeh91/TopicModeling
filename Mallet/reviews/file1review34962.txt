review/text: My daughter has been on liquid iron supplements since she was 13 months. It has been a major struggle to get her to take the liquid. As soon as she turned 20 months and her pediatrician OK'd a chewable vitamin I purchased these and crossed my fingers. It has been 3 weeks and she still will take her one a day with lunch.
