review/text: It does work, if you don't move it. The recharge last a while, it does turn on and run well. Only issues I have are that it is used to sanitize my autistic daughters oral stimulating tool, on the go. The slightest bump and it pops open and starts the cyce over. The rubber toothbrush holding piece isn't really holding well with movement. During travel may have to take out the rechargable batteries so it isn't starting and stopping with every bump in your baggage.
