review/text: Got these when my newborn began developing a pretty nasty diaper rash, despite frequent changes and use of ointments. Figured the rash was due to premoistened baby wipes. Started using these along with chamomile tea as a wash, and the rash disappeared in less then 24 hours. These things are great. They are soft and also hold up well. Definitely worth it if ur little one has a sensitive tush.
