review/text: I purchased this to calm down my 4 female cat household. The oldest never liked any other cat while the youngest was picked on by all. The 2 remaining were constantly fighting for the dominant role which resulted in one spraying her territory while the other combated her sprays by leaving both puddles and droppings by her sprays. I tried both rubbing this on all of their fur in addition to adding to their daily water but I really did not see any difference at all. I was sad because I was really hopeful that this would help my girls get along, but it didn't. What ended up working for me was to use a diffuser that sprays friendly pheromones into the air.
