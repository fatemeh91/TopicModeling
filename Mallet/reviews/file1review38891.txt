review/text: Daisy Plus Razors were shaped to shave curved areas and did a nice job. However, I didn't notice any difference between the Daisy razors and other brands, as they all seem to have adopted this shape for women now. I didn't think it gave me as close of a shave as the razors that I normally buy, at a similar price.
