review/text: My boyfriend and I have used this product for anal and vaginal and it is excellent for both. Really smooth action, goes on and stays in place (doesn't run all over) and easy to apply. Also works nice for toys (I have tried it on glass, plastic and rubber with no problems) and works well with latex condoms.The only drawbacks that are significant are taste (pretty bitter but not terrible) and the drying out time. When it starts to dry out it feels tacky. If you are using it for anal or vaginal, I would say it is good to go for at least a half hour without needing to be re-wetted or reapplied. However, if you are using it in the open air, it dries out much faster, say 5 to 10 minutes. It is easily fixed with a few drops of water but, annoying if you aren't used to a water-based lube. Also, I once got this in a small open cut and it burned and stung! So if you have sensitive skin, that might be a deal-breaker for you.One of the biggest pluses is the clean up! Comes off really nicely with soap and water without feeling oily or slick after you are done or leaving residue on toys. Also have used a damp warm washcloth and that also works well for clean up. Other things I like about it include the viscosity which is pretty thick compared to KY or Astroglide, and the pump is very nice for getting more product, rather than fumbling with a cap if your hands are already slick. I also really like the feel of the product when it is in use: makes things ease in and slide nicely, but still retains some friction, which feels GREAT!4 and 1/2 stars to 5 stars! All in all, a great product and I will most definitely buy more when I run out!
