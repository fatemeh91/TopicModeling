review/text: I bought this about half way through my third pregnancy. I have a history of back problems and have had one spinal surgery. Almost instantly, it took pressure off my lower back. Additionally I find that when I wear it, I make fewer trips to the bathroom....I assume that is because it helps lift the weight off my bladder.The only negative, is that it is difficult to hide under clothing. Not a big problem for me, as I am home most of the time and wear it then. I don't often keep it on when going outside the house.Definitely worth a try if you are suffering with low back pain.
