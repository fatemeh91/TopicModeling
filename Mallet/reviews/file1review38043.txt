review/text: There is no question that AEDs work great and save lives. If you have the means, I highly suggest picking one up.Something to consider though, is that $1500 would buy you a pretty nice treadmill, a lot of months at a health club, or many boxes of nicotine patches to quit smoking. You will be better served in the long run if you invest your time in PREVENTING cardiac arrest in the first place by cutting your risk factors.. exercise and smoking are two of the biggest.For those with confirmed history of cardiac problems, this may be a good purchase. Other people may want to consider some of these other suggestions. Don't take my word though, talk to your own physician before you make an investment like this.
