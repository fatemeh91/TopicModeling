review/text: These insoles seemed like a great idea to me. However, they didn't work in any of my shoes. Raised my foot up too high out of shoes and were just not comfortable. You need to take the entire inside of your own shoe out to try to fit this in. Today's shoes come with so many nice insoles that putting these in just defeated the purpose.
