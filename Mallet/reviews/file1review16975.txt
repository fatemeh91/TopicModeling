review/text: I bought this item after the charger on my Philips Norelco T765 got toasted.The trim is quick and painless - powerful motor, effective blades. Construction quality is a notch above that of my old Philips Norelco T765. The wheel-adjusted height is a nice feature and very convenient. The blades come pre-lubed and seem of good quality. The head is relatively easy to clean. However, some product descriptions seem to imply that it is rinsable - which is absolutely not the case. So don't get fooled (like I did).Otherwise a good product that does the job well, and at a low price point. What else do we need?
