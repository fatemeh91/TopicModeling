review/text: This unit is helpful in that it does not need a conventional toilet seat and that it installs by slipping under the seat mounts rather then with new bolts. But there are several issues.While it sounds great that it slips under the mounts, you still have to retain the seat and cover. Doing so means that you cannot lower the cover or raise the "seat". A work around to the unusual situation of having the cover and old seat in place would be to acquire additional bolts and nut to retain just this product.Another bigger issue is that it turns an elongated toilet into a smaller then normal round toilet. My 145lb mother fits on it fine, but as a 240lb male, I can't use this seat in her apartment.Previously I had tried a 4" extension type unit that worked perfectly with the normal seat and cover allowing both to be utilized, but it was too high for her. I now need to look for a 2" version of that style. Note that this item is non-returnable.I do not recommend purchasing this item at all.
