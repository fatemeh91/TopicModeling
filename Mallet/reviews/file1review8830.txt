review/text: I bought Green Vibrence from you because I thought I was saving money. So you people jack up the price, and try to get me to buy more. If you offer It to me again, at lest lower the price. I would think about buying more. I spent over $800.00 in less than a year on the stuff, and you think Im going to buy more, for more money? I bought that much so I dont have to hassel with buying it often. My cabenet is full.
