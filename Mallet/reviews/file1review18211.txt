review/text: I wore my Bucky 40 Blinks Mask for the very 1st time last night (I got it in the Dahlia pattern...very cute might I add!). Love it! It is sooo light. Can't even notice it's there! Extremely comfortable and definitely stays put! I sleep on my side mostly and had no trouble with it moving at all! I had no problem with the velcro closure and don't think it's too thick or bulky at all. There is a small gappage at the nose...very small, where it does let some light in. However, the gape is extremely small and I didn't find it to be a problem. Great buy & very glad I purchased this! I read all the reviews here on Amazon before I made this purchase,
