review/text: I found the Adventure Medical Kit to be one of the lightest, most compact kits on the market. The weight and size being saved by replacing the standard tin with a water-tight sealing pouch.While the tin is gone everything else is pretty much still there. Duct tape, a very good whistle, cordage, etc. The only thing lacking was a light source and small $2.50 led light was easily added to the kit.The only concern I might have with the kit is whether the water-tight seal would hold, it seemed somewhat fragile and only time would tell. The kit is a easy way to have a back up. I say back up, because you shouldn't rely on these kits over having standard equipment, they should be for emergencies and should be practiced with.
