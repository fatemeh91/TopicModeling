review/text: After years of trying numerous other brands, I found this lip product and fell madly in love. First, it tingles because it contains peppermint so it makes your lips feel alive and luscious. Then, it has beeswax and coconut oil to protect you from the elements.Burt's Beeswax Lip Balm contains soothing and refreshing ingredients, such as beeswax, coconut oil, sunflower oil, tocopheryl acetate & tocopherol (vitamin E), lanolin, peppermint oil, comfrey root extract, and rosemary extract.There are many other uses for this product. You can also use it on dry skin that needs extra attention. It also seems to work as a healing balm.I have one tube in every main room of my house. One hidden in a kitchen drawer, one in my desk, two in my purse, etc. My husband has two that he stole from me! I also buy this product for him because he finds that it works just as well for his lips.~The Rebecca Review
