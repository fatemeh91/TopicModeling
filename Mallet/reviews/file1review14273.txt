review/text: I purchases the Scrubbing Bubbles Automatic Shower Cleaner for my teenager's shower...you know why! When I first installed it, I pushed the button at least 17 times and nothing happened. So I called their customer service line.They were very nice and encouraged me to keep pushing as they sometimes take a long time to "prime" themselves. Now it works fine. We have had it about 4 months. My job of cleaning is much easier and my daughter likes to use it as all it takes is the push of a button. This was definitely worth the price!!!
