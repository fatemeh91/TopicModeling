review/text: I have only been using for a few days, so I can't comment on their effectiveness. I am using the Tablets. They smell and taste so bad I am considering pitching them in the trash and ordering the Capsules. If you dump them from the bottle to your hand, your hand smells so bad, you have to wash immediately. Now when I take them, I dump them into the cap and avoid touching them. It is hard to describe what they taste like since I have never had anything like them. I guess I would say they taste like rancid garlic; very strong. I can't imagine that a child would take these without throwing a fit.
