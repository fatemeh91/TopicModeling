review/text: I've used this protein for years and just ran out of it. Since I have moved across the country and haven't had time to go look for a GNC/gym that may carry it so I went with Amazon. When it arrived, the first thing that raised a red flag was that the container did not have an expiration date on it... Second, when I took the top of, the protective seal was completely different than the one I've always seen in the past, third, when I actually looked inside, the smell and texture were both nothing like what I have seen. Last, and definitely not least, I thought I'd give it a try anyway and mixed it up after my work out. BAD idea. It tasted HORRIBLE and I was worried that it may not have been protein powder at all. When I called customer service, they acted surprised and said that they purchase these straight from the source/company. hahaha what a joke. Thankfully they are letting me return it, no hassle, but honestly, I think they were hoping that a new customer was buying this in hopes that they could get away with filling it with who knows what. I will never buy ANYTHING from this company again.
