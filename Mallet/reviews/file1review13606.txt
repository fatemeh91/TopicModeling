review/text: The gaps between my teeth are VERY tight. When I use conventional floss I only manage to get through a couple of gaps before my teeth cause the floss to fray and break (usually leaving floss fibers wedged between my teeth). Most power flossers on the market are expensive but the Humming Bird Power Flosser is very economical. The vibrating effect enhances the cleaning performance and helps the floss glide between my teeth without breaking. The angle of the head allows me to comfortably reach ALL my teeth ~ even those in back. The affordable price tag + the superior performance + the comfort = (here's the good part) I'm now able to floss regularly. I bought mine in a store years ago but when I found refill floss heads at Amazon (also inexpensive) I also found the flosser starter kit listed and my wife wanted one of her own.
