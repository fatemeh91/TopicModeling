review/text: Its a nice moisturizing and stress relieving lotion. Soothing and sets my skin at ease. Works throughout the day. I use it daily after showers. Its smooth and doesnt have that oily feeling. When it gets to the end I break open the bottle so I can get to the lotion all the way at the bottom its so good I love it.
