review/text: I bought the TARGET brand. This is my first day and I did notice a difference - a little whiter.. But omg.. it hurt. I never thought I had sensitive gums.. but OUCH OUCH! And I barely made it through the time needed!! And my mouth is still tingling.. not to mention my tongue hurts... so I think I will do it once a day at the most. BTW.. I have been through childbirth and have a high tolerance to pain.. but... this was just REALLY uncomfortable.
