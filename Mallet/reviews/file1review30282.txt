review/text: Mainly got this to help me after I swept my hardwood floors. The dustpan just can't get all the stuff off the floor and having a little vac to do the pickup work is what I needed. After reading the reviews of the various cordless types, and not being impressed, I went for the corded. It really has crazy suction power on the main unit, HOWEVER, the hard plastic edges were not going to be good for my new hardwood floors. So, rather than hassle returning the thing, my husband took some self-stick felt padding, cut a couple of thin strips and stuck it on the top edge of the intake opening. It can still accomodate the little hose attachment, but now it won't scratch my floors. I know there are other brands/models that have rubber on the edges, and had I paid more attention, I would have gotten one of those. But I think this will do the job.
