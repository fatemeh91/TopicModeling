review/text: These batteries last as long as the name brands. We use these in pager, book lights, and a few different types of medical diagnostic equipment, without any problems.Consumer reports did a study on alkaline batteries and found them all to be pretty much the same, no matter where they were made, or how much they cost.So save your self some money.
