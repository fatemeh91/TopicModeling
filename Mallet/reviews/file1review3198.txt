review/text: I absolutely love these things. Condoms have always let me know they were there during the begining, the middle, and the end. Crowns are the only exception to that rule. Once in place, I have to constantly check to make sure that I'm still wearing a Crown. My Princess loves them as much as I do because I dont loose sensation and therefore my performances are that much better for it.
