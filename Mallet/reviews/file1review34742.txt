review/text: Like other Aubrey products, read the ingredient list. They're edible.This deodorant will last for a time period that makes its cost per use on par with commercial deodorants. The ingredient costs on those products are nill, the $ goes into marketing.The deleterious effects of aluminum, present in other products, are medically verifiable, no need to re-hash.This product has worked wonders for me, with pleasing herbal aromas, easy application.
