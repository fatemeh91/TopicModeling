review/text: I have bought two big 5lb bottles of this protein shake: a double chocolate and the cookies n' cream flavors. The double chocolate tasted great, while the cookies n' cream was a big disappointment. Even though the cookies n' cream doesn't taste that great, I can still drink it, but it taste nothing like cookies n' cream.I only drink this immediately after my workout. I only take one scoop and put it into my cup shaker. I give it a shake and I down it within a minute. I found that taking one scoop, rather than the serving size of two, will make this bottle last a good 4 months. If you don't mind dropping $50 every two months on a protein shake bottle, then take the serving size. If you feel like 25gm of protein right after a work is sufficient for you, then 1 full scoop should work fine.
