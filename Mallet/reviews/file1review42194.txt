review/text: I was very excited at the prospect of trying this product, based on the advertising for it. I have tried just about everything on the market with little or no success for the itching I haveassociated with the shingles virus. Unfortunately, this product did absolutely nothing to relieveitching. At $20.00 a bottle, it was a great disappointment!!!
