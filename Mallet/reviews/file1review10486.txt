review/text: As a person whose oral hygiene was greatly improved by this product (much healthier gums and cleaner teeth), I have to give Sonicare credit for designing an effective product. I would have given it five stars, except for the insulting price.As a professional engineer, I consider the whole $14 per brush-head a slap in the face. I see no reason these brush heads couldn't have been designed as simple screw-on plastic heads that would have cost pennies to make, except that Philips could never have charged $14 per replacement for small, simple pieces of plastic.Congratulations Philips/Sonicare, you've succeeded in fattening your wallets at additional, unnecessary cost to the consumer and to the environment. You've successfully copied the inkjet printer industry's business model. /golfclapUpdate: it looks like the new Sonicare ProResults brush heads have a much better, eco-friendly design. Too bad they are still quite pricey, though $8 per head is a big improvement.
