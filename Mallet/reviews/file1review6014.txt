review/text: I had purchased another brand for less, and had inaccurate readings, a cuff that wouldn't deflate. In general, dumpster filler. My dad has an older model Omron, so this time I ordered wisely! Very happy with the way it works, I like that you can average last 2 or 3 readings over 10 minute period. (Some people claim that pressure will be differant on left or right arm) At first I thought readings were low, turns out I was just relaxed. Quite a differance when I took bp while watching sporting events!
