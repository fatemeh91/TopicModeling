review/text: This item is pretty good, wish it would last a little longer only because when I wear it ice-wise I have to use my floor heater at work which tends to make it not last as long but it does do the trick and it helps me. That's really what I use it for, heat-wise, it's good, but I really use it for ice, and I really should have two, one for work and one for home for when I forget, but I would recommend this product
