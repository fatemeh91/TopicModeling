review/text: I have used this product for years to help minimize joint pains from chronic osteoarthritis. While it doesn't elimiante the pain, it certainly aids in removing some of the discomfort. For maximum benefit our herbalist recommends 6 tablets per day, 3 with breakfast, 3 with dinner. Amazon sells it in a the large quantity (180 tablets) which is difficult to find in local supplement stores. In addition there is a price break with the larger size through Amazon.
