review/text: I have been suffering from acid reflux for a couple of years. I was put on Nexium, then later Prilosec. I've read that these drugs are only supposed to be taken short term. And the last attack I had which kept me up most of the night(like I was on fire)was when I was taking Prilosec. So I had to find another way. I researched orange peel oil and the benefits of it for my condition. After taking Heartburn Free for a few days, I felt like I was almost feeling normal (without drugs). It's been about three weeks now and I feel great. At first I had to take one every day (as opposed to the recommendation of every other day). I don't even have the "swallowing wash" that some people get from the body automatically swallowing to protect the esophogus from acid. Somehow this orange peel oil prevents the acid from coming up into the esophogus. I only wish physicians would look outside the box and away from drugs. During the initial period I also took Lily of the Desert aloe which helped the soreness in my chest.(half aloe, half water). I hope this will help others who have suffered.
