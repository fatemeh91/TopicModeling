review/text: I smell lots of products and this is "the" best lavender sheet spray. I spray it on all sorts of fabric surfaces in my home - and recently had friend stop by and as she entered & crossed the threshold her immediate comment was "It smells GOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDD in here!". Really, this is best Lavender spray product I've encountered and I buy it repeatedly as I use it frequently. It does not have that "fake" scent to it that many others do. It's PERFECT and pure lavender smelling. Just the right amount of potency also. Not overpowering but not wimpy and "gone in 60 seconds" either. Just perfect.
