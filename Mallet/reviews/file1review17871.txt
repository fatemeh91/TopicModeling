review/text: What a great antiperspirant! Finally, a product that doesn't cause irritation, burning, itching or rashes. I love it: it goes on smoothly, lasts all day, doesn't stain your clothing. I've tried the other Almay formulations such as the roll-on and gel and they're very effective as well. If you've had problems in the past or present with allergic reactions, this is a product to try! Highly recommend!
