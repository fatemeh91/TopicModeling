review/text: I'm borderline anemic and these vitamins help me to control that. I try to take these daily but either schedule or early alzheimer's gets in the way. ;) When I take them, there is definitely a noticeable difference in my mood, appetite and digestion. If, for some reason, I forget to take these before/during my period, I get very weak. Everyone has problems taking vitamins consistently. I can definitely say that when I take these, I'm a much better person.Update 09/01/11:I noticed that I would frequently get migraines after I took these vitamins. I stopped taking them for a month and although I felt some anemic weakness, the migraines did stop. I switched to a different brand and so far, so good. In addition, these vitamins get moldy at the slightest tinge of humidity, which is difficult to control.
