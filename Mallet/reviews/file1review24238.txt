review/text: I purchased these at a retail store as a last ditch effort to seek relief from horrible heel pain I was having, later diagnosed as plantar fascitis. After the initial break in period, these supportive orthotics are my only source of relief from the pain that may take up to 1 year to resolve.These orthotics provide optimal arch support, not the cushy comfort of the traditional shoe inserts on the market. They are for those who truly need the support of an orthotic, as they may be tough to break in for those looking only for comfort. I recommend them to those suffering with foot pain or to active individuals looking to appropriately offload pressure.
