review/text: I bought these a couple weeks ago since my beloved Dr. Brown's washable pads are no longer offered. These seemed like they might be similar in size, comfort, and affordability. No so much. These pads are only about 4 inches in diameter, so the edges are pretty obvious unless I wear a padded-style bra (I'm about a 34C). They stick, which can make them a bit uncomfortable when removing them to feed the baby or pump. After the first wash, the flannel on the inside pilled-up, and the pads puffed-up, making them even more obvious in my bra. Since I don't leak much, I can't give much info on how absorbent they are. Suffice it to say that I'm glad that I didn't pay a lot...I suppose you get what you pay for (though I don't recall paying much more than about $8 for Dr. Browns).
