review/text: I love this product! It was recommended to me by my personal vegan trainer. She loves it! She doesn't put anything in her body unless it's organic! I was diagnosed with bladder cancer on August 8th. I changed my entire program and went from eating meat to totally vegan and only drinking green drinks. I have been using this product and making smoothies with it for 2 months and I have lost 30 pounds! On Sept 24th after a biopsy was taken I found out that I am cancer free! Thanks be to God!!! :)Some of you might find the taste not as good as others. If that is the case, try my favorite recipes that will most certainly turn heads at your next party or event.In a blender:1 scoop of Green Vibrance, 1 batch of Organic Kale, 1 dash of Stevia, 1 dash of Sea Salt, 2 Organic Lemons (peeled), 2 Organic Green Apples, 1 thumb size chunk of Ginger root (peeled), slight dash of Cayenne Pepper, Mountain Spring Water or best Aqua Hydrate 9pH water, blend - serves 6. Absolutely delicious! You will thank me later. :)Breakfast recipe:1 scoop of Green Vibrance, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Flax Milk, 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Coconut Milk, 1 baby Coconut water & meat (Use hatchet to get the coconut open), 1/2 cup of Unsweetened Almond Milk, 1 Chunk of Aloe Vera Leaf, 3 Tablespoons of: Cinnamon & Pumpkin Spice, 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper, 2 tablespoons of Chia Seeds, dash of Sea Salt & Stevia and 1 cup of Mountain Spring Water or more depending on the size of your blender.
