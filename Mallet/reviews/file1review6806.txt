review/text: I am a 45 year old male, surfer, tennis player and excercise enthusiast. I use the body back buddy daily, accompanied with stretching and rolling on a six inch diameter mini basketball. I find that this self therapy softens and relieves my myofacial trigger points that harden up after stressful events, or after hard excercise sessions, primarily around my upper back, shoulder, and trapezius muscles.The greatest advantage of this wonderful device is that it is there when the episodes of discomfort require massage, or direct pressure. My life is much more relaxed and comfortable by using this tool. I use it sitting down, lying in bed, or standing. It has numerous applications, is portable and extremely durable/unbreakable. I can get the needed leverage from the two straight handles. I cannot speak more kudos for this life enhancing device. My fiance uses it and so does my mother who now swears by it. She had an awful muscular attack one night around her shoulder and neck areas. I drove this up to her and it was the only massage tool that relieved her suffering! She would not return it to me! Therefore, I had to buy a second one for myself. LOL!! Absolutely No regrets with this tool. I recommend it for anyone us suffers from muscular tightness, trigger points or soreness.
