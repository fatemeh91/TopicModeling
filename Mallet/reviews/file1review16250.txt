review/text: Thank god we finally have vendors and sellers who are taking the embarassment out of buying something that we should all be buying. I just wanted to thank \"Kevin\" for answering my query so quickly. Not only did he have a wonderful sense of humor, but he also took care of my mistake immediatly! I am thoroughly impressed by both your low prices AND your superior customer service! Please pass this thank you along to Kevin if at all possible. Additionally, I believe that it would be helpful if your site had a feedback page where accolades could be posted. I feel confident when purchasing from an online retailer who has an open forum for positive feedback. Take care, Tammi
