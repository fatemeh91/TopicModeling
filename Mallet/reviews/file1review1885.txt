review/text: This stuff is the real deal. After trying to utilize Gold Bond extra strength body powder along with Lotrimin Ultra for the rash which wasn't working, I saw the reviews for this and bought it.My case was severe and after 4 days of use, the rash is almost gone. That's right, almost gone. I'm using the wash in the morning and after I workout, Lotrimin in the morning and then Gold Bond 3-4 times a day and I have no doubt this soap has given me the upper hand to win the battle.Do not hesitate to buy and have extra stock on hand.
