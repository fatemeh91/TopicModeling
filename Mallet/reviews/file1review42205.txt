review/text: I love this product. You get two large bottles of aromatherapy spray, which makes it convienient to keep one on the changing table and one in the diaper bag. It smells really good - it's not overpowering, but it smells good enough that it makes you want to use it all the time. It truly is a calming, cheering-up sort of scent, and my baby loves it. I spray it on his blanket before I rock him to sleep, and by now, the scent alone makes him feel relaxed and sleepy. The scent is not chemically or even too "babyish", so I can even give myself a spritz and enjoy the aromatherapy. I highly recommend this one!
