review/text: Is it possible to get excited about a potty seat? Yes, it is. My 4-year old daughter has been using this seat for four days now and I am thrilled. After owning three other types of seats, I am sold on this Baby Bjorn seat. All of the other seats were so hard to clean and literally collected urine on the underside, it was so gross and impossible to keep clean. The last one I had even leaked the urine onto the adult seat, it was terrible. This Baby Bjorn seat is one-piece and that makes all the difference - there is no where for the urine to collect except inside the potty where it belongs! The seat fits nice and snug on my round toilet seat as well as the elongated one at my parent's house - I bought another one for their house. And the bright pink and white seat is too cute. Thank you, thank you for making a decent potty seat that you can keep clean!
