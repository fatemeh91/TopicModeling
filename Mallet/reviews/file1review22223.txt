review/text: This is a great little product that I found out about while reading a blog written by a woman who packs her kid's school lunch each day. I am WELL past school days, but I still take my lunch to work as often as I can. This divided container allows me to separate dissimilar items and the best part is that the division between the three separate wells is sealed off with the lid. So, I was able to take leftovers in the large well, and celery sticks in one small wall, and some dip in the third well. No leakage at all! BPA free as well. Will definitely keep this on subscribe-and-save.
