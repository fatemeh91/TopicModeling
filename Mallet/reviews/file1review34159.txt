review/text: I purchased this because various web sites testimonials stated that it worked well on beards. It's OK however, at least for me, it does not live up to the hype on the various web sites. The wife has not noticed any difference on the softness of my beard. I will probably go back to what I was using previously which costs less that half of what this product costs.
