review/text: Bought this based on reviews and it's just not for me. I started feeling nauseous after taking the vitamin. After I found out I was pregnant and had horrible morning sickness, it made it even worse. It was a waste of $ for me since I have a full bottle and have to switch to another brand. Might try out vitamin gummies instead.
