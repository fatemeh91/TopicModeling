review/text: I loved this product. I use Rembrandt toothpaste, but I was really impressed when I saw they had toothpaste for sensitive teeth. The toothpaste was refreshing and I noticed my teeth weren't as sensitive as usual. It also didn't burn my mouth, as some toothpaste seems to do. And, I noticed a definite whitening of my teeth while using this product. I'd definitely recommend this toothpaste. I love the Rembrandt product line and this toothpaste just adds to my favorites.
