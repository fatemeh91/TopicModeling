review/text: I wish the pictures were better. This particular flosser is about as long as a toothbrush, and the prongs are about 1-1/2" apart. There's a little button where the prongs meet where you wind the floss around--this is held in place by a brass tack/rivet kind of thing. The prongs are angled, and at the end of each one is a shallow groove, which holds the floss in place. The handle is a bit less than 1/4" thick.Anyway, this feels really flimsy because the material just isn't robust enough. If I really pushed it, I'm pretty sure it would snap--it would be much better if it were made of steel or something. There's a lot of "give" when I'm moving it around in my mouth, and so that plus the design of the prongs (you can see they're at an angle, which really restricts your movements), makes the whole thing really awkward to maneuver.Disposables are much easier to use, but if you're convinced you want a refillable flosser, search around a bit and see if you can find the "Ezy Floss" which feels a lot more like a disposable.
