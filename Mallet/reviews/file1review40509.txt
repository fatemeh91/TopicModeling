review/text: I have tried various protein powders, always trying to find that perfect one with great taste. I finally found it. After reading other reviews I decided to try the Whey Gourmet. It is so good. I usually have one shake in the evening as part of my clean eating/high protein regime. I like plenty of ice to make it really thick and use skim milk plus just a tiny bit of Splenda and I have this great tasting shake. It is a little expensive but worth it when you find one that tastes so good.
