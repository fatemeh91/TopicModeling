review/text: I have always liked Cross pens. This one is my favorite so far since I can not only take notes with ink or pencil, I can redline documents as well. It is well constructed like other Cross pens, and with a modicum of care it should last you for years. It is easy to operate with a twist you go between black ink, red ink, and pencil mode. For those features I think it is reasonably priced and I recommend it for anyone that uses black ink, red ink, and pencils to write on a regular basis. A nice Valentine gift for men or women. Be sure to put it back in your pocket because everyone likes this kind of pen.
