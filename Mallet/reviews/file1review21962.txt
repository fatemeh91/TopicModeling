review/text: I bought these as an inexpensive alternative to the Theraband bars. They are not of the same quality. I bought a green and a red one. There is not much difference in the resistance. They are much stiffer than the Therabars and more difficult to use. I was hoping to recommend these to my patients, but instead I recommend the original Therabars which are more expensive, but also more effective.
