review/text: First electric I've had in a while. I was surprised by how close it shaves, but as another reviewer pointed out, if you go a few days between shaves the longer whiskers don't get in the foil. it's also necessary to go over the same area from different directions a few times, this shaver is not faster than a blade. I like the beard trimmer, I usually keep my beard trimmed pretty short and the trimmer attachment will get it down to three-day-growth short if you want. I have not gotten used to using the trimmer without the attachment, there's two sides to it; one rounded and one straight. The straight side is an inch long which is a bit too long and unwieldy, I usually end up using a separate mustache trimmer. Cleaning is a breeze, just run under hot water. Seems to keep a charge for a about a week for me, but I don't use it everyday. As far as maintenance, I'll know more in a couple months.
