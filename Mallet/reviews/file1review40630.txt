review/text: I bought some of this at a great price at Costco a few years ago. I was unhappy with Cascade and other products because my dishes were turning out to be cloudy and filmy because of a government regulation removing phosphates, if I'm remembering right. My dishes came out sparkling clean with this product from the get-go, so I bought a bunch of it before they stopped carrying it. My supply has lasted two years, and I just ran out. I won't be buying any more because it's extremely expensive at the regular stores and even though it's more reasonable at Amazon, I just won't pay that much for dishwasher detergent. So I'm deducting a star for costing too much. But it worked great for me and I loved the smell! I live in northern Utah and get city water and have a water softener. I am surprised at all the negative reviews since I've never had any problems with this product getting the dishes clean. I rinse my dishes, but only lightly, and never ended up with food residue on my dishes after running the dishwasher. Just my experience. Luckily, I found another product that works just as well and is a lot cheaper called Finish Gel, orange-fresh scent. I get it at my local grocery store for a couple of dollars for a big bottle. If I ever see it at Costco again for a cheaper price, I would be happy to buy it.
