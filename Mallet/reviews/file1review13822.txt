review/text: Oh!I love this lotion!!!!!It's the least pricey but the best!!!!!!I've been using this lotion every night since being pregnant for about 13 weeks.It's not greasy and smells good, which is definitely a plus,especially in summer:)I'm now 9 months pregnant and no stretch marks at all! Highly recommend!
