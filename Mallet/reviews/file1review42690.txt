review/text: I checked the break-in cycle results on this usingMaha Powerex Wizard One MH-C9000 Advanced Battery Charger and Analyzer - Free Deluxe Storage Case Includedwhere the reviewer found these to be close to the stated 2000 mAh capacity and they also had charge right out of the box as claimed at couchcricket[dot]com. So I purchased these.So far I have been happy with the performance and for daily usage I perceive no difference between these and Eneloops. Though on specs and paper, Eneloop wins.
