review/text: It is certainly (generic Benadryl) Dyphenhydramine Liquid Antihistamine.This products strength is 12.5 mg, per teaspoon.Although packaged well and arrived in new condition, this product is labeled, 'children's allergy medicine.' Had the seller included this information in the product description, I would not have purchased the item. I am an adult and require full strength medication.
