review/text: We moved into a new home 3 years ago with a mid-grade dishwasher. The water in our neighborhood is exceptionally hard and leaves a white film on metal and glass. The dishwasher interior and the shower doors are the worst. The spray arm in the dishwasher was particularly bad, and dishes were not getting as clean as they should, even with a rinse aid. It used to be people would "rescue" their dishwashers by putting a cup of Tang (yes, the one created for astronauts) in the bottom of the dishwasher and running it, because Tang was mainly powdered citric acid. But I wasn't a fan of adding sugar and a colorant to the problem. We purchased this product for &lt;$4 at a local retailer, so the price was right for a trial. The instructions called for removing the lid, leaving the wax plug alone, and placing the inverted bottle in the cutlery rack or in the bottom rack. Our cutlery rack is door-mounted, so I placed it in the bottom rack, rotating it 45 degrees so it would be supported by surrounding rack prongs. Preheated the water in the line to hot hot hot, set the dishwasher on Hi-Temp Wash, and let it do its thing. The inside of the dishwasher looks brand new! The spray arm is shiny metal, the entire scale-coated cutlery rack has been descaled, and entire interior looks better. For this price, it can't be beat. And so what if it needs to be done once a month? If my dishes are cleaner, and the dishwasher runs better, it's worth the $4 and the effort to do so.
