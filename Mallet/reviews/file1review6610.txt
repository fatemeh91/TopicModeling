review/text: This is an absolutely great tool for massaging one's own "trigger points" or knotted muscles.The "thera-cane" is recommended by many trigger point practitioners, and this is even better in my opinion. It has more options and you can reach virtually any point of your body with this thing and dig into your muscles to help release the trigger points that cause pain.This thing works, and it's great. Especially if you already know where your trigger points are. If not, I recommend the book by Clair Davies, sold here, the title is something like The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook.Anyway, this is a great tool. Overpriced, but you really can't get anything like this anywhere else for cheaper, so.... go for it!
