review/text: I have problem to see clear while shaving. I use 7X but it is not handy. I found this product on amazon.com first I hesitated to order of 10X but when I received the product, my hesitation gone. I am happy and satisfied with the product.I like it feature:Make-up mirror rotates so the light can be used on both magnificationsVanity stand to be used on on a counter topUse as a hand held mirrorOptical quality glassPatented design allows for mirror to swivel 360 degrees8" x 14" x 2 1/2"But I am not happy with it's Led Light,it is useless. Instated of this company should give good adjustable stand so we can set it height as we need....
