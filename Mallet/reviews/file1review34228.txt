review/text: I have tried the other creams like Preparation H. They have not worked like they say and are even messier than this ointment. You get quick, very good relief and the hemorrhoids do go away in a short while (less than a week). This absolutely works and well worth your purchase. Very reasonable price - in my opinion.
