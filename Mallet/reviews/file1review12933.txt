review/text: Our son moved from his toddler bed to his "big kid bed", an XL Twin. I wanted something more durable & water resistant than his waterproof crib pads, to be sure the matress was 100% protected. I saw some mixed reviews on this, but most of the reviews were very positive. I'm so glad I bought it, and plan to buy 2 more. It has never once leaked through. I put it under his sheet so he has a nice comfortable bed like we all do, and his matress stays dry consistantly. Great product!
