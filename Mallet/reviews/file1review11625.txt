review/text: Although Glucerna seems to help avoid low blood glucose, it is sweet, sweet, sweet! And, ironically, full of things that are otherwise bad for you, like transfat and palm oil, and little that is good. Another brand of diabetic snack bar is not likely to be worse, and almost certainly would be better. The makers of this bar don't care about our health: just our money.
