review/text: I've tried these and the feather blades - the feathers were too sharp/finicky and I haven't used more than 3 of the 10 I purchased because they tend to take off skin too easily. I have hearty beard hairs and soft skin, so I need sharp blades, but not TOO sharp. These Merkur blades seem to fit the bill.
