review/text: The glasses arrived in good condition and were well packaged. The view is excellent and my wife thinks they really look good. Since I don't really care what anyone else thinks that's good enough for me. The glasses fit very well and are the most comfortable reading glasses I own. They sit on the nose without slipping and there isn't any excess pressure on the side of my head, which has been a problem in the past with some of my reading glasses.Great product.AD2
