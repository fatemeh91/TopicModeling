review/text: I purchased this for my dad, who is elderly, and he says it does the trick for him in helping him get his socks on without bending, so I suppose it does as advertised. If purchased at medical supply stores or pharmacies (note: most pharmacies do not stock this type of product), it would run you around $25 or more, so the price was the hugest advantage here on amazon marketplace. Shipping was average speed. Overall very satisfied.
