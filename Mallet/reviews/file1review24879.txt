review/text: I purchased Fertilaid after being on birth control pills for 15 years. Recently married, we decided to start trying to conceive. I was not sure what my cycle would be like off of birth control, so I thought why not try to regulate things right off the bat? I read all the great reviews about it and decided I would go for it. Big mistake! I started taking the pills and got my period right away which lasted 13 days!! (Normally my period was 3 to 4 days). I thought okay, maybe this is just the start of these pills "normalizing" my cycle who knows? Well I am still waiting for my period after 45 days now and have taken 2 pregnancy tests. Deff not pregnant. These pills have messed my cycles up and I am so annoyed. I stopped the pills and am still waiting for a period so that I can try to get back on track! I would not reccomend these vitamins if you are stopping the pill. Wait and see what your body will do on its own!! I feel like I have just wasted time I could have had on to TTC.
