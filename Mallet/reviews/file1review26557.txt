review/text: I love(d) this product, but alas it doesn't seem to be manufactured to last. The first one I bought stopped inflating and staying inflated within a few days. The replacement one that I was sent after contacting Amazon has made it for a few months and now seems to stay inflated only about 20 minutes when not sitting by itself. Once I use it will driving it deflates in about 20 minutes. Disappointing.
