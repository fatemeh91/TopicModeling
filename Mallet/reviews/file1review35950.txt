review/text: I did try to believe that by just placing my wet finger over the little metal plate on the brush handle magic ions would clean my teeth and make them all better. I really did try. Finally though the silliness of it all just got to me and I got a Sonicare. Now I don't have to pretend and it is doing wonders for my teeth and gums. Seriously. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
