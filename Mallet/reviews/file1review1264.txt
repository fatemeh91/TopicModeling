review/text: This was first purchase of a wax eyebrow hair remover so I have nothing to compare it to.Strips are nicely shaped to remove hair from any area under brow. It could have used a little more "sticking" power.It failed to remove as much hair as I would have liked.Price was nice but delivered in smashed box. Vendor customer service was very good. I would try other of their productsbased on my experience with them.
