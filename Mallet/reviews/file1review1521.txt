review/text: I have had an extensive area of warts on the heal of my foot for several years. My dermatologist prescribed the 17% solution and 40% urea cream. I have gone through an unknown number of bottles of the solution and several huge tubes of urea cream to no avail. The solution would just eat away at the periphery of the problem area and would not affect the majority of the wart area. I have treated the area twice with the Wart Stick and a good size area of the wart has already dried up and peeled off. After applying, I covered the area with duct tape to keep the medicine where it was suppose to be. This stuff will kill good skin so be careful where it is applied. I have to give this product two thumbs up along with the five stars. I do not know how long this product has been on the market, but I wish I would have had it years ago.
