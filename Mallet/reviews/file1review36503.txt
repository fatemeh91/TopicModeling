review/text: This deodorant keeps me feeling fresh all day. It is NOT an antiperspirant, therefore it will not keep you from sweating. What it WILL do, is kill the bacteria on your skin that thrive off the sweat, creating body odor. This has a pleasant, not overpowering smell. Since using this I have watched the dark skin under my arms return to a normal color. I have also suffered from severe acne and cysts under my arms, and those have also disappeared since I left behind my traditional antiperspirant.
