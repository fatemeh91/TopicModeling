review/text: I've had clothes like this for my glasses in the past and they always took the longest time to dry! This one drys really quickly. And it's great because of it's size. I never have to put my fingers on my glasses while I'm cleaning them, one hand can hold one side of the cloth while the other side is cleaning my glasses. I would definitely buy this again!
