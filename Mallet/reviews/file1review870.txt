review/text: I was looking for a higher mg Primrose Oil and chose this one. Because of the higher mg I was expecting a larger sized pill, but these are huge! As a person who has trouble swallowing pills this was a bit disappointing. They are soft however so they're not terrible to swallow, trying not to scare anyone away from taking these just be warned for those of us who don't like taking pills that these are quite large.
