review/text: I have tried a few different protein powders, and I like this one the best. First of all, it is very nutrient-dense, unlike some other powders. 1 scoop delivers 24g of protein, while in some other powders, you need to take twice that amount. It also has fewer carbs (only 3g per scoop). I also find it to be much more cost effective. One of these 5 pound jars contains 149 scoops and costs $43 -- that's 29 cents per meal!! And, most importantly -- it tastes good. There is no sense buying something if you won't eat it, no matter how healthy it might be, but taste is not a problem with this product. So, it's healthy, it's cost effective, and it tastes good -- can't really go wrong.No doubt there are plenty of ways to consume it, but these are my top two: Either put it in a blender with black coffee and a splash of milk, or put it in a blender with plain Greek yogurt and a bit of water. You can also add other nutritional supplements, like fiber powder or DE.
