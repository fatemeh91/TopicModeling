review/text: Only on third day but it has worked so far, I am always hungry at night, and eat late, I still think about food, but the cravings still seem there, have slight buzz/head tingle from using it, not sure about that, but no difficulty in sleeping, I agree don't take too early, after last meal.Will update on results
