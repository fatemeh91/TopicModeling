review/text: I'd never had a Balance Bar before and wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at the taste. It was chocolatey and wonderful. I think the Balance Bars are great to have for breakfast on the run and to grab a quick snack before or after working out. I would highly recommend the Balance Bars.
