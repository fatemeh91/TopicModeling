review/text: I'm not a big fan of candy bars, cake, chocolate, or anything thats sweet so I was kinda having second thoughts on buying it at target ($1 for brownie with nuts). This was my first energy bar that I ate and I have to say It tasted great, not sweet at all..just pure good, I just took a drink of water and I was ready to go running.
