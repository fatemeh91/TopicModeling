review/text: Not even a "GENTLE warming sensation"; the warmth is absent completely! Not only does it not even get warm, but it comes in this teeny tiny bottle about as big as your thumb!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! K-Y is usually a trusted brand but this doesn't do what the name CLEARLY states it does. What DOES work: K-Y Touch warming massage oil...I bought that a long time ago, lost it somewhere, but it DOES do what its supposed to and its a decent sized bottle.
