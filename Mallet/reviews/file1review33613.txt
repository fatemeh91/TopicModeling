review/text: I've owned a half dozen Waterpik flossers over the years -- I'm addicted to them, my teeth never quite feel clean when I can't use the Waterpik for a day or so -- and, I simply wear them out. This is my latest replacement and it works as well or better than all of the others I have owned over the years.When I wear this one out, I'll be buying another -- they work and my dental health is testament.
