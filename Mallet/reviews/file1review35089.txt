review/text: I liked using this spray, but I can't say it really calmed me down for more than a few minutes in times of stress. I'd say this product is best suited to dealing with annoying phone calls, being stuck in traffic jams, or other minor annoyances. I have an anxiety disorder, and while I'd never try to use this in place of my prescription medicine, I did wonder if it might sooth my nerves. The answer? Not really.
