review/text: I have a problem with osteo-arthritis in my left leg which causes a constant aching or even pain for me all the time. This isn't shocking as I'm at the age that sort of thing occurs for many of us. This had been going on with increasing pain for about 10 months when a friend suggested I try Osteo Bi-Flex. I ordered two bottles from Amazon and have been taking it for a little over a month. Previously I had been taking a Glucosamine, Chondroitin supplement as well as MSM but they didn't seem to be doing all that much to relieve the pain.The Osteo Bi-Flex contains, according to the box, "the unique International patent pending ingredient 5-LOXIN Advanced." I'm not sure what that is but I knew I wasn't getting any of that and felt it just might be worth a try to see if it would help me.It has taken a few weeks but I do seem to be experiencing considerable relief from the pain; the results are good enough that I'll reorder when I run out of my present supply. I'll freely admit I'm not as faithful about exercising as I should be but I have been faithful about taking the Osteo Bi-Flex tablets, two a day since I got them. I didn't really expect a dramatic improvement in seven days but I believe I've gotten substantial improvement in one month.If you are having to deal with arthritis it would probably be worth your time and money to check this out for yourself. I have been pleased with the results and would be very willing to make these tablets a part of my dietary regimen for the foreseeable future.Less pain is good!
