review/text: I have been using this toothbrush for 7 years, and continue to be pleased with it. It really gives your teeth a good cleaning. I am very pleased with the reliability of the unit. How many household products like this can you think of that last 7 years and still going strong. I am also pleased that the little brushes last a long time as well.Reasonable price, great performance, and long lifetime . . . what else could you want in a tooth brush?
