review/text: Pros:I can now use one shaver to cut long whiskers. I used to use a Braun for short whiskers and a Norelco for long whiskers that grew when I did not shave every day.The shaver does not pull the whiskers as they are cut, regardless of the length.I have used my shaver for six months and it still holds a good charge and cuts well due to the cleaner, I think.Cons:Cost of cleaner -- I use about one per month but it does seem to do what it claims. It keeps the shaver clean, lubricated, and smelling chemically clean.I would buy it again. Also, I would not waste money on the LCD display.
