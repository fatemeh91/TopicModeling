review/text: Wow where do I start??? Well I've been a Venus girl since they came out and I went to my Walmart to buy refills and I saw the Intuition so I thought I'd give it a try because the concept appealed to me. So I go home and try it out. At first, I thought it was great because it was so smooth to run up my legs but then after I shaved my whole leg and felt with my hands where I need to go back over for missed spots, I had to re-do almost my whole leg! Then I looked really close at the razor...it's cheap! It looked like a cheap disposable razor that you can find at the dollar store. But I decided to keep on trying it for the heck of it. The solid lotion was all gone by my 4th shave. My venus razors last me a month. The Intuition lasted me 1 1/2 weeks. I don't want to be putting an expensive refill in every week and a half. So, since I had another refill that came with the razor, I thought I'd just use it up (I hate wasting things). So halfway using the brand new refill, the lotion part completely broke off the razor making it unusable.Lesson learned: I'm going back to my Venus. It lasts MUCH longer, smoother shave, I only have to shave my leg once to get it shaved, it doesn't take that much time to apply shaving lotion, and I can use it for my bikini areas and underarm. My shave lasts longer too.Jeers to Schick.
