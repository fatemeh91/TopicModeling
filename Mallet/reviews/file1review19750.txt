review/text: This seat meets the needs of my son in all of our toilets - from the round bowls that are nearly 100 years old to the new enlongated bowl we just had installed.Its stability was key for my son, who found the rocking of other seats to be an impediment to using the toilet. Potty training is hard enough, without feeling like your seat might slip!The seat is perfect for a little boy just learning to use the toilet, but large enough for a small adult to sit on as well - a key advantage when all the toilets in the house must be so equipped day and night.Excellent for all ages of children who need to use toilets with seats that are too big for their little bottoms.
