review/text: We love this tub. My son if fairly active in the tub and when he stands and sits during bath time he has plenty of cushion for his behind. We had purchased a bath seat before he could sit unsupported and after one use discovered how easily they tip over so we got rid of it. Our 10mo. old son loves this tub and it's small enough as not to overwhelm him but still has plenty of room for his tub toys. It's great for travel too which is important for safety in the hotel and relative's tubs.
