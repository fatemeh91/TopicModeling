review/text: Let me start with the notion that we have *really* hard water where we live, so keep that in mind when reading my review.I usually use Cascade powerpacs for my dishwasher detergent, along with Finish Power Up Booster for my hard water issues. This combination was working fantastic for my needs.After switching to Finish Powerball (and kept using the Power Up Booster) I was not as happy with the outcome. The dishes I thoroughly rinsed came out sparkling clean, but the ones my kids would rinse and leave some residue on, came out with spots of residue still on them.I was a bit disappointed since I LOVE the Power Up Booster so much (I actually do a Subscribe and Save here on amazon for that product because I like it so much and use it daily) I was hoping this Finish brand of dishwasher detergent would be as good. But I think I am going to stick with my Cascade.Again, we have very hard water, so if you don't you may have different results.
