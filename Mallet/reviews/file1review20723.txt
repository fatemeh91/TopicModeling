review/text: I purchased these Gaurds for Men for a friend who is having trouble controling his bladder. Based on what he has told me. He says that they work well for his needs and are very comfortable. I have joked with him that this is the first step toward him going back in diapers. I do hope not, since I am incontinent, and am diaper dependent. The shape of the gaurd fits well into his underpants and so far he has had no trouble with any sort of leak. I will buy these again for him when they are needed.
