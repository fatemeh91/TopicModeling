review/text: I've been using the Bluebonnet Calcium Magnesium Citrate liquid for about a year. It is a great effective supplement and the blueberry flavor is my favorite. I hate taking those gargantuan calsium tablets and this is a breeze to take. One tablespoon in the morning and one in the evening. This product has helped me sleep better and eliminated night time leg cramps. However,I do recommend that you purchase through a different seller. I purchased this product from VitaBox as fulfilled by Amazon and unfortunately, they are not very good with their packaging. They used a much too large box for two bottles and insufficient cushioning, and when my package arrived one of the bottles was completely shattered. Needless to say, Amazon was great about the refund, but I really needed more than one bottle. I would never again buy from VitaBox as they are incapable of packing their merchandise appropriately.
