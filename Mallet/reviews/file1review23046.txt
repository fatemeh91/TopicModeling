review/text: The sweeper works great! Perfect for a dorm, small apartment, office, etcWorks great, picks up lots of dust and debris. I fell in love with this thing the second I got it. So easy to use and keeps the floor clean. It's incredibly easy to empty the dust pans and not make a complete mess, and comes with a comb for the cleaning brush. I USE THIS ALMOST DAILY!The handle does have some issues but if you hit it on the ground when assembling it you shouldn't have the problem (the instructions tell you to do this). It also has problems getting around corners or up against the wall, but that is expected.
