review/text: I have tried a lot of different types of protein on the market and I always get disappointed and come back to this stuff. You know why? Because it taste great, has what I need to throw around the iron, and is one of the best proteins out there. It mixes very easily. I tend to mix a little water in it. Doesn't have a nasty after taste like many products out there. Very smooth. When I first tried this flavor way back, I thought it was simply a spin off of the Vanilla flavor but it really is more like cake batter when you get a few sips into it. Throw some milk in it for a truly amazing taste. I'm on the run and just use water. If a protein tastes great just mixing it with water, has the best ingredients, and is produced by one of the best companies out there, then you know it is worth buying. Don't get fooled by XYZ's new ad for the newest protein on the market. Just go with this. You will love it.
