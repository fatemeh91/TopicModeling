review/text: I feel bad that this tub has had safety issues for some. For us, it was extremely helpful. My small newborn fit fine without slipping, and after my c-section (and subsequent back issues), it was helpful to be able to stand at the kitchen sink to bathe him. He was a fussy guy who hated baths, so rather than filling the tub, I left the drain open and essentially gave him sponge baths. I was also grateful for the fold-up feature which allowed me to keep the tub in our small kitchen.
