review/text: I have been using this product since the last 10 odd months and the difference it has made in my morning shaving routine is just priceless. I have the entire kit, with the pre-shave oil, shaving cream, lathering brush and this after-shave balm (lavender). I also have the art of shaving book. This was my wonderful wife's gift to me on my birthday and I can't thank her enough. The book actually improved my shaving technique and my skin over a period of time...I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to enjoy shaving!!!
