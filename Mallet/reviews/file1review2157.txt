review/text: I had used Dip-It Food & Beverage Stain Remover for many many years until I could no longer find it on supermarket shelves. Used other products and they DO NOT work. I recently saw it on Amazon.com and was thrilled. This product is amazing. It is the only product that truly cleans my electric Farberware coffeepots. I also purchased Dip-It for Automatic Drip Coffee Maker for another family member. She was so pleased to finally have a product to clean her drip coffee maker. This product is an essential item in your kitchen. Believe me it WORKS!!!!
