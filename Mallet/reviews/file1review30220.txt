review/text: I bought the Black & Decker Corded Dustbuster for myself last year after Christmas from the gift card my brother gave me. It quickly became one of my "favorite" things. The suction on this little vacuum is better than my Dyson and great for little pick up jobs, getting cat hair off the furniture, and I have even used it to vacuum the keyboard on my notebook computer. Emptying it and cleaning the filter is pretty easy. I would suggest emptying and cleaning the filter often, it can get gross if you leave the filter too long. You just can't get the suction on the rechargable like you can on the plug-in kind. Highly recommended. This year I bought six for gifts for my family because it is one of my "favorite" things. Amazon's price was cheaper than anywhere else.
