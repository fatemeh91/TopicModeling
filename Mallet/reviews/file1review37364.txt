review/text: I would like to say first off I would definitely recommend this product. The hair on my legs (calves and thighs) is very thick and very dark, therefore very obvious, I'm just basically hairy. I usually grow through all kinds of methods to remove the hair; waxing, shaving, creams. This is the best I have ever tried. It does hurt, but like the other reviewers will tell you the pain goes away as quickly as you pass over the hair, and the more you use it the less it hurts. Another plus is my hair usually grows insanely fast, but with this I have been surprised the last week with still smooth legs! I did have a little stubble the first time I used it, but I realized that it was because I was going over the skin too fast, that rips the hair as opposed to pulling it from the root. 1 suggestion: it takes time to do until you really know how to work it so do it while watching TV or listening to music, anything that won't have you rushing. Overall great product.
