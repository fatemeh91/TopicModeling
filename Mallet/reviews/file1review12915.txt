review/text: I purchased these covers with the intention of using them on top of my children's sheets, to prevent, as others have mentioned, having to completely strip the bed after nighttime accidents. However, these pads not only do not have a nonslip backing, they have a very slick plastic backing which makes it almost impossible for the pad to stay in one spot, making them entirely unsuitable for use on top of sheets. I have had to resort to placing the pad under the sheets, which of course requires that I strip the sheets each morning, which I was having to do anyway. I regret having purchased these, as I could have gotten pads for under-sheet use for much cheaper locally. They do help protect the mattress by being waterproof, but one can find that easily in any mattress protector.
