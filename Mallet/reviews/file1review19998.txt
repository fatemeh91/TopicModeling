review/text: This was the first bathtub we bathed our newborn in when he was born almost three years ago. We got it as a shower gift. I love how portable it is - it folds up very nicely for storing. It is the perfect size for bathing your little one, and is nice and padded so they stay comfortable. The Safety First Space Saver Fold Up Tub works great on a counter, in a sink or in a bathtub.The main down-side to this product is that I feel like the baby isn't covered with ENOUGH water to stay warm. It IS nice that the seat is reclined just so so that baby is comfortable, but I always felt like my little one was cold when he was in the tub!We used this tub for awhile, but soon upgraded to bathing our son in the sink with a cushion-y foam bath pad. We didn't get a TON of use out of the Safety First tub, but we will probably use it again when we have our second child, at least when they are a very small infant.
