review/text: I bought this sweeper because I have a black cat and a light carpet and did not want to pull out the vacuum every time she sat down on the rug. She sheds constantly. The sweeper has a little plastic cover on the end of the handle which cracked by the third time I used it. It picks up the cat hair fairly well. I find I have to go over the area a few times. I think for the money spent, you can't be too picky. It does a decent job.
