review/text: I love me some Tigers Milk bars... Always buy the, when I am looking or a little something to augment a lunch salad or smoothie...however these (while well priced and shipped ridiculously fast) are apparently made for a leprechaun's lunch, because they are the tiniest little baby bars I the world. Sure, I should have probably looked at a traditional bar sold in stores and compared grams per package, but I figured you'd label the package or the reviews would indicate here were little tiny elf bars...
