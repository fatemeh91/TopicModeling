review/text: I really liked this beard trimmer when I got it, but within a few months the battery started to go dead. Problem is that it does not function while plugged in, so the only way to get it to work is with it being charged up. It won't take enough charge for me to trim my whole beard, which is very very annoying. Stay far away from this product unless you want to replace it within a few months.
