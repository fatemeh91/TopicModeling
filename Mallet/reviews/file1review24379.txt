review/text: i've used hammer gel for many years, ever since i did an exhaustive reading of several cycling messageboards, adn found that hammer gel was just about the top rated gel amongs users. sometimes i've bought Gu gels becuase they do tend to be cheaper, esp. when you can find them on sale, and they suffice, but hammer gel seems to give me a little more energy, especially this espresso flavor with the caffeine load.I use either for inline speed skating races (always), and quite often during training for the same, or while doing running training, esp. when i feel i need a little get-up-and-go. The espresso works wonders in this regard. In fact, it works 'too good' and i have to watch that it doesn't become a mandatory part of every training workout.Though many suggest taking it with water, i haven't found it necessary, and i hate to carry water bottle, so i take it straight.Best to take a little a few minutes before starting and then once or twice during workout. For races, best to take as recommended, and they do suggest intervals on the instructions.The bottle does save a few bucks, but sacrifices convenience. Bottle allows for partial shots. on one order (rom REI), i found both bottles to require thinning with a little water since it was very thick- no problem to accomplish. Personally, i go with the bottles, and carry a few of the packets in my sports bag in case i ever forget the flask or just run out.I love this stuff, and it does give a kick to my workouts. It will also save your workout big time if you ever find yourself bonking. That's why i originally got it, but i use it more generally now.
