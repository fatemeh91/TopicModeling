review/text: I started taking these because I am low on Vitamin D and they have added D2 so I thought it would eliminate having to take that pill too. I am currently trying to conceive and started getting heavy nausea in the afternoons after I would take it (I had to eat something first because my stomach tends to be sensitive when empty). I thought "Yeah! I'm pregnant, I have nausea!" But no. Turns out it was a side effect of the vitamins because it would happen almost every day about an hour after consumption. Boo. So now I am back to the drawing board for something that doesn't upset my stomach. Although Rainbow Light does make my nails grow! As with any prenatal, however.
