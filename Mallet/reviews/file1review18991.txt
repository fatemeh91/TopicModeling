review/text: This ovulation test format is the classic "pee on a stick" type of test. Personally I find this style much easier to use than the other type of ovulation test (where you pee in a cup then put the strip in the cup for a few seconds) - and worth the extra cost. I've used these for several months with no issues. I plan to order these again if I'm not pregnant this cycle.The directions are clear; follow them and you'll be fine. Per the directions, and another reviewer, take the test in the afternoon and don't drink too much beforehand. If you find that it "never" shows ovulation, you may be testing too late. Start using the tests earlier in your cycle (check the chart on the included directions). If after a couple of cycles, the tests never show an LH surge (ovulation), consider buying "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler for great information to help determine what could be happening with your cycle.Just in case someone else receives the tests without instructions, go to the manufuacturer's website - they are posted there!
