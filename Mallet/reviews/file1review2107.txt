review/text: I have a small Cuisinart 4 cup coffee maker with the metal carafe. After having 2 Cuisinart 12 cups, bite the dust in less than 6 months. I had to rely on what I considered my little back up. I refuse to buy another Cuisinart 10-12 cup again, unless they bring the manufacturing back to the USA.But, I digress. My little metal carafe was black from coffee stain, and no amount of Dawn and scrubbing would get it clean looking. I purchased the Dip it, filled my little carafe with boiling hot water and added the Dip It. 20 Minutes later the water was pitch black when I poured it out, but my little carafe was clean, all the stain was gone.Made a pot of coffee right after it was cleaned, I'd forgotten how good coffee can taste.
