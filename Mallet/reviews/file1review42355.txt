review/text: Hi, I am only 35 and I have had to use many different canes, over the years. I simply love the Able Tripod Cane Base. It gives you great stability and it is much smaller and more compact than a regular quad cane. Of course, I don't like using my canes, but with the duck foot base, I feel more secure and a bit more stylish. Members at my church have tried it out and I believe some of the elderly women may get one as they were so surprised how stable it made them feel. At the moment I am using two canes, almost like using a walker. Soon, I hope to be able to go back to only using one, but now that I have the Tripod "foot" I will interchange it on the bottom of whichever ergonomic cane I wish to use!
