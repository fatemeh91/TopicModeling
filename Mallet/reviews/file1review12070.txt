review/text: I really like these prenatal vitamins! I like that they are food-based and they do not upset my stomach. They are a good value for the price and amazon seems to have the best price. They can be a bit hard to swallow if they go down at the wrong angle. These, along with a slight diet change to more meat, increased my iron levels enough that I did not have to take iron supplements while pregnant. I continue to take these while nursing my baby! Would recommend!
