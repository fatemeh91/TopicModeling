review/text: That's a supplement whose power you can really feel kicking in before a workout. The enhanced blood flow to one's muscles is really something that can make a weightlifting session a whole lot more intense than it would otherwise be.However, it has to be mixed and dissolved in at least a cup of water for every 5g before you take it. The taste of the powder itself is horrible (dissolving it certainly makes it a lot easier to chug down), but still well worth taking for its benefits.
