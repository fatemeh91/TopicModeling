review/text: My mom bought this vac for me for my Bridal shower.She picked it up in Target with my sister after having a laugh when they saw the vac was called "the retriever"My husband and I have a 90 lb blond Golden who sheds like crazy. After one or two rounds vaccuming my couch and stairs the retreiver attachment became entangled with his fur. I had to break apart the attachment I could not get the bristles clean. I HATE that vac. Now I use my swiffer vac on my hard wood. A lint roller on my couch, and TV's One Sweep (sweepa) to rake the dog hair out of my area rug. UGH! Thanks "Retriever" you stink
