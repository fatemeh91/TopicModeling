review/text: I'm always willing to change products if the new one is better than what I'm currently using. In regards to the Speed Stick Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant, I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Since I wear a suit and tie every day and deal with the public, it's very important that my deodorant keeps me dry and clean smelling. This super-dry Speed Stick achieved both for me. I did also especially like the sport talc fragrance. It wasn't too perfumey, yet pleasant smelling and for a man. Since deodorant is so important to me I would not easily switch brands but I must say Mennen has a new customer!
