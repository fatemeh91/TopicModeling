review/text: This product was great as I started noticing results right away. Six hours is a long time to wear it and I didn't know if it was okay to wear it longer than 6 hours as I like to get at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. The instructions state that it should be worn for a minimum of 2-6 hours... What is the max? No max? Okay.... When they put 2-6 I assume 6 hours may be the max, but they should have not put the word minimum to clear things up a bit. I didn't use the toothpaste so no review for that. Overall, I liked it!
