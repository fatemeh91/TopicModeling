review/text: These helped me get through a prolonged bout of excessive acid and gastritis. Less acid seems to be produced after meals when taking them, which presumably makes it easier for the stomach lining to heal. Unlike some similar products, they taste like papaya rather than mint, which is a plus in my book. I give them four stars rather than five because they only contain enzymes to support the digestion of protein and starch, not fat or cellulose etc., and in a relatively low dose at that. But they're inexpensive and they do help, so I recommend them for anyone who wants to give this kind of supplement a try.
