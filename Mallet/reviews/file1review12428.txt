review/text: I purchased this product because it is produced locally and the company that makes this product is committed to sustainability, for both the environment and health. Their ingredients are 100% vegetarian and no animal testing. I also really like this lip balm! I can be out in the sun for three to four hours on a weekend bike ride and my lips suffer. This lip balm is really good at preventing my lips from feeling sunburned after a day outside. The consistency of the balm (soft and smooth) makes it easy to apply. There's a hint of tangerine taste. There is NO icky petroleum or chemical taste. This is great lip balm!
