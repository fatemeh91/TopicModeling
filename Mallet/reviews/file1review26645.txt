review/text: I use this in my nursing chair - before getting it I was always uncomfortable while nursing and rocking my baby and my back would hurt whenever I got up. Now, my lower back is supported, the chair is so comfortable and I am not in pain anymore.It is also great to use on the airplane because you can deflate it and it packs really small to fit in any carryon. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
