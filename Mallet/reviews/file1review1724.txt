review/text: I have had nail fungus under three toenails since I was a young child. I have tried many products both prescription (Lamisil and Penlac) and over the counter and none have made any difference. I work at a drug store and have tried virtually every product we sell and they have made no difference. I have tried all the home remedies such as soaking in vinegar, vaseline, tea tree oil, etc. The vinegar and tea tree oil have done more than anything else. When I saw this I thought it was economical and I would try it to see.While some have doubted the reviews as being original, I was willing to give it a try. It is too soon to gauge if this is a miracle product and I am sure it will be months before I know it it works or not. What I can say it that I really like this product and plan to continue its use based solely on my first months of use.I use it daily in the shower. It lathers well and it doesn't take more than a teaspoonful on a new nail brush. I lather up the brush and briskly scrub my toes and toenails. Then I scrub the remainder of my feet as well. What noticed is that my "healthy" nails are bright white on the tips, the rough skin around my toenails is now sloughed off, and my feet in general look healthier. After one month I can see that the nails with the fungus are growing out without any of the usual deformity at the base. I will update as time goes by and these nails grow out.This product has a very fresh and somewhat medicinal smell which disipates after a few minutes out of the shower. I have recently purchased the foot soak that is the complimenting product to this wash and will review it after a few uses as well.
