review/text: This pre shave oil is actually a good value if you consider its viscosity compared to cheaper oils...it lasts longer, as well. The bottle prevents dripping and it works well on sensitive skin vs. using no oil at all. I have tried cheaper oils but returned to this one after mediocre results.
