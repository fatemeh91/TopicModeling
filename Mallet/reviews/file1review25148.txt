review/text: this thing worked once. ONCE! After that, the motion senor never worked properly again. So then we just figured we'd raise and lower the lid manually. Well, because of the gearing for the auto lift, most of the time the lid jams and won't go back down after you open it.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. Unless you enjoy things that don't work.... it's junk.
