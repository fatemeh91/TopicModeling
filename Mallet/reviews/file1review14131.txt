review/text: I bought this for my husband in hopes that he would be able to use an electric razor rather than a Mock 3 which was getting expensive. The Razor came with lotion and the gel. The lotion didn't do anything for him but he sure noticed a difference with the gel. Normally he would get a rash after shaving with an electric razor but this time he didn't so he is hooked! Too bad it is so difficult to find in the stores!
