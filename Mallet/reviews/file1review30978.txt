review/text: I had been taking another brand of glucosamine/MSM for many months and did not feel as if I was improving. My right knee still hurt; both knees still "popped" when I walked, and I was still waking up in the middle of the night with lower back pain. I have a host of chronic illnesses - including MS, Fibromyalgia, and lupus. After FOUR days of taking this supplement, both my knees stopped popping, my right knee felt so great I walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes - and had NO PAIN! I slept through the night, and my lower back does not hurt! Like I said - Absolutely A Miracle!
