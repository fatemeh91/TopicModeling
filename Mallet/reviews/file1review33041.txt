review/text: Art of Shaving Pre-shave oil works fine but is very very oily... I'm not a fan... One could use olive oil or something similar and the result would be the same. Art of Shaving Soap and Post Shave Balm on the other hand are excellent, however the Pre-shave is sub-standard to other products. Once you apply the Pre-shave oil, your hands and face are coated in oil which is tough to remove even with soap.As an alternative, I use the Kiehl's Pre-Shave which allows the face to be slick but not oily so that your shave is smooth. I should note, that Kiehl's shave cream is very much lacking compared to Art of Shaving.
