review/text: I bought this potty seat b/c of the great reviews it had received. And I must say; I agree! We are still in the early stages of potty training for my 2 year old-- but this one is the right toilet fit, right size hole and has the very needed splash gaurd. I had first bought the safety first version and my son didnt even fit on the seat- it was way too small circle. Try this out- its worth the price!
