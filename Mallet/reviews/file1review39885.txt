review/text: I absolutely love o.b. Tampons. They're super-absorbent, and very discreet. They work so well, and are so small, you can carry one in your pocket and no one will even notice. Definitely my favorite tampons out there. And if you really need an applicator, they make them like that too. The ones without an applicator are so much more convenient! Great product. I'll definitely continue using!
