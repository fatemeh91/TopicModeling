review/text: I just tried dishwasher magic for the first time. I am so impressed that I wanted to buy more, but couldn't find it anywhere, so I came to my favorite place for hard to find items, Amazon.com. I was compelled to write this review because It worked beyond my expectations. We have extremely hard water and my dishwasher insides, including the stainless interior and racks were chalky white with deposits. My glasses did not look clean and I thought for sure that something was wrong. The rinse aid did not seem to work anymore and there was just a clean streak where the aid came out of it's dispenser. So I tried this product, following the instructions and expecting to use it a second time like the directions say if the build was really bad. When the cycle finished, I could not believe that my dishwasher looked new inside and very clean, smelled nice etc... I just needed to clean around the outside of the door around the gasket etc.... I plan to use this product on a monthly basis to keep the buildup under control from now on. I just had to share my experience with this product and I hope others agree.
