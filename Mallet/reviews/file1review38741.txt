review/text: I have four problems with this product.A) Product quality:I bought this as a replacement, because my previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.B) Usability:This handle is entirely different shape and contour that prior models.This doesn't come with a tray to hold extra blades.This doesn't fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.C) Customer Service:I reported the problem to Shick, which is "Energizer Personal Care".2 weeks later, they responded with apology, and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle.5 weeks after that email, I received the coupon in the mail.D) The blades clog. If I have stubble only, then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor. It can't be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer. If I have a couple of week's worth of growth, the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.Overall, this product shows a lack of usability study, poor customer service, etc.Go back to Gillette. They are worth the 15% more cost for the 3000% better product.
