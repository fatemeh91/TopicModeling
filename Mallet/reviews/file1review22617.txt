review/text: I think this product works about as well as any weight loss product. I don't think it works any better - no magic formula for sure. The good news is that I didn't feel anxious or wired while trying this product. I think I'll just stick to a low carb, high protein diet when wanting to drop some pounds in the future; for me, that is what gets the best results.
