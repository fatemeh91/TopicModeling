review/text: These disposable changing pads are indispensible. We have used them for almost a year now and find them to have many uses. They are great for changing diapers away from home and at home are ideal for changing messy diapers because the entire package can be wrapped up and disposed of easily. Although they are a bit expensive, we have found them to be worth it because they are so sanitary.
