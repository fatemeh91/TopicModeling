review/text: this is one of the few products that has helped our son deal with irritiable bowel syndrome.he takes one capsule per day and since we started this product there has been no further attacks. There has been other preparations of peppermint we have tried that have been unsucessful in dealing with the attacks, which some are quite crippling and last for days sometimes weeks. I don't know what I would do for him if this was not available. Thanks yoy Carolyn Mascioli
