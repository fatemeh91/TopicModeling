review/text: I love Glad Rags and have been using them for several years. I was excited to add a few more to my collection at a great price. Though I was wary of the "assorted colors" without the ability to choose, I went ahead with the purchase. I should have known I would not get the nice, rich, solid colors like the ones pictured. Instead I got three pink confetti prints. Not something I would have picked out, but it gave my husband and I a good laugh, and they'll work just the same.
