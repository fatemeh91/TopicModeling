review/text: I've been trying a few AIO cloth diapers on my 1 month old daughter, and this is trial diaper 3 of 3. I am happy with the quality of construction and materials. My only gripe is with the amount of snaps and the time it takes to figure out which one goes where to ensure a proper fit. I'm not an idiot; I just would prefer something easier. My very intelligent engineer husband (who thinks I'm crazy for wanting to cloth diaper in the first place...) is even less likely to want to figure out how to use them. I would recommend the Bum Genius AIO diaper over this one--they have the same quality (with a touch of velcro), but I think are easier to use. I hope this helps.
