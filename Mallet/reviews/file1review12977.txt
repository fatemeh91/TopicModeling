review/text: I have order thousands of items from Amazon, and I believe this is one of the very few times I have had to write a negative review. This product was not worth the money I paid for it, and didn't not work very well at all. I tried to return the product, but I was told since I froze the item I was no longer able to return the product. I asked the vendor how would I know if the product worked it I didn't freeze it?I would not recommend ordering this product. There are far better products for less money.
