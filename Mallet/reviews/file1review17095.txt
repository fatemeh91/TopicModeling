review/text: I am very pleased with this purchase. I just started growing a beard and had no idea of what type of trimmerI should get. I checked online and saw reviews for this trimmer and the $15 price tag and went for the purchase. Couldn't be happier with my decision, charged it twice and it gets used every day and has plenty of battery life, owned over two months.
