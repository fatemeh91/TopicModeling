review/text: I have used Spray N Wash in the aerosol can since, I believe, the sixties. I could depend on it to remove any and most all stains. In recent years I could get it at Wal-Mart only. Now it is gone and has been replaced (?) by a pump spray w/ resolve. The liquid spray is not nearly as good...is this a part of going green? I know this won't do any good, but I feel better venting my opinion. There is nothing like Spray N Wash in the aerosol can.Not a Happy Camper...Joanne
