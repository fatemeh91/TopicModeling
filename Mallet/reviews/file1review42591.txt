review/text: I bought the Chocolate Mint and the Butter Cream Toffee to use and they couldn't be more different. The chocolate mixes effortlessly and tastes delicious, while the Toffee forms clumps and tastes horrible. Another problem I have with the toffee is when mixing in a shaker cup, a thick foam head forms that is gross.As for the results, both products deliver a great blend of Whey and essential BCAA's. I use it for a post-workout shake and it works well.Definitely will be buying again, but not the Butter Cream Toffee.
