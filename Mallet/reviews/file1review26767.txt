review/text: I have tried several brands and flavors of protein, this is BY FAR the best I've tried. The taste is incredibly good, the texture (when mixed with a shaker cup) is amazingly smooth. Even mixing with a spoon is ok, but I recommend using the cup, you will not be disappointed. I've tried both the Strawberry Banana and the Double Chocolate, and highly recommend both to anyone looking for a protein powder that will give you the results you are looking for. There are many more higher priced brands on the market, but none can compare to the value of ON. I will be buying more and have already turned several of my friends and former Marines on to this product.
