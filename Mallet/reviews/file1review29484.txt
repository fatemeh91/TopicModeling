review/text: This product is great. I used it all the time and was so glad to see I could still getit, I got it for my daughter to use in her diaper pail. She uses cloth diapers andwashes them every other day and as you can guess they get a little stinky this worksfantastic! It sticks to the lid and viola the smell is gone! They also had reallyfast shipping and great prices!
