review/text: I purchased this product as an "enhancer" to my gym workout. I can't say that it helped my gym workout routine physically, but it changes the scent of your sweat from "sweaty" to a sweet maple syrup smell. I like the product for that reason alone! I've been taking it for about a month now.
