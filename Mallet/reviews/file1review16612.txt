review/text: Great lighter, hell zippo is synonymous with the idea of wick lighters.That said for those transitioning from gas lighters to wick, beware:1) these bad boys run out of fluid alot because they burn fast and some gas is bound to evaporate off the wick2) when you're gassing the lighter, be careful not to let the lighter fluid wet the flint, or it wont work and you'll need to replace it. overfilling the lighter can saturate the cotton inside and allow lighter fluid to leek out the wick, so be careful.Anyway these things are classy and I recommend them
