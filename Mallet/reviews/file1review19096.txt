review/text: I tested with these strips beginning 7DPO, as the instructions said. I got a negative result at 7, 10, & 12DPO (that's why I love these - so cheap I don't feel guilty testing and testing!). I gave it the final test on day 31 of my cycle, since I was officially late, and got a VERY faint line. I had a leftover Clearblue Easy test, so I tested again later that day, and got a no-doubt positive. So the verdict is - you can't test as early as the website suggests, and the positive line may be quite faint. It was certainly nowhere near the darkness of the control line. But at less than a buck a pop, they work!
