review/text: I would give this a full star rating if it weren't for the fact that it was made in China. Now I have many products that are in China and I have actually bought directly from Chinese sellers...but Zippo is known for their American made products! It's kind of frustrating that they couldn't employ some Americans to make this. It is already expensive...but I would gladly pay $5 more for an American made version. The reason being I expect more from Zippo. I want more with what I pay for, I want quality. Although the design is neat, looks like it is used for what it needs to be (in all honesty it's not me that will be using it), I am upset with the fact that it is made in China. Come on Zippo, get back to the program.
