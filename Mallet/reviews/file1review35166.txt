review/text: Having been dx'd with Diabetes a few months ago,I was on the lookout for something that could satisfy my sweet tooth.I purchased a box of these bars from Glucerna,hoping for a nice surprise. I got it.They taste good. They do not taste like you are gnawing on a block of minerals.Seriously. They are really good.If you decide to try these,please be SURE to ask your doctor if it is acceptable for you to use these bars. Mine did,and I have used them ever since.I no longer have the cravings for sweets that I did before.
