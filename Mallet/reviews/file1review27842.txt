review/text: I have been experimenting with different whey proteins and this one is definitely a winner. I chose it because it had just enough sugar to make it bearable with just water and a lot of protein and barely any carbs, since I refuse to drink any of my carbs! I tasted Double Rich Chocolate, Chocolate Malt , and Mocha Cappuccino. The Double rich is NASTY even with milk! The Chocolate Malt is AMAZING no milk needed its really good with just water. The Mocha Cappuccino is okay, a little to rich with milk; okay with water; BEST with a half water/half milk mix.
