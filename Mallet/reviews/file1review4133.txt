review/text: I've been the U.S. Army for 22 years, 8 months now. Shave at least five days a week. I have never had a razar that shaved so well. I was given the Gillette Fusion before my deploymet to Afghanistan in late 2006. I've used all types of blades...single, double, triple and even dipilaties. I was able to make one razor last 20 days throughout that deployment . Did I mention that I use it to shave my head also??? Since my return at the end of 2007, I've been getting a month out of each razor on both my face and scalp. I start to get some drag after about twenty days but what razar gives you this much use that long? It seems expensive when you're paying $20+ for each package but it last eight months. You have to admit, it's money well spent.
