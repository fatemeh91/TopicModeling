review/text: I will begin this heavy-handed review by saying that there is very little objective information that can be used to rate a vitamin supplement. Nonetheless, there is an interesting phenomenon that seems to have occurred in the reviews of this product: it seems to have elicited a unilaterally positive emotional response from all reviewers. In an effort to maintain some degree of scrutiny, I have given this product 1 star. To further substantiate the purpose of my review, here are two extremely relevant objective facts to consider:*Taking a daily multivitamin is associated with 8 percent fewer cancer compared to a placebo.*Half of the nutritional supplements in this vitamin have little to no scientific evidence supporting the claim that they are beneficial for human health. There exists only speculative claims of their benefit. We can surmise that their inclusion makes this product sound fancy but also results in an inflated price when compared with other multivitamins which only include substances which are supported by a substantial body of scientific literature.
