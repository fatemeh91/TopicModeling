review/text: This sleep mask is very comfortable and would be perfect for travel, when you're sleeping in an upright position. However, there are a couple things that make this less than perfect:1. The velcro attached to the straps is thick. This creates a bump (1/8" or so) on the back of your head that makes sleeping on your back unlikely. There really isn't a good position in which to place the strap to make this more comfortable. However, sleeping on your side is perfectly comfortable.2. On my face, light leaks in on either side of the nostrils. If only there was an extra bit of fabric to gently close off that gap without putting pressure on the nostrils, this mask would be greatly improved.Both of the above cons are minimized if you are using these on a train or plane, which is probably the intended use of this mask anyway. I just wanted to point them out in case you intend to use them in bed.
