review/text: My wife bought me this for father's day. I tried it out several times in all different spots through out the day and evening and to me the whole thing seems useless. It didn't feel particularly good or help in any way, I had to put some strength into it where my physiatrist says I need to keep my shoulders and neck relaxed. It's a case of 'its the thought that counts' here but I'd never recommend this to anyone. Instead, marry someone who is willing to give you massages on a regular basis.
