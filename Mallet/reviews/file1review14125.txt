review/text: I bought my boyfriend the razor that uses these cartridges for Christmas. However, it's impossible to find the replacements near our home. At times, we've been able to find the lotion replacement cartridges, but he prefers the gel. He feels it is a closer, more comfortable shave. He has a lot of trouble finding good razors that don't irritate his sensitive skin, but he has had no troubles with this at all. The razor's heads pivot very well, and it doesn't miss a spot! I bought him a large supply of these replacements, and I know he's glad to have them.
