review/text: Bought these a few months back, and they are worthless. They seem to lose most of their charge in a week (or less). In use, they die very quickly.I have a couple older AA Duracell batteries that work just fine ... so maybe Duracell changed something. The good/older batteries are colored green/white and say "Made in Singapore". The bad/newer batteries are colored green/black and say "Made in Japan".
