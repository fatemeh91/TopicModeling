review/text: I love a product that works as it claims to. This is an example of such a product. I am now in my lower 40s and hair is starting to poke out from my nose and ears and it was starting to get a little gross. This little machine cleans it all up in a jiffy. It doesnt hurt nor does it make an obscene noise. Actually it kind of tickles a little bit. What I dont understand though is where does the little pieces of hair go after they are cut? They seem to disappear ! Seriously though, its a product that costs $15 and it works. What more can you ask for?
