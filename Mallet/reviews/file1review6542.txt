review/text: First this is made of like re enforced fiberglass injected plastic so there is no way you can break it because I tried.. I also have the regular Theracane and while I love it, the back buddy is just designed to do so much more and the little knobs are in just the right places for me and I am 5:09 tall. Pretty much the same size as the theracane so its not huge as some have said.
