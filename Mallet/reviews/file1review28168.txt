review/text: I've been using Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate whey protein but because of the great reviews I figured I'd give Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate a try. It smelled much better so I was really excited to try it. Boy, was I dissapointed! It tastes thin and not nearly as much like chocolate as the Syntrax product. It doesn't mix as well either. I now have 5 pounds of this that I use only for making homemade protein bars because it's basically not useable on its own. Seriously, try Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate, you'll LOVE it. Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate is so good, you can just mix it with water and it's great! Try mixing Optimum Nutrition with just water and try to hold back the gag. It's seriously that much of a difference. This is a classic case where smell doesn't translate to flavor at all. All of those people saying how good this stuff tastes should try Syntrax Matrix 5.0 Perfect Chocolate. Do a double-blind test, try both with just water, try mixing both, no contest.
