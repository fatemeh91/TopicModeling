review/text: Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSenseI received this monitor quite timely and actually haven't used it yet but plan on it soon. It was packed very carefully to avoid dammage and came in perfect condition. I bought this particular one because it was reviewed in Consumer Reports as one of the best monitors.
