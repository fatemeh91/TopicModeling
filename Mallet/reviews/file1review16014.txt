review/text: I've tried various ways of head shaving and can say that Headblade is the easiest and produces the best results.If you use it properly you won't complain about it. When I started using it I made the rookie mistake of going front to back and that left the hair on the sides not shaved very well. Like some I thought that maybe Headblade just couldn't cut my hair very well. Instead of giving up I decided to try a different technique. I decided to ignore the videos telling me they were the definitive way to shave. The definitive way to shave is to go with the grain then come back against it. For me with the gain is to start at the top of my head and go down towards my ear. My method might work for you, it might not. Run your hand across your head and pay attention to which way creates the most resistance.So to recap:* When you shave the right way Headblade is top notch.* The right way to shave is with the grain then against it.* There's a reason you don't apply pressure when shaving.
