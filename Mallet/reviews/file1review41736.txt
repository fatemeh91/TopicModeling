review/text: I am very happy with my new Braun Triumph 9400 Power Professional Care Toothbrush. It is quality, good looking, works perfectly. The price was very good. I like how it times out 4 quadrants of your teeth and lets you know when to move to another part of your teeth and lets you know when 2 minutes are done. I love the optional types of brushes and the different speeds. It is everything it says it is.Thank you. Tim
