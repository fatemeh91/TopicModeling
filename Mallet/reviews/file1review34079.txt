review/text: I had my gallbladder removed back in April of 2011, and that initially seemed to fix all of my digestive issues. However, I ended up getting pregnant pretty quick after that, and since pregnancy slows the digestive system down, I don't think my body was fully able to adjust to having no gallbladder the way it needed to. I was fine through my pregnancy, but once I had my son, my digestive system became a wreck. Initially I went through extreme phases of not being able to keep anything in me, to not being able to get anything out. It was horrible and sometimes the time between phases was mere hours!! I tried taking bile salt supplements and they didn't really do the trick. They very rarely helped. Then, to top things off, my stomach started bloating up with every little thing I ate or drank, and boy do I mean even the smallest drink of something (juice, water, milk, etc). So I started doing more research on supplements for people without gallbladders and came across these. They've worked pretty darn well! I can't say they're perfect, because they don't always do a lasting effect (ie-they help immediately after a meal, but then within an hour or two I feel miserable again), but I'm going to see a doc in a week to see if I might need to up the dose or something. I was initially taking them before each meal as directed, but I've found that it's much more effective to take them, if needed, after or near the end of my meal, if I feel like I'm bloating up. They work almost instantly for me. Again, they still don't achieve optimal results, but until I can get to my appt. and possibly figure out what else is causing havoc with my stomach, they definitely make my life much more tolerable!
