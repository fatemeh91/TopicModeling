review/text: I owned a breathalyzer in the past, and the worst part was periodically having to mail it in to the manufacturer for calibration service. I really like that the Prestige uses the replaceable sensors, so I can just swap them out when it comes time (The test counter is good for letting me know when). All my tests have been really accurate for me, as long as I wait 20 minutes after drinking, like it says in the manual. I don't know about comparing it to police breathalyzers either, I think they cost ten times as much.
