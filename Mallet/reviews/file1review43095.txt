review/text: After reading the reviews on Amazon, I followed others' advice and ordered the prenatal cradle in a medium even though I could fit (according to sizing instructions) into the small. I am 5'3", pre-pregnancy I weighed 124. I also have a short torso. I am currently pregnant with twins and when I ordered the cradle I was 28 weeks along and had gained about 29 pounds putting me at the upper range for a size small.The medium arrived and I had to tighten all of the straps to their tightest setting and they still weren't tight enough to fit me. The cradle strap (under belly part) itself was also too big on it's tightest setting. I felt zero support as a result of wearing this device. Although, that I can attribute to my improper sizing order. It took about two weeks for this product to arrive, so returning it and waiting for a smaller size didn't seem like the best option for me.Additionally, the criss-cross straps in the front were cumbersome and uncomfortable (even as loose as they were). I don't think I would have enjoyed wearing this at all. I went to Babies R Us and tried the Especially for Mom Maternity Support Band and found that to offer little support or relief as well. I've since returned both products and I am just focusing on staying off my feet as much as possible and that seems to be helping.
