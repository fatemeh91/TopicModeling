review/text: We've got a couple seats, this is by far the best. It fits any size/shape toilet seat!!!!!!! It works wonderful with the Bjorn stool, my little guy is able to get up on the potty by himself and sit comfortable while reading his potty books while trying to be potty trained (2years). Must have.
