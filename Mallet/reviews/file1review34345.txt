review/text: I Seldom write a review on amazon, but I felt compelled to do so for this product. Krill oil has been a great aid to lowering my cholesterol, its tasteless to me and it goes down easy (and stays down, unlike fish oil for me). However, The shipments I receive from this supplier when I open them, they have a strong smell of fish. Its likely that in the shipping process over regular mail the heat is causing the pills to stench up. The local pharmacy has these exact same ones, without any smell! I asked the pharmacist and he agreed that its likely the heat is affecting these pills. overall great price, great product, just cant stand the smell of heated krill oil!
