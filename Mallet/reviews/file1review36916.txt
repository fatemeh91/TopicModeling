review/text: When I tried this Glide floss I was somewhat skeptical about the differences between flosses. But when I first tried it I will say I was astonished and surprised. This floss -- I kid you not -- was much less waxy than Johnson & Johnson floss but yet was very easy to glide right between my teeth. The waxier one did not go on as smoothly. My three teens have braces and tried this product, and they will also be using it.
