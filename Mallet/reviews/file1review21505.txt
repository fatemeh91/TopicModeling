review/text: I was excited to find these on subscribe and save and the price was very reasonable in comparison to retail. The brush itself is a different size and shape than the smaller round heads I presently use, so that was another reason I was looking forward to using these. The cut out shape in the stem of the brush attachment is entirely different than that of the brush I have on there now, and so it does not snap onto the brush handle at all. I don't know if Oral B/Braun has changed the brush design since other reviewers' comments, so just beware that this refill will likely NOT fit your vitality sonic. Bummed :(
