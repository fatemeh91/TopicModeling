review/text: So this lighter arrived a day early which is a very good start. I opened up the box and got the lighter. You will notice there is a sticker on the side which prohibits the lighter from being opened, if you remove you will find a sticky residue, now don't worry it comes of with alcohol ( not Jack Daniels ) easily. it looks used which is part of the Street Chrome model. Its hinge was a little loose but I didn't mind, the warranty will cover it. It is such a great little lighter and I highly recommend it!
