review/text: Ok, so this protein powder is too good to be true...Check it out:-Mixes easily-Very thin, no thick and chunky parts-Taste - Godlike?I have decimated a 2lb in less than 10 days and I've already chugged about 3/4 of a 5lb tub. Been around the block, tried a whole ton of products, wasted a good load of money but the end result is Dymatize Mocha...You will be amazed.-2 scoops, 10oz water, ice cubes = heavenEven adding pure oatmeal into the mix taste amazing!!!If you're still reading, you are missing out.
