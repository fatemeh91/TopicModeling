review/text: I'm pregnant with twins and have been getting a lot of back pain and abdominal strain which I know will just keep getting more pronounced as I get bigger so I have been looking for a support garment. I borrowed one of the single-strap type supports you can get at Motherhood and I found that to be really uncomfortable - it was uncomfortable while I was sitting down, it didn't stay in place very well and rather than help with the pressure on my bladder, it made it feel worse. Clearly I needed something better.I ordered this prenatal cradle and had a lot of relief immediately. It has seriously improved my lower and upper back pain and abdominal strain. I find it easier to lift and carry things and just getting up off the couch is easier.The "adjustablility" of this model was one of the reasons I bought it and I have to say, its nothing to write home about (3 sets of hooks that are pretty widely spaced) but better than nothing. The company says this will fit 150 - 220 lbs. I am 156 lbs and found I have to wear it on the middle set of hooks to avoid uncomfortable compression but maybe thats just how I'm carrying.All in all, I would say if you are getting big and don't have super-strong core muscles, this support can really help improve your pregnancy experience. I wish I hadn't waited to buy this - get it before you HAVE to have it and save yourself some pain.
