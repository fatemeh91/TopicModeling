review/text: I've had several of these over the years. Best tweezers in the world. Except for the last ones I got -- just as somebody else said, these only met at the tip, not down the rest of the slant. Cheap tweezers from the drug store would have been as good. I returned them, but had to remind the seller to refund my money, since it hadn't appeared after a few weeks. Not a happy experience.
