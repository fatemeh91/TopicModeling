review/text: I used this for so many things other than just the typical soreness from nursing. Even now that my son is 16 months old, I still use it for his (and even mine) light abrasions or cuts. It almost acts like Neosporin and cuts the healing time. But when I used this while nursing, I noticed that sometimes my son would initially refuse to latch. Then I caught on that it was the lanolin. Once I learned to remove it before feeding, I never had a problem with him refusing.
