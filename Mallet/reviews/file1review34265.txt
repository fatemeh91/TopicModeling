review/text: Best product I have used for hemorrhoids yet, BUT the smell is intense. It's &#34;spicy&#34;, and it lingers with you, and it hard to wash away.I recommend using this when your hemorrhoids are really flaring up.Its a small tube, but I don't recommend it for &#34;on the go&#34; use because of the scent and the hard to wash away factors.
