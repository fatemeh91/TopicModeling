review/text: Bought this because of the features and the price. I got what I paid for. Battery life has been miserably short since I purchased it in July of 2011. Even after being fully charged, I am lucky if I can trim my mustache and goatee before it dies on me. And of course, you all know how painful THAT can be! The battery life wouldn't have been an issue if it had some type of override, that would allow me to run it straight off the AC outlet. Guess I got a "lemon" based on all the positive reviews, but it will be hard to return as all the packaging was recycled some time ago. When I replace it, I will be looking for a better charging system, maybe a rechargeable lithium ion battery would be better. Or, I'll just find a model that plugs into the outlet, tho that limits portability. Will be somewhat leery of buying a Remington now...
