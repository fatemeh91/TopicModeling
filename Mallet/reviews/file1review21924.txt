review/text: So I ordered a supply of bountiful breast off of their website. To put it simply I did see minimal growth after 2 months. My breasts were fuller feeling but there were no mind blowing results. I didn't really follow the protein shake regimen regularly (only here and there). I would have continued taking it (because they recommend at least 3 months of it to see visible results) but I could not continue. My ovaries and uterus started killing me, so much so I went to the hospital. It must've been because of the excess of hormones in my body (I was also using a birth control pill at the time). It's too bad too because the pills are so expensive so I ended up blowing a ton of money. I don't think I'm going to buy any enhancement products of any kind anymore...
