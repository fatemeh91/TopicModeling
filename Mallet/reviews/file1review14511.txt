review/text: My currently pregnant wife, who is suffering quite badly with "morning sickness", has received much help from these pops. They actually seem to be effective, though I've no idea how!Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because she is thoroughly displeased with some of the flavors.I just ordered more for her, but with specific flavors.
