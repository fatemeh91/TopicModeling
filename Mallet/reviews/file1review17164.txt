review/text: If youre looking for a trimmer that adjusts to your mood, this one is perfect. With 9 different adjustment notches picking the right length for your hair is a snap. Feel like Gabby Hays, let it grow long and trim with a number 9. Feel like a jarhead fresh out? select down to a 2 or 3 and get a nice even stubble.Powerful (enough) motor, takes about 3 minutes to get a good job and it saves you telling the barber and wondering what youll look like when shes done. Strongly recommended!
