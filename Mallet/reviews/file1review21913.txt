review/text: Back when I ordered this, I had sprained my knee pretty badly. I needed to stabilise it to see if it'd heal on its own, or whether I'd need a doctor. There was nothing at the pharmacy that fit. This product was comfortable, sturdy, and easy to use and to keep clean. I would say that at the time I was right in the middle of the range of fit for it - 5'10", 340 lbs, mostly on thighs and hips.Postscript - the knee healed nicely, and I no longer weigh anything NEAR 340+ lbs. I included my then-weight in order to be helpful to others in deciding whether this product might fit. Truth of the matter, if this hadn't done its job, I might not have healed as well, and might not have been able to drop the weight.
