review/text: As do most women, i sometimes have to remove blood stains from clothes. This is the best product i've ever used for that purpose. I can't even tell where stain is after its washed. Of course i don't wait for days for the blood to set in the cloth, but if it's washed the day it's stained, it works beautifully. I haven't really used it for any other types of stains though, so i wouldn't know about how it works on other things.As for the other reviews, i'm sorry it didn't work out for you, but i believe the majority of people who found this product works great don't take the time to review it. I'm just procrastinating doing homework, and felt like telling peoples how impressed i am :)
