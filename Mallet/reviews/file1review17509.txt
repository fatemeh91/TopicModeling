review/text: Let me start off by saying that the product worked fine the first couple of days. I was very pleased with it. However, after 2 weeks it started having some problems with the battery. Somehow the trimmer kept turning off whenever I put it at a specific angle against my face. I recharged the battery many times but nothing fixed it. The machine turned off at some positions and at others it worked fine. I tried to take it apart to see if it was a problem with the battery but the screws were of the worst quality. They immediately lost all grip and I found myself with no other choice but to buy another trimmer. I have read many good reviews about this product but in my particular opinion I had very bad experience with it. Hope it helps any of you who are about to buy this product.
