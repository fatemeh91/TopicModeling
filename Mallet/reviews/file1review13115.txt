review/text: I needed something hot to wrap around my neck that will stay one. This one sounded good because it is a collar and has a part that goes down the back. I am instructed to use moist heat, so I use the one I have, which is rectangular, with a wet towel inside the pouch. This one came with a warning in BIG letters. DO NOT GET IT MOIST OR WET. What? Apparently, if you get it wet, the gel swells up and is no good. Plus, I am an average size 5'4" woman, and it is too big, I can hardly fasten it. It is going back to Amazon.
