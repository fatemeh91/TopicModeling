review/text: My mom used to try and get me to drink this stuff! I finally gave in....3 years later...purchased it on my own at my local Co-op. The taste isn't bad!! I put a packet of stevia in and just drink it... and I know I'm getting great benefits. So happy about this product except I wish the price was lower.
