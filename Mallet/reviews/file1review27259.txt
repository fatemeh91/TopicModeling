review/text: I've been using this protein for the past 6 months now, and it is one of my favorite out there. The price at Amazon is the cheapest thus far and the quality of the protein is great! I have tried countless brands or types of pro tine out in the market, but non have had such a great taste with only using water as this. I've gained approximately 20 pounds of muscle mass from only taking this protein, some creatine, and lifting weights 4 days a week for the past 6 months. The fact this pro tine comes with 71 serving is amazing for the price. Don't get all caught up in all the hype over the latest and greatest by salesmen out at your local stores or online. Stick with what has worked for others and most of all, what works for you. Here is a quick breakdown...Pros:-Taste-Ease of use (water to keep the calories down)-Price-Amount of servings you get-Results!!Cons:-Other flavors may not be as good such as "Natural Strawberry"-Large tub to carry around-Having the same flavor over and over gets a little old after 6 months-Making sure you have a reserve tub before you run out = )Not too much of cons if you ask me. I'll try the cookies and cream next to see how the taste is. Try the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor, you won't regret it. Best of all, it is very light and goes down easy. Hope this helps!!
