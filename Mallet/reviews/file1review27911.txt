review/text: For all you buff, rough, and tuff athletes out there, this is an excellent source of protein to get you boosted up for your game! Need a little extra edge? This protein supplement comes in double rich chocolate, chocolate mint, pina colada, strawberry and vanilla so your taste buds will be singing just like your results! I know, I use this stuff and I think it's really improved my endurance for both my tennis game and my three times a week five mile jogs.
