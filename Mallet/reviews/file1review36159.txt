review/text: I love this brush attachment for the Black & Decker Scrubbing Brush as it does a terrific job of scrubbing out the interior of glasses or coffee cups. To help clean things out, I add just a drop or two of dish washing soap, a smidge of water, and then I use the brush attachment. My glassware and coffee cups are cleaned up quickly using this nifty tool.Highly recommend.
