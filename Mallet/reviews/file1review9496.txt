review/text: Ascriptin is the best aspirin I have ever used, and it was my dog's vet that introduced me to it!! Manufacturer is backlogged currently, and product not available in stores. Don't quite understand the pricing because it's much, much less expensive in stores. Don't get it. Are we buying something that's becoming obsolete?? OUCH!!Ascriptin Maximum Strength Pain Reliever-85 ct.
