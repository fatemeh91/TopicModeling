review/text: this is hands down the absolute worst psyllium husk product I have ever bought. Okay, I know it is supposed to thicken, but it was so god-awful lumpy even after stirring it forever I found it nearly impossible to get down and keep down. Never again. It ended up in the trash and I bought some Yerba Prima instead. On the plus side, Amazon did give me a full refund when I requested to return it.
