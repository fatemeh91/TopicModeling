review/text: It sure does clear you out. I'm not sure how much of a detox it is, but it sure does do its job of clearing you out, in a good, healthy way. I felt great on them, just needed the bathroom a little more often. Just beware, you better be ok with your roommates, bf/gf whoever is in ear shot in the morning hearing you, or have sound proof walls, or run the shower/sink, anything, you'll need it:)
