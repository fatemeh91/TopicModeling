review/text: This wrap is very soft and takes heat very well in the microwave without the seed filling burning and smelling awful. I used this wrap heated 4 times with no problem, however the 5th time it came apart and seeds went everywhere. I have never had a wrap do that. It appears to just be glued together instead of sewn.
