review/text: Works fine for picking up debris off wood floors and flat carpets (not thick ones), and also a surprising amount of pet hair off the Man Cave rug. Remember this product has no motor or suction; simply brushes that turn as you push and pull it back and forth across the floor. Don't expect a top-of-the-line vacuum cleaner cleaning! Easy to use and easy to empty, just takes a little elbow grease.
