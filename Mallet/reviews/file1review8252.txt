review/text: I bought this just for cleaning theCamelBak BPA-Free Better Bottle with Bite Valveworks like a charm cheaper than Camelbak brushes only $4.99. The bristles are blue/soft & white/softer cleans but does not scratch I feel like it will last 1-2 years with light to medium use. Plus I can use it on other jars,bottles,containers I have around the house.
