review/text: I liked the scent of the product. I thought it had a very natural scent and it wasn't overpowering. I wasn't very fond of the roll on feature. I thought it was a little too awkward. I also didn't like the fact that it left a white residue. I live in Texas so I tend to wear tank tops and having the white on my underarm isn't very pleasant. Overall, I think it's a good product. I would definitely wear it during the winter when my underarms won't be seen but I wouldn't recommend it for the summertime.
