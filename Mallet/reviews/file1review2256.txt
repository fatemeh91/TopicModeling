review/text: Mach3 does a fine shaving job, and it's better than the cheap razors you find at the supermarket. They're durable (although not as much as I'd like). I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges, and that the 4 blades were overkill (let's wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works)Also with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, they arrive at my door with discount and I never run out of them. Nice!
