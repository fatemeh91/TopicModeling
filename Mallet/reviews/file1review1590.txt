review/text: We were advised by my son's dermatologist to try this product. It's easy to use and works great! We followed our doctor's instructions to the letter and after two weeks, some of the smaller warts are GONE and we're making great progress on the big ones. I was worried that it might hurt since he'd complained of stinging with the liquid and we were switching to something stronger but there is no pain at all. Compared to the 12 weeks we tried with a messy liquid product, lots of complaining, and very little success, this stuff is absolutely the way to go!I did find it odd that I stopped at three different pharmacies on the way home from our appointment and nobody had heard of a Wart Stick but it was easy to find on Amazon.
