review/text: Prevention is by far the best cure. This supplement is a gem and worth its weight in gold in my opinion. There's only a smell of garlic when you first open a packet to take a pill but once you ingest it there is no odor or aftertaste. You will not be burping up garlic or have garlic breath while using it. It's one pill a day and you don't really feel any different while taking it but it definitely is doing its job internally. My blood pressure used to consistently be in the 120-130/83-87 range so normal, but after a month of taking this supplement, about 30 pills my blood pressure lowered to the 96-110/69-74 range and has been this way consistently for over a year now. Missing a day or two should not alter the supplements effectiveness, however taking more than 2 pills a day can cause huge drops in blood pressure if it's usually or in the normal range of the 120s/80s. It's also a bit of a blood thinner too so you may notice cuts taking a bit more seconds to heal if you've been taking these pills for awhile but it does not lead to any type of spontaneous bleeding, if anything the nutrients in garlic actually act as a protective barrier for your digestive system, which is why garlic itself is so highly touted as being effective in the prevention of colon cancer. I've got my entire family taking this stuff now cause it works. My father who is in his 70s and on blood pressure medication has added these to his diet too and his pressure does not go over 135/82 now, whereas when he was only taking the blood pressure medication alone sometimes his pressure would be unstable and end up in the 158/108 range. I can't say if it does anything for cholesterol levels but as an anti-hypertensive this is a must and there are no real drawbacks to using it.
