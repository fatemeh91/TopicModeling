review/text: Just got this a day ago. So far so good, but a word of advice: NEVER MIX WITH HOT WATER!!! And by hot I mean boiling or close to boiling temperature. Instead of dissolving, it congeals and forms chunks of flotsam that have a meat-like texture. Needless to say you don't want to eat that. But lukewarm water seems to work fine. I don't know if all whey powder behaves like this, but in either case I won't do that again.
