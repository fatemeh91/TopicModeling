review/text: This is the best protein i've used by far. For those of you who don't know, Optimum Nutrition makes and packages all their supplements in their own factories as opposed to many other brands... which is one of the reasons they can put out such a high quality product.. tastes AMAZING (french vanilla creme is where its at) and completely dissolves in whatever you mix it with and goes down smooth. I'm no expert, but imo you can't go wrong with ON products.
