review/text: Love this cafe mocha! On a scale of 1 to 10, I will give it a 9. I use 2 TBSP of this whey protein in a blender with 6 oz of milk and 2 TBSP of a drink mix powder from Hills brothers called double mocha. I add a handful of ice and blend until really creamy. My kids and I love these "icy mochas".......and they are healthy...not like the one's at paneras or McDonalds. Can't say the same about my FIRST flavor,"Rich Chocolate". I have a trainer that loves this protein brand, so I thought I would give it a try. (I love chocolate and I thought it would be my safest bet.) I thought the flavor of rich chocolate was dreadful. Many times I felt like I had to choke it down. I was determined not to throw it away and get through my 5 lb container! I don't know why, but I decided to give another flavor a try....but in a 2 lb size. To my suprise, the mocha is really good. Now I am encourage to try another flavor. What is another good flavor to try?
