review/text: It truly is a great value. You might pay more for a dark glass bottle, which would be great to store oils in, but you could also avoid light ruining your oil by storing it in a dark place. The fact that this is organic, I love. I am the type of person that doesn't care so much anymore what I spend - I rather buy organic, buy less, and enjoy ten times more. I didn't receive this myself, but the person I sent it to as a gift absolutely loved it. WOO hoo! It's perfect for so many things - simple light moisturizing, it's a great massage oil you can blend with essential oils, it's great for lotion bases, so yeah.
