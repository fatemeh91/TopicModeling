review/text: A freind Of mine gave this to me as a gift, I don't know if he was trying to tell me something, or just trying to be nice. I hope it's the latter. I wear dark clothes occasionally plus a black suit and dark blazers for more formal occasions. Seems it's nearly imposable to keep lint and my Kitty's hair off of them.In the past I used one of those sticky rollers to remove lint and cat hair. It worked OK but not great, There always seemed to be something left and consequently I had to go over and over it again. It just seemed to be a hastle after a while.Now when I use the Magik Brush, it gets nearly everything off my clothes and furniture in short order. No it's not 100% perfect, but so much better than the sticky stuff. Occasionally you have to go over a stubborn piece of lint or hair, but nowhere near as often as with the sticky tape.Cleaning it is easy, just push everything in the opposite direction. I guess there are different methods of cleaning it but I use a piece of cloth with a slightly raised pattern, and slightly rough to swipe it across. This seems to work well for me.They have this same brush with two working sides on itEvercare Company 2300 "Magik" Brush with Two Surfaceswhich I purchased recently. Two sides for nearly the price of one, sounded good to me. Now I can take this one with me when I travel. And leave the two sided one home.Both of them are very nice inexpensive products that work well.
