review/text: I've been using EPO on the advice of Court Street Midwives, Plymouth, MA, the BEST OB-GYN care I've ever had, since they guessed I might be peri-menipausal. They said whether or not, it was strongly recommended taking these twice a day indefinitely in lieu of taking hormones which have always been bad for me and chances they are bad for you too. My body is in GREAT shape, I look younger than ever, feel good and have no post symptoms of "the change" or side effects. Remember this is an all natural alternative. Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy these and be diligent to them everyday - you'll look and feel GREAT for it! (Start with 500 mg and ease up to 1300 - don't miss any!! Take with Vitamin ACE & D per doctor's orders AND Omega 3-6-9).
