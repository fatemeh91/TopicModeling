review/text: I recently started having to take 10 pills a day, split between AM and PM... and I tried numerous other options to keeping things organized. This is absolutely the BEST pill organizer that I've found. It allows me to get everything organized on Sundays for the entire week, and each morning I just pop one in my purse and go. My pills are of varying size, but I do have 4 larger ones, and there's plenty of room for more even! Plus, they always stay closed in my purse. I am so glad I found this!!
