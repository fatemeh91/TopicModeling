review/text: I don't have my own testing lab, of course, but I bought this on the strength of some Consumer Labs testing showing that it's one of the brands known to contain the advertised active ingredient--quite a lot of it, in fact. ...and some of the other brands tested had bonus lead added to the supplement. I hadn't realized that was an option...
