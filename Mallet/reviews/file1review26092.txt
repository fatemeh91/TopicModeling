review/text: Having gone through about 50 of these chewing sticks, I want to offer my thoughts on them. They are, as many reviews state, very strong. If you tend to chew toothpicks into oblivion, they are uncomfortable to have in your mouth. The menthol creates an unpleasant sensation, and in conjunction with the wood will chap your lips painfully. I spent my first week with these picks prepared to write an unfavorable review. I then, for some reason, decided to simple try holding it in my mouth without chewing excessively. The menthol became a non-issue, I actually found it pleasant, and the chapping of my lips stopped. I have also found that simply holding the picks in my mouth is just as effective at satisfying my oral fixation as chewing on them are. A good product.
