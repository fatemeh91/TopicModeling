review/text: This pad works just like it says. My son has night time potty problems and has used it for 2 yrs and it works great since its large enough not to get bunched up when he rolls around at night and it stays put better then the other one i have. This one has a rubber/plastic bottom side to help keep it in place and to keep the bed dry underneath. Its also easy to take off and wash and you don't have to change the entire bed. Worth the buy.
