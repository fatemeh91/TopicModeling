review/text: the yoga mat is nice. it feel good when i lay on it to do my abs work out. this is my first yoga mat. i have not use the block yet but they feel good. the only this i dont like about this yoga kit is the cheap bag that come with it. it seem if i put the mat and the block in the bag it will rip. its not bad for what i had to pay for it.
