review/text: The Slim Fast Optima is amazing and definitely gives you the protein and nutrients needed. For me it definitely does what it says and curbs my hunger for about 4 hours. I had been using them in the cans and found it a little pricey and bulky to store. I use them for breakfast and lunch and they work great.This powder mix is a great deal. 14 shakes can be made from each canister and you get 3 canisters here. What a great deal. Also, you have many different options on how to make the shakes. You can just stir the powder with nonfat milk. This will do the trick but it feels like you are drinking just a small amount. The carton comes with directions on how to make thicker shakes with milk, ice and a blender plus recipes to add fruit for a tasty treat. Following these options I think they are much better than the cans. More flexibility.Also it is very important that you have to want to loose weight. You need to make sure you eat adequate meals along with the shakes and that you eat healty. Be aware of how you are eating and the addition of the Slim Fast Optima shakes will certainly help you reach your goal and loose weight while living healthy. I find that by having them replace 2 meals each day when I do eat my stomach is smaller and I don't want to eat portions as big as I used to.I highly recommed this item. Good luck!
