review/text: Coenzyme Q10 (often abbreviated as CoQ10) is essential for human life. It catalyzes the formation and utilization of energy in every human cell. Fortunately, our bodies manufacture CoQ10. Unfortunately, some people do not manufacture enough CoQ10 to keep them healthy, especially as they grow older. Research has shown that deficiency of CoQ10 is the major cause of cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and other heart diseases and these diseases can often be cured by CoQ10 supplements such as this. In fact -- astonishing as this may seem -- many heart transplant candidates have no longer needed a heart transplant after appropriate supplementation with CoQ10. Now it has been found that CoQ10 supplements can often prevent -- and, sometimes, even cure -- a number of other diseases including some cases of cancer.Those interested in learning more about CoQ10 may wish to buy and read the excellent book The Coenzyme Q10 Phenomenon by Dr. Stephen Sinatra, a board-certified cardiologist, which is available from Amazon.
