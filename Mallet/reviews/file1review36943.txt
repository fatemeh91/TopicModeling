review/text: This is my second favorite floss...i really like that the added mint give a nice *toothpaste* feel. It's great to use after a meal when you not going to brush so I tend to carry this around with me in my my make-up bag. I also like that the floss is woven and not the *tape floss*. I find that the woven kind is easier to use and works better, for me, than the tape.
