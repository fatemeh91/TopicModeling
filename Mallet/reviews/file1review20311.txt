review/text: A friend recommended I register for these although she knew I was planning to use disposable diapers. I accidentally registered for the diapers with the absorbent centerfold, and fortunately, received these. They are large - 27&quot;x 27&quot; square and are essential for baby care. I still use them every day and my son is almost a year old. I used them to line his cradle and changing-table when he was first born and going through many diapers a day. They work great as burp cloths, and are superb for wiping up other food messes. Additionally, I found they work as a light blanket during the summer months. Extremely durable, fold-up rather small for travel, and launder well. 101 uses, I love them!
