review/text: ......i was having trouble with my breath in the mornings.......my dentist gave me one of these scrappers.......it works wonderfully........better than brushing the tongue or some of the other scrappers that are stiff and have smooth edges..........this strip has a 'rough' side (which i like and use).......and a softer side..........it is easy to pack and i ordered more to put in our trailer and one in my overnight case so i won't have to remember one more thing when i travel........they are not expensive.......and when combined with brushing and flossing can keep your mouth very fresh.......
