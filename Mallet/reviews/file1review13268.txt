review/text: We purchased this item for a family member who must spend long periods of time in bed. These help to keep her linens clean. It is also large enough and strong enough to use as as draw sheet for repositioning the person. I had purchased a similar product earlier this year, but these are much larger and better meet our needs. I would highly recommend this product in this size.
