review/text: I am a professional athlete and I use this back buddy all the time. I can't just get a massage every day of the week, so I purchased this recently remembering when I saw one of my buddies using it a few years ago. It is great and a sturdy product. I have been very pleased and would recommend to anyone with upper back knots frequently. Also very durable as well. I am 275lbs and I really come down hard on this back buddy and it withstands the test.
