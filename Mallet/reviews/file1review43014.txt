review/text: I do like this detergent and I use it for most of our clothing items. However, it has optical brighteners that pose a problem for our cloth diapers. On the cloth diapers we are using a detergent by a little company named "Country Save" (also available on amazon.com) HE powdered detergent. Eventually we will probably switch all of our clothing to Country Save because of the cost savings and convenience of using just one detergent.
