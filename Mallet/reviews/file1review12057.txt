review/text: I don't have much to say about the nutritional content of these vitamins, but I will say that they're quite large. Also if I take them without food, I vomit. Obviously the answer is to take them with food, but I wish they didn't make me so sick. If you have a very sensitive stomach, you might want to try something else.On the plus side, the 150 tablet bottle is a great deal.
