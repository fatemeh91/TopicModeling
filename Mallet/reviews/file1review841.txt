review/text: The product (if it is the same exact one) has Flaxseed meal, defatted chia bran, orange pulp and peel, gum arabic and inulin-FOS. No wheat, no gluten, no soybeans, no dairy, no egg, no fish/shellfish, no peanuts/tree nuts.The products works quickly and effectively. It calls for two (2) tablespoons. I took barely ONE tablespoon and it worked within a few hours. The Flaxseed meal releases oils, the defatted chia bran is a fairly aggressive fiber, but the orange pulp and peel, full of natural anti-oxidants and bioflavoids is a key ingredient. Orange pulp is a digestive stimulant and encourages and increased the soft muscle contractions of the intestines, thus encouraging the forward movement of the bowel content. Orange pulp and peel is used in chinese medicine for the same thing - increasing digestion among other things.The taste is slightly strong (slightly bitter due to the orange peel) and it is a lot easier to get down than psyllium. It doesn't stick to your throat.
