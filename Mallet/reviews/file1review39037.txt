review/text: Do yourself and your family a favor - stop paying upwards of $30 a shot for your husband's haircut! This wonderful system will pay for itself after its first use, and can be used ad infinitum with little maintenance.We bought this terrific little clipper kit over a year ago and haven't looked back. My husband always had had longish hair before then, but now prefers his trimmer look. We keep it about 3/4 inch on the sides and 1" on top with it longer in the front to hide his hairline. We didn't even need the DVD to show us how to do that! It's pretty obvious how to use the tools. Okay, I admit it, after the first "mistake" of trimming him to 1/4 inch all over, we learned our lesson, but hey, hair grows back!The right and left ear pieces didn't really work for us, but maybe you can figure them out. For us, they kind of give a ridged look. The scissors and other tools are wonderful, though. It's a very complete set and you won't have to add to it at all in the future. I even use the scissors to trim my daughter's hair. We keep hers shoulder length, but it's important to have good barber's shears for cutting hair.Overall, I give this clipper set highest ratings.
