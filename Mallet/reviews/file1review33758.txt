review/text: i had really bad foot pain due to the flat soled shoes i have been using for years now. the item comes with light,medium, and firm support inserts for the orthotics thou i felt that anything other then firm was not enough.i have never tried Orthotics before so i did not know what to expect when i put them in my shoes. they fit snugly in my size 13 shoe and when i tried them out for an 8 hour shift at work it felt like i had only worked 4 of those 8 hours... usually my feet are killing my but the time im done.thank you Dr Scholl's for a GREAT product!
