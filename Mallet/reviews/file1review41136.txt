review/text: I have been using Zoe's Peanut Butter Paradise bars for several years now and they are the only bar I eat. I grab one in the morning if I don;t have time for breakfast, I take one on bike rides for energy, and I take some when I travel on the plane as an alternative to pretzels or some other snack. My 6 year old grandson loves them; the first thing he asks when we come to visit is if he can have one of my bars. I am delighted to give him one since I don't think he eats a very healthy diet and I think I am providing him with omega 3's which he doesn't get elsewhere. I also like Zoe's bars for health reasons. I suffer from constipation and Zoe's bars helps with that.Unfortunately, it appears that Zoe's is phasing out this bar and introducing one that is coated with chocolate. I am very unhappy about that--I won't be as happy myself with the extra sugar and I won't be as pleased with giving them to my grandson. Please tell me that they are not being phased out! I don't know what I'll do without my favorite bars.
