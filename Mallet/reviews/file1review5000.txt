review/text: I bought these to care for the lenses for my new camera but in just a few days time I already have discovered that they are also great with sunglasses/eyeglasses, small mirrors, and my computer screen. Yes, as everyone says, they dry out quickly but with a box of 200 opening a second wipe is not exactly going to ruin my day. The title says it all - spotless!Highly recommended!
