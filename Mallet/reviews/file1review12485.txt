review/text: From my research and personal testing, I have no doubt that these capsules contain the same product as PoopDoc (easy to search online). This version is in vegicaps, whereas poopdoc uses regular gelatin capsules. I know this product well and have been using it on and off for years. I am one of those people living with chronic constipation. Fiber, lots of fruits and veggies, exercise, water intake, are all part of my life (and have been for years), and still, my digestion tends to be sluggish with dense, heavy, sticky stool. Unless I have a stomach flu or have food poisoning, I would never have loose stools. This product was made for people like me. The product serves 2 functions. First, it dissolves years of crud buildup on digestive tract walls. Second, it softens and loosens the stool coming through your system, so that if it would normally be like play-dough, it will now have 'normal' and health consistency and action.When used by people with 'normal' digestions, whose colon is not packed with dense buildup or, at least, a heavy meal camped out in the colon, this product is simply overkill. To my knowledge, people whose digestive systems are not as described above, are likely to experience gas, bloating and unpleasantly scant loose stools with this product. For those people, I would highly recommend Acai Easy Cleanse (10 day supply per bottle). After using oxy-powder for years, I no longer have buildup, and can use oxy-powder only when I have at least a day's worth of packed colon weighing me down. Otherwise, Acai Easy Cleanse is the product I trust to keep my digestion in healthy flow.Hope someone out there finds this helpful.
