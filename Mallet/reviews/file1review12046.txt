review/text: I've tried a number of vitamin, but this one is by far the best! I take it at night, right before bed and have no adverse reactions in doing so. Other vitamins, you'd be amped up for hours taking it right before bed. Ive used these vitamins for both of my pregnancies, last one was twins, and everything was perfect. I felt very confident I was giving my babies the best and continue to do so, as I am nursing 4 month old twins. The only potential con is that these vitamins are larger than most. Trust me though, get over the first few uncomfortable days and the payoff is worth it! You'll feel amazing...you'll feel the difference. I will continue to take these even after I'm done nursing!
