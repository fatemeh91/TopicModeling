review/text: Ensure Plus Complete Balanced Nutrition Drink, Ready to Use, Butter Pecan, 24- 8 Fluid Ounce BottlesIn 1998 I had cancer of my throat. For the radiation treatmemnt they had to remove all my teeth. The result was - no teeth and elimination of half my saliva glands. The doctors told me that 4 bottles of Ensure Plus would give my my daily requirements of calories and protiens plus 24 other vitamins and minerals. So for 10 years I have been on this diet. For the record I am 85 years old and relatively healthy. I have maintained my weight at 178 lbs. My doctors think that's great considering I'm 6'1" tall. Now thats the reason I use Ensure Plus. But, the most important is that it tastes great. They have about five flavors to appeal to any taste. They are nice and creamy. And, can substitute for food when taking medication that requires food. I have Amazon send me four cases every month on the Subscribe and Save program. This program includes shipping for free. This makes it about a dollar less per six pack than in the store - and it comes right to your door.
