review/text: Finish Powerball Tablets are easy to use, pre-measured capsule/cubes that fit into your detergent dispenser. No more spilled powder, wasting detergent. Dishes are cleaner than other powders and liquids I've tried, and also spot-free, thanks to the built in rinsing agent. The orange scent is pleasing without being overpowering.
