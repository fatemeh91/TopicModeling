review/text: That is wonderful not having to care about wetness around, when you shave. Or to do it in the bathtub. And how practical to wash with water your shaver... I own one, for the second time one after the other and I will buy again one: it is really nice to shave wet! P.S.: And no problems in tropical countries.
