review/text: I started taking these vitamins when I first found out I was pregnant (at 5 weeks). I had to discontinue use when I started to get morning sick because it only exacerbated my nausea. In the throes of morning sickness, I started taking a multivitamin suggested by my OB. When I ran out of my OB recommended prenatal vitamin I was 8 months pregnant so I started to take the Rainbow Light vitamin again. Well, the nausea was gone, but I have had the worst nightmares and the most vivid dreams ever since. I can't directly blame the vitamin, but I do not have the vivid nightmares if I forget to take my vitamin. I haven't read about anyone else having this problem and my OB thinks that it is unrelated, but I wanted to share my story. I hope you have better luck with this vitamin than I did.
