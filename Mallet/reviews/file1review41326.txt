review/text: What can I say, these must be a leftover from the cold war.The government must have exported these to China to scare the military.The damn things are not only too tight, the length is also inadequate.They must have struck fear into the poor communist solder not to fool with the big Americans.Can't say I would recommend these as the leave indentation marks on my pickle.
