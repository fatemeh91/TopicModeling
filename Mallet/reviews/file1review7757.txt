review/text: I have big hands, and I hate dishwashers (the machines, not the people; in my youth I worked as a dishwasher). This brush is a perfect size for my hand, and makes getting stuck-on food off of dishes, pots, pans, indoor grill grills, glasses, mugs, etc., much easier than scrubbing away with one of those sponges that has a regular sponge side and a rough side (I only use the kind that are safe for no-stick pans, etc.). I have used the brush vigorously on no-stick pots and pans and it does not scratch the surfaces at all. The top edge of the brush is a scraper of sorts - not a sharp-edged scraper, but useful for dislodging food that is really stuck on the surface in question.The brush works great for cleaning coffee stains from the bottoms of tall coffee cups. I recently bought a Cuisinart Griddler Junior indoor grill, which has removable grills, and the brush gets those as clean as can be and eliminates the need for me to use the plastic scraper that came with the grill.I also like that the brush extends my arm so that I don't have to bend down toward the sink when scrubbing away.I eat a bowl of spaghetti with spaghetti sauce and suddenly I feel incredibly lazy when it comes to cleaning up the dishes and cookware and so I let the dishes, etc., sit; I'm guessing this lazy spell is a carbohydrate effect. Before getting this brush, cleaning up after such a meal - after the pasta sauce has had ample time (sometimes hours) to virtually adhere to all surfaces it has been in contact with - was a real pain. With the brush (and hot soapy water and elbow grease), it's very easy.Hey, it's just a brush, but it's a good one and it's nice looking. (I checked out the selection at my local WalMart before choosing the Oxo, and saw nothing there that struck me as being comparable in price, quality, and aesthetics. I have Amazon Prime, so shipping on this item was free for me.)
