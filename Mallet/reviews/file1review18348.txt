review/text: I put this product all over both feet, followed by a pair of socks. Went to bed and next morning while showering I used a mild foot scrubber. Brand new, baby soft tootsies I could hardly believe how soft they were/are. Once a week or two is all that's needed! No gross feet &#34;grater&#34; needed ever, so throw those things away and try Dermal Therapy. Great stuff!
