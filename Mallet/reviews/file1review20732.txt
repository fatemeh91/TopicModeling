review/text: I hate to shave. I usually only shave twice a week because of the discomfort and extra time that came with using a razor and shaving cream. This Braun is the third electric razor I have bought and tried and the only one that I used for longer than a week. In short, this electric razor is great. I can shave in less than a minute and the quality of the shave is great and getting better as I get better at using the Braun and my face adjusts. I now shave everyday, weekends included. My son is just coming into the age where he is needing to shave more often. My problem is do I let him use my Braun 8585 or do I get him his own?
