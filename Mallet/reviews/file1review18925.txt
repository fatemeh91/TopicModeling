review/text: Ordered due to knee dislocation and needed a better brace than dr provided. Ordered this after research and reading reviews. The sizing in the packaging is different that on their site but it fits perfect, I say go with website. It does not breathe like the one my dr provided but with the material it is made of it wouldnt and I knew that before purchase. It will be very easy to clean so this is not an issue. I wear it at least 6+ hours a day and it is comfortable, I do give myself some breaks in there to let it air out. Would reccomend to anyone needing this type of brace.
