review/text: Had the trimmer for about 3 weeks now. Worked easily straight out of the box and has continued to work flawlessly. Big improvement over my previous older trimmer. Probably the biggest thing that stands out is the solid build quality. Has a really nice "heft" to it and just feels very solid in every way.
