review/text: By far, the Optimum Nutrition brand is the best for the price AND taste. I've tried Double Chocolate (mix with instant coffee), Vanilla (great with fruit), and my fav Cookies and Cream (eat with a 1/2 banana and you're set). Lost 35 pounds while gaining incredible upper body muscle, and I have this brand to thank. Four months later, it still doesn't get old. That's a big plus. I'm ordering anoth 5 lb tub as I type this review.
