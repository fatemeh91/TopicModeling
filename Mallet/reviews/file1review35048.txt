review/text: I was suffering anxiety and panic while on an out of town trip. I found Rescue Remedy in a health food store. Being desperate, I tried it. I sprayed a dose on my tongue and in about 10-20 minutes, I felt relief. As with all homeopathic remedies, you take a dose every 15 minutes. I about an hour, I was enjoying my vacation again. Now, I keep one in my purse, on my nightstand and I keep the pastilles on my kitchen counter. I also usually have an extra bottle to give away in case friends or family are having a bad time with anxiety. As soon as I recognize any symptoms of panic, I spray my Rescue Remedy on my tongue and very quickly find that things are back under control. This is not a product that alters your mood. You will not feel sedated or drugged. The only difference I feel after I used it is the absence of panic. I highly recommend this product! As a side note, since that time I have worked with a doctor of natural medicine to help work on my adrenal glands and nutrition which are often the cause of anxiety symptoms and have had far less incidents of panic onset.
