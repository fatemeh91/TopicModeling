review/text: This product is great tasting, refreshing, and not too ""hot,"" as my boys would say. I'd recommend it to anyone (including kids), as my kids actually liked the toothpaste! I really liked it because it had tartar control plus additives to help keep your teeth white and a great mint taste. Two thumbs up!
