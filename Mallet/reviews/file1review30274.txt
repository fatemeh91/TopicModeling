review/text: Okay, I received this vacuum about an hour ago. Everything checks out fine EXCEPT for a question on the filter. Everywhere you look (even the box and instruction manual) refers to the HVF-91 washable cloth filter, but when I opened up the filter compartment what was inside was the fluted paper cone filter which seemed identical to the VF100 paper filter used in the cordless Dustbuster! Anyone else experience this?(After I posted the above I noticed a picture of the filter on the side of the box the vacuum came in. Guess what? It's a picture of the paper VF100 filter (the one that's in the vacuum), not the recommended HVF-91 cloth filter!!! Go figure. I'm just going to make the assumption that you can use either filter.)
