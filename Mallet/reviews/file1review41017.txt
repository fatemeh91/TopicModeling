review/text: Ive been a competitive powerlifter for over 15 years and there is nothing like a Redline (for starters or novice) or Redline Extreme for people like me. Dont waste your time with added calories and all that other junk and cut to the chase with Redline Extreme. It taste good so dont think because its small you need more than one like I did the first time I had this. I was up all night and did not sleep and that was drinking at 5 pm!!!!
