review/text: Our family of 7 justt bought 1 one these tooth brushes a month ago. Now this is the second one we bought for our other bathroom. The brush is amazing and your mouth feels so clean afterwards. And now, I actually brush for 2 minutes with a digital timer built in and a vibration every 30 sec. to tell me to switch to the other quadrant of my mouth. Its worth the high price!
