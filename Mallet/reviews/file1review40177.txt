review/text: Ultrabrite toothpaste is defiantly the number one toothpaste for anyone to get. I use it everyday and I must say, this stuff really works. Lately on Consumer Reports, Ultrabrite was ranked number one for whiting, protecting, and freshening over all of the most advertised brands. Most people say that Crest is the best, but actually they are wrong. Its proven the Ultrabrite is the best toothpaste out there. I know, to you this might not matter much, but when your teeth turn yellow and you use a different toothpaste, you'd wish you would have had some Ultrabrite handy, right there and then.
