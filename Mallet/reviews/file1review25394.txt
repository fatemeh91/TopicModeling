review/text: I think I bought my first ER112BC trimmer in 1990, and sometime around last December it stopped working. Recently I replaced it through Amazon. In the interim, from Brookstone I purchased a more expensive trimmer that had very high consumer ratings. It did not perform nearly as well as the Panasonic. I read some negative reviews of the Panasonic here prior to buying another and did not understand how anyone could have anything bad to say about it, especially if the user has experience with more expensive models. I will never switch again, there is no need. The Panasonic is very effective, long-lasting, easy to clean, uses very few batteries over its life, shaves nose hairs very cleanly (the more expensive model did not shave nearly as close to the hair root nor did it reach all areas reached by the Panasonic), does not cause injuries to skin. Can't say enough good things about it.
