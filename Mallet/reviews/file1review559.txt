review/text: I got this chair a few weeks ago and I LOVE it. It really does a great job with massaging and really works out the knots in my shoulders. My friends and family have all tried it out and many are now considering their own. I thought this was a lot of money but now think it is worth EVERY penny!Update: I have now had the chair for over a year and still love it. It is very relaxing and works the kinks out of my shoulders and back very well. Anyone that comes to stay for a visit wants to go visit "the chair". I feel it is still worth the money I spent!
