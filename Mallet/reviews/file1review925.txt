review/text: I was hesitant to buy these online without being able to see/touch them, but I'm so glad I took a chance -- they are exactly what I need to get into painful areas on my back, and I even carry them with me to places like movie theaters when I know I'll be sitting for a long time and leaning back on one or both of these gives me a lot of relief. They are a good size, and exactly the right firmness. I've had physical therapists suggest using a tennis ball for the same purpose, but tennis balls have never &#34;dug in&#34; the way these balls can because of the little spikes. If you have back or foot or anywhere pain that is relieved by massage/pressure, buy these!
