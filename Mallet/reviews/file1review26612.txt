review/text: These pillows do provide good back support, BUT they seem to last only a day or two beyond Amazon's 30-day return deadline,and then they develop bad leaks which make them unusable. Kinda expensive for 30 days worth of back support!05/24/12 - The manufacturer read my review and sent me two new pillows. I took one of them on a 35-day cruise, which included a 10-hour flight, and the pillow performed flawlessly throughout that time. No leaks, and great support and comfort. I have been using the other one in my car and can report the same great results.I appreciate the chance to try them again and am delighted with results now.
