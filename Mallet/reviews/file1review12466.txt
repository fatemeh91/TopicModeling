review/text: OK - very excited to receive product as plantar fasciatis is acting up horribly again. After good reviews I decided on this product. Felt some improvement after using for about 5 to 6 days. However, on about the 7th day woke up in night to big toe on that splinted foot hurting like crazy and has been hurting ever since (2 weeks later to date). Feels like electric bolts running through it which indicates nerve pain or damage. I used the product for about 2 more nights after the toe started hurting and tried to adjust position of splint, but pain got so bad in toe that I could not sleep and I had to stop using the splint. I believe that the way the foot was held in place and the way the tight velcro band comes across the ball of the foot pressed into my big toe long enough to pinch a nerve. A strange side affect that I hope goes away. I am curious if anyone else out there has experienced the same problem?
