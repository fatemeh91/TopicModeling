review/text: This improved silk epil model is painless and really lets your skin softer. I've been using this hair removal system for many years now and I can say that in a long term, the hair quantity and tickness will decline. Shaving removes even the very thin hairs, but the problem is that the hair will start crowing faster and from the ticker part, making it more visible, the same happens with depilation products. So, for me Silk epil system is the best!
