review/text: I have suffered with neck and upper back pain for years that I attribute to my very physical job, which requires a lot of pushing and pulling of heavy equipment. I see a chiropractor and get regular massages which provides some relief, but it never lasts more than a couple of days. My massage therapist suggested I look into a Theracane but after doing some research, I decided to go with the Body Back Buddy. I began using it the day I received it and it has done wonders for me! I agree with some other reviewers that there isn't very good instruction on how to use it, but with a little experimentation I think anyone can get benefit from it. You have to probe around until you find a sore spot and then use GENTLE pressure to relieve the knotted muscle. I press and hold it for 10 to 20 seconds on the sore muscle and then release. I do this everywhere I find a sore spot and then go back and do it again. I am using it twice a day, morning and evening. You definitely have to be careful and gentle though, or you can hurt yourself! Don't overdo any one muscle. The Body Back Buddy has helped me tremendously!!!
