review/text: This item is serviceable and probably something you could buy to use to basically get ruined without stressing about it. The Wendy Bellisimo changing pad covers are only $2 more and much better quality fabric. The terry used for these is very cheap and scratchy, like an old towel. I am using them but am not fussed on how long they last or what happens to them, I won't be buying any more though. Carter's also makes lap pads that are great for use over the changing pad. You don't strictly speaking need a cover, it's easier if you don't use one. I never used covers with DD and never had a problem.
