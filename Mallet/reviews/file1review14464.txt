review/text: I have used this product and had excellent results. My scalp was happier, and the color (auburn) was vibrant and natural. Preparation and application do take some time; however, I've also found that there is a generous amount in the box; I was able to divide the amount in half, and get two applications from one box - and I have fairly long hair, often I run a bit short if I'm used a conventional haircolor such as L'Oreal or Clairol. For my health, and the health of my hair, I will continue to use this product.
