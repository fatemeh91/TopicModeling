review/text: The site states that the product is a "Set of 6 of the most commonly used frequencies contains the following forks: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, & 4095 cps" I ordered 3 "SETS." When I rec'd my order, there were 3 INDIVIDUAL tuning forks enclosed NOT 3 sets. So, if you're a teacher like I am and are needing a certain number of tuning forks- don't depend on this seller to provide sets!!
