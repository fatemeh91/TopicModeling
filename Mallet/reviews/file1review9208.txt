review/text: While it's truly large and has big capacity in each compartment everyone of them is very hard to open and I must push the side to lift the closing cap, it makes thaking the pills a real hellish action and if I could I'd exchange it immediately with something as big but with easier caps to open, however I don't trust the buying of another large capacity pills organizer because it's impossible to tell by looking at the picture if there's going to be any issue with it.
