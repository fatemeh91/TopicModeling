review/text: I bought this stuff for my daughter who has lots of planter warts on both feet for the past 5 1/2 years. Was skeptical at first after reading reviews. But I thought I would still give it a shot. After a week and a half it does start to get rid of them. Her feet look so much better than they have in years. Make sure you soak your feet, use a pumice stone to slough off dead skin. Apply wart stick and cover with medical tape or duct tape. I have her change it daily and yes this stuff is great. Much better than anything we ever bought in the stores. Even freezing with make them worse. So yes this stuff does work. Very happy with the product.
