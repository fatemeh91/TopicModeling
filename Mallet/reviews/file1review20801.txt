review/text: I love this shaver. I get a great shave quickly and comfortably. For my face, Braun has the best blade technology of anyone. I was very skeptical about the self-cleaning aspect and, in fact, it is the reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5. I like the idea but I don't like the cleaning fluid they provide. I have no idea what it is made of (smells like a petroleum product) and I'm not keen on the idea of putting anything on my skin that I wouldn't put inside my body. After all, our skin is our largest organ and it does absorb. I also don't like the idea of throwing those cleaning cartridges in a landfill over and over again. So, I've decided to create my own cleaning fluid using all natural, organic ingredients and just refill the original cartridge when needed. Overall, I am happy with the razor and highly recommend it.
