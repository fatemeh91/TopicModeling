review/text: This pad is nice and big. It is very, very waterproof. I purchased this pad because we got a new puppy. The puppy pads that you buy are expensive and even the large size ones are not that big. Even if a dog uses them chances are great that it will run off on the carpet. My puppy learned to go on these thru the night by my placing a puppy pad in the center, eventually eliminating the puppy pad and just using the matress pad. (She is now trained and doesn't use them) When she would wet on them it would never, ever leak thru to the carpet. If you are buying this pad for a bed rest assured that if it didn't leak thru to the carpet it will not leak thru to a mattress. These are very thick with a great waterproof lining on the bottom. I bought 2 of them and they have been washed over and over. They have yet to show any wear. I would recommend them to anyone trying to keep anything dry. I know I will find other uses for them and will never get rid of them for fear of never finding them again!!!
