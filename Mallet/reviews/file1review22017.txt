review/text: I have a minor case of silicosis [which is by no means minor to me] that came on after one incident of breathing diamotaceous earth. The pain in my lungs was terrible. This product took over a week to get here so the acute phase was passed by the time I got it, but my lungs still were hurting a lot and I just gave it a try. After taking Bronchial Soothe for the first time just a couple hours ago, right away the pain in my lungs began to subside and within minutes I hurled up a mass of frothy mucous from my lungs. Sounds disgusting, but it felt like heaven. I'm not fully healed, but I do feel so much better after one use of this product.Based on my first experience with Bronchial Soothe and the relief I have already experienced, I would definitely recommend this product to others.
