review/text: this stuff is great....make sure you get the least resistant stuff if you are just starting rehab--you will know if you have gotten the wrong resistance because your hands will ACHE about an hr after u finish....the proper resistance feels good immediately as you use it. It takes the ache out of my hands and wrists....and my hands can open better now than they have in ages.
