review/text: This beard trimmer has been amazing. It has easily adjustable length settings that are by number, so you don't have to guess each time how long to set it. The battery, which you charge by plugging into the wall, lasts about 3 weeks (I use it about every 3-4 days) and is quick to charge. Also, it's very easy to clean and feels very solid - no pulled hairs.I highly recommend this beard trimmer.
