review/text: I have had a previous model panasonic trimmer, but it gave up the ghost and I had to replace it. So I went with another Panasonic.My old Panasonic didn't hurt. Its blades were configured to hit the hairs at a more right angle, cutting cleanly and quickly. Hairs could only enter the cutting zone of the head on the SIDES of the cutter, not on the tip.This (reviewed) unit allows hairs to enter the END of the cutter, where they are TWISTED out of your skin. It hurts like crazy - and I'm highly pain tolerant. I think they must have done it to make the tip smaller. But it's a totally ineffective compromise. It made my eyes water and started an insane sneezing fit. Entertaining for my wife, yes, but this thing is no good. Not even worth returning - this is hitting the trash can.
