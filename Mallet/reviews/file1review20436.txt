review/text: I gave the Tush Cush 3 stars because it only helped a little. My husband has sciatica and finds long drives (over 15 miles) very painful. He shifts around trying to find a way to take pressure off his spine. He still is uncomfortable but maybe not quite as much. The pain down the back of his knee is less. I think the real problem may be our Honda Civic car seat design which slopes back and down quite a bit. The quality of the Tush Cush is very good, and it is wearing well (not compressing). Delivery was prompt.
