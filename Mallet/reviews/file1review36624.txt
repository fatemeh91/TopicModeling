review/text: I used to take a teaspoon of local Alaskan fireweed honey a day. It was great, but escalated my insulin levels. So I decided to search around and see what other sorts of alternatives I could find. That's when I came across this Elderberry Juice Concentrate. Immediately it caught my eye when I saw there was no alcohol or sugar. Being an all-natural sort of gal I absolutely had to try. How could it hurt, right? I was pleasantly surprised. Elderberries are a hometown favorite of mine. Being raised in Illinois they were a common treat. I had no idea that they had so much nutritional value to them. And when I learned that this concentrate came from a farm in Kansas it really made me trust that it was safe and all-natural.Needless to say I've been trying this product out for a while now and love what it has done for me. Of course, it did wonders for me this cold and flu season, but as I have come to learn (and I hadn't realized this when I purchased the product) it does wonders for allergies. Although, here in Alaska, we don't face many allergy problems, I do visit my family in Illinois and they really start to act up. The tundra here has pretty much no allergens. But every spring I head down to my parents to become overwhelmed with watery eyes and sneezing. I was extremely surprised to learn this spring as I used this product they did not act up nearly as bad as usual. It was much more effective than my typical dose of honey.All in all this product has done wonders for my immune system. I feel healthier and unlike with unnatural alternatives, I don't regret putting it into my body. I've always been an organic sort of person and finding a product that is natural, safe, and works has really made me a fan. Definitely a 5 out of 5 star rating from me. Just a really great product.
