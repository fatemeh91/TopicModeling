review/text: I've been using Listerine for years, ever since I was a little kid. To be honest, I'm so used to the "nasty" taste, it isn't nasty to me anymore. I don't even think about it. If the taste is too strong, just dilute it in water. I did it as a kid and I still do it because it's too strong otherwise for me.Interestingly, in 1976 the feds said that Listerine could not longer claim that it helped with sore throats, but I've been using Listerine for sore throats for years. I rinse it down my throat as far as I can gargle and it sometimes it just kills the sore throat dead if I catch it early enough. Make sure you don't swallow it though.I don't use Listerine every day, but I will use it as part of my dental hygiene.
