review/text: If you like the quality of name-brand psyllium fiber supplements but dislike the price at your local drugstore, then buy this product. This is pure psyllium powder without the additives. Metamucil contains a lot of sugar, and Konsyl is too expensive. Mix this with 8 oz of water in a shaker cup after dinner and you will have a great morning, if you know what I mean. Great "bulk" discount with the quality to match.
