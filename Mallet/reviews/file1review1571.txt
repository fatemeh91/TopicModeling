review/text: My son had two plantar warts on his foot. Went to the dermatologist. She froze one, but the other was not a candidate for freezing (since it was right where he puts pressure when he walks, she doesn't freeze those types to avoid the chance of a scar, and said it could feel like he was walking on a pebble for the rest of his life if it scarred). She sent us home with a Wart Stick. Name sounded hoakey, but we used it. She said it will work, but the problem people have is not using it each and every day. We made it a routine and didn't miss but maybe 1-2 nights over three months and they are gone now. It's painless and odorless, no mess, quick, no big deal. Set it by your bed and make it a routine. You'll be happy you did. It was an interesting progression watching those gross things die. It was about $7. Saves you the expense of a doctor's visit.
