review/text: The Mitchum deodorant worked well and I liked the fact that it was unscented. I noticed that when I put on a dark tee shirt, I got white marks on the shirt where it came into contact with the deodorant. Also, the day after using it, it was hard to wash off in the shower (so I guess it was still working).
