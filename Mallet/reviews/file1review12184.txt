review/text: I had some trouble getting my order so I emailed the company. They said it hadn't shipped yet and they weren't sure why. So they sent me double for no charge and it came quickly, in two days. I will order from them again. Very friendly and helpful service. Great produces too. Thank you for your help in getting me my order quickly.Very Happy,Heather
