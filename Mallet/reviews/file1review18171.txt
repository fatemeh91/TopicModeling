review/text: I purchased a Bucky 40 blinks mask several months ago and the mask seemed to have a lining issue. However, I contacted Bucky directly and I learned from Bucky that some masks experienced a glue issue relating to facial cr&egrave;mes. Bucky assured me they have corrected the issue with a new glue process. I must say, even though my 1st mask experience was not perfect, Bucky's customer service was FABULOUS! Bucky offered to replace my mask for free no questions asked and I did not have to return the faulty one. I just received my new mask and have no issues. Bucky does what they say they will do. I LOVE MY BUCKY!
