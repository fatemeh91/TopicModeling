review/text: I don't want to blither on about that which has already been stated eloquently and not-so-eloquently by a hundred other reviewers. It is the best product of its kind on the market - do your own homework (as I did) and you will likely come to the same conclusion. What I did want to embellish on is the taste. Yes, this is covered near uniformly by most other reviewers but I believe I have found a great way to ingest Perfect Food. I originally included in my juiced drinks (i.e. carrots, oranges and apples...altogether). This was the only way I could choke this stuff down. But, in all honesty, it wasn't exactly delicious. I have since altered my ingestion path by drinking it plainly with water. Put one scoop into a glass, add exactly 1 cup of very cold water and blend. The two keys in my formula are: 1) the coldness of the water and 2) blending. Clearly, if you don't have a handheld blender just put it into a blender but really, what a pain. Too much water and it thins out too much leaving a less-than-desirable flavor. Too thick and it well, it tastes like a square of sod in a glass of water. Without blending it leaves clumps which taste like the sod description. So, do as I suggest and if you don't like this product then you probably never will. If you do then you will enjoy the best greens product out there. I gave it 5 stars because taste shouldn't be an issue. That's like docking a star because I don't like the color green. They could probably include additives to make it taste better but it would be at the expense of it's healthiness. Either way, enjoy!
