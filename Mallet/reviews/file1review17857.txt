review/text: Bought this as a gift for a friend, and he's gotten a lot of attention from the ladies when he wears it out in public- including me! As his girlfriend, I had to insist he only wear it when we go out together ;) Very sexy scent at a super price. Hard to find fragrance, too. Has a spicy, fresh, woodsy smell. Yum!
