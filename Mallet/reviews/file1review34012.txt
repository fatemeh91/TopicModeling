review/text: I really like Derma-E products and have had great experiences using the various creams and serums. I have tried the Psorzema creme a few times in the hopes that maybe it would help at some point but, unfortunately, it hasn't. On it's own, it barely moisturizes my skin, much less help my eczema. Maybe I have to use more but it's pretty expensive for the size. It works better in combination with another lotion/creme but doesn't work any better with the body wash of the same name. I wouldn't judge other Derma-E products based solely on this one though.
