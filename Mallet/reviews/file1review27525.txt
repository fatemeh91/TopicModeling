review/text: I am a vegetarian and it is hard for me to make 200g of protein as a full time graduate student and intern. I've been using protein shakes for almost a year and literally dreaded it. I couldn't even drink as much as I should, thus no serious gains. I literally downed those Pure Protein and Cytosport powders like gross cough syrup.This powder is different. I am already incredibly satisfied with the nutrition label and how much less ingredients it has than the other ones I've used (text is so small I'm not even completely sure of what I'm taking). Not only that... I absolutely enjoy drinking this shake. It tastes like Nesquik chocolate milk or some really nice quality chocolate milk with a bit of a minty undertone. I can drink two of these a day.
