review/text: I've tried a lot of supplements meant to help you sleep through the night. But I've always woken up regardless of their promises. I have some sort of condition that makes me come out of deep sleep over 40 times a night, only completely waking anywhere from 3-8 times over night.With this product, I've actually had several nights where I maybe only woke up once to use the bathroom over night. It is a night and day difference over other products.The only downside is that you have to take four horse pills 30-60 minutes before bedtime. With some capsules, I can swallow 2-4 at once...but these suckers needed to be taken one at a time...which increases the amount of water needed and leads to a slightly increased chance that you'll need a bathroom break overnight.
