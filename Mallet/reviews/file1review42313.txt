review/text: Ughhh I couldn't stand the taste! But it is a good vitamin and mineral product so I do recommend it for health. Just make sure you gulp it down really quick to avoid letting it on your tongue too long, or really drown the taste out by putting it in a strong flavored juice or something. It tastes gross!
