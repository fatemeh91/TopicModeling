review/text: I paid $400 for a custom dental guard which my dog promptly ate. Paid ANOTHER $400 for a replacement, which I finally chewed apart. Tried the kind you have to boil, then fit while it's warm - that didn't work out for me. This item fits great and does the job, and it's a whole lot cheaper than a custom made one. Very highly recommended.
