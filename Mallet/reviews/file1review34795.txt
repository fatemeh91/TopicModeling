review/text: I bought it thinking it would smell somewhat manly, musky, tree smelling, lumberjack envisioning, but after my first day found myself constantly thinking, "who's wearing the strong perfume," only to find I was sitting alone. At first spritz it has a bit more of a tree smell, but throughout the day smells more and more floral. In terms of staying dry, it did a much better job than Nature's Gate, which was useless, but not nearly as well as the synthetic stuff.
