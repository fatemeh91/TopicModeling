review/text: Have been using Chore Boy Golden Feece Scrubbing Cloths since childhood, and that's a long long time ago. The prduct scrubs pots, pans, sinks, counter tops, appliances, car rims, just about anything. Depending on frequency of use, one cloth can last months, If there were a 10 star rating, this product would get it. It's rare these days to find a product that has remained on the market for so many years. What a shame it would be if this product left the consumer scene. Try it once and I'm sure you'll agree. Two cloths to the box, and well worth it. What else can you buy with so many uses, for under three dollars. Not much I'd sayMichael McCannGladstone, Missouri
