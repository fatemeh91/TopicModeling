review/text: I didn't read the label carefully before I bought this. I thought this was standardized to both rosavins and salidrosides, however it is only standardized to rosavins. So yes the rosavins in this product help me stay more energetic throughout the day and reduce fatigue. But, there probably isn't much salidrosides in this Rhodiola to provide any adaptogenic benefits. So this product will not support your immune system, it will just help with energy. The next time I'm buying Rhodiola, I'm looking for one that is standardized to both rosavins and salidrosides.
