review/text: This sprinkler covers a surprisingly large area, and puts down a lot of water. My only gripe is that it is lightweight, which suggests that it may break easily, but also means that if there is any torque on the hose it will be difficult to get the sprinkler to sit flat. Not that this is particularly hard to compensate for, but it does make usage a tad fiddly.Edit: Hasn't broken yet, so that's good. Putting a quick-connect fitting on it prevents torque from the hose being a problem, too.
