review/text: I should have bought this toilet in the first place. I didn't want to spend too much money on a toilet trainer so instead I went with a cheapie from walmart. BIG mistake! That toilet was uncomfortable and the opening was small. Because of that, my daughter would either pee or poop on the toilet itself. While visiting my brother-in-law, my daughter used the babybjorn toilet they had for their kids. She absolutely loved it! I ordered this toilet as soon as we got home and we've been happy ever since. We've had no incidents and my daughter is no longer scared to sit on the toilet. The opening is just the right size and the "splash guard" in front is great, since my daughter likes to look at in toilet as she's going. It's very sturdy and easy to clean. I will recommend this toilet to everyone.
