review/text: Ricochet Mints are fantastic. Xylitol is great. I keep hearing about how terrible other artificial sweeteners are for you. These are great and are even good for your teeth!Beware: We got a bad batch that tasted rancid even though the expiration date was 2011. We've ordered these for years, and this time the candies were the wrong color and the surface wasn't smooth; the paper lining the can was rippled, as if it had gotten wet. Amazon would not accept a return, even though it was within 30 days.We contacted Emerald Forest and they made good on it. Such a relief, as we've been ordering Emerald Forest xylitol and xylitol products for years, and their products are great. Great customer service, too.
