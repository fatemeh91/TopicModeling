review/text: I will admit that shaving with a regular razor is less painful, but the beauty of using the Braun epilator is that I have to shave only every few WEEKS! I am EXTREMELY happy with the product and would recommend it to every woman I know. Even when the hair grows back, it isn't hard and stubbly as it is when you shave with a regular razor. I was at the beach in May when a friend told me about the Braun epilator and how much she loved it; I now agree with her.
