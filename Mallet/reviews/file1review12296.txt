review/text: I gave this bed in a bag 4 star as the top sheet is trimmed in green and the bottom trimmed in blue. The sheets are truly wonderful though. Very soft against the skin, and wash beautifully.I would have liked the blanket to be a little longer as I can only tuck in the bottom edges. The blanket is made of cotton and feels a little rough. My spouse doesn't seem to mind as the blanket is light weight for summer.I would love to buy additional identical sheets from this company but they do not offer them
