review/text: This product served its purpose. I used them went I sat down or in bed. Therefore, I do not walk in them. From time to time, I will throw them in the washing machine to clean them out anyway. After a couple months, the white is no longer them. I try to blench them and it does not work. Well, they still serve the purpose but it just don't look at that attractive.
