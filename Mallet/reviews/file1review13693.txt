review/text: This machine was quite a disappointment. It vibrates so strongly, even on the lowest setting, that it was painful. I'm no sissy but I couldn't stand it for more than a minute. It is also noisy and there is no heat...I returned it and I'm still on a search for a decent foot massager. Totally overpriced and worthless to me.
