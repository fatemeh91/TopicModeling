review/text: I won't repeat what other reviewers have said, but I did want to clarify some other reviews. This sheet does NOT cover the entire surface of a twin bed - that is really what I was hoping for. It covers the entire width, but not the length. My son is not quite two and graduated to a "big boy bed" this year. He tosses & turns all over his bed, so I was hoping for full length AND width protection. I'm going to get a second one and overlap them I think.We have had diaper leakage & this sheet did its job - protected the mattress perfectly. We put it under his fitted sheet and have had no issues with bunching or moving.
