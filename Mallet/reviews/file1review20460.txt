review/text: I was worried that the cushion might have a strong smell or odor because often foam does. However, there was no overpoweringly strong smell. There is a smell, but it's tolerable.The cutout on the backside is really large. I would actually prefer a cushion with no cutout, or maybe a cutout in the middle to help with air circulation. As it is, my tailbone area is rather cold now, for no good reason. I didn't need the tailbone cutout - I got this pillow for the wedge shape since I have hip problems and my chair didn't have enough cushioning. Maybe Tush Cush could make a pillow with a smaller longer narrower cutout for women, or maybe one with no cutout at all.The pillow is pretty firm, although it collapses more around the cutout, as would be expected near an edge. I only weigh around 110 lb though, so if you weigh a lot more you might want the extra firm cushion. Also - my hips aren't huge (~36" around) and this pillow is just the right size. If you have large hips and want the pillow to not disappear under you when you sit down, you might want a larger size pillow.
