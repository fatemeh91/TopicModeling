review/text: I enjoyed this product. I was pleased that the flavor wasn't too strong and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I've tried a number of mouthwash products and this one was very good. I was glad it wasn't so strong that it burned my mouth when I left it in and swished. I'd recommend this product to others.
