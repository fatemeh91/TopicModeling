review/text: I can't properly put into words what it is like to wake up in the morning, smell my breath and have it smell neutral. No foul odor!!! Honestly, I am still at the point where I feel I am either still asleep and dreaming or I have died and gone to Heaven. It's impossible! How can this be true and yet, it is true! No more bad breath. No more body odor. Well, to be fully honest I have to say that it EVENTUALLY levels off to about 95% elimination of body odor BUT THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!!! The problem with this liquid product is that eventually I find the taste to be obnoxious, I always have to wash off the bottle or it leaves a green ring in my refrigerator and, worst of all, I suspect it is leaving a subtle green tint on my teeth. So, I have ordered the soft gel capsules to start where this liquid left off. They expire in 2014 and the world is supposed to end December 21, 2012 so I am extremely happy and confident that when the world finally ends...I BE SMELLIN GREAT!!! HA!!!
