review/text: I bought these because I hate using disposables and adding to the waste problem. I'm sure there are better washable pads out there. These are completely flat and don't bend much to contour to your breast or nipple. They are super obvious under a thin bra or tank top. Plus, they stick to you--not horribly but still undesirable. I like the bag that comes with them but overall, I wouldn't buy this product again or recommend it.
