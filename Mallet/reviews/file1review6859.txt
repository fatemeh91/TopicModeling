review/text: I bought this item intending to use it to view my old 35mm negatives while assembling them in some negative holders. Either I am doing something wrong or this device was never intended to use to view photo negatives. I cannot see any detail on the negatives. I thought I would be able to place a strip of negatives under the glass and be able to see an enlarged view of the negative. The only way this might work is if some type of bright back light was used under the negative.
