review/text: I've been buying the Citrus for years. I tried the Honey Mango and almost vomited from the chemicals in it. I couldn't wash off the stench for an entire day. I believe they must have outsourced to China and are now poisoning this population with chemicals. I will never buy any Alba products again -- and I've spent many hundreds over the years.
