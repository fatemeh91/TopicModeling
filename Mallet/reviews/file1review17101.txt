review/text: I've owned the 3-year-old equivalent of thePhilips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silveror thePhilips Norelco Qt4050 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer, Blackand was disappointed with the build quality. The product may be better-built now, but the version I had was almost entirely plastic and the shaving compartment broke awhile back.Upon opening the Remington MB-200 I was instantly pleased with my purchase. To the touch, I could tell the Remington trimmer is made with better materials at half -- or even a third of -- the price I paid for my Norelco. I keep a constant "5 o clock shadow" look -- and after one use I can already tell this is going to be a better product for me. It could very well just be the fresh blades, but after one use I feel like the "1" setting on the Remington gave me a tighter trim in half the passes. I may not always go this short, but it's nice to have that option if I want it.One comment in the Norelco's favor: I quickly realized trimming with this Remington is probably going to be a little messier without the Norelco's vacuum/compartment; I probably took that for granted. Small price to pay for a better trim, though.
