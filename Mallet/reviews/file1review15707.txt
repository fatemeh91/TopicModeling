review/text: To sum it up its a great pen. I like the .5 mm lead and so many of the multi-pens have .7mm, so it make this one a good choice. However the ink cartridge inexplicably exploded inside the pen about 2 month after I got it. I cleaned it out so its good now but it shouldn't have happened on a $30 pen. I have had free ones that didn't, ever. Probably just bad luck.
