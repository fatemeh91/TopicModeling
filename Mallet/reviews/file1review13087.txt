review/text: I've been ordering Elasto-Gel collars for years for a friend who suffered a neck injury. Elasto-Gel collars have two different types of covers: one is a bright blue (as shown) satin material that is gentle on the skin; the other is a much rougher dark blue material that causes him skin irritation.I ordered this item because the picture depicted the bright blue satin material, but I actually received the dark blue rough material. Very disappointing.
