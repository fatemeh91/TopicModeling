review/text: I have been taking this for a couple weeks now. I would have to say that this is probally one of the better cutting supps out there. I have been leaning down more and more. Well im sure there is better but you will probally be paying a bit more.Dont buy this thinking it will just shred fat. You have to want to work out and eat right at the same time. If you do all that this will deff give you a little boost.As for people saying that it gives them a little energy, I have yet to get an energy boost from this. However I know this work because I am dropping weight a little fast then I normally would.Im giving this 5 stars because its a product that actually works. However it is a little expensive being it is only a 3 week cycle. Ill keep paying it every other month, well because this one actually works pretty decent compared to most other brands... just be sure to put in effort.Also this works even better when taking rage. Wich by the way is probally the best pre work out I have ever taken. You get 44 servings in one container for like 32 bucks i think.. not bad at all...
