review/text: This foot bath is amazing. The jets are powerful and the water actually will heat up to (I forget the exact temperature) 120. I felt the water start to cool down little bit but then the heat kicked in and it was glorious. I just got it yesterday, so I'm hoping the life of it lasts or else I will need to re-review. So far so good. I'm not listening the directions though...I AM using foot salts. That's basically the whole reason I bought a foot bath. The rollers do nothing for my gigantic feet because there's no room to roll around, but the water is super deep and there's even a fill line for those of us (like me) that don't know how high it can be filled. I think I'm in love.
