review/text: I specifically ordered these STIMUDENTS because they were advertised as the "Johnson and Johnson" product, but when I received them they were a product made in China by "Revive Personal Products". I'd used this brand before and they tended to break, split, or get soggy. THe exterior packaging and wording are almost identical to the J&J packaging, so they LOOK like the real Stimudents.
