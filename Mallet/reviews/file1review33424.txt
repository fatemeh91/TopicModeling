review/text: Well, it doesn't get quite that hot, and a wrap shape would be more useful, but it's nice. I think they're all filled with buckwheat and rice, and it sort of smells weird. Leave the scent packet out, it smells nasty. I wonder what a tea bag would do...The fabric gets kind of sticky from the heat coming out of it. Strange.
