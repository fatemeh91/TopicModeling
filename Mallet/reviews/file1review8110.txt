review/text: I can't believe I am writing a squeegee review, but I guess if one is sorting out competing squeegees, it would be nice to hear from other squeegee users. So I am happy to let you know this is a very good quality item. It feels hefty and "well constructed" in the hands, and it appears it will last a long time. The ergonomic design is not too bad either. Thumbs up.
