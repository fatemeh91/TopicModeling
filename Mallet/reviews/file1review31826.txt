review/text: The only thing I do not like about this product is the taste. Even though I add this to my Protein shakes, smoothies. It addes a funny after taste. I ussally use one teaspoon to each shake. I do not recommend adding this to orange juice. It made the orange juice taste like vomit. By adding some kind of sweetner like honey or agva sweeter helps with the taste.
