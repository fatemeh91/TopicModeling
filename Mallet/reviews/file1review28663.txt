review/text: A few years ago I tried every vanilla protein powder out there. I was about to undergo bariatric surgery, and knew I would have to supplement with protein the rest of my life, so I wanted something that tasted great and was easy to use - or I might not keep up with it. Well ON Vanilla Ice Cream flavored whey protein fit the bill then and I'm STILL drinking it. I drink it in cold two percent milk. It melts quickly without the need for a blender. It's creamy without being thick. It tastes as good as melted Hagen Das vanilla ice cream. And unlike products that contain soy, I've had no digestion problems with it.
