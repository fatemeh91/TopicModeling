review/text: I took these all through my pregnancy and am taking them now as I am nursing. I briefly switched to another brand that I picked up at the store, and started having bad leg cramps. I was surprised to find that the other brand didn't have potassium in them. I promptly ordered another bottle of Rainbow Light and the leg cramps stopped. I am also GF and had no problems with their product.
