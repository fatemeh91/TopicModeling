review/text: I really like this vitamin brand I really like this one a day prenatal vitamin. The first bottle I bought was the &#34;petit&#34; version and not only did I have to take 3 a day, but they also smelled really strong and made me gag in my first trimester because of the smell/taste.These are a little larger, but that's not a problem for me and they don't smell/taste weird. They are also pretty gentle on the stomach if I forget and take them on a not exactly full stomach.
