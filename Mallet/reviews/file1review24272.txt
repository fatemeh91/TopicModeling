review/text: I have high, long arches, and I am on my feet all day, every day. I've been using these for three years. They are great for arch and metatarsal support. I love the full support they give to my arches. Didn't take long to get used to them, and now I don't want to be without them. I have several pairs for as many shoes as will work. So much better than any other supports I've used, including custom ones, and even Birkenstock shoes!
