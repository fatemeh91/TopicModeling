review/text: I bought the Bissell swift sweep for my mom, she totally loves it as it is easy to use and she can carpet each room in the house without having to pull out the vacuum and no loud noise.... very reasonable and economical does a very thorough job on the carpets and floors without any hassle.... Thanks Bissel and Thanks Amazon.
