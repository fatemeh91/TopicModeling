review/text: After trying nearly every rechargeable battery and being disappointed that they did not arrive pre-charged as claimed, the Sony Cycle Energy batteries arrived ready to go, just as claimed. The higher price and lower mAh were a matter of concern for me before I ordered. Sony has 2500 mAh for less here on Amazon, but careful reading of the customer reviews led me to this choice and so far I'm very pleased. One surprise was to read the fine print (and I do mean fine) on the battery back and discover that these are based on eneloop technology. I could have bought the eneloops for less and that had been my first choice until I read the reviews. I suppose the hybrid technology is driving all the brands I tried, but Sony is the first to deliver on the promise.Sony Cycle Energy AA Ni-MH Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack)
