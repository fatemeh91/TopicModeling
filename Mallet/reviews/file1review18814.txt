review/text: I switched from my GNC multivitamin to this. I enjoy all the natural benefits it has to offer. It took me a while to go through caffeine withdrawals from my other multivitamin, but now I'm mellow, non jittery, level minded and still have energy to finish the day. And by day I mean waking up at 4, taking care of a toddler, going to work, then school, then home for cooking, cleaning, bathing and all that other stuff. So this is the truth!! I love it!!
