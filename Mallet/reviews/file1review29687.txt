review/text: So i was skeptical thinking that these things wouldn't work!! was i wrong! I put these in the washer ( and it comes with its own washing bag too) and they come out looking perfect!! I do not dry them however( so i can not vouche for this part of the cleansing process) i leave them in the bag and let them air dry which takes a hour at the most!! I am a size 38B with full milk in breast so fairly small boob size and these do not show up under my clothing. A great price for awesome quality!!
