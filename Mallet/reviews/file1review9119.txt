review/text: You know when you eat something that tastes horrible and so you think it is really good for you? You may feel that way after drinking this. It tastes like you fell into a pile of alfalfa and hay in the barn with your mouth open. We were interested in an alkalanizing green drink product and found this at our local health food store on a shelf "recommended by Dr. Oz". I gave it my best shot, I promise.Luckily we found a better version sold by Tony Robbins that tastes a lot more neutral and includes MSM which was hard to find in a greens drink. We ran out of Tony Pure energy greens drink and a month later I tried the Vibrant Health Green drink again (we have a whole canister). I almost gagged and thought I should share this info with others who want to give their body a maximized chance of being totally alkalanized.A month later, BEING ALKALANIZED FEELS WONDERFUL!! I just wouldn't recommend this product unless you try a travel packet first. Then you will know if you will continue to drink it.
