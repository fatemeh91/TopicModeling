review/text: I wanted an accurate scale, which is a lot harder to find than one would imagine. This scale fits the bill, although the post is not as firmly attached to the base as I would like.What is really annoying is that the the scale must be assembled by the customer, and unless you have a PhD in mechanical engineering, the instructions are totally confusing even though I'm very mechanically adept. They are printed in small type with tiny assembly drawings that utterly fail to explain the assembly process. I'd guess that the assembly instructions were published in the 1920's when paper and ink were expensive. This is unforgivable. The instructions should have been MUCH larger, clearer and more detailed, and there should be a link to a web site where an assembly video could be viewed. The kit also included a metal nut wrench which had no apparent purpose that I could discern.
