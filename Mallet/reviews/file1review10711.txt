review/text: I had been using the Med Sun 4 dose a day organizer and it is really great but when one pill changed to a larger version and no longer fit. I had to try out some alternatives. This is not the handiest set to fill however I do love the fact that the compartments are REALLY deep and the compartments STAY closed.If you take a lot of meds/supplements and are on the go, this set is perfect.
