review/text: Works great. My only complaint is that the instructions on how to actually trim your beard with the trimmer (how to hold the trimmer, etc) are somewhat lacking. If you're new to trimming beards like me, you could easily wind up chopping off more hair than you wanted to, if you're not very careful.
