review/text: I bought this tweezer two years ago and it works great. It's the best tweezer out of all the other tweezers that I've bought and tried. The way you hold them and the way the tweezer grabs is just perfect. I'm thinking of buying another just to have a spare even though it's a little pricey for a tweezer but It's awesome.
