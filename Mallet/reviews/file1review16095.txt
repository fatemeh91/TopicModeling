review/text: I found this online and ordered for my poor cat that was suffering from unexplained UTI. I got it very quickly and since I've used it she doesn't have them anymore. Knock on wood!!!I feel it helped with her suffering and the pain. I would give her a tiny teaspoon of a good wet cat food and mix the pellets right in. She always downs it, no problem.I recently stopped using it as she has been better for 3 months. I do always keep a bottle of this handy just in case.
