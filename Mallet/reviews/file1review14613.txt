review/text: I've been using this neti pot for three years, and I have absolutely no problem with it's function. However, I am in the market for a new one because I am tired of cleaning it. Mold starts accumulating in the nozzle, and it's difficult to clean out. It's a good pot in terms of how well it cleans my sinuses, and I will keep it for travel.
