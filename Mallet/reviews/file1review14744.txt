review/text: Items as described. I used something like this while in rehab for a knee replacement. They also had you do hand strengthening exercises. We put marbles into the putty and then put it in the box when through, and the next day we would knead the putty and get the marbles out, and then replace them into the putty and put back into the box. This is a good excercise, especially when you get into the stronger putty. I could tell the difference after a couple of weeks with my finger and hand strength.
