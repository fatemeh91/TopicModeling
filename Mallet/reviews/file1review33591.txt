review/text: I purchased the WaterPik flosser knowing it received mixed reviews. All I can say is this removed much more debris from my teeth than traditional flossing, and in much less time. This is a great tool for those who just wanna pass out at night, it takes 30 seconds and feels great. This is a great improvement to my routine.
