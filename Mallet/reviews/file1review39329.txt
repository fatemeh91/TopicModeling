review/text: There are many hooks on this inexpensive shoulder puller, but the smallest size is only just good enough for a size 6 person. I use it every night while I sleep and am glad a bought it, but if you are smaller than I am I don't think it will help you too much. Otherwise, remember it isn't about a straight back as pulled back shoulders.
