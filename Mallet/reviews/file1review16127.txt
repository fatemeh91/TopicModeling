review/text: My doctor gave me Thorne Profusia-SR to improve my circulation and, though I felt good for about two hours after taking Profusia-SR, it began a series of scary nighttime heart and breathing episodes that nearly had me in the ER! My pulse and O2 saturation were jumping all over the place. I had many palpitations and felt more weak and tired than ever! Then when I stopped the Profusia-SR, the symptoms continued for another couple of nights. I will never take it again!! People with any prior heart issues beware!!
