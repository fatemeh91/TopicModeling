review/text: I was always kind of against electric razors due to my pointless macho attitude of wanting to use a razor, but then my dermatologist (I have selective macho behavior) suggested it due to my neck acne/ingrown hairs. Anyway, I realized a mach 3 isn't manly, a straight blade is, and I'm sure as hell not going to use that.So I bought the Spectra so I could have the sensitivity control due to my obvious sensitivity...pretty sure that was a waste. It works a little bit, but not 40 bucks worth over the quatro.Pros over Mach 3 Turbo: Much better for my skin. A much gentler shave. Gets certain spots easier than a razor. No need for shaving cream or frequent razor replacement (once a year).Cons: Expensive inital principle, although the money probably evens out. Certain hairs take a while to get. I mean they take a while. Because there's no need to waste time with shaving cream, it takes about the same time, but still, it's a hassle.Overall: Well worth it. Only 4 stars because of the failure to easily get all hairs.
