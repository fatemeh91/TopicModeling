review/text: I have taken several different prescription meds for my blood pressure and they all made me feel worse, i found this one time when i didnt have the money to go back to the dr. to switch meds again, on the advice of one of the reps who was at the store stocking it, and i have to say it has worked for me very well. it makes me tired sometimes but not too bad, anyway its worth a try.
