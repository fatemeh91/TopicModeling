review/text: I was usingBSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder, Chocolate Milkshake, 2.91 Poundbefore trying this but decided to give it a shot because of the recommendation of several friends at the gym. ON is my new favorite brand and I will be buying this powder from now on. It has a good balance with low calories and fat. I usually stick with chocolate flavor, so I bought the Double Rich Chocolate. I mix my powder with just water 99% of the time and rarely use milk. This actually tastes pretty good with just water. It doesn't quite beat the taste of Syntha-6, but for the lower calories / fat content, it's worth a very slight sacrifice in the taste department.
