review/text: COMPANY FAILS TO MENTION THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS POISONOUS PROPYLENE GLYCOL! WHEN IT ARRIVED THAT IS WHEN I SAW THAT NASTY INGREDIENT ON THE LABLE. THIS IS DISGUSTING! I WOULD NEVER PUT THAT PRODUCT ON MY BODY. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!! IT IS GOING IN THE TRASH! COMPANY HAS LOUSY RETURN POLICY AS WELL-BUYER BEWARE! I AM LETTING AMAZON KNOW OF MY DISSATISFACTION. I AM SICK OF FULL DISCLOSURE OF INGREDIENTS NOT BEING LISTED ON PRODUCTS BEFORE PURCHASE.
