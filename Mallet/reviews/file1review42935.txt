review/text: I recently decided to try to "green things up" in our household (better late than never!) and have begun to pick up some green products here and there. I bought the Geranium version of this scrub to give it a try, partly for the "green" effect, partly for the scent.Well, I am SO glad I found this! Not only do I love the scent (I totally understand how some might find it a bit much, but I like a fragrance to most things and find this one appealing), but it worked wonderfully in my sink and on other jobs around the house. I particularly liked that you don't get the little toxic puff of "smoke" wafting into the air if you set the container down too vigorously (something the Comet always does).Now that I know how much I like it, I'm going to get a few more for different parts of the house. As someone else mentioned, it smells so good that it actually makes me look for an excuse to use it, so I've been cleaning things more often. I also find the packaging attractive enough that I don't mind having it sit out on the counter, which makes it all the more convenient to use.I'm now anxious to try other similar products by Mrs. Meyers and other green companies.
