review/text: Iv been using this shaver for about a month now, I just would like to say WOW this shaver is almost perfect and the trimmer is amazing , the styler does an excellent job, battery life gr8 (almost a week of shaving per charge)... been using electric shavers for years now I can honestly say that this is the best (shaver+trimmer+styler) all in oneI have one thing to say to the people who didn't like this shaver, read the manual! Ur supposed to shave against the way Ur hair grows, and it takes a couple of times till Ur face get used to itThe only bad thing I can say about the cruzer 3 is it doesn't do too well on the neck but hey iv always faced this problem with all electric shavers at least here u can get the suckers by using the trimmer.
