review/text: As pointed out by the other reviews the moisturizer around the razor head wears unevenly. During the first use I was required to re-shave all areas of my legs 3 times and still had areas that were not smooth. Shave time was increased and final outcome was a total disappointment. The soap does wear unevenly and because of the size this is a horrible razor for curves, underarms, and the bikini area. Don't waste you hard earned money on this shoddy product.
