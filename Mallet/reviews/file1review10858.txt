review/text: On our cold winter nights, my alarm sensor batteries kept weakening and of course setting off an early morning low battery alert. Getting these at the local drug store proved way to expensive as each sensor needed two batteries. Bought them from Amazon and saved quite a bit... am on my third six pack and all is well...
