review/text: Been wearing hard lenses for 42 years, a friend told me about Lobo about 10 years ago. It is the only thing that can get the oils off of my contacts. I don't have to use anything else. At night I store my lenses in water, been doing it for years. I also do not use wetting solution. I have spent a lot of money on Boston products over the years and can say it is over priced JUNK. I have never had an eye problem ever. Having stigmatism is a pain for getting a good contact fit, but why make it more of a pain by purchasing over price junk from the Boston company. you won't regret buying it.
