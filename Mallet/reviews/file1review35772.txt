review/text: This is my second brace of this type. Gives good support. Machine washable. I wouldn't go completely by shoe size when purchasing. The volume around your ankle needs to be part of the equation. I wear 10 2A shoes and found that the XS brace fits my ankle the best - as I have really low volume feet/ ankles.
