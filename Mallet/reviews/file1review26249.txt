review/text: This product was not right for me but, it appeared to be sturdy and well made. I am a big guy, 6'6", 250 pounds and although the lumbar pad is adjustable, I just couldn't get it postitioned where I needed it to be. I have friends that have tried this brand and love it. Although it did not work for me, the return was a simple and pleasant experience.
