review/text: I love this carpet shampooer. I had a higher-end model when I lived in the United States and loved it, too. It has been impossible to find a carpet shampooer in Italy so I checked on Amazon UK and found it! All I needed to buy was a converter plug for it to work here. With two pets and the rainy season upon us, it has been invaluable in keeping my carpets clean.
