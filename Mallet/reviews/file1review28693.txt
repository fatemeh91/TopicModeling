review/text: First off, the seller is great. Got the product in perfect condition in a timely manner. (Two days for me w/ PRIME.)The protein tastes as good as any other whey I've ever had. It mixes very well and I just use a small shaker cup and water and/or milk. No clumps or anything with one scoop whey. So everything is as to be expected.My only issue is the bag. The seal is like that of a cheap plastic ziplock bag. For me, opening this once or twice a day, the seal just doesn't seem to last. Once the seal doesn't close tightly, the protein takes on a bad taste (probably it going bad huh? haha), but I usually just stomach through it. I have left over 5 lb tubs, so what I do know is just dump in straight into the 5lb tubs and store it with those. A friend of mine just uses one 5 lb tub, and then wraps and seals the 10 lb bag, until done with the other.Either way I recommend you look into a new way to store it, but really I think Optimum Nutrition is the best protein I've had. So far all the flavors have been decent. Just take into consideration what you may be mixing it with. Like don't buy coffee flavor to make fruit smoothies, :)
