review/text: I have tried multiple flavors of the Optimum Nutrition protein and this is by far the best of the group. It doesn't seem to cause any bloating it tastes great with both water and milk and seems to mix fairly well. The only reason it received 4/5 stars is because there is better tasting gourmet proteins out there. For the cost and for the blend of proteins you get this is a solid purchase.
