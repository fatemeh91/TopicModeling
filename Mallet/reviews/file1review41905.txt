review/text: This is the greatest product. I love this body wash! I was startled when I found my daughter's old body wash on the Skin Deep website with a 5 hazard score. After doing some research I came across California Baby (which only has a 1 hazard score). Not only is it safe for my daughter, but it has a great smell and works really well. It is safe enough for my newborn as well. Although it is expensive, it is definitely worth it.
