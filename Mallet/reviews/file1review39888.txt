review/text: I wasn't happy with this product at all. The package claimed that they were more absorbent than other brands but this brand leaked on one of my lighter flow days, which I've never had happen before. I was also very uncomfortable with the fact that there was no applicator. It just doesn't seem sanitary to me and I could never get them positioned correctly. Based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this product to my family or friends and I'm sticking with my regular brand.
