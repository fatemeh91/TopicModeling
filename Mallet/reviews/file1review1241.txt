review/text: I have tried similar products in the past, but wasn't very satisfied. After reading the excellent reviews for this one, i gave it a try. I am disappointed. Even though it comes in precut shapes and is cold wax, it did not do a very good job on my eybrows. It left a lot of hairs. The shape of the precut wax strips isn't very good neither - it didn't match my eybrows very well. My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon.
