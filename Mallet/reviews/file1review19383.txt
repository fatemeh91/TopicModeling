review/text: Yes, you need to take six-a-day.Should that really be a problem if you read about the product before you buy? No.This is a wonderful multivitamin and it doesn't upset my stomach. Some have mentioned the taste as a deterrent, but I personally haven't noticed any foul taste. I will continue to take this multivitamin.Please don't negatively review this product solely on the fact that six pills is the daily dose. Be informed that this is NOT a one-a-day!
