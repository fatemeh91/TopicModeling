review/text: I bought these tweezers because I had my first experience with what I believed to be in-grown hairs (looked like blackheads), following a series of bikini waxes and laser hair removal. My only info on how to deal with them came from the internet. I was very pleased that these tweezers helped me deal with the issue even though I had little to go on. I didn't have a problem with the tweezers' sharpness or their ability to grab things, but I'd recommend keeping close track of the plastic cap that covers the sharp ends. For those who are new to in-grown hairs like me, my technique was essentially to scrape at the black head of infected hair, and actually stick these tweezers in the hair follicle and grab until I got a hold of something and then pull. Sorry if this review is gross!
