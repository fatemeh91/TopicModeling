review/text: After driving all over town and wasting time looking for replacement brushes at the wholesale clubs, big box stores, and local drug stores I decided to check Amazon. Viola! Three days later I had my much needed brushes and the shipping was FREE. I should have checked Amazon FIRST! I have used this Oral B Vitality Sonic brush for years and really like it. I don't know why retailers are no longer stocking the replacements.
