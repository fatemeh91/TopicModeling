review/text: Every piece you put together comes apart and you have to glue it or smash it cuz it gets you so frustarated. The rod between your hand and the sweeper is a two part thing you put together but comes apart every time you use it. The rubber bumper around sweeper comes off every time so I don't even use that any more. the Top handle comes off. Can't Amazon sell something made well form Iowa or Ohio like the old ones? They were a dream to use ten or more years ago!
