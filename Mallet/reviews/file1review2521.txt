review/text: This is much better than I expected, especially at this price. Left my legs smooth for a couple of weeks. (although it missed some areas so I had to follow up with a razor). Yes, it is a little painful -- but I think it's less painful than waxing.Start with the lower legs, which are the least sensitive, and afterwards usebaby oil or an unscented moisturizer. And, as others here have said, the second time is easier than the first.
