review/text: I have used the arm and hammer scrub free bathroom cleaner before and it is really good. As its name suggest scrub free. I sprayed the stuff on, left it for a few mins and WOW!All i had to do was rinse over with water. Its a litle expensive but worth it. A lot of us dont have the time and need something potent that works. My con has to do with the supplier, I ordered specifically Arm and Hammer, just love Arm and Hammer products, BUT sender took really long to send the product and when they did SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT!!!
