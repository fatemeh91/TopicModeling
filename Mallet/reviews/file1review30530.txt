review/text: "Natural" is a worm word to draw people into thinking that the products, including food, are healthy. It replaced the word "wholesome" when people started getting organically knowledgeable. This product uses Propylene Glycol as its main ingredient, but so do all deodorant sticks. However, this product uses Lichen to stop the bacterial smell, not aluminum or other metals. It does stop you from sweating, but not completely, but you don't stink. One reviewer gave the product a one star rating because of the "Natural" verbiage and the use of Propylene Glycol, which she thought was dishonest. She has a good point. However, her husband seems to have a problem with many products because he is hypoallergic. You can read about Propylene Glycol here and make your own decision:[...]I like it because it is tentatively much healthier than heavy metal deodorants, it has no smell if you get unscented, and it doesn't mark your cloths.
