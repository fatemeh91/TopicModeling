review/text: Newborns have really delicate skin, and if your's is like my daughter, will break out very easily when washed with a harsher soap.This baby bath was great for washing body AND hair for her whole first year. Never dried her skin out ONCE.We had received other types as gifts and returned them all when we saw how her skin became dry and red when we used them on her.Super super super!! Cannot say enough great things about the Aveeno baby products!I plan to use them again on my new arrival due in May.
