review/text: For the good news,received quickly, packed discreetly, priced right,quiet operation, rotates & vibrates well. For the not so good news, ordered clear received pink ...not a big deal. It is rather big if that is your preference you wont be disappointed. Heavy, could be used as a small club for self defense..lol. Has a distinct plastic odor,which I do not like. All in all OK. Can't they find a way to get rid of that smell???
