review/text: Fantastic. I had always been too cheap to buy an electric toothbrush. Now I wish I had bought one a long time ago. I like that this one vibrates every 30 seconds, to tell you to move on to the next quadrant. It really does a great job. I think I would have saved on Periodontist bills if I had bought this toothbrush years ago. My teeth feel so clean after I use it. It gets rid of every bit of plaque. I can't really tell the difference between the flossing brush and the polishing brush. The different speeds are unnecessary. I only brush on the highest speed, and I would think most people would do the same. The display is very easy to read. Great toothbrush.
