review/text: I purchased this product after breaking my back in a car accident. The resulting brace prevented me from twisting enough to...well...clean up. This product is made well and is very robust. It is a bit time consuming to load paper, but the paper seems to release well and easily. I'm not sure if the release button would work well for elderly users as it is fairly awkward to press.My only real complaint is that the price with shipping was almost $50 which I think is about 2x how much it should cost.
