review/text: Right now it is summer time, and our Arthritis is not felt much.We take it all year long. When winter comes we are not in as much pain as we use to be, and function very well.I have tried other type of Arthritis vitamins, but none has helped as much as Arth-X Platinum has.I notice the name has been changed to ActivJoint platinum, but comparing both Arth-X and this , theyare the same.I only take two aday, although it says to take more. My husband takes two aday in the summer, andsometimes 4 aday (twice a day) in the winter. We live in the mountains in Ca.get snow,and live at the beach .These are a pill, and some what large. Wish they where a capsule that are easier to take. Afterawhile you get use to them.Love this product ,I would not be with out them.Keep a extra bottle in the pantry.
