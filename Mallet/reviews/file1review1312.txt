review/text: If you are nervous about slipping in the shower or don't have good balance, don't get this! It really needs little suction cups or something to stay in place. You have to step on it with one foot to be able to use it on the other foot and it just left me tipping and almost falling every time. I ended up using in on the carpeted floor, sitting on the couch and even then, it was difficult to file every angle of my heel. Wouldn't recommend if you want a good file on your feet.
