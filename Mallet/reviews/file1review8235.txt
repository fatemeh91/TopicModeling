review/text: I have tried and bought over 5 baby bottle brushes in the past 2 months. I looked all over for one that cleaned well and wouldn't fall apart after a week! I am so happy I found this one. It looks like it would be stiff, but it's not. The bristles are soft and works great for baby bottles, water bottles and glasses. It really gets in to clean all the corners. I don't worry about it scratching the plastic at all. It has a long handle and it's well made. It even has blue bristles at the bottom so you can see through the suds.
