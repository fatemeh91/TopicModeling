review/text: These are by far the best clippers I have owned. I have not paid for a haricut in more than 7 years. Before these, I owned a cheap Conway clipper. They ended up tearing the hair out as oppose to cutting. The Wahl's are far superior in build quality, noise reduction and smooth cutting. Excellent product! Highly recommended.
