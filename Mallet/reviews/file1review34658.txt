review/text: My 88 year old great-aunt swears by this stuff. She says it cured her ulcers. I do know she was bleeding from the mouth (from stomach). She ask me to order this for her. I was a bit skeptical but figured she was old enough to know whats good for her and the meds were not working. Each morning she woke with blood on her pillows .. so much that the pillows needed to be discarded. She got this stuff and no more blood. She says this did it. She swears it's good for all sorts or things (natural cures). She takes this stuff every day and cooks some things in it. She is doing better.... she says it's the oil.
