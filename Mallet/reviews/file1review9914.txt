review/text: As always Tweezerman tweezers do the job. I love how pointed and sharp these tweezers and it makes them great for ingrown hair. The sharp tips allows you to pierce the bump and force the hair free. Although these are more expensive than your regular run of the mill tweezers, they are definitely worth it.
