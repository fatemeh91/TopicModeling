review/text: The main part of the Gillette Fusion(r) is indeed better than the Mach III(r). The shave is close, smooth and free from razor burn. The lack of razor burn is remarkable with a new blade.But the extra single-blade is another matter altogether. Because the main 5-blade setup is so big, some provision had to be made for tight spots like under the nose. It's an old-fashioned single blade. I really don't remember when I last used a single blade. I think that's why I dislike shaving. Oww, yes, it's that old-time razor burn in spades.So after any shave you can contrast the burn beneath your nose with the smooth, closely-shaved, unharmed skin on the rest of your face.After their big-buck R & D efforts, Gillette needs a way to solve this.(Or use a Mach III under your nose and the new Fusion on the rest of your beard.)BTW, somehow they seem to have solved the clogged-blade problem that haunted the 4-bladed Shick Quattro.
