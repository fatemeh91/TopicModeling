review/text: Both my daughter and I love this tub. I started using it with her when she was about 6 months old (when she was able to sit up well). It is comfy for her and she loves playing with her tub toys in this mini size tub. It is very easy to give her a bath in it. I like it 100% better than the swivel chair that is out on the market. It is also great to lean the baby back a bit to wash and rinse their hair. It's a great transition tub. It is a definate must have...
