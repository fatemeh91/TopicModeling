review/text: This stuff is really potent. It's truly the best Green Powder I've found to date.You can pay less out there for other seemingly similar powders, but, no joke, do yourself a favor and buy this instead.It's worth way more than the regular stuff out there in potency value alone. You get what you pay for.I wrote this review in the spirit of saving you some time by avoiding the trial and error approach.Just at least try this first.You'll be amazed at the new found energy and alertness you experience, and say goodbye to colds as long as you're on this stuff.It really kicks your immune system up a notch or two. It's like having a force field against bugs and sniffles, especially if you have kids.You know how easy it is pass a cold back and forth from your kids. Say goodbye to that as long as you're on this stuff.I truly couldn't recommend this stuff any more highly. Just order it and see for your self.Sincerely,Jason Bunner
