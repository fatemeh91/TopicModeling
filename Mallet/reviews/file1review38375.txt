review/text: I have been using an epilator for years, so this was a replacement. The price was most reasonable, the performance is fantastic. This one works great on the fine hairs without a lot of breakage. For those first time buyers, yes it will hurt. But with every use the pain diminishes and the hair becomes finer. Pays for itself in a short period of time. I would have given a five rating but the cord placement is a little awkward. Great buy!
