review/text: Worked great until one day when it wouldn't turn on. Changed the battery, cleaned the contacts, disassembled and reassembled the head/blade section, and nothing. The thing just up and died on me. For fifteen bucks it's not worth pursuing a repair or a warranty but I just want to warn prospective buyers that this is a distinct possibility. Still, it worked fine until this happened.
