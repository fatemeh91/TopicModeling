review/text: I tried many brands of diapers on my children (I have 5 total). While these seem good enough and are similar to pampers cruisers in many ways like efficiency, price, availability, what I wasn't impressed with were the chemicals used in these diapers. Next to baby skin it didn't seem worth it, there was also and increased incidence of diaper rash and irritation for my children with these. Besides chlorine and the other environmentally damaging chemicals used to produce these diapers, they are loaded with petroleum based absorbers and other irritants. The problem is that the earthy diapers don't offer the same level of dryness protection, or so I thought. I switched to Natra-care Naty Baby diapers which, believe it or not, actually keep my baby drier than Huggies supreme, are environmentally responsible, and biodegradable. Sorry Huggies.p.s. I don't work for the Naty baby diaper company. With over 10 million disposable diapers going to landfills daily, I think Huggies needs to step it up and do better. Even their natural brand is misleading and promotion is full of 'greenwashing'. Too bad!
