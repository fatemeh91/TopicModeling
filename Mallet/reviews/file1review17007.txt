review/text: I do regularly shave, but due to boils in my skin, I am unable to shave and I was growing beard. So decided to trim off extra hair, I searched for a cheaper yet better trimmer and found the reviews about this product.Ordered and got it in 2 days. Thanks to Amazon for super fast shipping. Got well before...Initially I didn't know how to use it and I was in a feeling that is it really trimming... But after reading the instructions, I figured it out how to use it and trust me it gives a closest shaved look without touching the skin and no plucking sensation and irritation. Its very handy to hold and do under arm trimming too.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to maintain trimmed mustache/goatee/french beard
