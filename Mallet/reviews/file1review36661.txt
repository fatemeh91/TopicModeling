review/text: I ran out of my soap and I had to use this Irish Spring bar soap which was the only soap available in the bathroom cabinet and to be honest the scent was just too strong and overpowering! It may be a fine soap for guys but personally it's a bit strong for girls, at least it is for me. I would only recommend this soap to people who like their soap to have a strong potent scent!
