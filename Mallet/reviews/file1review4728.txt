review/text: This product is great I love the fact that you are eating a delicious shake and not feel hungry all the time(like I USED TO).My favorite shake is the cookies and cream I mix it sometimes with the french vanilla and sometimes with the cafe mocha. For those of you that say that it dosen't taste good you are not doing it the correct way. Try this one scoop of vanilla protein, one scoop of cookies and cream and one scoop of french vanilla trust me it will be delicious and if youre willing to spend a little extra try the prolessa.
