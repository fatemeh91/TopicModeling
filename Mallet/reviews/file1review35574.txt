review/text: I bought this for my 86 year old mother who has been falling a lot recently. She was hospitalized twice during the month of November 2011 due to complications from falls. She lives alone and one of her falls was when she was getting up from the toilet, she tumbled forward onto the floor, hitting her head unable to get up all night. This seat gives her stability and extra height when sitting down or rising from the toilet. The hand holds and four legs make it wonderfully stable. I wish now I'd bought her one of these months ago but I'm glad she has it now. She loves it. I plan to get one for my home as soon as I make the decision to have my hip joints replaced. It looks good and works very well. It does not wobble. The secret words are stability, endurance, and trust. Great Product!
