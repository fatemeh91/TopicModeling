review/text: Bought this a month or two ago. I used it about two times a week, for quick trimming. Unfortunately, it's a lot flimsier than it looks, and the slider bar broke rendering the device useless as anything but an edger. The slider will not hold the guard in place any longer, as the two plastic clips on either side fall to the lowest slot regardless of the position the slider is in. It looks sleek but the components are cheap plastic. You might have better luck, but don't be disappointed if it doesn't last more than a month or two.
