review/text: I have tried many different daily multi-vitamins and this is my favorite. It's flavor isn't too strong, it has no added colors, and is food based. Swallowing pills in general can make one nauseated and pregnancy itself brings all sorts of issues- I have never found anything to blame on Rainbow Light's products.
