review/text: I rated this Tweezer 5 stars because it is extremly accurate, sharp when I need it to be at the tip, easy to use, comes with a plastic cover to protect the tip of the tweezer - overall a great product. Nothing bad to say about it it other than I wish it came in different colors! Buy it and you will not regret it!
