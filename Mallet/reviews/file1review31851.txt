review/text: Seems as though some have a vendetta against AOS products, just look at all his other reviews slamming AOS products. I have been using AOS soaps and after shave balms for a while now and they work great, smell great, do exactly as advertised. Are they pricey, yes. However the miniscule amounts that you use (that AOS dispenses) can last for a year so look at the price based on a daily use and you'll see these products cost pennies per use. Highly recommended.
