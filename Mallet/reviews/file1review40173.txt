review/text: I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a "throwback" toothpaste. It's very simple stuff down to the flavor, no crystals, no magic strips, no flavors from an alternate universe, no voodoo magic, just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights. It's fairly light, tastes like some sort of generic mint, and cleans very well. Apparently it's good at whitening. But the best part is that it's dirt cheap. It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste, basically. Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you). I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste.
