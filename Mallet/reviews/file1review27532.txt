review/text: I've been using ON 100% Whey for about 2 year now, and I will continue to use it. It's a great product. My favorite is Chocolate, I've tried others such as vanilla, and cookies 'n cream, but I did not like the taste. However I like to mix it with banana and straberry. This is it a great product and I will continue to try other flavors as well.
