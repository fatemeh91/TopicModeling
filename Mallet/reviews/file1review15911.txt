review/text: I was having really bad hip and lower back pain in my third trimester - so terrible that sometimes at night I couldn't walk without help. This belt fixes it immediately - you just put it on whenever the pain starts. I don't usually write product reviews, but this was such a help to me I thought I would let other people know. The only downside I can see to this is that it's a little too snug to wear all day - luckily I only need it for a few hours in the evening.
