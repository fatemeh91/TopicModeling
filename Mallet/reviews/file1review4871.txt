review/text: Willow bark makes wonderful tea, but I have found more enjoyment of my coffee by adding just a tiny pinch to my grounds before brewing; my aspirin a day, so to speak. Willow bark is exactly this, aspirin in its natural form rather than chemically assembled. It does not work as fast, but works longer and better; IMHO. DO NOT USE this product for ingestion if you take blood thinners or have thin blood as you will begin to bruise easily and bleed when you would not normally! ASK your doctor before using past a random cup of tea for stress relief or pain relief though it is probably a good idea to mention its use in any case. Regular usage comes with side-effects and these must be independently evaluated by each person as no two people react the same.My personal benefit:1) Inflamation around the bouchard nodes on my finger joints have stopped being inflamed and have ceased to grow.2) General mobility has increased due to lessening of pain in my joints.3) My morning coffee tastes like coffee from 20 years ago in its great flavor.4) It replaces formulated chemicals, aspirin, with naturally occuring chemicals.5) My white head and chest hair began to turn brown again after 6 months of usage though it did not change my beard.A friends daily usage has her able to work up to 6 hour shifts after two months usage rather than the struggling to stay afoot after 3 hours previously.I will NOT guarentee this to be an alternative to anyone or that it will work for everyone the same way as these are my experiences and that of a friend as we share the orders. It also must be stated that I live in extreme pain as a disabled veteran and take no opiates or synthetics for pain. Willow bark coffee and tea do not alleviate this pain completely though it does make it more bearable at times.
