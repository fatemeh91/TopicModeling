review/text: ABC offered this product, as well as all its products, with a free shipping promotion if items ordered totaled $100.00 or more. Naturally, due the weight of this item, the free shipping offer was a fantastic promotion. Unfortunately, shortly after ordering, I was notified that ABC was "out of stock" and, therefore, my order was cancelled. Now . . . perhaps I am being inordinately suspicious but I suspect the order was cancelled due to ABC's unwillingness to honor promotion. IMO, it either should not offer products for sale that are "out of stock" or merely suspend the transaction until products are, again, in stock. Bad business practice.
