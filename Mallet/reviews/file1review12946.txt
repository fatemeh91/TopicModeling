review/text: When my kids or I am starting to show signs of sickness or if there's alot going around at school I dose them with this and it totally helps keep them well. I wish the taste was a bit better but my kids take it from a dropper and i get it down fast. This doesn't take anything away that's already there but it helps to support your immune function working in top form! I have also used this on cold sores as there's colloidal silver in it and if you get it right when it's itching and keep applying it with a q tip it totally has worked to ward it off!
