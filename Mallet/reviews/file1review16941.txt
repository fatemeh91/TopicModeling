review/text: The decision to buy or not buy this product should be based on you liking or not Phillishaves.If you know you like to shave with this kind of shaver, this product is one of the best out there, for a nice price.I just didn't like it much because it doesn't cut close enough (Mach3 does a much better job), and it is quite hard and painful to shave the neck.Just don't give up on the first days, your experience with this product will improve significantly after 2 or 3 weeks of exclusive use. The manual says that and it is true.
