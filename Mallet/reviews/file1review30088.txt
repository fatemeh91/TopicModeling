review/text: I'm doing this little review in case anyone's wondering what the "Twilight Crush" color looks like. The colors aren't described well, and all of the colors in the picture aren't listed, so you can't easily tell which is which. Now clicking on a color choice will bring you a single product on the screen, which is better than a few weeks ago, when I bought mine.I mistakenly thought that the shimmer of the Twilight Crush pillow was distorting the way the color appeared in the picture, and it was that pretty color of rose that the girl's holding. Instead, it's a strange, shimmery green and burgundy red color, quite similar to the picture they have up now, but where the picture looks brown, it's actually much more red. That shimmery green is the dominant color, however, and the red is more of a "background" color. In my opinion, it's not very pleasant to look at, but it smells good, and maybe I'll get used to the odd color combination. If I could do it over, I'd go for the blue feather color choice...I'd also wondered why it has the funny little heart sewn onto the front of the pillow. That's actually a little pocket, inside which is a very small cloth scent packet. The rest of the filling is accessed through a velcro pouch on the back of the pillow. Open it up, and you'll find a pouch of unscented buckwheat. This is quite nice; in case you don't like the way the scent smells, you can remove it; and also so you're not over-heating the scent packet when you heat the buckwheat packet!
