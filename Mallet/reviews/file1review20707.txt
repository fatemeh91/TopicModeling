review/text: I never thought I'd say anything bad about my Braun 8585 shaver, but the replacement foils and cutterblock have ruined a wonderful product.Here's what happened....I used my original blades and foil for 2 to 3 years. The shaver gave me a GREAT shave. Then I replaced those blades with replacement foil and cutterblock. What a mistake! Apparently Braun was bought out by Gillette in 2005. Gillette changed the design of the blades and moved the manufacture of them to China. Well, now blades that are supposed to last 18 months only last 2-3 months. They are HORRIBLE.I am so frustrated because it now takes me 3 times as long to shave and the results are just terrible. The shaver is cutting my face and not my hair. Yesterday, I ordered a Panasonic shaver because I can't afford to replace the blades every 2-3 months and get a crappy shave.I used to love this shaver. What a shame.
