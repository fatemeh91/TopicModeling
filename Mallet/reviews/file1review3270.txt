review/text: OK I admit it is a wee bit smaller than I thought it would be but either my old tweezers really sucked or else this one is a high performance one. I love how precisely it grabs hair and pulls it out, and leaves nothing behind. I used it for eyebrows and above lips and love the performance. I am so glad I decided to throw away the old tweezers. Great performance, thank you Tweezerman! So far, you got a customer for life!!
