review/text: This little tool is just simple and to the point. It does exactly what you'd expect it to do and the bristles on the brush are hard enough to actually scrub off hardened food. I would have given it 5 stars, but everytime I fill up the brush with soap and screw on the rubber cap, some of the soap squirts out so I feel like it's not quite perfect.
