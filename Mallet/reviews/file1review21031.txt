review/text: Used this product before it works great and the price offered here is unbeatable, however Nutricity ships these out apparently, I ordered this with Expediated or 1 nite shipping on October 2nd, Now October 12th and amazon emails me saying it hasn't been shipped yet due to the provider and reasons are unknown. So it's a little false advertisement, but these are great to use, quick mass, better pumps, especially when you stack these with no2 it enhances the effects of both. But just thought I'd give everyone a heads up, if you're ordering, don't expect to receive it for weeks.
