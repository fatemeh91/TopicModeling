review/text: This product is amazing. I first purchased it from a spa on a cruise and was told I could not find it in any store. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for much less. The lather it creates is extremely luxurious and the aromatherapy of the ingredients is unique and rich. But the best thing about it is that it actually works. It detoxes the muscles so well, it will make you have to leave the tub for a potty break to flush the toxins from your body. After the tub soak, you are left feeling soooo relaxed. Just wrap a robe around yourself and meditate for a while.
