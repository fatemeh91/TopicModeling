review/text: Between making my purchase and receiving my items, I found this item for half the price. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I had misunderstood the 2-count (pack of 2) description. Each order has a total of 4 containers. Needless to say I am happy that I ended up with the item for exactly the right price and I have a few extras on hand. I am very impressed with how it seals and prevents liquids from leaking into the other compartments. I can now send my child's sandwich, applesauce and popcorn all in one container and not worry about them mixing up.
