review/text: I wanted a quick way to freshen the white carpeting (came with the house) without dragging out the big vacuum. I remembered using a Hokie way back when I was a chambermaid. But this ain't it.It worked acceptably on bare floors but no great performance. One the rug, it pushed the dog hair so it would pile it. It would have been funny looking if I hadn't waited so long to get the sweeper and then, had to send it back.
