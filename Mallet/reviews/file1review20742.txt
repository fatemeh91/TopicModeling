review/text: I bought a Braun Activator shaver because I was tired of nicks, cuts, and irritated skin. I had tried electric razors in the past but they never did a good job shaving (especially my neck) and were always a pain to keep clean. The Mach3 tripple blade razors did a great job giving me a close shave, but sometimes TOO close. So on a whim I decided to try this shaver. I figured it might be a $100 gamble.The results were pleasing. To be sure, it doesn't shave as closely as the Mach3 blade did. But it did shave close enough to last through the day. I was also pleasantly surprised that it was able to cut my difficult neck whiskers, something that all my previous electrics failed to do.I typically run the cleaning step every other day, shaking out the shavings on the off days. This helps the cleaning fluid last a wee bit longer. The cleaning fluid also leaves a slightly lubricating film on the shaver which helps it glide smoothly across the skin.One warning about the self cleaning part: It buzzs and whirs off and on for about 10-15 minutes (depending on the cleaning cycle). If you're a light sleeper, run it later.Why only 4 stars out of 5? If it gave just a wee closer shave I would have given it 5 stars. Overall, its a great shaver.
