review/text: Beanpod candles are nice. Try them and you will see they have a smooth burn and nice aroma. I tried the automatic shipment program with Amazon.com thinking I could get a different candle fragrance each month, but I could find no way to do this at this time I am writing this. Pricing on Amazon.com is good. I would have paid more in a physical store paying the sales tax than I would buying the candle and paying the shipping charge. I know, I tried and it would have cost over $25 in a store for the 25oz size. Yankee Candles I used for about a year, but the Beanpod candle is just better in all aspects and on Amazon.com is much cheaper than buying in a physical store.
