review/text: I love this tea, I almost don't want to review it and tell others, because it's too good. For those who are coffee drinkers, it's a darker, richer tea. Whenever I serve it to my company they want to get their own box of it. It has a great flavor, black or however you want to dress it up. I would highly recommend this tea to any tea drinker or coffee drinker.
