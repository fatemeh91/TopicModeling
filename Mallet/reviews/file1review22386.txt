review/text: These are great -- we have two so that when one is dirty, we can have a clean one. But they snag, very easily, in the washing machine. A lot of times, I find that it works just as well to use the changing table pad without a cover -- the plastic is much easier to clean up and you don't have to do laundry. A receiving blanket over the plastic cover works just as well, and washes up better ;)
