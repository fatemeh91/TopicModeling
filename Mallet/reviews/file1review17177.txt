review/text: I do not recommend this trimmer. I have a light beard to keep in shape, and thus twice I bought this product through Amazon. On both, the rechargeable battery died shortly after the short warranty. Non-replaceable battery. Remington wouldn't help. I even offered to pay for new batteries, but no go. Obviously these are designed to be completely disposable. That bothers me. I bought the second cause it was cheaper than before and I thought the first failure might have been a fluke. That one is on me. I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone.
