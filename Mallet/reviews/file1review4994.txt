review/text: I am baffled by the bad reviews posted about these wipes. (?)These wipes work perfectly.They work great on my glasses and my daughter's, even though her's get really dirty & even greasy.And they work great on our digital SLR camera.Plus, they are about half the price (or maybe less) than the Bausch & Lomb wipes!I cannot understand why some people have such problems with them.I almost got the Bausch & Lomb wipes instead, even though they are about twice the price, because of some of the bad reviews.But I took a chance on these and I am delighted!Plus, I'm not wasting money by paying about twice as much for the same thing...
