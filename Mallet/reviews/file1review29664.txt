review/text: These pads don't stay in place. I will go to remove them to feed and find them way off center, sometimes barely behind my bra. They also are not very absorbent - when they do stay in place and I leak (at night) I still leak through my shirt. So really these pads don't provide any protection. I do use the avent disposable pads and I like those a lot. Will go back to those until I find Washable ones I like.
