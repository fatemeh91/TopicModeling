review/text: I am a klutz who does not like stains, so Tide to Go saves the day if used immediately after the "accident".The way I use it is(1) blot the stain with a paper napkin(2) put a paper napkin under the stain(3) take of the cap, and rub the stain from the top(4) blot the stain with a paper napkinRepeat one more time if necessary.I have tried this with beef gravy, wine, soda, tea, ketchup, lipstick. Lipstick was not removed, but it works fairly well on the other stains. It worked equally well on cotton, nylon, and polyester.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.
