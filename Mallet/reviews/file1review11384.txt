review/text: I just picked up a case of this product because I got my wisdom teeth pulled, and I am suprised at how good it tastes. This really beats jello and ice cream while my mouth is healing, plus it's filling. The only thing I dislike about it is that is leaves a thick, chalky residue in my mouth. Maybe it is more noticeable to me because I can't rinse my mouth out properly.
