review/text: Over the past five or six years I've owned two beard trimmers of this model. There are three things I want to say here.Firstly, the earlier model allowed you to trim your beard while it charged. The current model, however, does not allow you to do this. So if you have zero or a low charge, then you have to plug it into the wall and wait. You can't just plug it in and turn the trimmer on. This can be a pain if you travel a lot. For example, you might reach your destination only to find that you have no charge or the charge runs out while trimming. (I once had to trim my beard in 30 sec. spurts, which was a pain. I had to turn the trimmer off for five minutes at a time so that it could regain a usable charge.)Secondly, the trimmer comb (which covers the blades and allows you to adjust the length setting) is somewhat fragile. I've broken two of these. One of them broke while I tapped it against the sink. Another one broke while I was using it against my face. If you look on amazon, you'll find that the trimmer comb is replaceable for $25. (A huge ripoff.)Lastly, I want to qualify these remarks by adding that I've used this trimmer heavily and have taken it with me on numerous trips. Overall, it has held up really well. Take that for what it's worth. But, all in all, I would recommend a different beard trimmer. My next beard trimmer will certainly not be another one of these.
