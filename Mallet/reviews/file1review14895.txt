review/text: I've got many pairs of reading glasses scattered all over the house. Have tried so many different styles/brands, I can't track them all. My pet peeve is the trend for smaller lenses. I had to have to move my head up or down while reading to keep the page in the field of view. These full-size lenses eliminate that. Some brands are just uncomfortable over time - too small. These fit well, are comfortable for hours of reading and I just like the spring hinges, not sure why.After using these for a couple of months, I just ordered 3 more pair and plan to toss out the others I have laying around. I'll let my wife keep my pair of mini-readers in a tube in her purse for when we go to a restraunt and I have to read a menue. :)Gordon
