review/text: My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/jYlSF ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I was told that CoQ1O is a very powerful antioxidant and neutralises free radicals. It is widely used to support healthy cardiovascular. It also works with vitamin E to protect cell membranes (and particularly immune cell membranes) from free radical attack, thus boosting the immune system. CoQ10 is found in virtually every cell in the body, primarily in cellular mitochondria, and it is a vital component of the electron transport chain which generates 95 percent of the body's energy via ATP. It can cross the blood brain barrier and further studies have shown a protective role in delaying dementia.The Dr told me I should take meds to control my slightly elevated blood pressure (138/93). I tried this. I noticed a small difference in my energy level on just the 3rd day. On the 6th day, I increased to 2 capsules per day and began noticing a difference in my severe allergy symptoms as well. After 3 weeks my BP reading is 122/84. My mother has had a high cholesterol problem since her early 20's. She used the product along with Red Yeast Rice( goo.gl/koavD ) to reduce her cholesterol count from 300 down to 167 in just 6 months. Amazing!
