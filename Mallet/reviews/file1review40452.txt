review/text: I have been suffering for a few months from severely dry, chapped, peeling and cracked lips. The sides of my mouth were cracked and at worst times, bleeding every time I opened my mouth. I had tried everything including straight Neosporin and nothing helped. This amazing balm healed me within a few days. Within 24 hours I had about 80% improvement. I am shocked at just how good it is. Hands down best lip balm I have ever used!!
