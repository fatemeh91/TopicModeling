review/text: Purchased this recently with a $1 off coupon from the Sunday paper. I have never used an electric before, but this works really good. I could never get that feeling from a cleaning at the dentist with manual brushing (never expected to). But this brush comes pretty close. Most studies I've read on the manual vs. electric say manual brushing is all you need if done right with the right brush. Probably accurate, but I think I'll stick with this product for awhile.
