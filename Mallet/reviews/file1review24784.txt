review/text: I like Aleve and its generics for its long-lasting effects. Most often, I use it for menstrual cramps. It's great. This past weekend, I needed some Aleve and bought the Aleve liquid gels. Big mistake. When I'm out and about, I often take my pills without water, but these were impossible to swallow without water. They are huge! At least I'm able to get them down with some liquid. I know there are people out there who cannot swallow large pills. If you are one of them, don't buy Aleve liquid gels. I can get the same strength in generic tablet form that is lots smaller.Other than the size issue, they do work the desired 8 to 12 hours. I do need food with them or else I get terrible upset stomach.Of course, you can't take these if you have ulcers, bleeding disorders, are on a blood thinner, have a serious allergy to aspirin, are allergic to NSAIDs or are going in for surgery. It can worsen asthma,too. Did I miss anything? If you are not sure if you should take this, please ask your doctor.
