review/text: I've had two other cheaper brands of these and they never seem to hold the heat. This one is amazing! I love the heat and it works so well, you have to turn it off for as bit or it gets too hot! That's a nice switch. This is far better then the ones who get cold in 20 or 30 min. It's a bit heavier, but also has more room for larger feet...if you need that. Even if you don't need it, the extra room is nice and the height of the water if good too! I use it all the time now and the first day I put some sea salt in the water and noticed some detox effects the next day. I'm thrilled with this unit and I feel it's worth the extra money...since it has no hastle and I actually use it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing, warm, serious foot bath.
