review/text: At almost 50 years old, I had never grown a beard until now. Approaching two months of full beard (I don't like goatees), I needed to start trimming it. I researched reviews of beard trimmers on the Internet, and my first choice was Braun's Exact Power models, but they seem to be available only from continental Europe. What gives?I might have got a Norelco but the wide range of ratings gave me pause. That left the Panasonic ER203K which I just used for the first time.It ran well, seemed well made, and so on, as others have said. Why less than 5 stars then? Because it has no instructions on how to actually trim a beard with it! Maybe I missed that session in Guy's Class, but as a newbie I would definitely appreciate some tips. For instance, I started at the longest setting, ran it around my beard, then reduced it a number until it started cutting. Then I discovered it cut a *lot* more going against the grain, than with. Not surprising, but what's the recommended method? Should I always keep the flat part of the guard against my skin, or hold it at an angle? Is it safe to use without the guard? (I did use it like that a bit to trim the mustache but found my electric shaver trimmer was smaller and thus better). Also it's real hard to read their diagrams to see where the oil should go.Yeah, beard trimmers aren't real high tech and maybe don't need any instructions. But it wouldn't have cost them much to provide some. Otherwise a fine product.
