review/text: I second what all the ladies have been saying about the BEST PERSONAL RAZOR EVER MADE FOR WOMEN! I too have been using it for decades - maybe even since the late 70s when it came out. I never switched. Then suddenly could not find the refills. I was totally dismayed. But now, thanks to online buying, I'm back in business again. I had thrown my last one out when I couldn't get refills so just ordered another Personal Touch with blades. It gives the closest, pain free shave you could ever want. I too tried the newer stuff WHICH IS JUNK! I just hate them. So I'll be happy again when I get my Personal Touch back. Glad to see I was not the only one so impressed with this wonderful ladies shaver.
