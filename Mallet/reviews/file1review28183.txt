review/text: I have been using TrueProtein for awhile but their prices are really expensive. After trying ON Whey I think Im going to stay with it because the quality is comparable and the price is a lot cheaper specially if you do the suscribe and save plan. It also comes with aminogen, a scoop, flavor, and a container all included. The cookies and creme flavor isn't the best but its not bad. The ratio of isolate to concentrate to whey peptides is great for pre and post workout. Five pounds of high quality whey for 33 dollars shipped is a steal. Definitely give this a try.
