review/text: Great claims about slower metabolism than plain sugar, but no glycemic index numbers on the package or website. There are no values for amount of sugar contained or any other nutritional values on the packaging or website. It calls itself "100% Pure Birch Sugar." Actually, Xylitol is an alcohol sugar, as are Mannitol and Sorbitol. When I looked it up, Wikipedia stated, "Xylitol is produced by hydrogenation of xylose, which converts the sugar (an aldehyde) into a primary alcohol." How "natural" is this? There are no warnings about the laxation potential to cause intestinal problems such as diarrhea, flatulence and bloating. Apparently the same processes are not used to refine this sweetener as an often used "surreal step" described for some white and brown sugars. But, there is no information about the processes used to extract this Xylitol as "a byproduct of [trees cut down for]the furniture industry in Finland." The quotes are from the packaging, except for the words between the symbols []or as noted from Wikipedia's website today.The price was ok, and the product is sweet, but contributes to reflux or heartburn for me as much as white sugar does.
