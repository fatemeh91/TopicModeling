review/text: The Back Buddy is my new best friend. Spending my day in front of a computer and reading lengthy documents I experience a lot of tightness in my neck and upper back. The Back Budy has been the cure! I love it so much I bought a second so I could have one at home and one at the office. Perfect for performing your own trigger point therapy. Highly recommend this for anyone with back, neck or shoulder pain due to tight, knotted muscles.
