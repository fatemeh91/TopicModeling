review/text: I usually use the All Free & Clear liquid detergent, but they didn't have that available on Amazon, so I decided to try the powder version of same. It does NOT dissolve well and I now have three extra boxes sitting in my laundry room! The only time I can use it is when I'm washing stuff in HOT water and have time to let the water run so it can dissolve before I put the laundry in. I had to go and buy liquid detergent at the store last weekend so I could do laundry!
