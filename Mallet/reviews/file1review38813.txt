review/text: Well, I think it's delicious because it has a lot of sugar in it so if you're looking for a diet that cuts out sugars, this probably isn't a good idea. I also don't think it keeps me feeling full for more than 2 hrs (nowhere close to the 4 it claims), but it's still a yummy breakfast shake. Like previous reviews have said, the Chocolate Royale is hard to dissolve with a spoon but put it in the blender with low fat/non-fat/or even soy milk with some ice cubes and it's really good!
