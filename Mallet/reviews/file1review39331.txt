review/text: Everyday I wake up in pain, my neck, my back, my shoulders...everything aches..i am a secretary so i spend long hours sitting in front of a computer...it is so hard for me to hold my shoulders back al the time and constantly my neck cracks and gets stiff...so i decided to try this product...The pros:-It really does help hold your shoulders back-You can sleep with it on and drive, etc.the cons:-before i got used to it, my armpits were a little tender-also if you sweat at all during the day it gets on the brace because how it loops under your armpits, so you have to wash it often to get the deoderant, etc. off.- it does ride up a little bit but whenever i first put it on after being washed it is tight and sturdy and stays right in place.I suggest you buy several (like 3 or 4) so that you can wash them often. I used to wear it to bed but now i just wear it while at work and i take it off wheni get home so basically i wear it 8 hours a day.It isn't really that visible through clothes however if you wear a shirt with a lower cut back and wide shoulders, you can see it peak through...ive gotten some odd looks before. You cant really reach up when this things on and u need to keep your arms pretty close against your body.Overall- definately 5 stars.. my chiropractor recommended this because i have several posture problems due to my shoulders slouching forward. this product doesnt completely hold your shoulders back by itself but the feeling that its there is the reminder to go with it and let your shoulders sit how it is correcting them. GREAT PRODUCT!
