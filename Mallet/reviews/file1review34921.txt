review/text: Dont like the time release..Prefer the regular melatonin. Disappointed. Bought a two pack because it was the best deal economically but it hasn't worked for me and now I'm unable to return 2nd bottle because it's too late but had no way of knowing it's quality until giving it a reasonable try. Would not buy again. Very disappointed. Have had to resort back to sleeping pills because this failed to live up to what was advertised. I thought the time release would be a step up and better but it's not. The regular melatonin worked better. Upset that I cant return the 2nd bottle. It's useless to me! Wasn't a bargain or good deal afterall.
