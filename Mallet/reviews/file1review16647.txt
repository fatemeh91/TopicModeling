review/text: I think I lost my Zippo last week when I went out to blow up some fireworks, but I love this thing! It runs out of fuel if you just let it sit for awhile though... But other than that, this thing is great! I bought this thing mainly because it's a classic that I believe everyone should have, and it is windproof.
