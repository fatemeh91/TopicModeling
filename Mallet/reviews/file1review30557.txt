review/text: I tried this because I am a bit unsure about the safety of using aluminum-based deodorants; there are some studies that suggest a link to conditions such as Alzheimer's. The deodorant smells nice, and is far from overpowering. It's not heavy-duty deodorant by any means, but if you're not going to be exerting yourself (or if you just don't sweat much) it'll probably do the job.
