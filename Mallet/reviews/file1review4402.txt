review/text: I have been using Gillette razor blabes for over 50 years and what amazes me is that every new razor surpasses the previous great razor. This new Fusion razor is by far the the best to date. Shaving is so much faster, easier and smooth. Personally, if this was the last version of Gillette, I would use the Fusion until my last shave.
