review/text: These diapers are my favorites, followed closely by Bumgenius. I'm a fan of AIOs and Pocket diaps, but you should know that when I ordered these I ordered the snaps AND the touchtapes, and the ones with snaps didn't come with a free insert. The ones with touchtape were all there.These diapers are pricey, but the best quality. THey dry fast and are super, super absorbent. I absolutely love them... and they are the only ones on the market to come in cute colors and designs. yay! Save all your baby money and spend it on a good set of these instead of all the other stuff your baby will outgrow in a few months.
