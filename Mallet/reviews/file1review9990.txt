review/text: I was a certified trainer in college and still have retained my certs but no longer train people other than friends and family.One thing the average person buying or using fat calipers has no clue of is that proper use of fat calipers TAKES PROPER TRAINING!!!!!!! I have seen some doctors use them so poorly, it was pathetic and my extreme pleasure to correct them and embarrass them in front of their patients.Here are some very important things to know -#1 - On average, you need to perform over 100 measurements under supervised instruction before you really know what you are doing with calipers. Yeah! It is not as simple as you would think.#2 - Measuring yourself can be the most difficult thing to accomplish. I can do it for myself very well but still normally do not do it for myself. I have another trusted and well instructed trainer do it for me.#3 - You have to know specifically where to pinch. It must be precise. If you are off by so much as a centimeter...it can make a huge difference. So learn the proper locations and use a tape measure and be precise!#4 - The Accu-Measure manual will not fully teach you what you need to know. Sorry. You will need to find a local course at a college, sports therapy center, etc. then practice, practice, practice.#5 - When you know what you are doing, measure the same location 3 times. YES! 3 times!! Then take the average of those 3 measurements as your final number and record it in your log.#6 - Finally, fat calipers are guides. GUIDES. They are not going to tell you body fat to the tenths of a percent level. Instead,So do not expect perfection folks. More than likely, it is you, the user, that does not implement this tool correctly. For the average person who takes the time and develops there skill...the Accu-Measure product line is really the best and most affordable solution!
