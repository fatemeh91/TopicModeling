review/text: I'm not really a toy type of person so pretty much it was read some reviews and make a choice.Firstly it was much bigger than I anticipated! The size (at least for myself) was very intimidating and I'm still not sure if it's really the right "fit" for me.One big complaint on here is about the rubbery smell that emits from it. I didn't find this to be an issue at all. If you stick it right in your nose, yes, it stinks like rubber. I washed mine well before using and still noticed some smell but nothing that interfered in any way with my activity. Also complaints about this product not being soft of flexible are unfounded in my opinion. Even the ears are very soft and pliable. I found the "rabbit" part of this product especially enjoyable! The beads...I didn't really notice them to be honest but that also speaks to another complaint, I didn't notice any pain or "scraping" mentioned in some of the reviews. Other than that I have to say this is a VERY effective device! I mean...wow! The rubber is smooth and soft with some nice textures, the vibration is excellent and the controls are really simple. Also, it's very quiet! I have a small apartment and a roomie who knew I was expecting this in the mail. When it arrived she laughed as I headed straight for my bedroom to try it. Afterward I questioned if she had heard "anything" and in good humor she insisted she hadn't heard a sound. :-DHighly recommend this quality product! I've looked other places and have seen this priced at almost $80! Amazon rocks!
