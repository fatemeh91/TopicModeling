review/text: I gave this product three stars and not one merely because it was delivered as promised and the product was of high quality. That being said, l-arginine doesn't do much. Its supposed effects are minor and studies show NO production is better manipulated with citrulline mallate. This product tastes TERRIBLE. I thouight I'd be able to bear it. As soon as I took a sip of it dissolved in water, I barfed my brains out. I haven't puked in 4 years, stomach viruses exempt.Awful, awful, awful taste.
