review/text: This item is effective at blocking out the light and it's concave design providing space around the eyes is comfortable. The material it is constructed out of is also comfortable. My one complaint is the strap. Being that it is a single strap it tends to slip around, especially while you sleep. Ultimately it tends to slip down and pull on the tops of your ears. I have often woken up with my ears sore from having the elastic band pulling on them. I took to wearing the band low and over my ears to avoid this issue. It works but is slightly uncomfortable. All in all it is an ok product. Would have been 5 stars if there had not been that issue.
