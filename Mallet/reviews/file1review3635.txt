review/text: For the PRICE! Needless to say that I was much disappointed about the product when I realized that the scrapper is nothing more than an embedded simple razor blade in a plastic handle. I wish manufacture of these stove would tell you that you can use one to scrape burn remaining on glass top. The pad is useless, much smaller than it looks on the packaging at amazon while a regular non-scratch scrub sponge less than $1 would suffice.
