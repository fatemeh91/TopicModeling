review/text: I'm always searching for a perfect amber and this one comes close. I don't know about "hotter" (as it says in the description) but it seems somewhat darker than most ambers, if that makes sense. It's very resiny, with a little hint of something woody at first and not at all powdery, has staying power and I love it a lot. It's very thick and a small amount of it goes a long way. I'd recommend wearing it alone or layering it with other scents to boost their amber content.
