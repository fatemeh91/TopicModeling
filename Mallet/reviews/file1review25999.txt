review/text: I already have one Mind fold mask, I love it so much I bought this one as a back-up. I use mine primarily for Trance dancing and doing Holotropic Breath work. Works like a dream, blocks out all light and I have the choice of keeping my eyes opened or close. Often while trancing I like to roll my eyes up slightly this mask makes it easy. Strap is adjustable, which is nice because with my hair up it becomes bulky, I can make it as tight or as loose as I want it. I've had my old one for 3 years now and I sweat alot while dancing and it's still in great condition.
