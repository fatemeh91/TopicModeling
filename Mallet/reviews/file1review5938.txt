review/text: this cup is awesome, the bottom container holds 2 scoops of my protein powder, which are large scoops. and under the lid the spiral angled insert breaks up clumps nicely, and it hold the handy ice pack for those of you who like to take your protein with milk and cant get to a fridge for a few hours. lid doesn't leak at all (YET, after 4 months of use)
