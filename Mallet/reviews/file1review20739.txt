review/text: This was my first foil razor in years, I basically decided to get it based on the strength of the reviews here, as my old Norelco rotary shaver was giving up the ghost.I didn't like my first foil shaver (a Remington) because the foil design made it hard to get all the hairs shaved, especially if I went for a couple days without shaving. All the extra passes it took trying to get everything into the foil holes would also cause irritation.This shaver, however, has a more complicated foil design. Rather than being a simple mesh of circular holes, this foil has holes and slots in a pattern that basically gives a lot more ways for a hair to enter the foil and get cut. I still wouldn't say it's "as close as a blade" but in my experience, no electric is. However, it's certainly as close as my Norelco was, just as fast, just as easy and the cleaning/charging system is nice.I also appreciate that the razor can be plugged in and recharged directly so if I take a trip, I don't have to take the base and cleaning stuff with me, just the razor and the cord.It came down to this or getting a new Norelco Advantage, which I also liked. In terms of comfort, the Norelco Advantage has a bit of an edge because I did like the integrated gel dispenser, in terms of a close, quick shave I'd say they're about even but the Braun self-cleaning system is quite nice, using a lightly scented alcohol solution to give the razor a good cleaning between uses.I'm happy with my purchase.Edit:2 year update -- I still use it and like it. No problems either with the shaver or the cleaner. I've replaced the head and the blades once (seemed like the thing to do, not because they were broken or anything) and still use it daily.
