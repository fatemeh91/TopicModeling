review/text: I've tried several electric toothbrushes and finally found the one for me. I have a small mouth and sensitive gums and this one has a "gentle" setting plus a small round brush head. Since using an electric toothbrush my gums have improved greatly. I've had this model for 3 years and just bought this one for my vacation home.
