review/text: I purchased this product a year ago; looking back, however, I believe I fell victim to such great reviews... a little too great. Some posts goes from one month to the next. Others are posted a day apart with similar titles such as "relief!" or "immediate relief!" Ugh. I should have been more suspicious. Oh, and the product did nothing for my Tinea Versicolor. :(
