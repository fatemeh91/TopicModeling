review/text: I bought 3 flavors so far of Gold Standard Whey Protein: vanilla ice cream, extreme milk chocolate, and delicious strawberry. In the past, I never liked any chocolate-flavored protein drinks. I read other recommendations and decided to purchase it. This company proved me wrong. The Extreme Milk Chocolate is so delicious that you can mix it with water and you will love the taste. I also like the vanilla ice cream flavor. However, I was vey disappointed with the delicious strawberry flavor, because it is nothing delicious about it. I honestly can't stand the taste. It just taste very "chemical." I have to try other flavors, but my stable flavor might just be Extreme Milk Chocolate.
