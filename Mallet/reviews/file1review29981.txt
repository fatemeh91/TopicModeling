review/text: I will not take too much vitamin B6, because it can have negative long term health consequences.13 mg of Vitamin B6 are added to each serving = 650% RDV. I already take 1/2 of aSource Naturals B-125 Complex, 180 Tablets. To remedy this extraordinarily high level of B6, I have adjusted my daily dosages of other supplements which contain vitamin B6.
