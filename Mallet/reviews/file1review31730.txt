review/text: I have three or four of these little gems and recommend them highly! While any kit this small is going to be pretty bare-bones, when the chips are down better the basic kit in your pocket than the 30 pound Bug-Out Bag sitting back in your living room. And all the basics are represented by very high quality items; I'm actually very impressed. The Fox whistle is very, very loud, and the signal mirror is superb. Heck, both of them are fairly expensive on their own. The Spark-Lite firestarter, when used with the supplied tinder, is amazing. I've seldom failed to light the tinder on the first strike. Again, it's small enough that there are compromises. Water is very important but is hardly addressed. You are supposed to be able to make a cup from the foil but good luck with that. The kit is designed to be non-expiring, which is why water purification tabs arent' included. Fortunately there's just enough room in the kit for a few SMALL additions. I added a small aqua-pouch to mine.I should also point out that this kit is a screaming bargain (at least when I bought mine- the price probably varies). The kit is actually a fair bit cheaper than you can buy the individual components on their own. When Amazon had a subscription for this item I stocked up. Then I parted a couple kits out to make slightly more elaborate kits.All in all a very well thought out mini PSK. Anyone into camping, fishing, hiking or hunting would be well served to keep a PSK like this on their person whenever venturing into the wild. Hopefully supplemented with a few choice items (eg water, survival blanket) but just the contents of the PSK could keep you alive.
