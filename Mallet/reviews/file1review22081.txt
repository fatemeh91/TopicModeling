review/text: I bought these prior to my son being born/before breastfeeding. I started using these in the beginning instead of the dispoables because they are less wasteful. I found these very bulky and would wake up every morning with soaking wet cotton breastpads, bra, and t-shirt. After that, I switched to the disposable medela breastpads a friend gave me to try; they are super thin and very absorbent and only $10 for a month supply (you only need to use two a day, they are that absorbent).
