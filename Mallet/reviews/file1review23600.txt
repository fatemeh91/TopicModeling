review/text: This product works really well. It tingles quite a bit when applied, but standing in front of a fan helps. It reduces large pores, fades sun damage, and generally makes your skin look like you have had a professional peel. I always glow after giving myself one. Plan on being a little red for a few hours, so don't do it right before you are going out somewhere. I alternate between this and the pumpkin peel, and would purchase both items again.
