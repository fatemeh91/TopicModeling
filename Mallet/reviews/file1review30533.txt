review/text: I've been using this for over a year and I love it. It has a pleasant smell and so do I! It doesn't stop you from sweating, but that's fine with me. There's a reason we sweat, you know, to cool our bodies when we exert ourselves. But with this product, we don't smell. The perspiration evaporates and this keeps us smelling fresh. My husband ran out of his usual stuff & tried it, now he won't use anything else. We are going to try the sport scent next, to see how he likes that one. Overall I highly recommend it!
