review/text: I have had bouts with insomnia for the past 5 years and took benzodiazepines (prescription sleeping pills) to deal with it. After going thru several sleep pills with bad results, I opted for Triazolem which was ok. However, it was extremely hard to get off this sleeping pill.I found Nutrasleep & took one pill a night, along with one pill of Triazolem & starting getting good sleep again. I very slowly tapered off the Triazolem every two weeks (about 10% cut) until I was finally done with it. Then I tapered slowly off the NutraSleep (about 20% cut) every two weeks until I was sleeping naturally again. Nutrasleep helped cushion the post-benzo period after I was off Triazolem.I follow this method anytime I get a bout with insomnia (about once every few years). I give a lot of credit to the benzobuddies.org forum which helped me much more than any doctor !
