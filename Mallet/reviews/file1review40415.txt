review/text: I was having a few challenges with dry skin and scalp so I thought I would try this. My scalp has dramatically improved since I've been taking these and it's the only change I've made-so I would have to attribute the positive trend toward the vitamins. I will be ordering these again and will continue using as part of my daily regime.
