review/text: Tea helps relaxation when not boiled, try boiling water and putting two iced cubes in water before steeping. Otherwise, the kavalactones are killed by the heat.This tea has awful stevia sweetener. Maybe I'm not just not used to it, but I don't like it. I don't want the tea maker deciding how sweet my tea should be, especially with this trash stevia.
