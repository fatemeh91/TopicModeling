review/text: If you are looking for a product that will curb your appetite, this is it. This is my second can of Animal Cuts. The first was tablets, where these are capsules. I felt the tablets were better at curbing the appetite, but made me feel a little shakey. That being said, the capsules still work better then other things I've tried. These mixed with a good exercise program are tools to having a great body.
