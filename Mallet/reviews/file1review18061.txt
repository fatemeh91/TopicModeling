review/text: This product probably doesn't need another five-star review, but it deserves one. I do a lot of long-haul flights to Europe and Asia. I typically carry a cheap-o sleep mask (the kind the airlines used to give out for free) in case the person next to me wants to keep a reading light on or open a window onto daylight when my body says it's still night. The cheap masks don't work well, but they're better than nothing.Then, on a recent flight from India, I saw a passenger wearing one of these masks. When I got home I ordered one. The difference between this mask and a cheap one is amazing. The mask is super soft, and the foam bulges out over your eyes, so you don't feel the subtle pressure of a cheap mask. The seal around my eyes is fantastic -- even in a sunny airplane cabin, the mask blocks out all the light. The mask is very light weight -- it adds about as much weight to my carry-on as a toothbrush.The headband is a bit thick, as at least one other reviewer has noted. However I prefer it to the thin bands common on other masks. My experience is that thinner bands slip while I'm sleeping, and the mask slips out of position. I also like the easy adjustability of the velcro band. It's not perfect, but it's better than the other designs I've tried.In a nutshell, this mask is worth its weight in gold for long-haul flights. At only twelve dollars, it's a no brainer. I wish these had been invented years ago. I won't get on a long flight without it now.
