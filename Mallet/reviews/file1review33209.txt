review/text: Bought these about a month or two ago to battle the winter season. As a smoker, a mom of a school-aged child, and a frequent sore throat sufferer, I ALWAYS get sick in the winter months. Ususally by Febuary I have battled either a terrible bout of strep throat, tonsilitis, or a lingering chest/sinus infection.It's almost February, and nada. I've felt my left tonsil swell up twice, but I take a few extra pills before bed and when I wake up I'm good as new. Great product!
