review/text: This is great when you have a headache or back/neck pain. It warms nicely in microwave and is much better than those products that are filled with rice or seeds. It doesn't have an "odd" odor like those filled with seeds. Nice weight to product, conforms to the body very nicely. I have given this item to my sister and to my dad and they both love it as well. Highly recommend this item if you are looking for something that is well made and that can be used for hot as well as cold compresses.
