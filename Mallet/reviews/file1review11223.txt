review/text: This thermometer is not very accurate. I can take my baby's temperature 3 times in 3 minutes, and I will get a different reading each time. If she is not running fever, the reading varies greatly each time, usually well under 97. On a more positive note, when she is running fever, it does seem to be a little more consistent and accurate. It gives a quick reading, and it doesn't bother her at all when I take her temperature under her arm.
