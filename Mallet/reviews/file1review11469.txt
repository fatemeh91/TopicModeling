review/text: This model is ok I guess but I really miss the pop out trimmer of the older model that eventually wore out after several years. Doesn't seem like the choices are that good any more and I would love to find an older Norelco model l ike I had. This model trims the beard ok but the head is too wide to do any detail work and the pop out trimmer was perfect for that. Replaced a Conair unit that had a bad habit of ripping my beard hair out though -- will never buy another Conair product.
