review/text: I can not believe how acute my vision is after cleaning my contact lenses with this solution. I have tried Boston and Alcon (the popular brands) and nothing seemed to take off the built-on protein deposits except professional polishing. THIS STUFF CLEANS BETTER THAN PROFESSIONAL POLSIHING.The delivery was very prompt and I highly recommend this product if you wear rigid gas permeable lenses.
