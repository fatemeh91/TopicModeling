review/text: I have a lot of experience using the Always brand -- they're my preferred brand of feminine hygiene product. I liked these pads, but I mistakenly thought they were going to be thicker. These are much like a panty liner, so I wasn't able to use them a lot. These pads are best suited for women with lighter menstrual periods, and they serve well as a panty liner. I could've used this same type pad during my pregnancy two years ago, especially during the last couple of months when my daughter was pressing on my bladder, causing some embarrassing leakage at times. These would also be good for post-pregnancy, to catch any light bleeding. As usual with Always products, I loved the dry-weave that keeps the top layer dry, and the wings that help secure the pad to underwear. All in all, a very good product.
