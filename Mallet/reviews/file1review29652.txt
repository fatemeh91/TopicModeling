review/text: I bought these thinking they'd be more cost effective than throwing away disposables AND the box says that they have a leakproof back. WRONG!!!! I put them in and nursed my son and BAM, in front of our guests, I leaked through the pad, bra, my shirt AND the blanket. I contacted Avent to discuss the fact that the box is VERY misleading and they never got back with me. Go ahead and buy the cheap disposables, they don't leak!
