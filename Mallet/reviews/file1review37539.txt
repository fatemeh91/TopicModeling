review/text: I have tried many sleep masks over the years and have found this to be the best so far. It is comfortable and does a good job of keeping out most of the light. A tiny bit filters through across the bottom but with my eyes closed it is not a problem .If I tightened it more it might seal completely but not be as comfortable. Some that I have tried in the past had such heavy foam construction that they were not comfortable at all and they were impossible to use when I tried to sleep on my side. This mask stays in place well even when I am on my side. It does not press on my eyes so it does not seem to interfere with eye movements during REM sleep. (I did not use the ear plugs as I just don't like wearing any earplugs.)
