review/text: After reading all the reviews, I decided to order 2 pads for my father who is almost completely bedridden due to Alzheimer's and I must say these pads are great. They are large enough to provide a large amount of coverage. Once my dad is laying on the pad, we use it to reposition my father back towards the head of his hospital-type bed as needed...they are that strong. The pads have already been washed multiple times and seem to hold up perfectly wash after wash. They are very very absorbent. I am ordering another pad today as I have found a great product with these Priva pads.
