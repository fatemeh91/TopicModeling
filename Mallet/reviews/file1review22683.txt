review/text: I ordered this after reading the reviews because my mother had a round faucet. Once we received it, I couldn't get it on her faucet because it was too large for the opening on the hose. I went to purchase a new faucet at the hardware store and took the hose in with me. They only had square faucets but the associate at the Ace Hardware store put the hose on for me. It took quite a bit of strength for him to do it but it did fit. I took the whole set up and screwed in the faucet without any trouble. I wouldn't do this unless you're ready to not remove it. It does work great and I am so happy I ordered this one and everything worked out as it did. You may want to remove your faucet to attach the hose and then push it up on the faucet as far as it will go. You will get a nice strong stream of water from it.
