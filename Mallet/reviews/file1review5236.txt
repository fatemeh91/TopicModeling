review/text: I can't speak for anyone else, but this product caused me severe leg pains that were debilitating. I thought at first that I was just working too hard, but the pains got worse and worse. I stopped the Cordyceps and the pain went away within 2 days. Just to make sure, I started the Cordyceps again and the leg pains returned. Maybe it's just me, but I can't take this stuff!
