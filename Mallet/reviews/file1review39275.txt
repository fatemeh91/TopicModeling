review/text: Have three pair of these. Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces. All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case. The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart. On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right. Wish I could find something better in this style.
