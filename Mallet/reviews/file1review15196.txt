review/text: Thesse bars are great in general - the cookie dough is my favorite because it tastes great and also because the texture is a lot like actual cookie dough. So it's like chocolate covered cookie dough.One of these will tide me over for at least a few hours. I make sure I have a few in my briefcase for long seminar/meeting days and other times when I don't control the meal schedule and want to avoid vending machines. I also don't travel without them. They are a perfect holdover for most plane trips and allow me to avoid airport food or fast food. I also eat one about 10 minutes before working out in the morning before breakfast.The only drawback is that they are sensitive to heat. Once the chocolate coating starts melting - even just a little - it never re-hardens and you end up with a bit of a sticky mess to try to eat it. So I don't carry them through airports in pockets of a light coat that would be close to body heat or leave them in a sunny spot on the counter. This is a bit of a bummer, because what would make this product absolutely perfect would be the ability to throw a few in my center console and always have a few with me. But this is impossible in the summer because they would melt and never re-harden.But overall, these are a lifesaver for keeping me away from fast food and vending machines.
