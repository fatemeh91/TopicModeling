review/text: As other reviewer said, this is slim enough to fit into shoes. It takes a bit of time putting it on and taking it off as the fit is VERY tight; tight enough that you need to remove laces from top 3 holes to take it off.However, once you put it on, you feel your ankle is well-supported and you can concentrate on whatever the sports you are doing. This brace uses dual supporting methods: laces and "figure eight" strap. The instruction says to put the laces up first and then adjust the strap. Well, when you put the laces up, it creates a tight fit which makes it difficult to adjust the strap. What I do is to adjust the strap first, then finish up by tighting the laces up.Overall I am happy with the product. If you do sports with a lot of rapid lateral movements (like soccer), this is a very good product. However, if you are looking for some support for other less intensive sports, this may be a bit too much.
