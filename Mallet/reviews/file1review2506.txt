review/text: I bought this item after testing other methods (home waxing, depilatory cremes, razor shaving and electric shaving) for over a year. I found the results of epilating to be very comparable to those of waxing - the most marked difference is the cost! Waxing, even with at-home kits, quickly becomes a pricey (and messy) venture and in salons, forgetaboutit! This epilator costs less than one trip to the salon, provides equally fine results. Also, that it does a superior job on those "more sensitive" areas with coarser hair than on the legs. If you are prone to ingrown hairs I highly recommend making use of the loofah and "bump patrol after shave intensive treatment", a gentleman's shaving product designed to treat and prevent facial razor bumps and ingrown hairs (it's cheaper than "tend skin" and works better than "bikini zone" . The combination has worked very well for me and freed me from the razor forever! Yay! All hail the epilator!
