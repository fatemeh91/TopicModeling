review/text: I also tried another cheaper brand but it does not have the concentrated formula (85% 3-n-butylphthalide, or 3nB for short) this one does, this brand "Celery Seed Extract by Natural Factors 60 Capsules" definitely feels like a diuretic, with this brand I definitely had to go to the restroom more often, the other brand I just went back to normal, can't say what it's doing for my blood pressure yet, I just reordered more of this one so I only took one months worth but will not be trying any of those other brands. With this brand I actually started loosing belly fat with the diuretic flushing, yes you need to drink extra water as with any diuretic.
