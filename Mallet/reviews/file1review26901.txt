review/text: Although I have not tried that many protein shakes out there(only about a handful), this tastes the best. Even with water, it's drinkable, and with milk, it's actually amazing. Of course, I doubt people would sit there sipping this and savor the art in its taste, but it's better than many other shakes out there. Artificial sugar. I personally prefer real sugar, but you can't really find a good protein shake with real sugar.
