review/text: I don't think I have 'roids as much as I have a spicy food addiction, and sensitive tissues. I can only use wet wipes anymore, because after a hot tasty taco, or anything else I put hot sauce on, I get to itchin' something FIERCE! I used Prep H for years, and some witch hazel wipes, but nothing works like this Ancient Chinese Secret!They're tiny tubes, but you only need a little bit.. it's thick and spreads around nicely when I swirl a finger around my stinger ! Afterward, you'll smell like a damn muskrat... they put artificial Musk Oil in it.. must be the secret ingredient. Bust out some soap and scrub your finger 3 times to get it off !
