review/text: These do not work at all. I have waxed hot and cold wax for years for my own touch ups inbetween salon waxings. This does nothing but pull off some debris if your skin is not spotless. Besides that the price is crazy high considering you will use 4 each time for both upper/ lower on both brows.
