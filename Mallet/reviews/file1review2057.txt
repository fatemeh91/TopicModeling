review/text: PediFix Nighttime Bunion Regulator, Left, MediumI have what one would consider a 'moderate' type bunion. My toe is not out of alignment that much and the 'bump' is noticeable (5 on a scale of 1-10). I bought this product b/c the pain has increased to the point it will sometimes hurt to walk. (I'm already wearing shoes with a wide toebox and have for 20+ years). This splint seemed to work well the first couple nights but shortly thereafter it wouldn't stay on comfortably. The plastic separator began to uncomfortably dig into the area between my toes.If the point is to leave it on overnight to get good results, the item needs to be comfortable. This was not and I have since thrown it away.
