review/text: Got it for about $15 and have been pleased after using for 2+ months. Gives a fairly consistent cut for a hairy chap like me. Able to keep my goatee and sideburns in check. Only takes a couple of minutes to get the job done. Has a solid feel to it and the charge lasts for a while. Only downside is that the rubbery length selector is very hard to turn with wet hands. I always have to dry my hands and the trimmer when turning the selector wheel. Recommended.
