review/text: This makes a reasonable shake, though I make it with milk, not with water. The blender gets it to dissolve the best, rather than just stirring or shaking it. I would like it to be a little more frothy like a milkshake.The chocolate can also be found with soy for those who want the benefits of that.Can't say I lost much weight with this, but I didn't use it regularly. It makes a quick lunch when you are in a hurry and keeps you from eating fast food and junk.
