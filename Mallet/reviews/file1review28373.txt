review/text: purchased this on the recommendation of a friend, word of mouth. very happy overall.tastes fine. as others have said, it's better in milk, but i've also sprinkled half portions into a fruit smoothie from time to time and that's delicious too. it isn't always easy to mix in with a spoon, unless you do it a 1/2 portion at a time.very filling - i use as a meal replacement (often breakfast or dinner right after a run and workout), and am rarely hungry for 3-6 hours afterwards.oh, you might have to dig a little into the mixture to find the serving cup the first time you open this.i'll be getting this again when i run out.
