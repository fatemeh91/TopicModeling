review/text: I've been battling plantar fascitiis for a couple months and decided to get this support to help stretch the tendons in my arch. I can easily move the supports from my tennis shoes to golf shoes. I'm still having pain, but it's much better. I'll be using the supports even after the pain finally quits.
