review/text: Well i purchased this last month (August) and here are the pro's and con's that i found:It is kind of big not huge huge but a tight fitthe metal beads dont seem to hit the right spot and cause more discomfort that pleasure but i have found them to be nice but that was only one time!The clit stimulator - is the best part of this toy! It doesnt even need to be on the highest setting, it is a great first toy, it was mine and it totally showed me a new side of things!
