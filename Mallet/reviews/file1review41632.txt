review/text: Oral B makes a very good product, although it can be tough differentiating among all the toothbrushes they offer. I've had their toothbrushes before, and they have lasted well over three years before the batteries go. They do a nice job of brushing the teeth, and the 30-second timer is handy for letting you know when to switch to a new area of your mouth.
