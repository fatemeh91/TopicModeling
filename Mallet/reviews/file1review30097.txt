review/text: Only problem with this bag is that it is going to cost me a fortune to fill this HUGE bag. LOLNot a professional and got this for med BOB. With all the compartments, dual side pockets with detachable zippered bags in each, and the elastic bands sewn into the top, I could set up one heck of a field station with this.Heavy zippers, reinforced seams, protected bottom with pegs, medium weight material...Could not be happier at this price.If you are a Vol. firefighter or small town first responder that doesn't have a big budget, save your money and buy this bag.Also, to those who denigrated this bag, what were you expecting for this price....gold leaf? I agree the picture used may be misleading, though this bag will hold all the items shown and then some. Read the descriptions and reviews before you buy. If no reviews, contact the seller. Nuf said.
