review/text: My elderly mother suffers from Parkinson's & arthritis. For the past three years or so, she has had to curtail her daily activities. The pain in her legs have had her unable to walk and even do the simple stretching exercises that keep her mobile. She's tried a number of different products. Since starting the Australian Dream Cream, she has more than doubled her walk and has been able to resume simple household chores. To me, it has been quite remarkable.
