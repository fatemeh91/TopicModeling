review/text: I have been using the Hlavilin cream underarm deodorant for 3 years -the same container! I thought I was crazy to pay so much for a deodorant but it has come out cheaper then any other roll-on or stick. Just a tiny amount of cream lasts me for 2 weeks or more. You must follow the instructions when you start the procedure. Also I found that putting on too much gives less effective protection. Dont be tempted to spread it around.Just "a little dab will do it".I dont know anything about a new formula.
