review/text: I ordered this first in XL, the size that should fit me according to McDavid. It was too small for me to pull it up over my knee. So I ordered it in XXL, the next larger size. This one is sloppy loose, and has to be bunched up under the straps in order to stay on at all. So what is a customer to do? Two return charges now, and no size that actually fits. This is a brand name that I will avoid.
