review/text: The Braun 8585 Activator is one of the best shavers I have ever used. It has a self cleaning system where you just place the shaver on the stand and connect that to the power outlet. After that, hit the cleaning button and self cleaning has BEGUN for about 45 minutes. Never EVER worry about cleaning this shaver yourself b/c it does it all for you. The LCD display shows how much power you have and how clean the shaver is. You can even connect the power directly to the shaver and use it. The shaver comes with a plastic case for storage and a small brush to clean. 5/5 stars and I would recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable shave!
