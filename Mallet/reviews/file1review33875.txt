review/text: I've had these a little while now and can say they are high quality and work very well. I can easily hear a heart beat while taking blood pressure and that is why they were purchased. I didn't want to buy a cheap set of "toy" stethoscopes or spend a lot of money on a top end "professional" quality purchase and I think I have hit the perfect balance. Since I don't do medical work I can't say, but I think these would do quite well for a nurse in a clinic setting. I bought the Lilac color since it was less expensive and the sound comes right through them :)I would recommend these to family and friends, and would purchase again if lost or stolen. 5 stars
