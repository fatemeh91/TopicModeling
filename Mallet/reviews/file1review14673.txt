review/text: I've been using this along with Jarrow Formula Acetyly-L-Carnitine 500 mg capsule and Source Naturals Vinpocetine 10 mg tabs. It helps in clearing brain fog, thinking properly, clearing confusion in my head and with the memory. Hard to say which pill is doing what but I'm on this cocktail for couple of months now and plan to continue its use.
