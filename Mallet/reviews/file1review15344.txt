review/text: The Zippo pocket ashtray is very useful. Take it with you to friends houses and enjoy not having to get up every time you need to ash. The whole thing even splits in two for easy emptying. The size is the smallest it can be while being very ergonomic. A butt can jam into the sliding mechanism sometimes and make it harder to close, but so far it's never actually gotten stuck. It's a great buy. Very recommended.
