review/text: The first month of near nightly use I was loving this eye mask. Blocked all the light allowing me to fall asleep more easily. I would give this eye mask 4 stars if it didn't fall apart so quickly. Like others have said, the inner fabric started to peel off around the nose at first, then continued to un-glue up toward the temple area... then off to both sides. Pretty disappointed =(. Also the velcro on the back is a bit thick and may cause some frustration. For me it bothered me some nights, but not others. I'm going to try and sew the lining in and see if the stitching doesn't bother me...
