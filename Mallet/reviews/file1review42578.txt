review/text: I bought this product thinking it would be a decent protein. I was highly dissapointed. It has a very bad taste and unless you are using a blender (I use a blender bottle) it is very hard to get the protein to break down and not be chunky. Spend your money on gold standard or syntha 6. Just as good of proteins with a much better taste and blendabilty.
