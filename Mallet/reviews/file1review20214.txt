review/text: Read about using Black Cherry concentrate to treat the symptoms of gout. I tried this for about a week, taking a couple of teaspoons worth each morning and evening. After about a week the gout cleared up. It seems to have worked. The product is very strong tasting, but that is to be expected of a syrup like concentrate. The price is better than what I could find elsewhere.
