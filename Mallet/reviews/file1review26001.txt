review/text: I have worn these masks for years. It not only keeps light out but keeps air out of my eyes. Through the years they've made them a little smaller so you are not pushing against the side of the plastic on your pillow and causing them to move. I am a side sleeper for the most part. I've awakened to broad daylight with sun streaming in and was completely surprised. It would be good if they made them in 3 sizes or at least two. I think you have to get used to them and be sure they are centered and the velcro strap is at just the right pressure to keep the mask on without pressing against your eyes. I adjust them from time to time as they loosen.I rarely sleep without them and use them on planes all the time. They were recommended by a friend of mine a long time ago who uses them for the entire family for travel on planes.
