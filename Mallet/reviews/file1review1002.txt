review/text: I used the capsule version of this product because I have had trouble producing enough milk for my twins. It seemed to work reasonably well, with a moderate increase in production (maybe an extra ~1.5oz/double pumping session). However, it had an unexpected effect on my thyroid as well!I am mildly hypothyroid and have been very stable on medication for several years. I had been taking this stuff for a couple of months when the time came for a routine check-up lab test. To my surprise, that test revealed that I was mildly _hyper_-thyroid. I attributed it to general hormonal issues with pregnancy, post-partum, nursing, etc. because I couldn't find any information linking any of the ingredients to thyroid function. But my endocrinologist insisted that herbal preparations can have unpredictable effects, so I went off the stuff. Six weeks later all my lab tests were normal again.I don't want to be too critical of this product because I think it actually helps a little, but I really want to note this effect. Please remember that I am simply reporting my personal experiences and not the results of a scientific study, but if you know that you have thyroid issues you might want to have some extra testing done if you choose to use this product.
