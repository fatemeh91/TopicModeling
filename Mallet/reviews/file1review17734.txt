review/text: I'm writing this review after using the product for a few months--I'm glad I waited.Overall this product worked fairly well, you can adjust the for the perfect trim of your beard or mustache depending on how long you want it.A few weeks ago I tried to trim my beard. I turn on the trimmer and about 5 seconds later it turns off due to not holding a charge. I've been trying to charge since then, its definitely not a user error; the battery no longer holds a charge. I would not suggest this product to a friend.
