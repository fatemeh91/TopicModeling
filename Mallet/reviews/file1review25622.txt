review/text: Hair in nose and ear is not one of my problems. However, a well beloved family member is quite hirsute. This little instrument has made me a hero in the family - no more nose hairs peeking out while we are eating our soup and trying to avoid looking at ___'s hairy nose. No one would sit next to __because his ears had hair that needed to be braided. Hair be gone and it is. Want to be the family favorite- buy one for all of youu beloveds.
