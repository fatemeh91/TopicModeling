review/text: As odd as it may seem, there really is a difference in the life of batteries. We use this battery in our medical laboratory. It is recommended by the equipment manufacturer and does cost a little more than other 3 volt lithium batteries so we tried to save by using others. Bad mistake. The battery by renata lasts nearly twice as long as any of the others we tried. Well worth the slight extra cost.
