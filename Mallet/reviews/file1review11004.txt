review/text: I was a skeptic with this product before trying it. After about 3 days, I can definitely tell a difference in my body odor, my breath...and when I go to the bathroom.Be WARNED, your stool will be greenish in color while taking this product. Other than that, I haven't seen any other negative side effects.I do have to take quite a few of these per day for it to be effective though. I'm sure this depends on the individual as well but I take about 4-5 pills a day...which can be a pain. I hate taking pills!Updated after about a month of usage:I am now taking 3 pills a day, one after each of my main meals. I find that this is the dosage that's been working for me and I will keep taking it as such.I experimented by not taking any pills for one day and noticed that my breath odor started coming back as well as other body odor. DO realize that this is a product that works if you continuously take it, it is by no means a treatment for body/breath odor. My stool also goes back to its normal color when I stopped taking it for a day as well so if anything, I know that the effects are not permanent.As I've stated, I take 3 pills a day and there are 90 pills in the bottle for $8.61. This means that I'm paying $8.61 per month for the rest of my life if I want to stay odor free. I can't determine if this product is worth it for everybody but if you're doing something that requires you to to be up close and/or communicate verbally with people on a regular basis then yes, this product is definitely worth it for you.Also, note that this is NOT an instant breath freshener. If you take it after eating a meal full of onions or garlic, it's not going to help you at all. Brushing your teeth, chewing gum or something similar is probably a better option. However, if your diet consists of foods that makes you smelly, then yes taking this product will help get rid of those smell over a period of time. It took me about 3 days for the product to start taking its effect.
