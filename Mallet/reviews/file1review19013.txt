review/text: Originally, I was skeptical of this product and its claims about being "tasteless", "grit-free", and "non-thickening". I have tried many fiber products that alluded to similar claims only to be disappointed in the long-run. So, I figured that I'd give this product the ultimate test: I put a serving (2 teaspoons) in a glass of pure spring water and stirred it. In about two minutes time it vanished. I drank it down and didn't even notice that it was there, and that means a lot to me. I have very sensitive taste buds that can detect the minute difference between fresh mountain spring and purified/filtered bottled water. This product is great and I will be buying a lot more of it. I will never use any other fiber supplement again. Though it's a bit on the pricier side, there's nothing comes nearer to it in quality and simplicity.
