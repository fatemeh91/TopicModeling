review/text: Trying to find a blade for my clipper was difficult in my neighborhood stores.When I went to Amazon the choices were there and the WAHL Professional 2 Hole Precision Clipper Blade was exactly what I needed. It was easy putting it on my clipper and when I used it for the first time I was pleased how evenly it cut my hair. That's why I called it the sharpest blade.
