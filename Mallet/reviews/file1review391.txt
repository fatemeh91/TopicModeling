review/text: A very enjoyable product. I've owned a clear one for a few months, and really like it for the clear color, it looks nondescript and techy-fun! Girth is big, but I like this as well. Great action on bunny ears. Waterproofness is definitely a plus. The smell is there, but not really offensive. It is quiet enough. It is the top vibrator out of the three I've tried so far. I would buy it again.
