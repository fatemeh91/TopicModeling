review/text: I am not carrying multiples, but am pregnant with my third child and have a history of preterm birth. This has relieved the pressure in my cervix and all is well with my pregnancy and haven't had to go on bed rest!!!! It is amazing at relieving back pain and has even helped with my sciatic pain! I am so half my doc recommended it! My only complaints are that it is a little awkward to put on (but I am a lazy gal ;D) and not practical if you have to spend any lengthy periods sitting (I am a full time nursing student so my day is spent with portions of standing and the rest of the time at a desk) because it tends to either ride up or press on my bladder. All in all a great help to me, and I highly recommend to others.
