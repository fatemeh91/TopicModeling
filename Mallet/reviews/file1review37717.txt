review/text: I've never used waxes so I can't compare this to hot wax, etc. Personally, I prefer shaving. By the time I prepped my legs, waxed, and used the oil, I could've shaved both legs. It hurt, but not too badly, though I did say ""OW"" with each pull. Worked pretty well on the hair between my brows without any pain. I'd recommend it for facial hair, but I think shaving leg and underarm hair is less painful and quicker.
