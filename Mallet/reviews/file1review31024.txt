review/text: I have had arthritis in my knees and hips for years from high school injuries, and this formulation gives me relief within a few weeks. Before I took it, I was lying awake at night with my joints aching, and doing stairs was torture. I can cut back to 1 pill three times a week once I have reached a therapeutic level. If I get lazy and stop completely, the pain comes back in 6 to 8 weeks.
