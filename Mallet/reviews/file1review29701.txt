review/text: I bought these inserts because washable ones seemed more environmentally friendly and were recommended to me by a friend. They work as expected, no embarrassing wet spots on my shirts. I only wish that I cold wear them at night for longer than 3-4 hours without having them soaking wet and needing a new pair. During the daytime, this is not a problem.
