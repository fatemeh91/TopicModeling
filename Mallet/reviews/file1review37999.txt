review/text: This is an easy-to-use, affordable model from a trusted name. Of the three models I've trained with, I much prefer this one. On the effectiveness of CPR/defibrillation: Many people have used this review forum as a means to "diss" CPR and defibrillators. None of these reviewers has offered any medical credentials to back up their statements. As a medical school student for whom AHA CPR/defibrillation training was required (and not someone who receives my medical education from TV drama), I have discussed the topic with many physicians, nurses, and basic scientists. I feel I must respond despite the fact that it's not entirely appropriate to do so in a review. While CPR alone does have a seemingly low overall success rate, it is quite successful in a variety of situations and should be employed as appropriate. CPR with defibrillation has a rather impressive success rate among adults who suffer SCA. It's probably true that not everyone needs to take a CPR/defibrillator course, but it's misleading and irresponsible to say that CPR and defibrillators are "useless." It's also misleading and irresponsible to say that only professionals can use defibrillators. The home use models are designed and FDA-approved to be safe in the hands of almost anyone, although if you expect that you will need to use one, you should probably take a course. What is dangerous in the hands of non-professionals is "a little information." Statistics require the knowledge and experience to interpret them, and not everything you read in a journal article is gospel.
