review/text: People always ask me if it works and my answer is simply - I haven't had the flu since I started using it (over 6 years ago,) so I will assume yes. It really is your choice, but if you want to believe the dr. who makes money off of you being sick over people that haven't been sick in years after using the product. You might be leaning on science, but I guess logic was left out of your analysis all together.
