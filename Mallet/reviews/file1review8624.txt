review/text: After several attempts to really clean some light colored grout in a very soiled environment with a soft bristle toothbrush, I decided to buy a proper tool and quit skinning my knuckles. OXO almost always makes good products, and this is no exception. The bristles are tough enough, and set at the right angle to really get into the grout cleaning process. The handle is comfortable. I have not owned the product long enough to give it a 5-star rating, but if it holds up until all my grout is cleaned at least once I will consider it a 5-star item. The price is right and the tool is appropriate for the job.
