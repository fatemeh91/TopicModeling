review/text: great shaver, works great, holds a charge a long time, easy to clean. the razor works great on a daily basis, but a little slow if you've not shaved for a wknd, just have to go over your beard a few times. the trimmers are awesome, work great, just be careful in the "sensitive" areas down below, but really good on chest hair and trimming those bushy places. definitely worth the money.
