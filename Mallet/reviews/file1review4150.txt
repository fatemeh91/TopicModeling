review/text: I used to buy Fusion blades on Ebay, but I always worried about getting counterfeit blades. I don't have that worry with Amazon. I use Sam's as the benchmark for a good price and legitimate blades. Thanks to free shipping, my price here was a little below Sam's, without that worry of getting bogus product and delivered to my door. I'll come back.
