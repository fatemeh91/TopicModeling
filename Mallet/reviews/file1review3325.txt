review/text: I ordered this with some trepidation, having used electric razors before and found them pretty useless...ineffectual.I used disposable razors for years but ultimately got tired of carving myself up & stopped shaving altogether. Then I read a review of the newer electrics elsewhere, which referred to this model as the "BMW of shavers". They also noted many people were equally satified with the lower end model-so I came to Amazon looking for that one, and found this, reconditioned for about the same price.I have to admit that I bought it fully expecting not to be satified but got a pleasant suprise. It is almost as close as a razor! All that said, if you've been unsatified with other electrics, this one is worth a try.
