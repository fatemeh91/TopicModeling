review/text: Okay, so the name is "Kid Glove Shave Gel," but it's also iron fist in a velvet glove shave gel. Granted, it sits on "his" counter in our bathroom, but I "borrow" it whenever I can.Upon application this kid glove treatment immediately becomes a transparent gel covering those "difficult" areas for women to shave. It shaves cleanly, smoothly (think easily) while it heals and hydrates due to a healthy infusion of Aloe Leaf Extract.He likes it for the easy glide and healthy glow it gives him. I love it for all of me. The scent is fresh, appealing and it leaves no razor rash or redness only a silky smoothness.Sharps is for me - no flats here.
