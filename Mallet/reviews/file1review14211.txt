review/text: Been trying to find the right lubricant for what I was looking for...Water base,No bad oder,cleans up good, and needs to have a good taste or no taste...After reading all the reviews it was between this and pjur..So I thought I would order the smaller bottle just to see if it was worth my time..This stuff is good slick and cleans up great and has no taste the only downfall is it doesnt last real long about 15 20 min then have to reaply but its water base so you can just add a little water to get it back into shape..I would def recomend this if your looking for a good lube.
