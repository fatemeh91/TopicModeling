review/text: I have a Wahl MC-2 clipper my wife uses to cut my hair (for several years on the original blade set). I wasn't sure if this blade fit my model, but it looked like it would so I ordered it. Service was WAY fast - got the new blade set in a few days. The fit and finish of the new set was just like the old blades in that they were a perfect fit. Aligning the blades took a bit of time. I used a magnifying lamp to help me see what I was doing, and had to re-do the fit several times to get it exactly as per the instructions. Now the clippers are just like new and I am a very happy customer. Also, the blades are Made In The USA, which is a huge plus for me.
