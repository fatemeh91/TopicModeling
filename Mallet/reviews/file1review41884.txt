review/text: An excellent product. It definitely gets the job done, and the little stutter at the end of each 30 second period is a great help. It holds a charge a lot longer than brushes I've had in the past, and the visual battery gauge is a nice touch, as is the smiley face given when you completed the brushing. However, you cannot see it when brushing, so until you get used to the sound and feel of each of the three "modes", it is too easy to slip between them by hitting the second button. The display can tell you which mode you are on, but as you cannot see the display while brushing, you have to learn that a sudden drop in power means you switched modes accidentally, and not that you are low on power. Those are very minor things, however, and should not deter anyone from buying it.
