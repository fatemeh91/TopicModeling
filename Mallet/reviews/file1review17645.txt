review/text: The price, quality of product, the look, and performance are all excellent. Way better than those multiple beard trimmer guides and the price is excellent. Right out the box, it cut perfectly. I will purchase another one hopefully in 5 more yrs or so. The length of time I'm expecting this trimmer to last.
