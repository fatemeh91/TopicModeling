review/text: I agree with several reviewers that this cleaning unit is really a lot of hype and overengineering. At the time, I did not realize I would be buying replacement cartridges every 1-2 months. Cleaning shaver stubble from my rotary shavers for >10 years has never really been a big deal. We have far more unpleasurable waste that we deal with everyday. Hey, we're human!As far as the shaver, it cannot do a good job on the neck if you have a thick new beard every morning. I am of Italian descent so take that for "whaddits" worth. As a test, I used my very old Norelco rotary on half my face and it blew away the Braun in direct comparison. Maybe there are foil shavers out there that are equal to rotary shavers, but this one turned me off completely to foil shavers.P.S.- I personally felt this product needed to be bashed. I am even disappointed with Costco for carrying this product in their limited selection.
