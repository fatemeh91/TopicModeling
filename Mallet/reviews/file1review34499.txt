review/text: this is not the same as in the picture! it just got here today and NO I have NOT taken it out of the packet. the white part you see in the pic here.. where you hold it.. is NOT IN HERE. and there is NO ROOM for it.. it must be a seperate attatchment :( the end where you hook it up to the water source.. looks NOTHING like in the picture.. the only part that IS THE SAME is the purple curled hose *slumps*I am NOT HAPPY.
