review/text: I've had this product over 6 months and moved it in a truck to a different house. It works great and is very dependable! It's heavy so it's not rickety and is attractive too. Mine is white and black. Very pleased with it and how easy it was to put together, take apart to move and put back together again. Recommend it highly.
