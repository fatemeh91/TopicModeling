review/text: This pill has been a miracle for our son. His pediatrician approved it for him at 18 months and we have been using it ever since. We have to use 2 pills a day, but he likes the taste and eagerly chews them first thing in the morning. We have absolutely no problems for the rest of the day. He always fought us on the Lactaid pills, so those never worked for us. I highly recommend these.
