review/text: I've gone through a number of different shave creams for use with my badger hair brush, and this one makes the best lather yet, without requiring a large quantity to be used each time.It seems expensive, but it actually seems to last long enough compared to the cheaper Proraso that the extra money is worth it. Plus the lather is 10x better with much less work.
