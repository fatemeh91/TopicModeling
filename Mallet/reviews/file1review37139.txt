review/text: I was thrilled to Test Drive Lady Speed Stick Invisible Dry Antiperspirant & Deodorant, and it was a great product. Like its name, it actually was invisible AND dry. There was no residue left behind and the deodorant didn't spoil my clothes like gel deodorants do. The smell was great too....it smelled EXACTLY like baby powder and I felt really fresh. The only drawback was the smell didn't last long. Overall, it was a great product!
