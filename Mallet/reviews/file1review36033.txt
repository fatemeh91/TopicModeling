review/text: swallowing a spit-up burp.Won't kill me but it is not the highlight of my day. I wake up to 40 grams of L-Arg and creatine mixed with some Mio squirt-flavor and eggs. I do notice a better pump. I try to get some down at night before bed but am just not motivated enough. Will probably go back to tablets when this runs out. I'm doing bcaa powder as well. Much easier to handle.
