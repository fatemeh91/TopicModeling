review/text: We bought a new coffee maker that came with a stainless steel carafe. After six months or so, the insides started getting dark no matter how many times we washed it. My wife tried vinegar and a bottle brush which helped a little. I remembered a product called &#34;Dip-it&#34; my mother used to use. I looked in grocery stores, department stores and specialty stores. No one had heard of it. I should have gone to Amazon.Com first.Following the directions on the box and letting the carafe soak for about 1/2 hour, it was spotless, like a brand new pot. I'm glad I opted to buy a box of 8. This is the only cleaner I'll ever use on my coffee pots.
