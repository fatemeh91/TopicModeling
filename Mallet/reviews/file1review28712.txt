review/text: Rocky road is a great flavor, thanks to all the reviews below for recommending it... I just had my first serving for breakfast, and it tastes just like cold Ovaltine. I had Strawberry flavored whey of a different brand with my last batch, and that was almost enough to make me swear off whey protein entirely. It tasted terrible.I would prefer ON without sucralose (Splenda) or acesulfame potassium, both of which are artificial sweeteners, but I'm not overly concerned as I don't take this product more than twice per day.Mixability was good, not great. It took me thirty seconds of stirring in a cup and I still had some clumps, which eventually went away. Probably will work better with shaker bottle.
