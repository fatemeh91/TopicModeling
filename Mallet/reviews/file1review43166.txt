review/text: I bought this stuff hoping to love it since it is supposed to be nontoxic and ecofriendly. I love daily shower cleaners but was always worrying about the chemicals. I do not see how something with such an overpowering smell as Method Daily Shower Cleaner can be good for you. Luckily I tried it first in my downstairs bathroom and not in the bathroom which is attached to my bedroom. I have had a headache since using it, have tried running the fan, running the shower and still it smells. I will be returning it and making my own spary as originally planned.
