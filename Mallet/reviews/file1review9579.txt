review/text: Ordered in December, but all the bars appear to have melted in the package at some point in their history. They re-hardened in a mixed mess and tasted OK, though, so I'm not returning them. They're just really messy and difficult to eat in this condition, so I'm giving two stars. Check the images to see what my bars looked like.
