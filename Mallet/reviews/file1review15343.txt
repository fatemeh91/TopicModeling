review/text: Smokers can largely be put into two groups: those who will toss their butts anywhere, and those who will always try to throw their butts into a trash can when possible. I fall into the latter group, but unfortunately there are times where there is no trash can available and I have to simply leave the butt on the ground.In theory, this pocket ashtray should be just what the doctor ordered. But it fails to really fulfill its task. The first issue I have with it is that it can be a pain to completely open. It slides open to deposit a butt easily, but to throw it out you have to pinch both sides of the ashtray and then pull. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But "ok," you think, "it still contains the cigarette butt which is what matters, right"?It does, but it doesn't do it admirably. In fact, it does a pretty poor job of containing the smell of the burnt cigarette. Maybe you don't mind your clothes smelling like a spent cigarette (and that's a very different odor than the smell of smoke, it's much more concentrated for one) but I do. As such, I wouldn't recommend buying this ashtray.
