review/text: The insert did not help my foot problem, decided on another type of gel product, much more effective. But the 11-14 mens size was a pain to reduce to size which wasn't accurate enough. They need to have the lengths more precise (like the brand I choose), i.e. 11-12 or 10-11, or 10, 11, 12, etc rather than an all size (doesn't) fit all. Disappointed!
