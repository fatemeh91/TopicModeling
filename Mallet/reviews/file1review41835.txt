review/text: I had an earlier model of an Oral B Professional Care toothbrush for almost four years. I really like Oral B, and my dentist highly recommended me to continue to use a similar brush. It works great, and my teeth feel really clean. I really like that I can get to each tooth. It has a digital timer on it so you know how long you have been brushing. When you brush for 2 or more minutes a smile face shows up next to the time - which is kinda cute. There are three different modes you can use to brush. Every thirty seconds the brush will vibrate a little to let you know to move on to another section of your mouth. Then at two minutes it will vibrate twice as much to tell you that you are finished. It has a nice travel case, which I really like. I couldn't really travel with my old toothbrush. The base for the toothbrush is very convenient. You can choose to just use the charger part which isn't as bulky, or you can use the other parts which hold the extra toothbrushes and create a bigger base. You don't have to keep it on the charger all the time, although you can if you want to. It will work off the charger for about a week's worth of brushing (2x a day). It's easy to keep clean and is well worth the money!
