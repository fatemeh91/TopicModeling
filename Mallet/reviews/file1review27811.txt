review/text: Heard about this product through StrongLifts.com, and was very satisfied with my purchase. The taste was bearable - unsurprisingly, mixing it with milk instead of water makes for a much more enjoyable beverage. I've tried other flavors since my first tub, and would definitely recommend the double rich chocolate over anything else.
