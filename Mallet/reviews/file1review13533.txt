review/text: I wear the Sketcher Shape-Ups all the time to relieve the pain from plantar fascitis and was looking for the same relief when I play tennis. I found theseby accident, reluctantly tried them, and I have to say my heel pain is improving after 9 months of pain and agony! I wear the adidas tennis shoes and placethese inserts right in without having to remove the insole. Some sneakers may not be deep enough and you have to remove the insole in order for the smartsole to fit comfortably. I have flat feet and this product provides great support on the arch and great cushion on the heel! I have recommended these tomy friends who also suffer from plantar fascitis. Believe me, I have tried EVERY insert out there and this one wins!
