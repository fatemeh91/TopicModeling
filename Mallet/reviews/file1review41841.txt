review/text: This is an excellent toothbrush it does a great job. However the NiMH rechargeable battery died after 3 years. And yes you can replace it if you have a soldering iron, a small screw driver and are very carefull.HERE IS HOW...First you have to remove the bottom cap by unscrewing the center socket; the charger/plug has a triangular "key" for that purpose. Turn the center socket counter clock wise and remove the bottom cap.- Look inside from the bottom and press the two white clips away from the sidewall from each side with a small screw driver until you hear a click.- Insert the opposite end of the toothbrush(after removing the brush) into an engineer's bench vise. Tighten the vise loosely around the flat plastic surfaces and push harder and harder toward the vise until the interior assembly slides out. (The seal at the top of the brush pushes through the "soft" rubber on the top of the brush). DO NOT TRY TO REMOVE THE ASSEMBLY BY PULLING ON THE BOTTOM COIL. THE ASSEMBLY MUST BE PUSHED OUT.- Now that you have the interior assembly out you can pry off the battery connector strip at the bottom of the battery with a sharp knife.- Use a soldering gun to to remove the solder on the circuit board for the upper battery strip.- Replace the battery with a 1.5V NiMh 16.7 X 48mm cell. The original battery is made by Sanyo and is a NI-MH. I don't know the part number but Part Number: MH-4AA270-BH will fit although the diameter is slightly smaller.- Carefully remove the remaining strip from the old battery and solder both to each end of the new battery. Positive must be on the top (with the toothbrush standing up) (USE MINIMUM HEAT AND ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME OR ELSE YOU WILL DAMAGE THE BATTERY).- Insert the new battery and solder the top battery strip to the circuit board.- Remove the blue top seal from the brush end of the assembly.- Insert the assembly into the cover and replace the blue seal. Lubricate the seal with silicone or salad oil, it will make assembly easier.- Replace the bottom cap and tighten the triangular nut.- Charge for 12 hours before use.NOTE, YOU HAVE TO BE SKILLED TO DO THIS JOB OR ELSE YOU WILL RUIN THE ASSEMBLY AND WASTE MONEY ON A REPLACEMENT BATTERY. If in doubt purchase a new toothbrush. Or alternatively remove the old battery first before you purchase the new battery (to make sure you don't damage anything).I CONSIDER IT AS UNNESSARY ENVIRONMENTAL WASTE TO THROW A PERFECTLY GOOD TOOTHBRUSH IN THE TRASH AS SUGGESTED BY THE MANUFACTURER. YES ORAL-B DO TELL YOU TO RECYCLE THE BATTERY. IT MUST MAKE MANAGEMENT FEEL GOOD.This battery replacement note is applicable to all Oral-B Triump 9400 series toothbrushes.
