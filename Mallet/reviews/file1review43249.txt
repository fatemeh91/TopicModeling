review/text: When I was little my mother used to give me blue green algae, she gave it to me in pill form and even went as far as putting it in my food. I hated taking it. When I turned 18 I stopped taking it completely. I noticed over the years my hair and nails became weak and my energy level dropped drastically. For years I brushed it off and said I'm just getting older. That wasn't the case I've tryed every type of supplement you could think of and nothing helped. I finally gave up and decided to buy a bottle of algae and Im glad I did. I've been taking it for about 3 months now, I feel great my energy has been restored my hair has been growing faster and shinier. I even give it to my dog, he's 8 and now acting like a puppy again. The only bad thing about this stuff is when you first start taking it you detox, and I got it bad. Make sure that your not far from a toilet for the first week.Aside from the detox I would honestly have to say taking the blue green algae is the best thing I could have done. I feel great.
