review/text: I purchased this aftershave for my husband for Christmas. It arrived as described and on time. It was a great buy and a good value. It costs much less than in the stores and I didn't have to stand in line or drive anywhere. Now my hubby has his favorite aftershave that doesn't sting and he smells great too! I saved a lot of money and we both got something nice. Now that's what I call a WIN WIN!
