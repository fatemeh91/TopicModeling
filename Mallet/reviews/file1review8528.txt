review/text: As the title says, this is overall a very good brush. But Amazon (based on the buy these items together link) misled me to believe that these would actually work well with the Aquasana 27oz glass bottles. They do indeed fit in the mouth of the bottle which is a feat, however, they leave the bottom 2-3 inches of the bottle untouched due to the width of the rubber on the handle.
