review/text: I love the sweeper. I'm able to clean the carpet and use it on my hardwood floors. The canisters are easy to empty. There is a little comb that comes with it to clean the brush. The sweeper is easy to assemble. My only complaint is that the handle comes in pieces so you have to make sure you attach all the pieces tightly or the handle keeps coming apart. It's easy to put back on, just annoying when the bottom falls off as I'm carrying the sweeper to the rug. For this reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.
