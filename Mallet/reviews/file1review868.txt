review/text: As a recent breast cancer survivor, I lived with a difficult and stressful problem, hot flashes - or as we callthem, "power surges". A good friend and mamography tech suggested trying evening primrose oil. She specificallysuggested NOW SUPER PRIMROSE 13MG SOFTGELS. After researching this on Consumer Lab (a testing facility forherbal remedies)I found that NOW SUPER PRIMRPOSE 13MG SOFTGELS had been tested and approved by them. I looked for the NOW brand and found it on my Amazon link and ordered them. My friend had specifically told me to use the NOW brand and to take two in the morning and two in the evening for the first week. Then for the second week take one in the morning and one in the evening and continue this from then on. She also told me to not get discouraged if they didn't work right away. I followed her schedule and had some relief the first week andthe second week most of the nightly rolling power surges stopped. PHEW!! Now, a month later, I only havea few during the day, usually when I'm stressed, and no longer have any of the rolling-power-surges at night. When I told my MD at my six-month checkup a week ago what I was doing...he said, "Jennie (his Physician's Assistant) has been recommending evening primrose oil to her patients for hot flashes and they seem to work". I kiddingly told him that it's too bad I wasn't seeing her instead of him. He laughed!Nothing else worked for me and was very please to be able to order them from Amazon (I also order my Omega 3 capsules from Amazon).....I hope you'll try them and find the same relief I found.
