review/text: When we 1st purchased this thermometer the battery was dead even before we used. The second time round, the battery lasted no more than 10 uses and it was out again. The 3rd time lasted about 12 uses. It's now dead again.According to specification under the instructions, the battery life isstipulated at more than 300 measurements or approximately 2 years ofusage. we are very disappointed with the product due to this reason. Other than that, I loved the big read out and colored back light.
