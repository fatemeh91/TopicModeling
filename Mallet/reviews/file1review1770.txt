review/text: Love this Tea Tree Oil Soap. My son takes a lot of serious seizure meds and went through aggressive chemotherapy for testicular cancer two years ago. I believe both of these issues are the reason he is having so much trouble with his skin, hair and nails. It is likely that his natural immunity to minor bacterium and fungus has been compromised. He uses tea tree oil soap once/day now, every day and I believe it helps a lot and makes his skin just feel good. We're hooked.
