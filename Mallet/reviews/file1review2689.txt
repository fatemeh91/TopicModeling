review/text: We go through quite a bit of lube in our house, and this is by far the best. It doesn't get sticky or leave residue, it literally just lets your hands glide over anything smoothly. No mess, its super easy to clean up and the slickness lasts for a long time, so you dont have to use as much. I also really like it because it doesn't taste bad, I actually dont notice it at all if I happen to be licking something that has been previously covered in lube. Just use the lube until you stop feeling that smooth glide and either reapply or try something else. Its more of a moisturizer than anything, and when it dries, you can't tell that you used anything in the first place - no cleanup! Its great. And this bottle lasts forever. We go through quite a bit of it and this bottle has lasted us 6 months. Really great value for the price and really high quality stuff. I wouldn't consider using anything else.
