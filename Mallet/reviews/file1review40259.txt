review/text: Although the FDA does it's best to tell you that echinacea is nothing more than a placebo, I beg to differ. The all natural ingredients in this product help to strengthen the immune system. The time to take this is just as you feel something coming on. Once you are full on sick, it is too late, but if caught early on, you will avoid the misery of a potential 2 week illness. I didn't believe it either and tried it only at my Aunt's urging. Damned if it didn't work and I've taken it ever since.
