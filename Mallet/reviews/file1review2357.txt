review/text: I go to an opthamoligist (sp?) for an eye disease and then developed a film over my eyes that just seemed to occur. He explained that my tear ducts were clogging and not producing enough oils and thus the film.. He told me to buy this product and take it as directed and with this and washing my eyes with baby shampoo the problem has gone away.
