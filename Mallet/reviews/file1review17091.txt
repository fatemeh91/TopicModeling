review/text: I purchased this beard trimmer 5 months ago for my fella- he loved it until it just stopped working or taking any charge whatsoever (we even ordered a new charger from Remington) about 5 months in. I e-mailed Remington and they told me to mail the trimmer and my receipt to them and they would further investigate. 3 weeks later, they sent a brand new and way upgraded model to us free of charge! Thank you Remington- I am so impressed by your customer service!
