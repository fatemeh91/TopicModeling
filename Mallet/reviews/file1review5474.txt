review/text: I tried these after a bunch of headaches with a Costco clipper I got a while back. It works great. The cordless feature is a huge plus too. My wife cuts my hair pretty quick with these things and they have stayed sharp for at least 6 months now. For the price these clippers are awesome. I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews though. Maybe it works differently if you trim your hair really short. I think we do 1/2" on the sides and 3/4" on the top.
