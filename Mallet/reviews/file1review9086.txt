review/text: I work out every morning at 5:30 and spend my entire day working in construction. With the dogs and busy schedule I barely slept. I had tried numerous multivitamins from all brands. After trying Green Vibrance for about a month I feel like i have a nuclear reactor inside my chest. The energy I have for work and play is up tenfold. Great product
