review/text: I've done a lot of reviewing of shaving creams, over 60 in fact, and Castle Forbes is one of my absolute favourites. It's not the best (that would go to Martin de Candre, but good luck finding it in the USA), but it's easily available and absolutely a top tier product. You might not like the lavender smell - personally it's one of my favourite fragrances - but there are others you can try instead.It creates a great lather, it comes off cleanly, it lubricates and protects well, and it's for a great price too. I have recommended Castle Forbes to all my friends and they all love it.
