review/text: I've never been someone who buys protein powder - I'm not into muscle building and supplements. However, I recently had a week when I had to work 80 hours. I ate one or two meals a day that week, and nothing terribly nutritious. All I did for 7 days straight was drive to and from work, work, and try to get 7 hours sleep.After it was over I decided that I'd buy a protein powder, and a green powdered superfood to keep in my pantry so that if I'm working long hours I can come home, throw the protein powder and green powder in a blender with frozen fruits and have a somewhat nutritious meal in 5 minutes. In fact, if I'm going to use the blender (and then have to wash it) I might as well put in enough to have several smoothies - one for dinner and one to take in the car for breakfast.I did an experiment with this powder today. I put a scoop of this powder, 1/2 cup of skim milk, 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt, flax seeds, a handful of fresh spinach, frozen fruit and a couple of packets of Splenda in my Vitamix. I really enjoyed the smoothie - I couldn't taste the spinach at all, the frozen strawberries and blueberries gave me antioxidants, the flax seed provided Omega 3, the yogurt was good for my digestive system. I'll end up making smoothies with this whey powder a few times a week to satisfy my craving for something sweet and cold, but without the fat and sugar of a milkshake. And when I have to work long hours this powder, the green powder and the frozen fruit will be a way to fix a quick meal substitute.
