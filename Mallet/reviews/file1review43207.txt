review/text: I just got the case of this stuff a week ago. I love that Amazon shipped it to me UPS for free to Hawaii! Anyways, we have used it for a week already. The smell is quite strong and personally I don't care for it. We use it on our cultured marble tub surround, curtain, and the tub which I think is plastic. So far it seems to be okay. I haven't noticed it getting cleaner, but that's probably because it was already clean to begin with. I'm hoping it helps cut down the soap scum and hard water that builds up.Since it smells strong and perfumey, kind of like what you'd imagine someone's grandma to smell like, we have to close the bathroom door so that we can sleep. There is a window in the bathroom, but I like to leave the door open so that there is a cross-breeze.I bought it because we are trying to be more eco-friendly and healthly too. I have a toddler too so I like to keep toxic things out of my house.
