review/text: The Wahl multihead shaver is a great buy. The multiple heads give me a choice each day. Since I have problem skin -- formerly eczema, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis ( explained at [...] ), now cured but still VERY sensitive -- I needed a shaver that doesn't irritate my skin in some locations.I read the instructions very carefully and adjusted my expectations as noted. This is my first foil shaver. I have used only a rotary type before. After three weeks of using the Sensitive head, as predicted, I could see no problems. I had got used to the shaver and it worked well.The nose and ear hair trimmer has been very helpful too for those hard to get places.The one problem is the volume of noise. I wouln't dare use the shaver early in the morning, for fear of waking up my neighbors. (I live in a small apartment.) I am retired, so I can shave during the day and avoid the problem.For men with serious skin problems, I would suggest what I am trying now: Use a hair trimmer, set to a very low setting, every few days instead of trying to use a shaver. That means a short stubble, rather than a close shave, but that is much better than tearing up skin that is already a problem.I have used Wahl products before (specifically a hair trimmer that lasted for seven years), and I have always been pleased.
