review/text: Tide To Go has saved me on more than one occasion when I was eating somewhat carelessly before a job interview or an important social gathering. Tide To Go correctly advertises itself as "an on-the-go stain remover," not a pretreater. Once it saves you from an embarrassing or ugly stain on your garments you'll never travel far without one of these again!Tide To Go works best on common stains like coffee, tea, wine and juice--ketchup, too.Moreover, it's easy to use: Take it with you when you're on the go; it fits much like a pen inside a pocket in a jacket or pants. Removes the excess liquid from the stain and rub the tip of the Tide To Go "pen" across the stain to remove it. There are a few more detailed instructions; read them all before using this product.If you have further questions, Tide To Go offers consumers both a toll free "hotline" as well as a website. Great!Overall, once you try Tide To Go and it saves the day, you'll simply never go far without this again. It keeps well when the cap is on the "pen;" and it fits very conveniently in most pockets so it stays out of sight.Excellent!!!
