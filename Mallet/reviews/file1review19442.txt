review/text: I am a recent graduate nurse and hated my Littman "lite" that I used for clinicals. I vowed when I got my first big-girl nursing check I would purchase a new stethoscope. I am not a fan of the Littman's for a number of reasons and was pleasantly surprised to find MDF at a local nursing supply outlet. First off the clarity is awesome! I can hear things that I never heard with the lite littman. The bell feels heavier but not enough that I think it will be a bother while wearing it. I hope to get many years out of my new MDF.
