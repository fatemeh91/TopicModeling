review/text: As a guy who used to syran wrap frozen peas to his shin, this seemed like the perfect device. The neoprene sleeve holding an icepack to my shin was a nice step up. It worked great for about a week, then one of the ice compartments started to leak, then another, then another. After a couple of weeks, only about half the ice compartments had fluid left. Nothing was obviously poking holes in the ice pack, so I can't figure out where the leaks came from. My guess is that an improvement in the plastic quality/thickness for the icepack would solve the problem. Overall a great idea, if only it were more durable.
