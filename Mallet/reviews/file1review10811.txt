review/text: I bought this product for my mother who has severe arthritis in her knees. It allows the person to use more leverage with their arms when getting out of their car. The metal end is easily inserted in the U shaped striker bar found in most cars. I found this product to be very sturdy and easy to use. I would highly recommend this product for anyone needing extra assistance getting out of their cars.
