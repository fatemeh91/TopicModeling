review/text: This is not a cure-all, but it definitely helps. I am 7 mos. pregnant with twins and I am carrying 40 extra lbs - all in the belly. I am still doing a lot of walking, and the cradle definitely helps. It does not completely eliminate back pain. But on the days I am on my feet all day, I feel much better if I wear the prenatal cradle. I also get very sore from sitting in front of my computer, and the cradle actually helps a bit with that too.The downside is that the straps are actually visible with almost everything I wear - except tops or sweaters with a crew neck. Anything with a v-neck or a boat neck leaves the straps exposed. Even a tank top does not cover the straps, as they are designed to criss-cross at the center of the chest. But it's a small price to pay for pain management.By the way, based on other reviews I read, I bought a size up (eg, I bought a medium even though the size-chart indicated I would be a small) and it fits fine.
