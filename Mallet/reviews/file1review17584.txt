review/text: If there are any good reviews of this product, it's from people who just bought it. I LOVED this thing when I got it. That lasted about a month. Now the battery won't hold a charge through a single trimming. I have to stage trimming, do one sideburn (quickly) then wait a couple hours for the battery to hold enough of a charge to do the next one. No way I could do my beard or mustache at once, have to space my face out over the week. The power adapter isn't one where you can run the thing while plugged in, you have to wait for the battery to charge. Completely useless. Don't buy this trimmer, it doesn't last very long so you'll just be replacing it soon. SO, I'm off to buy a new trimmer....
