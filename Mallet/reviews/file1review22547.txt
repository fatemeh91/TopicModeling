review/text: When my son was newborn, this thermometer worked great. He would suck on it for the required time and the reading would be almost identical both auxillarily and rectally. The biggest problem I had was keeping my son interested in sucking on the pacifier long enough to get a reading as he got older. He cut himself off from the pacifier at about 4 months old and this method was no longer useful for us. If your child still uses a pacifier, this is probably a great choice for you.
