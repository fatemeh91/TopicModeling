review/text: This power toothbrush cleans my teeth more thoroughly than I could with a manual toothbrush. It even helps to prevent gum damage due to brushing too aggressively (since it warns you if you are pressing to hard.) If you can afford it, then this brush might save you from a toothache, cavities, and gum disease. Which, I guess, makes it apotropiatric.For replacement brush heads, I recommend the FlossAction variety. [i.e., "Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills (3 Count)".]
