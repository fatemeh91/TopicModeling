review/text: This has been a great product for me! I used to be able to use most deodorants, but after having my thyroid glands removed my body seems to have changed. I have had difficulty finding any deodorant the doesn't give me a rash. I saw this brand on the shelf at WalMart and bought a couple to try it. It has worked perfectly for me! No problems with rash or odor. I went back to buy some more and our WalMart no longer carries it. So, I decided to try Tom's of Main. Two days later I have a pealing rash under both arms. Today I got on the internet to see if I could find a supplier for it and happily it is available here on Amazon (I purchase quite a bit through Amazon), so I am back in business.I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.
