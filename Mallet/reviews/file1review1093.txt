review/text: I'm experiencing classic tennis elbow, from too much bad technique with the backhand, and playing a guy who hits the ball with a lot of pace and deep into my backhand corner. The elbow support works pretty well. Stays in place w' the velcro strap. Only thing I'd suggest as improvement is a somewhat larger, higher area that pushes down on the forearm muscle and tendon. Overall, it works well.
