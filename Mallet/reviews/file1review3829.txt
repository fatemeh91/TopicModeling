review/text: I had been having problems sleeping, and i saw this particular tea advertised in a magazine, ordered it right away online from the supplier, good price and fast shipping. No problem with the supplier at all. The tea does make one sleepy, but the overwhelming taste of licorice makes it hard to drink, and in reading the ingredients i see that licorice root is the first ingredient.
