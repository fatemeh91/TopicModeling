review/text: These gloves are pretty useful, though I can't sleep in them, as the review stated. The gloves fit perfectly (I ordered a size S, I have tiny hands) but they make my hands feel too warm and tingly when I am asleep. In the winter, after work or after dinner or whatever when my hands are sore, these are great to put on and wear for awhile. I'd be more pleased if they were a bit airier, allowed for more air circulation. If it's warm and your hands sweat, they do not breathe very well. These are small complaints compared to the soothing help provided to my hands.It's difficult to type on a computer and do some other things that require precision, but they are pretty mobile and very comfortable. I'm a huge fan, I'd suggest them to anyone with psoriatic (or any kind of) arthritis, especially people with small, brittle fingers. They were totally worth the money and make your hands feel warm, tingly and massaged. There aren't many options for people with sore hand joints, especially if you live somewhere with cold, dry winters, and these are a must-have.
