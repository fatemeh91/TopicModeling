review/text: I highly suggest this product. But, you must make sure you need it. It does not vibrate. It sends electric current harmlessly through your feet. People who have poor circulation in the feet or have numbness, it is perfect. There are pads that you attach to stimulate other parts of the body. My chiropractor does that.However, if your looking for vibration from long standing on your feet, this is not for you.An excellent product!
