review/text: I am a physician and recommend this to all my patients - I take care of people with musculoskeletal pain (arthritis, backs, knees etc) and 3 different women's rugby teams and recommend this for its immunity boosting effects and antiinflammatory properties - gives you a great energy boost in midafternoon as well. I also recommend it with Joint Vibrance - great stuff.
