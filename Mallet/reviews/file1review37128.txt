review/text: I hate admitting this but, until the Oral B Humming Bird came along, I flossed maybe once a month. Tight teeth and sore gums meant 20 minutes of misery and shredded, stuck floss, with stuff still stuck in between teeth. The floss in the Humming Bird refills is thin and waxed and held in a little plastic slingshot. This makes the device easy to maneuver inside even a tiny mouth (like mine). The Humming Bird's rapid side-to-side vibration gives your teeth a much better flossing compared to the typical ribbon or any other device. I actually look forward to flossing now. Really!
