review/text: I run an in-home daycare that uses a lot of sippy cups and also use a lot of reusable water bottles. This brush has held up remarkably well! It hasn't &#34;scratched&#34; the insides of the bottles or cups. You can also throw it in the dishwasher to clean it. I haven't used the sanitize cycle or heat dry because I do worry about the bristles melting but it comes out clean and stink free. I didn't give it 4 stars because the handle is thick enough that if you try and hang it up on a hook is lays a little funny against the wall.
