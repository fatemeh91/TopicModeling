review/text: I purchased this toothbrush for my kids. I am tired of the hefty dentist bills and wanted to try something to get the kids to do a better job brushing their teeth thoroughly. The timer that this toothbrush has is really nice. It lets the kids know when 30 seconds is up and they can now move to the other side of their mouth. So far, it is helping the kids brush for a full 2 minutes!
