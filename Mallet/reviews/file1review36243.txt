review/text: I added a pack of these batteries to the shopping cart on a whim, just the push up the total cost to qualify for free shipping. I didn't expect them to have much staying power, but, for the price, it would be no big loss if these turned out to be short timers.Surprise, surprise! They're as good as any widely advertised brand of alkaline battery. We've been using them about 5 months now in various portables, and have been absolutely impressed with their performance.I think they're an equal match for brand-name batteries at a fraction of the cost.
