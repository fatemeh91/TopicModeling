review/text: Dear Tiffany, I promise that I will not try to be frugal and will always, always come to you to have my legs waxed. You see, I got this kit from a friend. She tried to use it on her underarms and after doing half of one, vowed she would never, never wax anything again. But I was willing to give it a whirl; after all, I've been waxed a number of times and know what to expect. What I don't expect is that the wax will never take on the "thin, creamy" texture described on the box, my kitchen will turn into a sticky mess, the wax won't peel off my legs at least half the time, the number of muslin strips will be completely insufficient for a half leg job, the wax removal product in the box won't be of any help, and that I will end up covering myself in cornstarch in order to keep from sticking to the dog, my husband, the sheets and the furniture. What a nightmare. I still have a thick crust-o-wax on my calf that I can't get off for love nor money. I may have to go to the waxing salon to be de-waxed. (How embarassing is that?) So, Tiffany, I promise, promise, promise that I will always let you wax my legs in the future . . . if you promise not to laugh!
