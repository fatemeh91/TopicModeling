review/text: I'm on my third bottle of this supplement, and I don't know what I'd do without it. I LOVE it. I break out mainly from hormonal and stress factors, but if I'm using this product I don't have breakouts. Ever.My dermatologist wasn't too concerned since as I said, my breakouts are hormonal and stress related, but having medical school in the works did the job and motivated me to find a solution of my own. No more wasted time. I've taken these gels once a day for well over a year now, and my skin looks flawless. I use tub Noxema during the week, and a Nuetrogena Benzoyl Peroxide mask/wash on the weekends since I have sensitive skin. Never had I ever been able to use Noxema without my skin looking like pizza the next morning until I started this Vitamin A regimen.If you have breakouts or even severe acne, skip the Accutane or Retin A and get on this. Give it about a month minimum to start working, and I promise you'll never have flare ups again.I don't really have side-effects. I can tell when my body is storing too much a though since I'll get a slight ache on my left side below the rib cage (spleen). When this happens I'll drop my intake to every other day or altogether for about a month and it goes away. Any breakouts won't occur within a month off of the supplement. Also, when the splenic ache comes I've also noticed that my water intake has decreased so it is most likely correlated even with fat soluble nature of Vitamin A.
