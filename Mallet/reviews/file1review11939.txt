review/text: From researching about prenatal vitamins, I read these are really good. The only complaint is some days I have a hard time swallowing them. I was taking a multivitamin which is a bit smaller with no problem. However the Rainbow Light multivitamin is a little larger and sometimes hard to swallow. It also lacks a coating where the texture is rough compared to other smooth vitamins I've tried. I noticed if you let it linger in your mouth, it will start to have that dissolving feeling which I think is part of the reason why I'm having trouble.I would love to buy this product again if it was reduced to 2 smaller pills a day!
