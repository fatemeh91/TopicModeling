review/text: I started trying different brands/types of breast pads and out of the four I have tried so far these are my favorite. I hated the disposables and several of the washables that I tried stated they were waterproof but have leaked through onto my clothes. These are rather thick but very absorbent and are so soft when they come out of the wash. I stopped buying other brands and now own 18 (3 sets) of them and they are holding up nicely with the frequent washing.
