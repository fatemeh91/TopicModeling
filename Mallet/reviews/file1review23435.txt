review/text: This stethoscope was just what I needed. I could hear manual BPs with ease and lung sounds clearly. Unlike other stethoscopes, it did not feel like it was placing a strain on my neck. Plus my patients always had a pleasant comment about it. Well less than 3 months after receiving it, I bent over to get my pen and it fell from around my neck. Well the heart cracked off and flew across the room. There was no repairing it. The metal portion ( which I guess was aluminum) that was embedded in the heart made a clean break. I am saddened and disappointed in the quality. It was nice while it briefly lasted.
