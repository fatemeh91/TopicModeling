review/text: Friend recommended quercetin for dealing with allergy season...which, according to some, this Spring 2012 in the NE is worst it has been in a long time. Although a bit skeptical, I started taking quercetin just as the season was starting up. According to my friend, it typically takes 2-3 weeks for this stuff to take effect. I did have some minor allergy issues (headaches, itchy eyes, sneezing) initially, but they have now totally disappeared. I never had allergies until about 10 years ago, and I discovered them with a vengeance!! I would be absolutely miserable, sometimes having to miss work, getting sinus infections, sore throats etc. This product is absolutely amazing and I can not understand why its connection to allergies has not been studied more. I went on the WebMD website and it is primarily recommended for prostate issues, very little being said about allergies. As a relatively safe, reasonably priced and effective solution to the plague of allergies, I could not recommend this stuff enough!!
