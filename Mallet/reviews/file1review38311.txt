review/text: I am used to doing home waxing, so I guess I am used to having the hair removed by the root. Even the first time using this product I didn't feel any pain. The only thing I can say is that it was a little scary when I first turned the thing on- a bunch of metal tweezers making a hideous sound. But it's a great product that does everything its supposed to. Personally, I think it hurts a lot less on the bikini line than wax as it doesn't pull your sensitive skin there. I use it on my legs, bikini line and underarms without problems. Well worth the investment.
