review/text: So I would first like to say I am one of those selfish A-Holes that never goes back to rate items though I have purchased countless items off amazon. This is my first review btw.I bought the green magic because I was looking into meal supplements. I am a college football player with no time, a huge appetite and a love for school and lifting weights. After 3 weeks of taking the powder faithfully, I noticed I felt a little more energetic and my body responded more from the things I ate. But that wasnt a good enough reason for me to believe this stuff works. Then my girlfriend came down with a bad case of the flu. I decided its time to put this to the test so I exposed myself to my girlfriend in more than a couple ways (use your imagination). She had became really ill after a while, shivers, heat sweats, migraines, fever, etc. I began feeling a little funny after a few days of being around her but continued my powder. I was waiting for the day I would be like her the 2 days she was deathly ill from the flu(Dr. Diagnosed flu for the record) and it never happened. Over a week later I am still fine. I became slightly congested sneezed a few times and felt mucus in my chest but nothing serious.I am sold on this product and will use it until I am in my grave and if I make it to heaven I plan on asking the guards at the peraly gates " Hey you guys got green vibrance up here or what?"
