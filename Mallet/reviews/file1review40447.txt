review/text: Works like a charm where other balms middlingly deliver. Used Karite Lips to help heal a lip cut that kept reopening and splitting everytime my mouth stretched open. It helped soften the cut area so that the wound would remain supple and flexible while healing properly. Excellent by any measure.
