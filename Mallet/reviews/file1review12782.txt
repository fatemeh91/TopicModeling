review/text: Purchased this splint for an emergency pack as a &#34;just in case&#34; item. Have worked with it in the military and love the ability to mold it into any shape you require for almost any situation. When not in use, it is very small and easy to store. Hopefully we'll never need it, but if we do, we definitely have the right item for the job.
