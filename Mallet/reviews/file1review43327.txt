review/text: I got this product after struggling for a few months with varicosities, it has been my saving grace! I would cry every day by 10 in the morning because of the pain I was in, and this saved me! I have 3 other kids to take care of, so no way for me to sit and such, so this has been a life saver for me! My only complaint is that I ordered the petite size, my weight at the time I ordered was 118, my pre-pregnancy pant size was a 4. I ordered the petite, but it is very tight at this point and I still have 4-8 weeks left before I will deliver, so I would order a size bigger than you think! But the product itself is wonderful!
