review/text: I am a new lover of Gin Gins hard candy!! I am newly pregnant (7 weeks) and the morning sickness, which for me is all-day sickness, began a few days ago. I feel aweful, AWEFUL. As soon as I found out I was pregnant I stocked up on anything that might help with the impending nausea - PsiBands, Preggie Pops, Ginger tea, Gin Gins. The PsiBands don't seem to work for me but the ginger candy is AMAZING. (The Preggie Pops work pretty well too.) I feel almost normal while I'm sucking on it. I don't know how or why but, seriously, after about 30 seconds of popping a ginger candy in my mouth I feel SO much better. I'm probably going to destroy my teeth by sucking on candy all day but for now it is definitly worth the relief. Thank you to everyone who rated these highly and convinced me to try them!! (My only complaint is that the candies are a little small and so seem to go fast.)
