review/text: I thought the scent of this was earthy and kind of nice...until I read the other reviewer that said it smells like bug spray. I hate to say it but they're right. It pretty much smells exactly like bug spray, which I guess isn't a noxious odor but it's not a fragrance one tends to seek out especially when you don't want to smell. It also didn't really work so by the end of the day I smelled like b.o. and bug spray. Really gross. I'm going to have to keep looking.
