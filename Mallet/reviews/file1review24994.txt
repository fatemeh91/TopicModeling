review/text: Tried this product on a whim for one month. Not sure it was so smart of me. I was another 'regular' girl, every 28 days like clockwork. I tried this for only one cycle, and only 2 pills a day (as opposed to 3) and I ended up ovulating on Day 18 and my period lasted 34 days. Absolutely unheard of. The only issue is that I happened to get my hormone levels tested during this one month, and both my LH/FSH AND my Progesterone levels were great, so I am not sure if I can attribute this to Fertil-aid. I also had fewer PMS symptoms that I have ever had in my life! So the jury is out on this one!In any case, I decided to stop it immediately so I can get back to my 'regular' 28-day cycles and take it from there. I guess it's better-suited to those who don't ovulate every month or have irregular stuff going on. I see how it can really help. But like the other reviewers, I'd be very wary if you have a regular cycle. I fear it messed me up.
