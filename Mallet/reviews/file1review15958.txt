review/text: I have a back injury while pregnant and was told by my Physical Therapist to get this support belt. It helps elevate some of the weight/pulling in my back do to my growing stomach. It is a little awkward to put on by myself, not sure if that is do to my back injury or the way the belt is made so it didn't get the full 5 stars. I find the belt easier to use when my husband assist me in putting it on. I would recommend this belt for any pregnant women who is having back issues while pregnant.
