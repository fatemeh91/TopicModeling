review/text: If you have tightness in your neck, shoulders, back or head, this is for you. I like the slow speed..."guaranteed" to have you dozing peacefully in 20 minutes. It works. Unlike real humans, it doesn't get tired, or not quite reach the exact spot you want. Feels like someone with strong thumbs is massaging you. Ahhhhhhhh.It does NOT move up and down your back, like the human touch massage chairs... you have to either move it or your body to change where it works. But I found it very relaxing. Use before bedtime for a good night's sleep! Durable. Controls are on/off and 3 steps of speed.
