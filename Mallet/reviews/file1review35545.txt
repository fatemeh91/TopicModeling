review/text: I've owned a pair of these since 2004, and they seem to do a great job. They're relatively comfortable and allow full motion. I play volleyball about four hours a week, and despite occasionally landing on the foot of another player, I have not sprained an ankle while wearing these. (A few years before I started wearing ankle braces for volleyball, I had three sprains in the course of a year and a half.)
