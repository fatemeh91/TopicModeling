review/text: This long-lasting aromatherapy hot/cold pack will literally last for 10 years or more. The investment in your health and comfort level is well worth the price. The polar fleece cover makes this warm and cozy, while the black cloth on the other side makes this pack radiate cold better when the pack is put in the freezer. So, you can use this in the winter or summer or anytime heat/cold is needed.To heat, put in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. To cool, keep in freezer until needed. You may want to put this in a plastic bag first if storing in the freezer.Over the years, the aromatic spices and herbs seem to retain their scent and the rice never seems to dry out, which is quite amazing.This truly will relax tense shoulders when heated in the microwave. Can also be used on lower back if you are in bed on your side because of the shape of the product and how it will conform to your body.Can also be used to create what we call a "kitten spa." We heat this and put it under blankets for our cats. It makes them especially happy and must be very comforting since they will sleep for hours. So, if you have pets who need to be put down for a nap - due to being high strung or just having an annoying day - this works very well and can also give you a much needed break from pet parenting duties.Would also be wonderful for older pets with achesand pains.~The Rebecca Review
