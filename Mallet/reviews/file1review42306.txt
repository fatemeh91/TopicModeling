review/text: TASTE - I was amazed that a vitamin could taste so good! Although it's not the "same" as Odwalla Superfood juice, I'd say the taste is on par, and still fairly similar. Mainly, it tastes like some kind of tropical fruit juice with spirulina in it. I can't understand why anybody would complain about this stuff, unless maybe they're one of those who dislike vegetables, fruit juice, and anything else that's good for you. Even if I didn't like the taste, I'd probably still take it since it's soooo much easier to take than the tablets and you only take a capful (1 oz) at a time - less than a shot of liquor.RESULTS - I should say that I've been taking the Source of Life in either tablets or liquid for almost a year now and the benefits have been pretty clear. I'm a 3rd year grad student and I often have to stay up late. This stuff is NOT a stimulant or anything like that, but the semester I started taking Source of Life, I remember feeling surprisingly resiliant, physically. Even if I was working late a lot, I'd still feel okay and be able to function the next day - different from before I started this stuff. Also, I did not get sick, even when my wife was sick. Previously, I used to get a cold or something about once a year. It's not exactly scientific proof, but I'm convinced enough to keep taking it.
