review/text: I keep relacing this massager, I find that it has a life of about 3-6 months. I have been told I over use mine but it is very cheaply made toy (probably made in some factory for 10 cents each unit) but amazon offers it at the low low price of $11 bucks and you can't beat that price anywhere online and certainly not in a speciality store. So, if you are looking for an inexpensive toy that will hit the spot, this is it.
