review/text: The product is badly crafted..comes apart. It is too light to work as a good tendon hammer...you shouldn't be using the same pin on everyone and I am nearly positive the tuning fork does not vibrate at the said frequency...very bad product...do not be tempted by the 5 in 1 thing...its useless!
