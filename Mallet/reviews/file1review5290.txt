review/text: If you want to completely waste your money on a product that absolutely has no detectable taste of ginger in it..Well than this is the product for you..The Company should of called this product Bruce's Yams Sweet Potato bites...Because that all it taste like...It taste like a Sweet Potato losenge...if such a thing would ever exist...WHERE IS THE GINGER!!..What a joke of a product...
