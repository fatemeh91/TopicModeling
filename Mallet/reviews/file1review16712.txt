review/text: I have bought many of these lighter this summer as a gift to my friends. I did not open it because it was taped and I do not want to open it as a gift. However several friends told me that the lighter seems like opened before and a lot of notches in the surface. Also the lid is not very stable and very loose. I am very disappointed about it.
