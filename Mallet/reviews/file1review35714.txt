review/text: I usually use Systane, but I was out of it. I was shopping at Whole Food, and this homeopathic product was the only dry eye product in the store, so I purchased it. I suppose it's better than nothing - after squeezing multiple drops a few times I finally felt some relief. But the dropper is poorly designed, and it takes too long, and too much product, to get any results. Putting in my Amazon order for Systane now!
