review/text: There's not much to review about these lancet drums. They're easy to install, you never see a needle (not that I care) and when you dispose of a used drum, there are no needles exposed.The MultiClix is my lancet device of choice. I purchased it even though I have several "free" devices from Accu Chek and Bayer as well as my old Accu Chek SoftClix device.What is nice is that Accu Chek doesn't gouge us for the convenience of the drum system. The lancets are priced pretty much the same as any other box of lancets for the same quantity.
