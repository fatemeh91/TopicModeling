review/text: This lavender oil is made to refill the original K Hall diffuser kit (also sold by Simple Luxuries - a great company to do business with) and is so concentrated you don't need very much to get a light fragrance in a room (a bottle will last a long time). This is the purest lavender scent I've ever experienced, no fake, soapy smell. It never fails to make me smile.
