review/text: I wanted the results of waxing without waiting for the wax to heat, the mess of cleaning wax off of my skin and the bathroom floor, or the expense of paying someone else to do it. I read reviews and went for this one. Don't expect it not to hurt a little; it hurts a bit more than waxing, but it's more than tolerable (I have a high pain tolerance but I think most folks could hang with it). I use it to give myself a full brazil monthly and am mostly happy with the results. Not as good as wax, but worth the trade off.The real key is to exfoliate everyday. I have more trouble with ingrown hairs than the epilator. Worth the dough.
