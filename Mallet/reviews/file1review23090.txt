review/text: I bought this carpet sweeper to leave in our travel trailer (aka caravan in British), but I started using it at home because its so easy to whip out and clean up the rug in my living room even several times a day (Baby & 3 kids & dog & cat = dirty quickly), or to whizz around the hardwoods under the highchair. My kids can use it and actually like to use it without the huffing and puffing that comes with a vacuum cleaning request. It does a great job of picking up Labrador hair, food particles and dust bunnies and I empty it each use. However, you knew that was coming right? However, the actual product is frustrating... the handle falls apart everytime (there are 4 sections that slot together), and the handle bracket comes out of its hole everytime too. The fundamental design of this type of product has not changed in years but this model seems to be a poor design. The handle needs to be either one continuous piece or each section needs to screw to the next. And the bracket (goes over the top of the sweeper to which the handle attaches) needs to be more securely fastened to the body. As soon as I find a better replacement, it will relegated back to it's original intention - occasional use in the travel trailer!
