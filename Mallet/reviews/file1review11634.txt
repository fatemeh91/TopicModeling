review/text: This is a beautiful red, I just wish the coverage turned out better. It's very liquidy so it was a real challenge to apply, but I have very long, thick hair. Still, it's gorgeous and my experience with this brand is that the color lasts far longer than the typical brands you can by at the grocery store or Walmart. I will order it again, but next time get help applying it.
