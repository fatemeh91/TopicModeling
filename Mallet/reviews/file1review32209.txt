review/text: I bought the White Nights Doc Johnson Pocket Rocket after purchasing many quality Doc Johnson products, however, when first trying to use the product it took me 5 tries (and 5 different batteries) to actually get the battery to work correctly. The seal, upon further inspection, does not seal tightly enough to allow the battery enough contact with the cells to keep the product going. I've tried to rig the connection and it seems to be working okay, though not as satisfactory as I thought. I would recommend buying this product if you're willing to deal with a less than perfect model.
