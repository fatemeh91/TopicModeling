review/text: Wahl 4196-500 2-Speed All-Body Massager with Heat.This is the second massager that I have owned. I can honestly say that I truly love this Wahl massager. The Hi-Lo heat is just awesome and the vibration (whether Hi or Lo) is so soothing. The only drawback (which doesn't bother me) is the massager is a little bit heavy. But, as far as reliability and comfort you can't go wrong with this Wahl 4196-500!!
