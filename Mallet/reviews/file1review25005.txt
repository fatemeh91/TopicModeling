review/text: I have fibromyalgia and have also had severe hip pain for the last couple of years. I began taking D-Flame about 3 weeks ago. Just two pills a day, one in the morning and one at night, and I no longer take any other medications for pain. The hip pain seems to be almost completely gone and the fibro pain is greatly diminshed and I haven't noticed any side effects. I am not totally pain free at this point, but the pain relief allows me to function more normally and I am hoping for even greater pain relief as I continue taking the product.
