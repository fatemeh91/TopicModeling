review/text: This product was easy to set up, and the scale portion works well. However, those are the only positives.The body fat percentage of the scale does not work. I get different readings each time I step on the scale. One of the reasons why I bought this was because it has an athletic mode, which corrects for the high muscle mass of athletes. Being a collegiate division one athlete, my muscle percentage is higher than that of a normal person. The batteries were also not included, so that added extra expenses.Overall, it was not worth the money I spent on it. If you are an athlete that want accurate readings, do not buy this scale.
