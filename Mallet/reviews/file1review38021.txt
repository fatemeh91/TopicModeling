review/text: Since my husband's family has a history of heart disease, I thought I would look into getting one of these. In researching the topic at the Consumer Reports website, I found that they reported that the resuscitation rate nationally is 2 to 5%. With a Home Defibrillator, the rate jumps to 40 to 50%.In researching further, I found that the Phillips is the only Home Defibrillator available to buy without a prescription. The website for this product, www.heartstarthome.com, has a wealth of information. They offer assistance in finding out if insurance or Medicare will cover some of the cost of this product.The American Heart Association states that 340,000 people in the U.S. die from Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) each year. St. Jude Medical Center website (sjm.com) lists the risk factors for SCA, although SCA can occur without any risk factors:Heart attackHeart failureHeart surgeryCoronary artery diseaseDiabetesHigh cholesterolHigh blood pressureCigarette smokingDrug or alcohol abuseExcess weightHigh fat dietSedentary lifestyleStressCertain medications (over-the-counter and prescriptions, including decongestants, diet and herbal supplements)Family history of arrhythmia or sudden cardiac arrestCongenital heart disorders (heart problems present at birth, usually involving the heart's chambers or valves)Advancing ageI was very impressed with the amount of on-line support at www.heartstarthome.com, including a video and a demo. The demo shows exactly how the product works. It removed all doubt about whether I would be able to use this product. (Obviously, taking the American Heart Association class is highly advisable!) Thanks, Philips.
