review/text: This item works great. It does have a strong, unpleasant plastic type smell, but I got rid of most of it by removing the sleeve and cleaning it with warm water and orange scented dish soap. I turned it inside out, as the residue on the inside of the sleeve is where most of the smell was coming from -- like with latex gloves. Anyway, after a washing of the inside and out, most of the smell is gone, it's not as strong anymore. I'm also going to get some adult toy cleaner that was recommended for getting rid of this smell. Works great, though. ;)
