review/text: It works as described, is very slim and seems mechanically well designed but it has one pretty major flaw (in my opinion). You can't go backwards. The order of the cycle is pencil, black pen, red pen.... That means if I'm writing in red ink and need to go back to black, I have to go around the cycle. That may not bother others, but for me, it's a huge issue because I bought the pen for quick organized note taking. Also, the red isn't a vibrant red, it's more of a business red, aka deep purple.
