review/text: I have been using a Mach 3 razor for the past few years but I got tired of the hassle of shaving with it every morning (especially the shaving cream mess). I decided to try the 8585 after much research, and I am happy to report that after a month of use I couldn't be more pleased. I get a shave almost as close as my Mach 3 with no cuts or nicks and none of the mess, and my skin never feels irritated.It took about a week to adjust to the difference of using an electric, but now I am getting close shaves every morning. Highly recommended for those who are thinking of making the jump!
