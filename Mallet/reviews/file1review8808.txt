review/text: I will add to the chorus of positive reviews of this product. It is absolutely incredible and is, essentially, a pharmaceutical grade phyto-nutrient/herbal/vitamin/mineral supplement that works as advertised. I am an internist (MD) who happens to believe in nutritional supplementation and the positive effects of "alternative" measures to combat everyday ills--i.e. common colds, body and joint aches, skin ailments, etc. However, I am also very skeptical about the true benefit of many supplements. I find it amusing that most "alternative practitioners" bemoan the fact that most MD's are pharmaceutical pushers who are lapdogs for the drug companies while the "practitioners" preaching this are trying to sell something (to line their pockets)... but I digress. I was suffering from lack of energy, poor mental clarity and had multiple aches and pains like many people have. On a recommendation of a colleague, I tried Vibrant Health Green Vibrance--of course, after a bit of research. Wow! This is no placebo effect. Its careful balance of ingredients worked to improve my energy, mood and sense of well-being. I highly recommend it both from an anecdotal perspective (mine) and from a medical perspective. I will begin recommending it to patients. One word of caution.. in people undergoing chemotherapy who are neutropenic (i.e. extremely low white blood cell count--under 1000) the pro-biotics can potentially be harmful (i.e. even the good bacteria can be bad under these condtions). On the flipside, if you are taking antibiotics (and are not neutropenic) then I would highly recommend taking this because it is a good way to protect colon health and prevent Clostridium Difficile ("C diff.") colitis. Take care and take this supplement. You will not regret it!
