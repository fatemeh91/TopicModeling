review/text: I've had major back and neck problems since an auto accident a number of years ago. The pain often becomes an unbearable burning sensation that I am not able to reach. I have often thought..."If I only had a nail on the wall that I could press into..." Wish I had invented the Back Buddy! Since my purchase of this remarkable product, I can use it to find the exact point of pain, use as much pressure as necessary to relieve the spasm and get greatful relief. Thank you Back Buddy!!
