review/text: The "Zeiss Lens Cloths" are just about the best and most convenient lens cleaner I have found. We use very high grade digital still and video cameras in our business and trust these cleaners to get the lenses clean without removing the protective coatings.We also wear glasses and these also work great on them as well, leaving no streaking at all.Recommended!CFH
