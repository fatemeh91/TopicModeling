review/text: I loved the idea of taking liquid magnesium...I get very anxious and tense. I hoped this would be a miracle for me but I haven't seen any difference yet. The flavor is ok--it's pretty chaulky but that's to be expected. The serving size seems large...taking it every day would last me like 2 weeks. I wish the bottle were bigger.
