review/text: I used to love Vitamin Shoppe Ultimate 10 probiotics -- they worked and were much less expensive than most other brands. But more and more, I started getting batches of them that were speckled and old-looking and didn't work. Most consumers probably can't tell whether their probiotics work or not, since it's the kind of thing that you don't really notice. But I can tell because I had a severe candida problem for years due to undiagnosed thyroid and adrenal problems, and this product made a huge difference in helping to get it under control. When I felt the candida coming back slightly, I'd take about 10 of these and break one apart to use topically -- which is what really worked great and immediately -- and voila, next day, no symptoms. But when I started getting the speckled batches of probiotics, they stopped working. At first Vitamin Shoppe took them back with an apology -- but now, so many batches are like this that VS's corporate office has told employees they're fine, it's just a "new formula." It may be a new formula, but if so, it doesn't work. I wanted to get one tested, but that costs $1,000+, so instead I just stopped buying them. They are crap -- don't waste your money!
