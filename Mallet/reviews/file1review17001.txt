review/text: I had bought two of these. The first pair was for my dad and he loves the trimmer. I would use it on my son's hair too and the cuts came out beautifully. I had bought a cheapo hair cutter that broke so I ordered myself one of these to cut my son's hair. He is 14 months old and tolerates this just fine. The 9 length settings are great and you can remove the guard to use just the blade. I would definitely recommend this product.
