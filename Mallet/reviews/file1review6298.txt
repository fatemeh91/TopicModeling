review/text: Just because this mop has the Mr. Clean name doesn't mean it's better. It's actually worse! The mop head is made up of two sponge layers, which came apart (unglued) during the first use. I tried it with two different mop heads, and the same thing happened to both. Sometimes simpler is better. I would've gotten a better quality mop if I had just bought it at my local supermarket.
