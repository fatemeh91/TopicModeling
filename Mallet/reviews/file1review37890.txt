review/text: This is an aesthetically pleasing, well-built, durable product. I have noticed trouble compared to other braces in getting a good fit that applies enough pressure without cutting off circulation. However this has gotten a bit better over time, so I think it's fair to say this brace has a bit of a "break in" period.The brace does an excellent job of wicking away moisture, which helps keep bad odor buildup to a minimum.It's important to remember that braces like these are damage control, *not* treatment. Wear it while you sleep; wear it during your most aggravating activities. But make sure you get in plenty of time without a brace like this one. Especially if you developed your wrist issue through repetitive gripping/finger-pushing activities, it is likely that you have issues further up your arm which a brace like this will only mask. Still explore things like massage, nerve/tendon "flossing" exercises, and strengthening your extendor muscles. I also recommend Penetrex which you can find for sale here on Amazon. Good luck!
