review/text: this stuff really does work--felt results the first day for sibo ibs ect... i only take one and it surely takes the bloat away-i take celebrex and ur not supposed to take both because damage will occur to the stomach lining. but i still take one and i can feel it working. some people take up to 6 or 7 so i think one is ok.
