review/text: I bought this item 8 months ago. All of a sudden, it stopped pumping water. It has a two year warranty. Now, I have the option of shipping it back to the service center or buying another one. I need a water pik, but the postage and the hassle of sending it somewhere is simply not worth it. And the time it will take to get it back. This is how they make their money- they sell you something that is shoddy and give it a two year warranty then they give you no choice but to buy another one because when the time comes to make use of the warranty, the time and expense you have to take to make use of it cancels the benefit. If they gave it a 6 month warranty, I would not had expected so much. A two year warranty led me to believe this is a mugh better product than I thought. It is a sales tactic.
