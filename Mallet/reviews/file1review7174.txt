review/text: I received the foot bath today, and tried it out immediately. The heating element actually keeps the water warm!I was concerned because the photos don't show the inside of the bath, and I really hate massaging nodes - on my last foot bath I had to hold my feet up all the time to avoid their nasty little spikes. So I was very happy to see this has removable massaging rollers, and very comfortable little bumps on the bottom of the bath.The size is also terrific. My son has really big feet, and not only was it long enough and wide enough for his size 16 EEEEE feet, but it is deep enough to accommodate his equally outsize arches.
