review/text: Rapid response, rapid delivery, of two identical brooms...one purchased as a gift. Love this type broom, and sought it out online. Works perfectly. Only problem is that when my daughters broom tipped over and hit the floor, the handle cracked off right at the base where it attaches to the head, and can't be repaired, and is now useless.
