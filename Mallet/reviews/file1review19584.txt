review/text: Length:: 0:44 MinsThis is an awesome seat for the little ones!! We tried the Disney Cars Soft Potty Seat and it didn't fit at all because our toilet seat is an oval. My son is 2 1/2 and he loves this seat. I wish we had bought this one the first time around instead of wasting time and money on other seats. The adjustable dial is great to get a snug fit so little thighs or bottoms do not get pinched between the toilet and trainer seat. The rubber ring around the edge of the seat keeps it firmly in place so the little ones feel safe on it. The rubber handle is the perfect size and easy to grab. It doesn't hang flush with the wall but that's a small price to pay for an otherwise PERFECT seat!!
