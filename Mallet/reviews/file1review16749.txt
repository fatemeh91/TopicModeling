review/text: The Neutrogena Mattifier works ok, but I think Clean & Clear's mattifier worked better. Unfortunately, Clean & Clear discontinued their product. Perhaps my opinion is based on initial application. Neutrogena goes on feeling a little slickery or greasy, and it initially makes your skin feel greasy, too. Whereas Clean & Clear goes on feeling clean and dries almost immediately. And your face feels completely grease free almost all day. I'll probably try other mattifiers before I come back to Neutrogena's again.
