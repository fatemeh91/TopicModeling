review/text: I used these tweezers for a few days before the tip bent and was unusable (tips would not connect and tweeze anything).Pros*was not able to use long enough to really find positivesCons*the sharp tips actually seemed really ineffective when I used them compared to a flat tipped pair. The "needle thin" tips made it hard to get hairs. I found that the precision description of these tweezers was hard for me personally to use in reality*the super pointy tips actually poked me quite a bit and I gained a sort of Pavlovian aversion to using them*while using them they fell about 2 feet from the bathroom mirror cabinet to the bathroom counter, bending the tips instantly. After this they would not conform to their normal shape despite my efforts and would not tweeze anything. I may take them up on the replacement but I found them hard to use even when working 100% as they should.Some people may find great use of these, but prefer the flat tipped/tapered tweezers after using these briefly
