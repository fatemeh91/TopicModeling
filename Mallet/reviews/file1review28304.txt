review/text: ON Gold Whey is known for high quality protein and was part of the protein absorption testing and was shown to be high quality, but there are lots of high quality protein powders. I think the main factors for picking a protein powder are: does it mix well and does it taste good.ON does mix very well. I mix with 2% milk and I can use a shaker and no clumps are in the bottle. I've even mixed this in a pinch by stacking two cups together ala Cocktail and it came out blended.The taste is decent and better than most I've had. The only thing that put me off initially was the consistency. Using one scoop with 8 oz. milk the mix is still very liquid. I've been used to having a thicker texture with this type of ratio, so it was a bit off putting. But, I've grown used to it and it's actually nice since you can finish off the shake and not have much left clinging to the sides.
