review/text: I am upset becuase i am trying to find the best natural safe remedy for my baby but i also want one that is EFFECTIVE. these pellets do not dissolve very easily, annd they did not work at all.. it was a pain to give it to him , and was EXACTLY LIKE I WAS GIVING HIM WATER! I think cold water would have worked better.. BUT I ran out of camilia teething relief (which seems to work better and does not have coffee or sugar in it) so i have melted 2 pellets in each ice cube and hopefulle will get better results since it will be on his gums while he sucks on it for a while.. hope it works and isnt just a waste of money..
