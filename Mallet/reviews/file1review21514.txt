review/text: I actually prefer the Sonicare toothbrush, but switched to Oral-B sonic when my Sonicare finally conked out after 6 or 7 years.The only reason I switched is because I was spending about $25 a pop for only 2 replacement brushes for Sonicare and Oral-B was around $20 for 3 brushes. Figured I'd save more in the long run... and after about a year of using it... the unit works pretty good and a have definitely saved a bit on the replacements.Overall good value... I have it on subscription now.
