review/text: I have irregular periods and am on clomid. The day before ovulation this test gave me a line that was darker than i had seen before but it was not darker or as dark as the control line. I went to the dollar store and bought one of theres to double check and that one was much more clear and about the same price. Thank goodness i bought the other brand bc i ovulated on day 23 and would have missed it relying on this test alone.
