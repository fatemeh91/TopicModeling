review/text: This first aid kit looks great, and is ideal for the 3-5 person hiking/camping trips that I take with friends and with family. However, the item shipped to me from Amazon was full of expired medical items. I purchased a similar item from a local outdoor-ing retailing. Give yourself enough time to expect a refund before getting a valid item.
