review/text: This blade was sharp, came with the razor, and lasted 6 shaves. It was nearly as sharp on the 7thas the 7 AM blades I bought are new.The Merkur blades are sharp, and hold their sharpness, at least for me.They seem to be a bit on the expensive side, but, I'll need more then one blade to find outhow long they last, consistently.So far so good. I've got another 3 months of 7 AM's to shave through, then I'll give these another look
