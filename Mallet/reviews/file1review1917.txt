review/text: I know Tea Tree Oil does the job and is a great antiseptic and that's why I bought it. It's a rather small bottle but not bad. One could most likely make their own version for less money, which is what I did with some Tea Tree Oil when this ran out. I gave it 5 stars because I'm a firm believer in the main ingredient.
