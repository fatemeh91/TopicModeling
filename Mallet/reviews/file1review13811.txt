review/text: I found this happy wrap to be indespensible during the cold winter in a drafty home. Many uses. Once heated for 21/2 minutes in the microwave, I keep warm by sitting on it, throwing it on my lap, warming my feet, my arthritic knees and back and of couse my neck. The warm, moist heat is soothing. Slight smell but not enough to prevent me from using it several times a day to keep warm. Don't intend to use it in the summer.
