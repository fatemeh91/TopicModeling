review/text: I first was introduced to this tea as part of the "Master Cleanse Lemonade Diet" about 5 years ago.I only did the cleanse for about two days but I kept the tea around.It does exactly what it's supposed to and I love that it's natural as opposed to laxatives.The only problem I have with the tea (hence the 4 stars, instead of 5) is that for me, it does cause serious cramping about 30 minutes after drinking the tea. The cramps are pretty painful though they do stop instantly as soon as everything is "emptied" out.I do not use this tea on a daily or even weekly basis. I save it more so for times when I am feeling irregular or when I feel that I want to do a cleanse.All in all, even with the cramps, I still prefer this tea to laxatives for staying regular and cleansing the body!
