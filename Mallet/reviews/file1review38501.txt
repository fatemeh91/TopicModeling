review/text: just for the record, i'm a 17 year old girl, and embarrassingly enough i have(or had) the pleasure of walking around with overly hairy arms. in the past, i've stupidly tried to shave them, bleach the hair, use nair, and other crap like that..but until recently i've just been sticking to long sleeves. a majority of the reviewers here only talk about using this epilator on their legs, pits, and bikini area..but let me just say it works just as well on arms, too. just a warning though, this thing hurts like hell! it may just have been because it was my first time using it, or because my hair was so thick and long, but don't believe the whole "you'll only feel a slight prickling sensation" deal. this little thing is also pretty intimidating as well...it scared the crap out of me when i first turned it on XD but all in all, i'm so happy that i invested in this product. it's made me feel a lot better about my arms, and now i can wear t-shirts without being so self-concious :) thanks emjoi!!
