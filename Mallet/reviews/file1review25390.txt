review/text: This thing could not cut a single hair. First we tried the nose, then the ears, then the arm then the twigs and berries.......it was as if the blade was missing......complete POS......my old Panasonic device worked well for years......sad to say this is the first Panasonic product that I have ever bought that has not lived up to the name.
