review/text: Hands down, the best, simplest, and most reliable nose hair trimmer that I have ever used and I have owned many. I had this one like 10 years ago, and lost it in a move and couldn't find it anywhere. So I went through a chain of bigger name, more expensive crappy trimmers, only to find this one on amazon a couple weeks ago.
