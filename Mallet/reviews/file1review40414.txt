review/text: I did a bit of research on various companies selling Pycnogenol and found that only Natrol has an "A" rating with the Better Business Bureau. That tells me that they take care of their customers and don't put out products that draw a huge number of complaints. For that reason, I'm going to give their product a try over their competitors.
