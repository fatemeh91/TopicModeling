review/text: So, I'm suffering from a broken tailbone that will not heal.I tried this cushion, but it was too thick to use in the car. It placed me uncomfortably tall in the seat. I'm a tall person, so it might work fine for some one who is short or has a short torso.What I found works much better is a a foam roll on in the small of my back. My doctor told me that having this to keep me erect in a seat or a chair would keep pressure off the tailbone. It has helped a great deal on long trips.
