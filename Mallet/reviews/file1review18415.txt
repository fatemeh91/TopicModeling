review/text: This product came as described- Stretch cotton terry. If you are looking for a thick, durable, would last through 100 washes changing pad cover, this is not the one. It's very thin, looks and feels more like polyester than cotton, and stains are hard to get out :/. It is soft and fits our contour pad well, it just wasn't quite what I was wanting out of a cotton terry cover.
