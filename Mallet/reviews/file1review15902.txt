review/text: I read as many reviews as I could before purchasing this one and still wasn't sure if it would be a good support. I'm used to wearing a stretchy velcro closure back brace for lower back support when I work out on my farm. I'm under 30 but have had lower back problems in the past. This brace is similar to the kind I've used before and is adjustable to your needs. If you're looking for lower back support and have worn a generic type of back support (not over the shoulder strap kind) before then this one is a very similar pregnancy one. Before getting pregnant I was about 160 (muscular but some belly fat), 5'9 and this size medium during pregnancy is working very well. I'm at 71/2 months now and I'm sure it will fit up to the end.
