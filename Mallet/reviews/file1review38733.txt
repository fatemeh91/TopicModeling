review/text: Overall, this is a pretty good toy. For the price it more than delivers. Its firm, not too soft and bendable and I had no problems using it to its fullest because of this. My only minor problem is the suction cup barely works. Others have complained of smell, I simply washed it and let it air dry, no more smell. The girth and circumference were a little more than expected, but still pretty great.
