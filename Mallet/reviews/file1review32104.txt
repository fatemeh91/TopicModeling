review/text: Well it was our wedding day and my wife looked amazing. The only problem is that her red rose bouquet bled into her wedding dress. Could you imagine the horror???? All I can say is thank the good lord for Tide To Go as it saved the day and our wedding... Best product I have ever used. Once again Tide does it again with a remarkable product
