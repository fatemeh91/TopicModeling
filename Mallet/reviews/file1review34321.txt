review/text: Product allows you to use both hands to style your hair and still use your blow dryer. The air will get right to the area you are working on and the job will go that much faster. The stand adjusts to only one height (so its #1 low or #2 higher). the gooseneck is great as it can bend into your task : whether you are styling your hair or drying your finger or toe nails. The manufacturer no longer produces the Hair Made hair dryers which fit into the stand holder, but almost any hair dryer should fit.
