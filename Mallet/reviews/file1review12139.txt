review/text: I have used 1-day vitamins (with DHA) during my last pregnancy and with this pregnancy until now, and they worked fine. 2 weeks ago, I started to have fish-oily burps after taking them (due to the DHA one). So, I did a little research on the internet and found these Rainbow plant based prenatals. I have been using these for 1 week now. They do not have DHA but my body seems to be adjusted to these. They do not cause nausea (which i had for first 3 months), stomach upset or constipation.Almost all the prenatal vitamins do not have 100%DV calcium. If you are not taking enough calcium-rich foods, I would recommend taking an additional calcium supplement.
