review/text: I was taking Pro Complex by ON, but the price of that was just too much. I decided to try these instead and love it. Not only is it affordable, but it tastes really good. I usually mix it with fat free milk and it pretty much tastes like a chocolate shake with a hint of the protein taste. Although this has less protein per serving compared to Pro Complex, it will benefit most people who use it in their diet and workout routine.
