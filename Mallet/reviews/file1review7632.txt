review/text: I have all of the Taylor as well as the Trumper creams, both I consider excellent. I also happen to have extremely sensitive skin. This said, did I mention, I severly dislike nicks which are hard to avoid during a careless moment with a feather blade. With this underpackaged product small mistakes are forgiven. The only cream I literally treat as a soap with my brush, (kind of hard) which I really don't mind because the Trumper cream, (which I also love) is the same weight as this product and shave for shave will last half (or there abouts) as long.This is a great cream and I fully intend to try there other products. So should you if possible, you won't regret it.
