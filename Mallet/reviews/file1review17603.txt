review/text: I have worn a beard for 36 years, and have used the predecessor of this Remington (the MB-40) for the last 10 years. Loved the MB-40, and this MB-200 improves upon that model...more quiet (amazingly quiet), lighter and feels like a sharper cut. I am a happy camper (runner, walker, snowshoer, bicyclist, etc).
