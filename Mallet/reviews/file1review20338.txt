review/text: I purchased this cloth after buying a junky microfiber cloth at a big box store. I simply ran my glasses under water, scrubbed with my fingers, and then wiped it clean with the cloth. The results were fantastic. My glasses were as clean as the day I purchased them. I've washed the cloth twice in the laundry and it's held up great.
