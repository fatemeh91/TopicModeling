review/text: Hi,I found this kit to be complete. The material is sturdy and IMO quality. I mainly use the yoga mat since I only do yoga twice a week to maintain my flexibility. So far, it has remained in good shape, even in the desert heat and humidity. All in all, for the money, I'd buy this item again.Take care,Rob G
