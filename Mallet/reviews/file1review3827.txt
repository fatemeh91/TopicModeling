review/text: So I've had my fair share of green and black teas. I received this certain tea as a present from a good friend. I cannot tell you how amazing this tea is.It's got two things going for it: It tastes awesome and is pleasant to consume.Taste is a big deal. This tea tastes amazing and there is just a burst of amazing spices and flavours that come out of this tea.Downing something is not healthy. If you're consuming something for everything but taste then you're doing it wrong. I enjoy this tea because it goes down nice and smooth and leaves a very pleasant after taste. As one reviewer said, it leaves a nasty after taste. I would not agree. I believe it to be a very relaxing and just overall awesome after taste.If you have some kind of stress disorder this is probably not the tea you want. Now I'm no tea whizz but I don't really think that getting this tea for it's "relaxing effects" would be the way to go. I get it because this was a delicious tea and I'm sitting down with a cup as I type. I really do love this tea and if you're looking for something that just tastes awesome and you want to sit down and chill out with, this is the tea to go with.
