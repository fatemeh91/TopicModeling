review/text: Prior to purchasing the Oral-B Triumph, I had used an Interplak electric toothbrush for a number of years. I had been reluctant to change, but Interplak stopped manufacturing the brush heads I needed.Since switching to the Trimuph I've been very happy. The motor is strong and delivers satisfactory power to the brush head; the unique pressure sensor cuts the motor when it senses that you are pressing too hard on your teeth (which leads to gum problems), and the unit is easy to clean. In addition, the fully charged battery provides at least two full weeks of 2x/day brushing, as promised.The only downsides so far are minor: The charging base is too big for a narrow bathroom shelf and the battery takes a while to charge fully.But on the whole I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it readily.
