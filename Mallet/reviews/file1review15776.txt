review/text: I won't go into a long-winded monologue about this pen.It's an absolute pleasure to write with, and it's the most useful writing utensil I've ever owned. It looks great, too.I've had this pen for over a month now, and every day, I sincerely look forward to writing with it. What more can you ask for?
