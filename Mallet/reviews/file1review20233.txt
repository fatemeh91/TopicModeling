review/text: After purchasing three packs of these, I was so disheartened to read the overwhelming amount of negative reviews! I am a first-time CD'ing mom and I have to say, I actually love these. YOU CANNOT BEAT THE PRICE! - which is why I chose these to try out first. Yes, when you first open the package you are immediately starring at a very thin piece of cloth, but don't let that fool you. Wash them once or twice (I only did once) and they are already a world different! Until our Kawaii OS Covers get here, I am doubling up and folding in the oragami style. Yes, the cloth gets wet when your little one urinates, but that's a cloth diaper for you! They are made to be worn with a cover.... Something else we are doing is putting a microfiber cloth (also very inexpensive) between the cloth diaper and the cover, and we don't even need to change the cover often because it does not get wet. (Don't put the microfiber inside the cloth diaper, though, because that is not great for your little one's skin).Overall, I would highly recommend these. They literally take 10 minutes to dry on Medium heat! 10 MINUTES! I can't say how long they hold up for yet, but honestly, with the price so low, I can afford to buy more in a few months. If you're unsure, buy one pack - wash at least once - and give it a shot. They are so versatile that you WILL be able to find plenty of other uses for them if you don't like them for a cloth diaper.
