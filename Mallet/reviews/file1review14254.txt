review/text: I have two of these units. One in the kids bathroom and one in my shower. Just this morning I was in my shower and I heard the noise of the other unit going off. I was home alone and everyone had been gone to work/school. Freaked me out for a second. By the time I got to the kids shower, half the bottle was sprayed all over the floor, wall, sink, etc. I got a face full myself before I managed to close the shower curtain. The entire full bottle emptied. I had to remove the unit from the shower and remove the batteries to get it to shut off! This is a 3 month old unit and I was on my 3rd refill.I will be removing the unit from my shower also. They are both going in the trash. I would not want one to go off as I was showering. And the sticky mess I had to clean up all over the kids bathroom was ridiculous.So, beware to those who have one, make sure your shower curtain/door is kept close, it can go off all by itself. And it will just keep going and going and not shut off.Must be the energizer bunny at work, trying to scare me half to dealth!!!!!
