review/text: But boy was I wrong! This is a very well laid out and well stocked kit. The only thing I added was Adventure Medical's "Pocket Survival Kit" tucked inside and the whole thing went into my day pack. I feel good knowing it is there and would definitely recommend Adventure Medical's products to anyone looking for first aid supplies.
