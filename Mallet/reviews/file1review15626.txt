review/text: Like others I was intrigued by the idea of a one week deoderant. The first time I tried it it worked for about 3-4 days, so I was psyched. The second application was less effective though, only lasting about 36 hours. A little expensive for that kind of performance.I'm also curious about how it works and couldn't find enough info on the potential health effects. I want to avoid aluminum. An alternative product which is all natural and works like regular deodorant is "Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Roll-On" by TCCD International. This is made from Thai crystals, but is easier to apply. Good luck!
