review/text: I bought this toothbrush because it was a gold box savings and needed to replace my other Oral B. I am so happy with it. My teeth feel "squeaky clean" after using it and it doesn't "tickle" my gums like Sonicare did. It has a great battery life and two different speeds. After a few weeks, my teeth look whiter and I had a lot less plaque at my last dental appointment. My husband is a dentist and has started to use a more deluxe, but similar, version of this (has a digital timer, 4 speeds, and some other aesthetic nuances) and is also very pleased. In fact, he likes it so much that he is starting to give them away to his new patients!
