review/text: This is the best razor out there. I have been using it for over 15 years and I love it! No razor burn, no cuts, no red bumps. The blade lasts forever so refills last awhile. I was happy using this razor until the metal part that holds the razor broke. I guess after 15 years it had served me well. I went to the store to buy another one and couldn't find it. Turns out every store I went to didn't carry it anymore. I bought that Intuition razor-crap let me tell you. [...] My husband doesn't get it, but I know you ladies out there in similar situations will be as happy as I am! I bought two just in case this next one breaks in 15 years and I am stuck again. Good luck and happy shaving! :)
