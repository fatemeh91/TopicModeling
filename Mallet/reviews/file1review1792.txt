review/text: I have a 14 yr old special needs son with horrible athletes feet and ingrown toe nails. This stuff has worked so well for him he brings me the bottle so I can use it with him. I noticed a drastic difference in his feet just after the first try.This stuff does smell...it's from tea tree oil so thats a given. But if it smelled like roses it probably would not have worked lol. Once we all adjust to the smell we are going to try it as a soak in the bath for him because he also has a rash that just won't go away no matter what the docs do.
