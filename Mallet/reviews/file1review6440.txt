review/text: So I've owned this for less than one week. I have had neck, shoulder and lower back pain for quite some time. I have been in some kind of constant 24/7 pain in my lower back for the past year and a half, Chiropractic doesn't help. My shoulders and neck have been extremely stiff and painful for the past 6-7 months. I had an episode of vertigo in July due to it.I was getting ready to have my doctor get me back into physical therapy where they have done TPT (trigger point therapy) on me before with great results. Then I bought this.I know this is going to sound over the top, or maybe that I am exagerating, but I'm not. Working my trigger points several times a day I have all but eliminated the tightness and stiffness in my neck and my lower back pain is almost non-existent. But, you have to keep it up, not over do it, and do it consistently. That being said, two days after I received this, I went out and bought Clair Davies book, The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook. I recommend this because it helps to know what you are looking for and how to address it. There is A LOT to learn, and I figure if I am going to poke and prod around on myself then I want to have a good idea on what I should do and how I should do it. Being to physical therapy before I learned from them, too, and already had an idea of what I was looking for with trigger points. In general though, remember for TPT to work, the trigger point is generally located away from the site of where you are experiencing pain, and also located on the same side of the body.Muscle wise, this is the best I have felt in a long time (and in such a short period of time) and I would recommend this tool. I would also recommend Clair Davies workbook (or any good TPT book) to go with it as a must have. Learn as much as you can so you can use it successfully.
