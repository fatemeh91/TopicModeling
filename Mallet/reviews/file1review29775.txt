review/text: I first purchased this product in 2002 and I have to say it is a great product. If you want to get a moderate amount of omega-3 fatty acids into your diet through salmon oil, try this brand. The oil is tested for contaminants such as mercury and PCBs. Finding salmon oil that is from WILD and ALASKAN salmon is somewhat tough. Any fish oil from wild fish is better than fish oil from farmed fish, because wild fish usually have a higher amount of omega-3 fatty acids. The omega-3 fatty acid content per capsule is 80 mg. EPA, 70 mg. DHA. Each capsule also contains 10 IU of vitamin E. Try this product.
