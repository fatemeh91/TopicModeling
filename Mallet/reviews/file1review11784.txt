review/text: Champion Nutrition does it again! This flavor is relatively new to me... I tried a sample pack a couple of months ago and it was absolutely delicious. It's not a super-fake banana taste (like the Runts candies), but more of a creamy flavor, which is implied by the play on words that is the name of the flavor (Banana Scream::Bananas'n'Cream).The quality of the protein is excellent as well, including both isolate and concentrate (a stack). Great overall consistency, stirring ability (a bit thick on the surface of the liquid when you stir it), shaking consistency is perfect (frothy, creamy, lump-less), and blend-ability is great, too. It thickens up and lightens up nicely when blended, turning 16oz of shake into about 24 oz's of a lighter frothier liquid. It has a consistent texture when blended as well, unlike some proteins that settle and have separation.Overall, I give this whey a 5/5. Delicious taste, great macros, and great price.
