review/text: When the item came, the batteries were already dead. I ran to the drugstore to buy new batteries, but the store didn't carry the correct kind. Even if they did, we could not get the battery cover off. It says to just use a coin, but we did that and all it did was strip the plastic. Both my husband and I tried with various tools, but we couldn't open the battery cover. We'll keep trying, but right now it's basically a big waste of money.
