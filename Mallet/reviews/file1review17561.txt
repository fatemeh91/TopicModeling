review/text: I purchased this because my Braun electric razor developed a problem with the power button: it wouldn't stay turned off. I got this for a quick, neaten-up while considering another razor purchase. I never made one; this does the job for me and cost so much less.For it's intended uses it works very well. But I use if for shaving. Here's how:Pull of the front, adjustable head and leave the bare cutting edge exposed. Drag that across your face. Not back and forth, just drag. WOW! It is fast and leaves just a stubble. That's just the way I wanted and it works fine for me.When new it held a charge for a long, long time. Now, with age, a full charge doesn't last quite as long. Nut, hey, it has a long life left in it still; and when it finally goes, I'll buy another one just like it. Thanks Amazon for a useful and efficient product!
