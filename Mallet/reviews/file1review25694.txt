review/text: I have been in the market for this item for months. I read every review on every personal trimmer Amazon was offering and chose to purchase this item because of all the good reviews it received. I received my trimmer yesterday and am very please to say that it is an excellent product. It trims neatly and painlessly and is very easy to use. The noise level is minimal and comes apart easily for cleaning. And you can't beat the price!
