review/text: The razor gives a close shave, but I have had problems with Braun's customer service. I have owned the razor for almost a year. After approximately six months, the lights on the charging/cleaning base would not come on and the base would not clean the razor. I called Braun and they told me which service center to send it to and gave me the number so that I could call first. I called the service center, described the symptoms and was instructed to send in the base at my expense. Well...weeks became months with no word from Braun or the service center. I called Braun and they told me to contact the service center. I did as instructed and they told me that the base was fine and that maybe there was a problem with the razor or the charging adaptor and that I would have to send them in at my expense even though I was originally asked to send in only the base. Interestingly enough, I have been using the razor and charger without incident. I am frustrated that they have had my base for months and have not contacted me to tell me their conclusion. I will send in my razor and go back to a blade until I receive my repaired setup; hopefully it will be back in a reasonable amount of time. Though I like the ergonomics and shave of the 8585, I will probably not buy any more Braun products due to the poor attention Braun gives to the buyer after the sale.
