review/text: My wife absolutely loves this rabbit! During stressful times, she sometimes has difficulty getting "over the edge," so to speak, but this rabbit is able to give her exactly the extra stimulation that she needs. We've had other vibes, and this is by far the best.The motor is surprisingly powerful but is not terribly noisy. The main body is nice and thick without being monstrous, and the rabbit ears hit her in just the right spot. She also likes the fact that the controls for the clitoral stimulator and shaft are entirely independent, to suit the mood that she's in at any given moment.And, as one would expect, Amazon shipped the package in a nice, discreet manner. Like many such products, there is a bit of a chemical smell when it comes out of the package, but that quickly subsides with a couple of washes.We purchased this product almost two years ago and it has functioned perfectly for the entire time we've had it.All in all, it's been a great buy and has improved an already-great love life. Highly recommended.
