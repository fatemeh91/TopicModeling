review/text: After going off the Birth Control pill, my cycles were irregular and I didn't think I was ovulating. As I'm 29, I felt my body clock ticking and decided to give this a go to regulate my cycles and to allow me to start ovulating. I started taking this product along with Fertilaid CM in mid September. By late October, I was pregnant! I'm now 17 weeks along with my baby due July 3. I'm not sure whether it was just luck or the Fertilaid, but I couldn't be happier! I'd definitely recommend this product!
