review/text: I've been using it just about every morning for the past several years. It's a fast, out-the-door morning starter and otherwise I might have nothing for breakfast. I use 2% milk and add an ice cube into the blender to make it frothy and light (adds to the taste somehow). If I happen to have a piece of fruit handy, I throw it in too. I find Chocolate Royale more flavorful than the Milk Chocolate flavor. With all the vitimins, I feel like I'm taking good care of myself.
