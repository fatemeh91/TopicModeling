review/text: If you have regular periods, do NOT buy this product. I am 34 and have been trying to conceive for 4 months. I have had regular periods and have been ovulating since I stopped taking birth control. I saw the advertisement with the hopes of conceiving quickly and I thought, every little bit helps. Since taking this product for 5 weeks, I have NOT ovulated. I have stopped taking it and hoping for the best next month.
