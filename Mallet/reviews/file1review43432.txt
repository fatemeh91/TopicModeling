review/text: Looks like the guy who is complaining about getting the wrong Flakes ordered from the wrong seller. I purchased this product from TheIndianFoodStore and it is the original Flakes from England. There is no Arabic writing, multi-region export pack, etc. This is the original bar, made in England, imported from England. I suggest that person try this seller.
