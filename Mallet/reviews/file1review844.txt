review/text: These little petals do just what they are meant to. They keep the foot from sliding forward in the shoe, which would have created pressure in areas of the foot that should not have pressure. Makes wearing even new shoew easy. I wear an 8.5 shoe and these are a perfect size to fit in the area behind toes, without showing when worn. It is also amazing how well they stick to the insole of the shoe. They are still in place on sandals I wore last summer and again this summer. They were put in when the shoes were new, so I'm sure that helped them stick longer.
