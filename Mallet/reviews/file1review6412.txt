review/text: This device is great. Handles are in the right place, the hooks provide plenty of reach for a person w/a large chest & shoulders. This device is effective by using a properly designed fulcrum system that produces enough leverage & therefore pressure on the 1&#34; ball tip to REALLY help me!Altho I originally purchased it hoping it would help me hit the trigger points in my glutes to help with hip pain, altho it reaches, I just can't get the torque (apply enough pressure) to be noticeable, least of all effective.Another problem area I have is in the low neck/high shoulder area. Sometimes pain & 'pressure' seem to build to the point where I can hardly move & yelling out in pain, I ask my gf for a brutal acupressure application [loosely applied term, all i mean is that she grinds the localized area with great amounts of pinpoint elbow pressure] which solves the problem.HOWEVER, with this device I can apply all the pressure needed to alleviate the pain MYSELF!WARNING!!! ALTHOUGH EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE [your results may vary (!)] you must know that you may have to really hurt yourself to help yourself. If you can tolerate the pain from the pressure you create [& if you don't yell out or growl, it's probably not enough pressure to do the job (altho i hope it is). In that case, reapply with even more pressure. Get that blood flowing to that area & you'll also produce endorphins which is your body's method of creating it's own 'painkillers'QUESTION: IF YOU HAD TO SPEND 60 SECONDS IN EXCRUCIATING, YELLING OUT LOUD PAIN in trade for HOURS or TOTAL relief of your pain... would you?NO, I AM NOT A MASOCHIST! However after many PT sessions over many years, I can tell you that if a therapist inflicts it or you do,MOST times the pain created by intense, isolated pressure to key muscle areas & trigger points will hurt like hell but be well worth it!QUESTION: IF YOU HAD TO SPEND 60 SECONDS IN EXCRUCIATING, YELLING OUT LOUD PAIN in trade for HOURS or TOTAL relief of your pain... would you? HELL YES!!!!BOTTOM LINE: YES, this tool really works. YES, I would buy it again & again and YES, I would strongly recommend it to my family & friends! But NO! It's not for those that cannot tolerate intense, short term pain.Michael
