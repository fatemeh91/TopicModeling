review/text: This product is awesome. It really does remove most food and drink stains! I just used it on my $50 abercrombie shorts... the stain is totally gone.This thing works by dispensing detergent out the tip of the pen, which loosens the stain. The stain gets absorbed by the tip of the pen.A word of caution though -- don't try it on grease. It'll spread the grease because grease isn't water soluble.
