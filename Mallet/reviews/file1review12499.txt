review/text: This is the best colon cleanse I have ever used. There is no discomfort and it does work. When you use it for the first time, you will need to stay close to a bathroom. I have used lots of other product and have never had the results I have had with Oxy-Powder. I now just take it once a week. You will need to find out what dose works best for you, I have to take 6, but my husband only has to take 4. It does cost more, but you get what you pay for. I highly recommend this product.
