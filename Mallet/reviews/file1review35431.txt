review/text: After having our 3 year old dishwasher serviced 4 different times over the last year and a half, the last technician suggested we try Dishwasher Magic. Our dishes and silverware had continually come out not fully cleaned and often had residue left on them. It was amazingly frustrating, especially after following all the suggestions from the technicians (including raising the temp on the hot water heater, getting a water softener, filling it with less detergent, filling it with more detergent etc.) and getting nowhere.We used this and immediately saw results. The results are truly amazing. I wish I had known about this last year before I paid for a one year extension on the warranty. I felt forced to do this b/c of the bad performance of the dishwasher, but looking back, I could have just used this stuff and passed on the extension.5 stars!!
