review/text: I decided on this prenatal after doing a moderate amount of research. Here are the key points that tipped the scales for me:1. I like that this one was a food-based vitamin rather than chemical-based like so many others on the market.2. I like that this one was a one-a-day approach (probably not the best distribution of nutrients for me and my growing baby, but when you're hardly able to keep your face out of the toilet, one pill is just about all you can stomach down.)3. I like that there are probiotics AND digestive support built right in to help ease morning sickness at the beginning and constipation at the end of pregnancy. Its almost like they've thought of EVERYTHING!I am currently 11mos postpartum, still exclusively breastfeeding, and this prenatal has served me well from my antenatal months on through my breastfeeding months. I will likely continue to take this prenatal even after I am done breastfeeding since we plan to try for another baby in a year or so. After I'm done baby-making and baby-feeding, I will switch to the appropriate Rainbow Light vitamin for the next stage of my life.
