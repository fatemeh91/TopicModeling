review/text: This protein tastes wonderful. It mixes easy and blends very well. I believe that this is the best protein available right now. I used to get protein at Costco, but this protein tastes better and performs better. I like the Double rich chocolate the best (personal preference). I would recommend this to anyone looking for the best protein out there for the money.
