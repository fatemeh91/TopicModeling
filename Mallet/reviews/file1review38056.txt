review/text: The title of this comment says it all. The longer a heart is without oxygen, the more heart muscle is lost. Chances of survival decrease 10% for every minute that passes without successfully restarting the heart. It's that simple.Quite contrary to Mr. Cirino's allegation that Philips is doing the community a disservice, Philips and other AED makers, along with lawmakers, are doing the public a great service by providing AED's for in-home use. (In fact, I'm not sure what disservice Mr. Cirino could be referring to? I'd like to see Mr. Cirino explain this gross "disservice" to a family member that has just successfully restarted their loved-one's heart... and of course, still called an Ambulance. Does Mr. Cirino really think civilians are not going to STILL dial 911? C'mon, man.)If you live with a high-risk loved one (history of heart disease, stroke, etc.), please consider buying an AED and learning how to properly use it, as well as how to properly perform CPR. Early defibrillation along with proper CPR can save lives. I've been privileged to witness this first hand, many times.I urge everyone to take a simple CPR/AED class. It's quick and simple, and you might just save a life one day.Holiday Wishes to All,[...]
