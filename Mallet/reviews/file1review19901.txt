review/text: I ordered for my 23-month-old who was potty-trained. It is comfortable for those longer sits and your toddler gets used to relaxing enough to do her/his business. The loop is nice - it hangs perfectly on the side of the toilet with a suction-cup hook. My daughter can put it on and take it off herself. The size is just right to fit into one of those drawstring backpacks which came in handy for those first few outings when my daughter was afraid to sit on the public toilets.I also like that it is non-porous - it is easy to disinfect. That is why I didn't even consider any of the soft seats. The ergonomic design makes up for the rigidity.
