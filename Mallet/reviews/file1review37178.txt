review/text: Started wearing a glove on my right hand at night due to thumb stiffness and pain in the morning. They helped to keep my hand warm and less stiff.I have very small hands and the extra small size fits well around the palm but not as snug around the fingers. Which leads to one small con: some mornings the webbing between my ring and middle finger is slightly irritated.Very good construction - neat seams and quality material. I've washed them once with no problems. Wish I could purchase a single glove since I have no use for the left glove at the moment.
