review/text: This ice wrap is quite like the one given to me at the time of my first knee surgery from Dec2003. I still have it. It's held up well (same brand) I just wanted a "back up" ice wrap. This new one is WONDERFUL! You don't have to worry about ice leaking or shifting (and freezing one spot) while this product is in use. This entire wrap has several 2"x2" (aprox.) little plastic pockets that are filled with water. Because of their small size, each ice pocket will have contact to the area in need of ice. This makes icing your knee down after a game of basketball or a few too many squats a lot easier. The stretchy band allows for equal and sufficient pressure of the wrap.
