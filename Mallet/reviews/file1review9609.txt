review/text: I signed up for the monthly delivery of these bars and was so disappointed with the product. I love Met Rx bars and this price was a great deal and the delivery was a great convenience. Unfortunately whoever provides these bars for Amazon.com does not store them appropriately and they appear to have been melted and cooled a number of times. They are hard as a rock, disfigured and the chocolate covering has turned white in many places. They are grainy tasting and lack they're original flavor. All three cases I received, three different flavors, where all in the same condition. The expiration date was far in advance so it is not an old issue, just a storage issue (I work in the grocery business :))I cancelled my subscription immediately. They may be cheaper but it's worth it to buy fresh ones at the drugstore.
