review/text: It is exactly what nearly all the reviews said. The product arrived discreetly in a white (non-see through) bag inside Amazon's box. When I opened it, I was very intimidated by the size. It task 3 double AA batteries (not AAA as someone said).The size DOES take some getting used too. Used it twice so far and it's huge, but I'll get used to it. The rabbit ears/nose got me off right away, in less than 2mins or so. ..whoa.....Powerful as people have said.....intense )
