review/text: We've been using this for 2 weeks and I have come to the conclusion that it just doesn't work. All dishes come out with some sort of film on them. Over half of the dishes need rewashed following the dishwasher cycle. In particular, this solution appears incapable of removing peanut butter from knives, anything sticky on a plate (syrup, refried beans, if it sticks, it stays). If the dish isn't already clean, this stuff won't make it that way. I think Earth Friendly should just pull this product. It doesn't work.
