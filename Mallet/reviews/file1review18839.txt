review/text: Heard about this MineralRich drink from a lady on YouTube so I thought I would give it a try. Did not know what to expect, but drink actually tasted very good with no aftertaste. Directions say to take 2 tablespoons per day. I have to tell you that I did not figure out why I began having more energy until I realized it had to be the MineralRich because I am not taking any other multivitamins or supplements at the moment that could give me energy. I believe it must be the B12 that is in this drink. Whatever it is, I have had no adverse effects or issues with this drink and will continue to drink it daily. Only 2 issues with this item: The cost and the plastic bottle that it comes in (I ordered two bottles). One of the issues that I was able to remedy was to purchase a tall glass bottle with sealing swing top which I store the MineralRich in. I will finish the two bottles that I have and then decide if the price is worth the item. Overall, I am glad that I purchased, so far.
