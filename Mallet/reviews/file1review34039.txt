review/text: Very pleased when this arrived. I instantly used it on my dark black bib overalls I intentionally wore for a couple days. I let the dog and cat jump in my lap so I could allow enough pet hair accumulate. Though I keep the pets brushed daily, there was still plenty left on my clothes to test this lint remover brush.The result was more than amazing. And was very easy to clean off the brush and discard the lint/ pet hair.If you read any reviews with a rating less than 5 then those users probably are the type to never be happy about anything. The brush is amazing.....I'm ordering more of these....an extra one to keep in the vehicle and the others for some people I know will really enjoy them.NOTICE: teachers,ministers,real estate agents,attorneys,judges,sales people,waitstaff help and anyone who must look sharp for the job...GET ONE of THESE....I absolutely promise you......this is a great inexpensive must have item.And works great on car and furniture upholstery too! I used it there as well and with the same perfect results.
