review/text: I've been using the Rembrandt Whitening Toothpaste for five days now, and I do notice a slight whitening of my teeth. After I brush, my teeth feel very clean and fresh. Because I have sensitive teeth, I liked this product a lot -- it was very gentle. I'd recommend this product to my friends and family.
