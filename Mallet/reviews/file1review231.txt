review/text: When my doctor gave me a choice between crutches or a walker, I chose walker. My uncle had one of these and offered me its use. I loved the ease of its smooth gliding wheels and especially the hand brake. I never felt like it was getting away from me. The compartment was handy for traveling around with a book, meds, etc. and doubled as a seat when I was tired and had to rest. I think this is the best walker on the market!
