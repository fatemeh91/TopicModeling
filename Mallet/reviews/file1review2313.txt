review/text: i love this product. i use it on my daughters bottom since she has extreme sensitive skin. i have used Triple Paste, A&D, Balmex, Desitin, ... u name it, and nothing worked until i got this. its a miracle cream. i use some on every diaper change and since i started using it she hasn't had a rash yet. not only does it work great its easy to clean off and u don't have no residue left over. its amazing.
