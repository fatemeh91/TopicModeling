review/text: After my husband passed away, I could get only 2 or 3 hours sleep at night because I would wake up in the middle of the night and could not get back to sleep. I didn't want to use drugs to help me sleep and heard about Melatonin and decided to give it a try. It WORKS. The chewable works best for me.
