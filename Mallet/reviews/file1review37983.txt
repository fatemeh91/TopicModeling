review/text: Contrary to the previous poster's review (who should know better as an EMT), AEDs require no "license." No such license exists so I am at a loss as to what he is referring to. And such a requirement shouldn't, either. The point is that a cardiac arrest victim needs to be defibrillated within about 6 or 7 minutes of onset to have a chance at surviving the ordeal. Paramedics often don't get to the scene fast enough to affect meaningful treatment. The EMT in his previous post is nothing short of irresponsible and I challenge everything in his post. (I am a former Paramedic and present day EMT.) I cannot fathom that he would rather see someone die of a heart attack in lieu of having some sort of "license." Can anyone here see my frustration?The opinion of a license requirement is further shown to be irrelevant when you understand that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lifted the prescription requirement for this model of AED for home use. It's a safe bet that other models will follow. Until then, if you can afford an AED, get one! Learn CPR (it's the best way to learn how to use your AED) and please disregeard the ill-informed rant of the previous reviewer. It could cost someone their life.
