review/text: Anyone who has ever had a Protein Smothie at Green Beans knows damn well that this product works. This is what they use at Green Beans. However, they use berry instead of the natural.I purchased the 10Lb tub from Bioplex at $118. To get this for $67.00 is a steal. Maybe I should have purchased 2. I have had no issues with clumps but then again I use it for my own protein smoothies.
