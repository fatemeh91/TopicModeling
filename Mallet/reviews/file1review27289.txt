review/text: Our family has used Optimum Gold Standard 100% Whey for years. Both my adult boys are athletes and use it every day. One of them is sensitive to milk products and this does not upset his system at all. My husband is a bodybuilder and feels that this is one of the best products of its kind on the market. We make smoothies, use it in coffee drinks, mix is on the go with water ... whatever the use, it tastes great. We like vanilla as it mixes best with all types of frozen and fresh fruit.
