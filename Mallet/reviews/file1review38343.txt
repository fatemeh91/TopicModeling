review/text: I used this product for the first time two days ago and I was really pleased w/ it! Too soon to know if ingrown hairs will be an issue, so that's why I only gave it a 4 and not a 5. On my first try, I did my legs AND my bikini line! I had an Epilady epilator back in the 80's and that was a true torture device. I tried it twice and never used it again. The Emjoi is NOTHING compared to that! If I was brave enough to try my bikini line on the first day AFTER doing my legs, that should tell you something, haha.I would stress 2 things:#1: DON'T use it on hair that is full length! I believe that makes a BIG difference it the amount of pain people experience. I shaved my legs and then let them get a bit "stubbly" THEN used the emjoi.#2 Hold the skin taut and just take your time - dont' try to rush.When I finished, my legs were smooth as if they had been waxed w/o the mess and w/o the hassle of going to a salon. Trim the bikini line first - DO NOT use it on full length hair -- I did a few full length hairs and I definitely felt a difference! If you can stand the pain of waxing or the pain of tweezing your eyebrows - then you can totally do this! It hurts a little yes, but nothing, NOTHING like that old epilator!!
