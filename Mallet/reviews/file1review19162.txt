review/text: I chose these vitamins because they are made from food products, not chemicals....I like the idea that they have concentrated vegetables in them, no added sugar and no artificial colors. My kids really enjoy eating them, and I think they do well with these vitamins. I've tried them myself and I personally think that they are better tasting than your average grocery store vitamin. The only flaw I have found is that they break easily so if the shipper doesn't ship them in decent packaging you get a lot of broken vitamins. But I bought my last bottle from Amazon directly and they did a great job with packaging and very few vitamins were broken. I know this is supposed to be a product review not a packaging review but I wanted to touch on that subject because the product IS easily breakable, so you want to pick a decent shipper.I used the Subscribe and Save option to save even more money on these.
