review/text: I have now purchased and tried 7 different potty chairs/seats. Four potty chairs and three seats. This one is the best and our favorite. It fits on all toilets I've tried, and it works just fine for my boy who just started potty training last week. The splash guard is high enough to capture his urine and not get allover his clothes. The seat does not move around when he climbs on the toilet. I love the clean white color, and it hangs nicely. My son has no problem taking it off and putting it back on a hook. The opening is wide enough that this will last a while. I can't say enough about this seat. OH most importantly, when my son gets off and on the seat, it doesn't hurt his boy parts at all.
