review/text: I remember taking Wheat Germ Oil as a kid and I had the thickest hair, strong nails, and smooth skin. Now that I've destroyed my hair with relaxers and toxic hair colors, I've opted to go back to natural (out of necessity and choice) and require some aid to assist me on this journey. Wheat germ oil is one of them. Good supply of Vitamins A, D, and E. Also, natural oils such as these helps to keep internal plumbing in check, as well. I don't recall this brand having any filler oils such as soy/soya bean or the like. You really can't go wrong when doing nutritional stuff for yourself. So buy, use and enjoy! And you'll bear witness to all the good things Whet Germ oil has to offer, such as healthy hair, nails, skin and eyes.
