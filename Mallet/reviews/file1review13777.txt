review/text: I originally bought the OWL for my husband, whose distance and middle sight are still very good, but he finally needs reading glasses, but carrying around a case to dinner and the like was a royal pain and half the time he forgot. The convenience and the light has made him the envy of many of our friends at table and we've even had people at adjoining tables ask to borrow the OWL.My brother-in-law is similarly challenged and was fishing for his reading glasses at Commander's Palace when my husband (his brother) whipped out the OWL - well, I knew the perfect "host" gift for their having had us down for Mardi Gras.When I asked my brother-in-law if he was seeing any better, he responded, "It's much worse now. I actually KNOW how much the bill is before I sign!!
