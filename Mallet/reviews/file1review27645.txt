review/text: I have tried many different protein powders and this one is by far the best! My goal is to gain muscle and lose fat and I have been into fitness for 7 years. I am looking for something low in carbs, sodium, and fat, with high quality ingredients that tastes decent. This product is the perfect combination. Tastes good and does not have added fillers or tons of artificial ingredients. The first ingredient is protein and that is important. I will be sticking with this product and highly recommend it.
