review/text: The Zippo pocket ashtray is pretty nice product as I always seem to have problems locating an ashtray for some reason, however there are a couple of points I believe had the pocket ashtray had, it would have it merit a 5 star review. They are:1- Zippo should have really thought of adding a small ring at the bottom of the ashtray so I could place it my keys on my keychain. It might make the contents of your keychain bulkier, but they should have added the option2- The interior half of the ashtray (the one used for the cigarettes ashes) is made out of plastic. It should have been from the same material of the exterior halfOther than that, it's a nice idea that is very handy in my point of view
