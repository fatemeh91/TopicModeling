review/text: Been taking this for abvout 2 months now and I seem to notice a difference. My 40 something eyes don't feel as dry and one day I noticed that I could read the news scroll on the bottom of the screen clearly! It also seems that I can read street signs better without having to strain.I take one every other day and have given up my bilberry/lutein supplement for this one; I think it is much better and a good addition to supplementation and to eye health.
