review/text: I have never set taste as a very high priority when determining what brand to go with. I could always just wolf it down. This is by far the tastiest protein shake I've ever had(i am big into bananas). Tastes great with low-fat milk or water. I will update with results in the coming weeks because i just began using this product along with my second time through p90x( first time through was last year)
