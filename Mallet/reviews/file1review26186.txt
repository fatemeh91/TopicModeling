review/text: This is by far the best sex toy that we have ever owned. We have a alot of different things that hurt my wife when going in even with lube, but not this one. It is just about the same size as me just not as thick as me but it is a little bit longer by about half an inch or so.All the ladies that say it is way to fat made my day. It is the perfect size it could be just a bit thicker. As far the smell yea it smells but not that bad.It does not require much lube and it goes right in.Great for going down on her while using the Mr. Softee.If this one wears out any time soon I will buy 2 more. Every lady out there needs this toy it is wonderful.It is very realistic,soft, and flexible.
