review/text: I first tried ON 100% gold standard whey when I first hit the gym. It was good. Then I tried other cheaper brand due to financial constraints, and realized that it isn't the way to go. Results were inferior, had lots of bloating with other brands. This is the best brand of whey protein for the price. Indeed, it's the gold standard when it comes to mixability, texture, taste.
