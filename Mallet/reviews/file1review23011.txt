review/text: I've read numerous reviews before deciding on the McDavid Neoprene Patella Knee Support With Spring Steel Stays. I am 57yrs old and carry more of my weight in the legs so I needed the xxl. They are snug but very comfortable. I have OsteoArthritis with partial bone on bone. My intention is to avoid/delay knee surgery. I have begun Physical therapy and find the water to be more beneficial and not so hard on the joints, in addition to taking OsteoBiFlex. This is working for me as long as I don't over do. I find that having a happy medium of exercise is best without over using the joint to cause more pain and discomfort. I have no intention of climbing mountains or running marathons, I just want to have more mobility, comfort and do simple day to day activities. These knee supports are great!
