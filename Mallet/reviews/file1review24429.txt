review/text: These inserts are terrific. They are a cost effective alternative to custom fit orthotics from the doctor and they work very well. As others have mentioned, they must be used correctly. NO cushioning in the shoes (take out the insert that comes w/ the shoe and add the walkfit-- if you have an shoe where the insert doesn't come out-- you CAN'T use this product with that shoe). Now this creates a problem in that you have to cut the top half (the part by you toe) of the old insert, put that in your shoe, and then have the walkfit right behind it. You don't want these pieces to overlap (this can cause discomfort) and you don't want a gap between them (also painful) so I have learned the art of cutting the insert that comes w/ the shoe just so. Some people mentioned sliding as an issue and mine once did that as well (i used duct tape) but they no longer do this (my foot has changed shape? I am better at cutting the toe part?). It is also important to note that YOU MUST CHOOSE THE CORRECT ARCH LEVEL INSERT-LOW, MED, OR HIGH. I started using the med level and this worked well. I always thought my arches looked pretty high so I changed to the high insert- VERY PAINFUL- no amount of time could get me used to this. Using them at the correct level, in the right way, however makes these insert invaluable. It instantly changed my posture, relieved back and knee pain, and just plain made walking/jogging easier (my muscles felt as though they were propelling me forward, and walking didn't feel like so much `work'). I would recommend anyone try these to see if it worked for them. When I try to walk w/ out the inserts I experience pain in my knees within 5 min and notice a profound difference. I wish that the product didn't wear down so quickly (I replace them in all my shoes once a month for best results) and that it would come w/ a seamless cushion for the front part of the foot so I can retire as a cobbler or whoever makes shoe inserts fit.
