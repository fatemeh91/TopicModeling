review/text: i was interested in meal replacements to fit in 6 meals a day (3 of these come from the shakes) and I tried Labrada's Lean Body choc. ice cream....ugh, maybe its for some people but not for me! then i tried Met-Rx's extreme chocolate, now THATS good stuff, literally tastes like cake batter, the best!
