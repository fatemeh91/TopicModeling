review/text: I'm now thirty. I started smoking when I was ten, and by fourteen I was smoking a pack a day. I'm also work in a couple highly stressful professions, meaning cigarettes were something I needed to keep me sane. I tried all sorts of nicotene-based substitutes, and they didn't work. I tried other methods to quit, and they didn't work either. After hearing about Smoke-Away on the radio, I thought "what the heck?"Being somewhat conservative, I admit I was kinda suspicious about a herbal based alternative to nicoteen, but my parents offered to pay for it and my doctor said it was safe. It worked. I quit smoking for a month, which is the longest I had ever gone without smoking. While it wasn't completely painless, and while it required some willpower, Smoke-Away made things a lot more comfortable and helped me deal with the withdrawal symptoms with more ease than I had ever felt using any other product or method.Unfortunately, I had a relapse about three weeks later, having forgotten the products at home while on a stressful business trip. By the time I got back, I was addicted again and didn't want to quit. About a month ago, I tried Smoke-Away again. It worked just as well as it did last time, and this time I make a point of double-checking whenever I go on a trip or some other stressful event that will last more than a couple hours.About a month has passed since I smoked my last cigarette, I feel much better, and I am convinced this is the best product on the market for quitting smoking. One of its key advantages, in my opinion, is the fact it doesn't use any nicoteen, so from the start your body is able to cleanse itself of the cigarette's most addictive agent.
