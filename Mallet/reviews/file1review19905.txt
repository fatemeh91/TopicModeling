review/text: We bought the cheaper soft cushion type toilet and it was just never comfortable for our daughter. This one was easy and comfortable and it stays on the toilet seat without moving! Within a few days, we were able to get her to potty on the seat. It took a little sticker bribery and she was quickly using it. Since it doesn't have many connecting parts, cleaning is much easier.Don't bother with the other seats, just buy this one. I'm going to buy another one for grandma's house.
