review/text: My oldest daughter is an extremely picky eater and won't eat fruit or juice at all so vitamins supplements are essential for her health. She also won't take the chewable tablets or the gummies but she will take this. If you have a picky eater, I highly recommend this product. My only complaint is that I wish the bottle were bigger as it only last us a month and then I have to reorder. Have started ordering several at once to save on shipping.
