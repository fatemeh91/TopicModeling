review/text: This mask looks like a cute little piece of lingerie!! Its soft and has a foam or other soft filling that keeps it from pressing against your eyeballs while you sleep. Used it on a trip in the car once and it worked great!! I need total blackout to sleep well and this did the trick!!! I plan to order more as Christmas gifts--now if they sold matching pjs...
