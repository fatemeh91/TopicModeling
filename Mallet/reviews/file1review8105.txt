review/text: This well built, well engineered squirting palm brush replaced a nasty, leaky sponge-type soap dispenser and a soap pump bottle that took about 50 pumps to get a dab of soap. The nylon bristles can be cleaned easily after each use, so it doesn't get disgusting. The dispenser valve doesn't leak, so you can fill it up with soap and set it on the sink rim or counter, then when you need some soap for washing dishes, a couple of squirts is all you need since the squirt volume is very adequate. My wife also loves it!
