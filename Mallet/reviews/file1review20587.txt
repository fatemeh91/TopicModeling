review/text: The cutting block is no longer a thick piece of metal. It is another foil against the outer foil. When I opened the package 10 months ago and noticed this, I was already concerned. I've had 10 months now to review it, and the change is not for the better. The cutter is already worn, and it gets "caught" sometimes, and sounds like it's about to give me razor burn. It's also hard for me to get a close shave compared to the original. I'm looking to change my daily shaver because of this bait and switch! This one will be relegated to travel duty. Shame on Braun. I'll be looking for a different company's shaver.
