review/text: Ok, I just bought this baby about a month ago, and here's my official opinion. A bit about me: never waxed before, lots of dark, coarse leg hair. My thoughts:1. If you haven't waxed, the first time you use this thing it hurts like the dickens. Quite painful.. took me probably 4 hours to do both legs, and I used the Bactine recommended plus drank. :) People thought I was crazy.2. But, it's been worth it. I LOVE not having to shave frequently, especially since within 12 hours I was stubbly when I shaved. It does hurt significantly less the second time, if for no other reason that you have less hair (it doesn't all grow back simultaneously). You really won't care about the pain, or feel it anymore, after a few times.3. Listen to the people who say to exfoliate!! Buy a loofah, do this frequently. I got quite a few ingrown hairs, because I only exfoliating every 3-4 days. Do it as often as you can.4. It does work, it'll remove the hair, no problem.5. To make it less painful, keep your skin taught. That made the pain much less than the bactine. Especially important if you're doing the upper legs.6. I actually found the bikini area less painful than my legs... but I only did up to, say, the underwear line and no further. Pull skin very taught. Also make sure to trim this area first so the hair isn't too long.7. After your first time, remove the pain head, especially if you're trying to get some ingrown hairs out. A little closer, it'll grab a few more.Have fun with this... it's fabulous. Love it.
