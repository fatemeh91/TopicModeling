review/text: My wife recently purchased 2 types of wrist support devices. One for rigerous activity (like yoga) and one for other things like knitting - which she does a lot!! The Wellgate for aggressive / weight bearing activity and the Futuro for knitting. The Futuro works great for her knitting and other fine work requiring extensive use of the fingers. It is supportive, provides warmth and relief, yet permits the full range of motion and use of fingers required in knitting. She would whole heartedly recommend to anyone for this kind of application. Note she does not recommend if you are looking for extensive wrist support.
