review/text: This stuff works exactly as advertised! We have a house with a second story bathroom, and our ceilings are popcorn textured which makes repairs a real pain. Our kids spilled quite a bit of water out of the tub one day, and it leaked onto the textured ceiling in our kitchen. The result? A big nasty yellow-brown stain all along the joint in the sheetrock in our kitchen ceiling. A little bit of this stuff (it works as a very fine mist) and it was *GONE* by the next morning, and looks good as new. Just saved myself the aggravation of painting and who knows what else.This is clearly a bleach-based product as is evident from the smell. Don't wear your Sunday best when using, and definitely be careful of dyed fabrics, etc, in the vicinity of the work area. But all you need to do is follow the directions, and water stains will be history. Great product!!!
