review/text: I didn't but this tell my last 6 weeks of pregnancy but I wish I would have gotten it sooner. I had to do something for work (I was working as a occupational therapist assistant) and I was on my feet on and off all day. My baby was 9lbs 10oz at birth so I have big babies. This belt was the only way I was able to work the last 6 weeks. I had to work up until 2 days before I had my son. My back did still hurt during the last few weeks but it was so much better with the belt. Also I always wore a tank top so it wasn't itchy at all to me.
