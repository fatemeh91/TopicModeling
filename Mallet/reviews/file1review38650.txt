review/text: The old standard, been using it for years. My wife like the fragrance better then more expensive after shaves.Too bad it's in a plastic bottle now. But what I did, I have an old Aqua Velva glass bottle and as it empties out, I fill it from the plastic bottle. So I have the glass bottle on my counter in the bathroom
