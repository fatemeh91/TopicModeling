review/text: I'm a professional photographer and have relied on these batteries to power my flash units for years. To give you and idea of how good they are, on a typical photography event, they hold a strong charge for up to 3-4 hours of CONTINUOUS flashing, and I'm talking on a Nikon SB900 flash, which is one of the biggest Nikon on-camera flash units available. These are excellent batteries. Great quality and life span. I don't get the negative feedback from people that say they die quickly. What in the world are they doing? Don't expect them to have a charge for a long time, like days or even weeks at a time depending on the type of use. The point of them being rechargeable is the ability to recharge them for reuse and optimal performance without having to waste so much money buying regular ones. In my experience, after all that heavy duty operation, they start dying out one by one at the time of about two years. Failure to recharge, it's an indication that they need to be replaced. In conclusion, I definitely recommend these batteries.
