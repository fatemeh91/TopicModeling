review/text: I've read reviews that said you should not take this product if you are regular. I should have listened! I didnt even make it through a full bottle of this, before I had to stop using it! And that is after avid research on the product. I don't believe that it doesn't work for some, but it is definitey not for me! I started spotting really bad after week 2. I was regular, every 29 days I came on, but this made me irregular. Im going to see if my body regulates itself and I might try clomid at the end of the year.
