review/text: I saw all the reviews and in search of something with less blades and a better price tag, bought this one. The cost compared to a lot of newer razor handles and "high performance disposables" these days is a big plus. With an 8-pack costing less than a dollar per cartridge at some sites, you can't go wrong.When it came down to the SHAVE, my reaction was not as favorable as was with the value. I'm very careful because I have sensitive skin with coarse hair prone to in-growns. I did my usual prepping and shaving. Unfortunately, I noticed that my legs were irritated after the shave. The shave gel left my legs soft as usual but the blade left them covered in small red irritated bumps (I didn't shave very hard so this was a surprise), and not a clean shave on either. I was pretty disappointed and will probably just let my sister have it so she quits using my regular shaver. Results may vary from person to person though. This is just my experience.
