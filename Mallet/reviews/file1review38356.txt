review/text: This is a great hair remover. I am not going to lie it is not painless, but it gets less painful the more you use it. I use it weekly so there is less hair and it is finer. Also, use a exfoliating sponge daily to prevent ingrown hairs. I had an earlier model and it seemed to be a little easier to grip, but this one works fine.
