review/text: I bought this scale for home use because I wanted something accurate and was tired of cheap bathroom scales. First, it was a little tricky to put together, because you have to attach the internal linkages, but nothing too bad. Second the scale is delicate, like all precision scales are. If you move it, you have to set the tare again. It has to be on a perfectly flat surface as well to work right. The scale is well built, same exact scales you will find in the doctor's office most places. Also, I'm a mixed martial arts promoter, so I took this scale to my events for the fighters to weigh themselves on, while they are trying to make weight. We compared this scale against the athletic commission's certified and very expensive electronic scales and all across the range this scale was dead on accurate. I expect these scales will last me the rest of my life.
