review/text: Glide Dental Tape provided a large surface area that allows the user to clean more effectively in-between teeth and gums. The width of the tape was the biggest advantage over regular dental floss. The elasticity of the tape made it easy to maneuver through teeth and it didn't shred like some other dental floss does. There was no waxy build up from the tape, and the dispenser was easy to use. I'd definitely recommend this to friends and family.
