review/text: I found this product through the company website. I have a son with Asperger's and chronic GI problems. There was a recomendation on the DAN website for a certain amount of EFAs. I found that most store products weren't coming anywhere close to the percentages per dose that the doctors were recommending. I went online and found this. Per teaspoon dose, you can't get a bigger percentage which means only one teaspoon instead of half a bottle. My son has been on it for nearly a year and is doing much better. This has definately been part of the healing process for him although for Autism Spectrum Disorders, there are no one cure wonders. It is made from flax seed oil, so if your child is allergic to flax, you might want to try fish oils instead.
