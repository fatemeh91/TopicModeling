review/text: First of all, since a lot of people are wondering...here is the sizes (listed from the manual) that each setting will trim:1 : 1.5mm, 0.06" (Stubble look)2 : 2.5mm, 0.1"3 : 4mm, 0.16" (Short)4 : 5.5mm, 0.22"5 : 7mm, 0.28" (Medium)6 : 9mm, 0.35"7 : 11mm, 0.43"8 : 14mm, 0.55" (Long)9 : 18mm, 0.71"I'll admit, this is the first trimmer I've ever bought...but I think I made a great choice. I've had it around a month now, and trim on average twice a week. Everything about it is simple, easy to pick-up and use.- Cleaning is simple. It comes with a comb and brush to clean the trimmer.- I've read some reviews that say the plastic pieces are flimsy/break easily/etc. So far, I've had no problem. The guide is easy to remove (honestly though, just in case I'm totally baby-ing this thing so it won't break).- Some reviews say that even without the guide, it doesn't trim close enough for them. In my opinion, if that's not short enough for you...then you just need to shave! I use setting 1 to get a stubble look on my cheeks, a 3 for my mustache, and a 5 for my goatee. And I remove the guide to define the edges. Simple, and takes away a lot of the time used for shaving and cleanup.Overall, great product. Hoping it will last awhile -knocks on wood-, if not I guess I'll have to search for a more sturdy one or buy this one again lol.
