review/text: Actually tastes like chocolate. Even when using water to mix with. I use two scoops in my coffee in the morning and it's awesome, almost mocha like. Super easy to mix, doesnt need a blender. I put it in a nalgene with water and just shake it and it mixes fine with no clumps. Gives me heartburn though, but then again everything else does too so I cant really blame the powder.
