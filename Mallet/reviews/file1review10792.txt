review/text: I have to say, I love this product, and have actually used it for years. When I couldn't find it being consistently carried in ANY of my local stores (supermarkets and drug stores), I decided to order it in bulk from Amazon. I use these daily mostly to keep my mouth moist at night, but I have found them effective in controlling the coughs I get from time to time as well. I needed something that was (a) sugar free, to protect my teeth (b) individually wrapped so it was easy to put in my pocket or purse (c) good tasting and (d) did the job. The Ricola products do it all. By alternating the Mountain Herb with the Cherry versions, I don't get tired of using it. I have gone to other products from time to time, and always came back to these because of the taste (and no aftertaste). I will say, however, that for some reason the other sugarfree flavors Ricola produces don't seem to work as well or taste as good.
