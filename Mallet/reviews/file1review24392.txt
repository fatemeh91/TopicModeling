review/text: I had insomnia for months and tried many things from over the counter to prescription sleep aids and Xanax. I saw a doctor on tv mention this so I thought I had nothing to lose. I take it every night but also added 100mg 5-HTP, it finally did the trick!! I still quite often wake up once per night but the big thing is that my mind is able to relax and I can get back to sleep. It is worth a try without any concerns.
