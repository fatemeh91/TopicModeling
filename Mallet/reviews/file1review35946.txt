review/text: After stopping using total toothpaste for a short time, my teeth became off white almost yellow. After about two weeks of using this brush my teeth were cleaner and whiter. My teeth are even cleaner in the morning when I wake up. I`m using crest 3D until my teeth are really white and then I`m going back to total.
