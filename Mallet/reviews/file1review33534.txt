review/text: We have had waterpik years ago; it does wonders for your gum bleeding problems and removal of debris not only between your teeth but above your bridged teeth. I'm not a religious flosser but a devout "waterflosser"!!This newly designed version has a bigger housing than the original ones and the design of the handle is different. After using this newer pik for a while I must point out that you must be careful when turning the tip so as not to press down and eject it!!! The way this newer base is designed where the handle is stored causes the excess water to run out on your sink area, your must be aware of any other electrical devices you might have in the same area.I love the waterflosser results but this design could be improved in my opinion.
