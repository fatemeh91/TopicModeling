review/text: This stuff is amazing. I suffer from chronic wide spread pain, and this stuff is great. It's a gel so it dries quickly and without any oily residue. I use it on my hands, my neck and shoulders... AMAZING!! The only draw back is it has a relatively short affect. It lasts a hour or so, but I really love the stuff!!
