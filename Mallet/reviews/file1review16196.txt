review/text: After eleven knee surgeries I did it again! This time I tore my meniscus and got this brace for support until surgery. Great support and breaths very well. Sitting in the sun all Memorial Day weekend at my kid's soccer tournament with no sweat under the brace whatsoever. The only issue I have is that it does tend to slip down a little and needs to be pulled up every now and then. I wouldn't recommend it if you have major instability but for my purposes it is lightweight, comfortable, supportive and well priced. Definitely the best brace of all those I've ever used over the years. An excellent value.
