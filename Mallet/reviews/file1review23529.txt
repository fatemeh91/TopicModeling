review/text: I'm somewhat angry at the negative reviews here of people who cannot follow simple directions. I almost didn't buy this powder because of reviewers who wrote that the powder did not dissolve in water and instead ended up a chunky mess. These people obviously did not follow the instructions. You put your fiber into a glass, pour water over it while stirring with a fork (I actually use a bar stirrer which works just fine), then let it sit for a minute or two, and then stir again. The first stir does leave chunks, but if you leave it be for a couple of minutes it all dissolves. There are no chunks and it has the taste and consistency of slightly foamy water.Also, if you only take it once in awhile it will do nothing for you. You have to be consistent with it. It's not working wonders for me yet (I just bought it a couple of weeks ago) but it is helping. It's not the only tool in your IBS arsenal. It's just part of the solution.I definitely recommend this. It's really not expensive when you consider how much powder is in one canister and if you drink it consistently you will notice a difference.
