review/text: A great product, but you need to put it on the proper shoe. If you use it on shoes with a closed toed, your toes can no longer fit comfortably inside as this product is considerably thick. It works best with shoes that have lots of toe wiggle room, such as heeled sandals. I put it on my sandals that have a very well-worn toe bed, and it's extended the lifetime of my well used shoes. Make sure to clean your shoe and let it dry before apply the product (such as with a bacteria killing surface cleansing wipe), and it should help it stick better. I haven't had any problems with it peeling off.
