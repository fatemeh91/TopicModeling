review/text: I've used these blades for years, graduating from the less expensive type. I originally started shaving with the dual-side, double blade that sold for 5-cents and lasted for years. Amazon offers the Fusion in several different packages. The way I figured the 8-count offered the most savings; I ordered four which should last until next Fall.They work when the beard is soften, the shave cream is spread thin so as to avoid clogging the blades, and avoid irritating the sensitive skin (usually the neck) by repeaded overage. I remember an old SNL satire on the &#34;5-blade Gillette&#34; which was funny and intuitive.Check the quantitiy when order for the best value.
