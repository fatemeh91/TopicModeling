review/text: We love it! It is adjustable so it fits perfectly on our toilet seat. It never slips around & is super easy to clean. I also bought the Baby Bjorn floor potty & loved that too. I think if we had gotten this first, we could've bypassed the whole floor potty issue (meaning less messy clean-ups for mom & dad). They make the greatest products.
