review/text: This has been a great razor so far. I had been with a short beard most of the time in the last few years. I had been using the cheaper Schick and Gillette 3-4 blade razors if I wanted a clean shave in those years. I mow my beard down with my Wahl hair clippers and shave. The cheaper razors always get clogged and are dull after that first shave. So far with this, I am still on the first razor that comes with the handle. I started clean shaving once a week and touching up the edges with an electric in between. After I mow down my beard and clean shave this razor has not clogged. I had used it 3 more times since and it still seemed to be sharp as new on the last shave, but I think i'll go ahead and switch to a new razor next time since its been a month . I should have bought a quality razor like this instead of saving a few cents all a long. The difference is huge.
