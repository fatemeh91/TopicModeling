review/text: During a particularly horrible flare up, I went looking for anything to help and purchased these along with fargelin pills. The over the counter stuff and witch hazel were giving me no relief and I already eat a diet of mostly plants and whole grains along with lots of water. These just arrived today (12 days after ordering) It indeed does have a nice cooling feel. After one application I googled the ingredients.#1 synthetic musk:can accumulate in human bodies, are potential hormone disruptors and may break down the body's defenses against other toxic chemical exposures #2 Synthetic bezoar: A bezoar is a ball of swallowed foreign material (usually hair or fiber) that collects in the stomach and fails to pass through the intestines, apparently this is a man-made version of that? #3 Pearl--the thing from oysters or an herb? #4 borneol:an eye, skin, and respiratory irritant.I stopped looking after that. I will definitely not be using these anymore. The thing is I was so desperate I tried every home remedy I could and by the time these arrived, my bum feels the best it has in months. I was able to get back on my bike the last two days! This is what worked for me--fargelin pills and cayenne tea (1 tsp to about a cup of hot water). I also mixed witch hazel with apple cider vinegar and mixed in a couple cloves of minced garlic to use topically. It gave more relief than just plain witch hazel, but it sure does stink!! My rhoids are not totally gone and I'm not sure if it is the cayenne or the fargelin that has really helped, but I will be out of fargelin today, and will continue to drink a cup of tea daily. I hope this helps someone, I know i was desperate when I bought these.
