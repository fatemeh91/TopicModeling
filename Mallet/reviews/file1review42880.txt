review/text: First of all, the light is about what I expected as far as design quality. The flexible arm would be fine while connected to a relatively stationary laptop, but I bought it to connect to a vehicle mounted computer, which bounces around a bit. Within the first few weeks, I started to notice that the arm was not holding its position as well as when it was brand new. Also, one of the LEDs went out after just a few hours, but the remaining two are more than enough to satisfactorily illuminate my keyboard. The light is bright enough to see the keyboard, but not too bright to be annoying. The most perplexing thing about the purchase was that this light is packaged in a box that is about 4" x 2" x 1/2", but it is shipped in a box so big that it could easily hold 50 of these lights.
