review/text: I had this prenatal early this year for my first pregnancy. I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks... I don't know if its directly related to this vitamin, but every body type is different. I did some research on the vitamins... That's a lot of b12 and vitamin a. Seems like some of the other ingredients are excess as well. Be careful before purcHasing this product. Make sure you get a prenatal vitamins according to your lifestyle and diet. Other than this, it did have a positive affect on my hair... It actually stopped falling.
