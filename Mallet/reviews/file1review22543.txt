review/text: I had trouble using this themometer because my child's pacifier was a different shape than this one-- so he didn't really want to suck on it long enough to get a good reading. The couple of times he was able to suck on it long enough, the reading seemed fairly accurate.Overall it is a fantastic idea-- and fairly inexpensive. So it is probably worth trying on your child.
