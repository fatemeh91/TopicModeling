review/text: Here are the facts regarding this product. I have owned 2 of them in the past 11 years and have just ordered the third. They are more effective, less irritating and closer than any other brand of razor I have used in the past. At under $50 they are an astonishing bargain despite the plasticky appearence many others here have commented on. This price is compared to- for example, the $220 price tag I saw on a Norelco shaver earlier in the week. Even if they were sloghtly less durable (and my expereince says they aren't) I could buy five of them before I reached the price of the Norelco.Finally, I like the fact that these are still made in the USA. Given the absurd number of formerly American products now being banged out by slave labor in China, I am heartened that Wahl has not bowed to the pressure and is still paying American workers to make these. Frankly, the only way that is likely to continue is if the company sells shavers. So, I am buying one.
