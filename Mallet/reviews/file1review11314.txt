review/text: Hello im a 31 year old man and i have severe bladder pain and frequent urination due to having interstitial cystitis and i have been suffering from this condition for 9 months now and i've been told by my urologist that there's no cure or effective treatment for IC but i've also read online that others have been cured from IC and completely symptom free by taking anti-fungal or anti-yeast supplements. So i decided to give this one a try but i was a bit hesitent, because of what i read about the tea tree oil not being safe for consumption but for topical use only. Well i bought it anyways and i tried it for one day cuz i was desperate to find anything that would help me and the good news is that it worked and i immediately felt relief in my bladder just 2 hours after taking the 6 pills as directed by the bottle but the bad news is when my body started processing the ingredients i started feeling a sharp pain in the right side of my body in the kidney area, not a nice feeling and the pain persisted for 9 hours along with mild diarrhea. I'm definately not gonna use this product again and i don't recommend it to anyone. I'm gonna try other supplements that don't have the tea tree oil in it so that i don't wreck my liver or kidneys.
