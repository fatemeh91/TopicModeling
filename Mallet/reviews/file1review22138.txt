review/text: When baby's not feeling well, it can be hard to get them to hold still to take their temperature. This great kit really improves on the traditional pacifier. By using this set, the baby can get the soothing comfort of a pacifier from the same device that is taking their temperature or dispensing their medication. This kit can definately take away some of the little difficultie involved in caring for baby when baby doesn't feel so well.
