review/text: I have to disagree with the other reviewers - I actually love this product. I haven't had any problems with durability, even with two teenage girls that help with dishwashing. I've had mine for 2 years, and just bought another one for an elderly relative who has difficulty with her hands. I would love to see the replacement sponges in grocery stores, etc - having to track them down is really my only complaint about this product.
