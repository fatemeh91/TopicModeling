review/text: After discussing nose hair trimmers over a family dinner tonight (strange isn't it?), I wanted to share my thoughts on this trimmer.15 years ago I received this little trimmer as a gift. I still use this same trimmer on a weekly basis and it still does a great job. I have purchased other trimmers in that time to see if anything newer on the market does a better job. The newer ones I have tried have not been impressive.If they are still made the same as they were 15 years ago, buy with confidence.
