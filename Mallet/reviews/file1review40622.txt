review/text: We're not grease-loving people, so maybe we're not the best testers, but we've gone through several bottles of this and are dishes and glasses are clean with no residue. I don't know why so many others are having a problem. I would give it five stars, but I've noticed a difference in consistency between bottles--it should be a gel, but we had a bottle that was more fluid. Also, the fragrance has not been consistent between bottles. Cleans like a champ, though. We do rinse our dishes before loading but just a quick rinse--no scrubbing.
