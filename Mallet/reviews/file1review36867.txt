review/text: I love this sock aid. I've had a hip replacement and am not permitted to bend very far at the waist. This gives me longer arms. The first aid I had after my surgery was all plastic and a fixed shape and the sock often slipped off before it was on completely. The terrycloth back and slick inside of this sock aid make it wonderfully effective - my foot slides in, the terrycloth holds the sock, and the three blades flex to fit a sock of any size.
