review/text: The fusion system is the best! I've used all other methods, and they don't compare. I'm amazed at how long the razor blades last. The replacement blades are pricey, but worth it. The vibrating aspect of the razor seems to be helpful, also, but I think it's really the quality of the blades that does the job.
