review/text: This is hard stuff to find. I use it for my dogs when they cut a pad or hurt a leg. Not able to find it locally unless at the vet. Of course, you need gauze and vet wrap first, but this product keeps everything stable and safe while the part heals. Top grade. Fast shipment. Great price.
