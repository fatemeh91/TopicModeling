review/text: Coming from bargain tweezers at walmart and target these tweezers are really a step up. Their holding power is great and they don't flex or slip once they have a hold like lesser brands have in the past. Also, regarding the size I have seen some reviews that state they are too small. I disagree and it is worth noting that the tweezers also come with a protective tube case for storage which is a welcomed extra. I would highly recommend this product and stop wasting money on lesser items.
