review/text: Haven't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet. However, wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it. This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a "snap on" deflector (for boys). Purchased 2 of these, one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs, as they are in the process of potty training our grandson. It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats, and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it. I also purchased the stool and potty book...and am ready whenever my kiddies are. Highly recommend this seat as it very well made.
