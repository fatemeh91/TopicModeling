review/text: I'm not exactly sure why this brush is so different from so many others but it is. It simply works. The trick seems to be to brush relatively lightly and let the bristles do the work. It might be my imagination but I think the bristles are just a bit pointed, or perhaps cut at an angle at the tip so they are "sharper" than most brushes. Whatever the engineering is, it works, and after six months of twice daily use the brush simply looks, and works like new. I may buy a few more and just be all set for the next few years, after all, they keep. &lt;G>
