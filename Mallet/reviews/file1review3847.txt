review/text: Being a smoker and coffee drinker, I was skeptical that this product would do much for my teeth in just seven days but it worked amazingly. The other thing is I am sensitive to just about everything in the world, hair dyes, etc., and this product did not bother my teeth or gums at all. I will say, however, that I did not use them twice per day like the instructions say. I only bleached once a day and sometimes skipped days. The results, however, were still great. I'd like to go a bit whiter than I am now but I'm sure that's because I started off with yellowing due to smoking and coffee drinking. All in all, I loved this product. The biggest thing to remember is that some people (me being one of them) drool a lot with the strips in their mouth, so I would never leave the house with them in my mouth. I just surfed the net, watched tv, read a book, did the dishes or whatever and kept my drool rag handy. It wasn't the most fun I've had in my life but since I was determined to have whiter teeth, it was worth it.
