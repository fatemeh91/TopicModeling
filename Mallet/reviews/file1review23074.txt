review/text: Perfect for crumbs and dog hair (labrador). This sweeper does work on hardwood floors, but not as well as carpet; the pickup bristles sometimes chase the crumbs by flicking them on hardwood. It is true what people say about the handle coming apart, but it only seems to be a problem if you pick the sweeper up and carry it by the handle. The handle is a friction fit socket and cup (three joints), it would be better if it had a lock on the individual sections. The crumb tray is easy to empty, and the sweeper is quiet. All in all, a great buy for the money, you won't be disappointed.
