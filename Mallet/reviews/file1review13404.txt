review/text: My daughter has accidents on and off all the time. We have bought so many of these things. Other ones are so small, but this one is big. I love that. Her whole 4 year old body is just now starting to not fit on it. Others move around and bunch up, but since her whole body fits on this one, it isn't uncomfortable. Other ones are cooler, but they are smaller, bunchy, move around and they leak. That's the only thing about these, they are hot. My daughter does not sleep with covers. But, it keeps the sweat off the mattress!
