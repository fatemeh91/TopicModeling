review/text: Last year my electric toothbrush broke and I went searching for a new one. I ended up with the Oral B Sonic Complete - it had 2 brush handles and a charger which was perfect since I still had the old charger. It came with a travel case that fit the handle and a brush head conveniently for travel. When it came time to buy new brush heads, I couldn't find them anywhere in a store, so finally decided to let my fingers do the walking and found them on Amazon at half the price of a store. This particular brush and head are the best of all of the ones I have tried before - I love them and my dentist even commented that he noticed a positive improvement in staining around the spaces and gums. I will probably never buy these in a store again.
