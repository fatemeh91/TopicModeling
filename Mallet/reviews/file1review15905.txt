review/text: I am 30 weeks pregnant and still doing kung fu, so I needed something to wear while exercising to prevent back pain, and to keep my tummy from jiggling around too much. I chose this product because of the claim to have great lumbar support. It certainly does! The only problem is that the edges can really irritate your skin on the sides and back......so I suggest wearing it over a pair of high rising "granny panties" to prevent chafing. Also....you will want to get and use this product BEFORE you have back trouble.....Although it will help relieve some back pain you already have...it's much better to prevent it than to cure it! For that reason, I also wear is when doing housework and yard work.
