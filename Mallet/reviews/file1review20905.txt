review/text: Speaking as someone who has been shaving for 20+ years, primarily with blade over electric (Gillette Mach 3 for last few years), I can honestly say the Braun 8585 is the best shave I've ever had. As we all know traditional razor blade replacement prices have been going through the roof for years, and for guys like me with tough beards the blade itself only gives you about a week or two worth of good shaves. Due to my skin type, I was only able to shave every other day in order to avoid serious skin irritation. Now, with the Braun 8585, I shave every day, no irritation, and as close as I ever got with traditional razors. I've only been using it for about three weeks (what they say is your average adjustment period), but I feel the shaves have been great since day one. It's definitely one of the best looking electric razors I've seen, and it's self cleaning feature is a great extra. Cleans and recharges at the same time, in the same base. Overall, I'd say it's well worth the money and I'll never go back to blades.
