review/text: I couldn't wait to get my order. My arm had been aching for weeks and nothing helped. My brother, who is an M.D., swears it is a miracle drug and has a standing order. I could go on and on with stories of friends and family who swear by it, but the bottom line - Penetran Plus didn't help my arm at all. I may try it another time for a different type of pain and see what happens.
