review/text: I just received the battery (BA 151) that Amazon suggested I buy for use with my Sennheiser 140 headphones. The problem? They don't even fit or work with the headphones! I don't see how people buy these to go along with a product that doesn't use them. This is the first time I have gotten bogus information from Amazon and at $7.14 they are not worth the bother for paying to have them returned! Guess I'll just chalk it up to experience but I'm not sure how one avoids having tis happen in the future. I have always taken Amazon at their word!!! Strike one......
