review/text: There are many vital nutrients in beets. So what do you do if you hate the taste of beets? My solution is to order beet root powder. I take 2-3 capsules daily. The red coloration in beets is a great source of cancer fighting phytonutrients. I tried taking this product for a potential lowering of high blood pressure, but I did not see any results in that area.kone
