review/text: As the subject said. I was hoping to get the product pictured as it is superior in every way to the inferior replacement 51S. The description also says "Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock" which is also incorrect. Everything about this listing is wrong, and you should not buy this.For what it's worth, you can probably get it cheaper from someone else if you want the 51S, by the way.I always ignore reviews when people shout "DO NOT BUY", but I'm now writing one. BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT BUY. I can't believe Amazon lets this go on.
