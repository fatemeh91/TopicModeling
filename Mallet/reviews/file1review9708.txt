review/text: I ordered this product after many failed attempts to quit smoking. The motivational tape in this package is the best I've ever heard. I listened to it twice and used the supplements enclosed, and I have been a non-smoker for 7 weeks now. Unfortunately the CD was broken on the second side, but the speaker mentions you don't really need it, and I have to agree. Every thing I needed was on the first side. Otherwise, I would have returned it. If you are truly committed to quitting, I definitely recommend this product as it makes it much easier to do so. I still listen to the CD occasionally as a refresher, and I am quite comfortable without the cigarettes.
