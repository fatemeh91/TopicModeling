review/text: I like this cushion very much. I would get the firmer one another time because I am a larger woman and this cushion is a bit soft for me. I decided not to get the firmer one because I was afraid it would be too firm. But I am very happy to have a comfortable and comforting wedge pillow for riding in and driving the car. I would definitely recommend this pillow as a good purchase tho' slightly expensive. I also like the removable cover which you can wash. If you are regular size and need a good tush cush, then get this! Otherwise get the firmer one!
