review/text: Billed as 'The Closest Thing To Nothing At All', I must say these are some thin condoms. Okamoto delivers! I was tired of all the thick condoms and was ready to reject condoms altogether...even started using the 'pull and pray' technique, then I discovered Okamoto Crowns. Okamoto made me appreciate condoms once again. These are great for achieving that 'extra sensation'.
