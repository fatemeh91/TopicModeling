review/text: Going through menopause and feeling tired all the time, along with brain fog. I started taking this product and can't believe the difference in how I feel. I've never noticed such a positive effect from taking vitamins. My mind feels clearer and I'm not dragging all day long.1) It tastes great - I also can't believe someone thought it tasted bad.2) I take it in the morning without food before work and have no stomach upset.3) I immediately felt so much more energetic - don't know if that's the ginseng, however, it doesn't make me nervous like a stimulant. I just feel like I want to exercise. Take it in the morning and by bed time, I'm ready to sleep. I wouldn't recommend taking it in the evening.Like so many of us, I usually fall off the wagon when taking vitamins, but I'm definitely not going to stop taking this product!
