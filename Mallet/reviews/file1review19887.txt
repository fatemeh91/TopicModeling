review/text: Nothing to add to all of the positive feedback. This is, by far, the most excellent toilet seat for potty training. My son, now 3.5 years old, completely skipped over portable potty chairs, and much prefered going straight to the "big potty," using this training seat. He can put it on and take it off himself, and seems to take great pride in doing so. I have purchased three, two for home, and one permanantly dedicated as our travel potty seat. Love it, love it, love it!
