review/text: This is a wonderful product. This inflatable tub makes it easy to bathe that baby who has gotten too big for the plastic tubs yet is too small for the adult tub. It is better than any bathing seat ring too. With the seat ring you cannot really wash a babies bottom. This tub is great for bathing your baby and it is easy to use and store. I highly recommend it. My daughter used it till she was 2 years old and I plan to use it with our second daughter very soon.
