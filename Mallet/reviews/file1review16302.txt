review/text: Yes, this is a Vine review, but it was a no-brainer for me to pick this product to receive in exchange for a review, since I've been using it for years already. I like this product. I particularly like this orange-scent version, as it just smells better and "cleaner" to me than the regular scent. It gets my dishes nice and clean, even with hard city water, though like all the detergents that had the phosphates taken out a couple of years ago, it doesn't work as well as it used to. I've been supplementing my loads that contain aluminum cookware (which turns dusty black with the new non-phosphate detergents) using Finish's Glass Magic to replace the phosphates, and with the additive it's nearly as good as it used to be. Unfortunately, the Glass Magic has been discontinued, and I only have 1.5 boxes left, so I'm hoarding.Anyway, I still find that this detergent alone is better than other things I've tried. I compared this recently toFinish Quantum Dishwasher Detergent with Baking Soda, 25-Count, but I still find myself reaching for the Powerball Tablets first, unless it's going to be an easy load for the dishwasher, because the Powerball Tablets seem to clean just a little bit better and more reliably, plus I don't have to worry about any stray water in the detergent cup with this product. The little foil packets are easy to open and use to drop in the tablet without touching it. I occasionally have to chase a loose powerball and put it back in the cup, but not often.
