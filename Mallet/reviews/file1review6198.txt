review/text: I have tile floors and two pets and this mop keeps my floors in great condition! When you have 2 young children and a dog who tracks in dirt all day long, the floors get pretty dirty. The scrubbing head is great for getting the toughest dirt spots out and the sponge head keeps streaking to a minimum. Even works well on my bathroom floors where I have the super small times and lots of cracks for stuff to build up.
