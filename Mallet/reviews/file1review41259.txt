review/text: I discovered Australian Dream at my mother-in-law's over the Holidays. My wife's Dad has severe arthritis pain and uses it so I thought I'd give it a try for my osteoarthritis pain. After a day of great results (a near pain-free day) I decided to do some research. Like others that have reviewed here I'm surprised at the high number of negative reviews after a good experience for myself. Then I dug deep online. Here are my take-aways:It's great for mild arthritis related pain. The positive effects are tied to the active ingredient Histamine dihydrochlorideInactive increasing blood flow to the treated region. So essentially this reproduces the effect of icing. After four ACL surgeries and years of physical therapy on my knees, pain, and now osteoarthritis, I can tell you that icing my knee works well. It's also a total pain in the butt. This seems to provide the same positive effects without the effort of icing.The negative reviews seem to come from people with severe arthritic pain. This makes sense since it doesn't contain any pain blocking agents, so for people with severe pain, this probably won't do much for them. However, if you have pain that can benefit from increased blood flow to let you body treat the pain point this will likely help. While expensive compared to other creams they have their money back guarantee so I'd give it a shot. Based on what I've seen it looks like they honor the refunds when people send them in. But again, if you have really bad pain, it looks like this might not help.I'm planning on using it as part of a pain overall reduction strategy. My plan is to use it as my main long-term treatment for pain along with physical therapy. The side effects are minimal and it works for me. I'll still use the more powerful stuff / pain blockers when my knee hurts really bad after activity or a long drive / flight. But this is a great compliment and I'm stoked that I found it.I hope this review helps!
