review/text: Helps my body functions nicely. I'm 55 y/o and just had my six month checkup. Heart rate and blood pressure in the very normal range as well as my EKG. Doctor continues to recommend a colonoscopy as prevention but I'm quite confident that my colon is very healthy thanks to my daily intake of The Super Green Formula. Great for all around body and mind function. Perfect way to assure your daily intake of green foods-I also assume that it's a good way to keep myself alkaline.
