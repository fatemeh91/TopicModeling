review/text: I've been on a health kick lately, just trying to focus eating better and healthier. I came across this product here on Amazon and it had such great reviews so I ordered it. It's great! Yes, it may not taste like candy or anything, but it's really not bad. I make my green smoothies every morning for breakfast and lunch- 2 scoops of Green Vibrance powder, 2 scoops of Whey protein powder, 2 cups of unsweetened almond milk, 1 scoop of fiber powder, and 2 cups of frozen fruit. Mix it all up in my awesome Ninja blender (It makes the best smoothies!!!), and I have 2 of my meals for the day. I've been doing this for 2 weeks now and I have felt so much better. I've really been more energized. Actually, a couple of people have commented to me about how much more energy I have. For a while there, I was feeling fatigued all the time. And as a side note, I have lost weight doing this, too, which is great! It's nice knowing that I'm getting more vitamins and minerals that my body needs.
