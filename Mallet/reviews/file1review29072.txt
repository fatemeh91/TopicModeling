review/text: I liked the great price, and great crisp look of it. And on Braun website, the ads were fantastic, so these all made me to buy it. Also I was tired of regular razor shaving and i wanted electric shaver to do the work for me.I must say that the razor is an Ok shaver; Ok, because it didn't match my facial hair structure. In order electric shaver to cut hair, the hair has to be standing on the face. But my facial hair lies on the face, so it's hard for razor to cut them. Also face must be shaved at least every other day; otherwise it won't be able to cut the long hair.Hair length adjustment accesory is nice tool as well. Not only facial hair can be shaved with it, but also body hair can be trimmed.Rotating styler is a nice tool, as well. You can easily correct the sideburns, and neck can be cleaned with it from ugly hair.In the end, i must say, that electric shavers aren't for everyone. Unfortunately facial hair structure has to be compatible with electric shaver too.
