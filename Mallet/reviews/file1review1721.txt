review/text: This is really great for getting those tough fungal infections. I have constantly battled with several infections all over and have done many things, over the counter ointments and sprays, prescription drugs, etc. The only thing that remotely worked was vinegar on my feet and it is tough to bathe in vinegar (as well as costly). This soap worked really well for me, and I started seeing results within a few days. My only complaint would be that it doesn't come in a bigger bottle as 6oz is not really enough to use as body wash on a daily basis. I would not expect this to rid you of an infection in a week or two but I would say that I have had much better results with this than anything else I have tried.
