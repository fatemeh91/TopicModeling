review/text: The regular Magnum's were ok, but they were always tight and uncomfortable for me. Couldn't really stand them actually. Felt like a watermelon trying to be stuffed into a thimble. These came along and fella, thank God.Can't express how grateful I am to Trojan for finally getting it right with this. Now if they'd only start making a full line in the Magnum XL series. Ribbed, Her Pleasure, etc. But for now,THANK YOU TROJAN!!!
