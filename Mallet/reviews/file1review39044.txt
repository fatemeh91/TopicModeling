review/text: This Wahl clipper system is my new best friend, I hate going to the barber and paying for a haircut that only takes them a couple of minutes or so. This kit was much easier to use than I thought it would be, came out w/ a nice haircut that looks as good as anything I've paid for recently. The DVD is LAME, there's no need to watch it if you've ever had your hair clippered before. I don't dig the "left and right ear guard" pieces either. But overall, this is easy to use even without anybody helping you out.
