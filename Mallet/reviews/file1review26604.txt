review/text: UNRELIABLE QUALITY THOUGH GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICEI purchased this Back Booster (2 of them) somewhere else. One of them started leaking air in a week. The manufacturer sent me 2 not 1 as replacements so I thought it was a good business practice of theirs.HIGH HOPESI fly quite a bit for work and I've always carried with me an inflatable lumbar support (or two) and the lumber support(s) sometimes work and other times not as each plane model has different seats. This time (last week) when I flew, I brought the Back Booster with me and really had high hopes that it would work as it appeared to be ergonomic.DOES NOT WORK ON THE PLANEWell, I had to fly 2 segments at 3.5 hr each from coast to coast each way. I sat on the planes for 14 hours in a 3-day time frame. I'm petite and the Back Booster was not even wide enough for me. It's also either too hard or too soft and wobbly. I could not get comfortable whatsoever.CAUSED MORE DAMAGEOn my return flight, my back started to hurt and I had to walk slowly from one plane to another. By the time I finally got to deplane at the destination, my back was in so much pain that I couldn't even straighten it as I walked. I had to bend my back forward walking very slowly...I am still suffering a week after I flew and used the Back (pain) Booster!RECOMMEND AGAINST ITDo not waste your money and cause yourself harm.
