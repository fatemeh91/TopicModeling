review/text: I have purchased these brushes for years..... by the dozens. I loved them. The maker has for some reason stiffened the bristle to such a degree that the brush isn't really usable. If I wanted a bristle this hard I'd buy a metal bristled brush! To really use a brush with a bristle this stiff one would need a much heftier and heaver handle. Way to stiff.... they've ruined a wonderful product.
