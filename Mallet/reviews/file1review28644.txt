review/text: I've tried a lot of whey powders, and Optimum Nutrition 100% Gold Standard ranks among the top in it's price range. When considering how many flavors they offer, I think it's fair to say they might possibly be the best for this price range. It's hard to say, since I haven't tried every whey out there.I typically mix my whey in water. The flavors that taste like bakery goods, or chocolate aren't the best in water, however, the fruity flavors are excellent. Banana Cream is my favorite, however, Tropical Punch and Delicious Strawberry were excellent as well. These also go great in coffee. I like them more than Coffee Mate-like products.The chocolaty or bakery-good type wheys I've tried have all been great in milk. I haven't had a chance to try many of them though. Of the once I've tried, Chocolate Malt was the one I enjoyed the most.If Optimum Nutrition sold sample packs of all their flavors, I would rate them all, however, as it is now, I can only review what I can afford. But from what I have tried, I don't think you can go wrong with Optimum Nutrition 100% gold standard. I've been a repeat customer for about a year, and don't foresee that changing.
