review/text: OUCH!! This stuff kills my skin! This is the second time I've used the Truefitt & Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream, and it is the second time I've walked away from my shave with a horrible rash on my damn face!! I don't know what I was thinking giving it a second try.Using this product achieves a result similar to rubbing poison ivy on my face.I do have slightly sensitive skin, so maybe this could work for you. But really: if there is something in there that causes the skin on my neck & face to respond like that....is it really something that you want to be using?On the plus side: it lathers very nicely and the lavender scent is enjoyable but not overpowering.Finally, for the skeptics out there that are thinking "hmm, maybe it is not the shaving cream but some other step in his routine that is causing the reaction"...not the case. Today the only change to my routine was substituting in the T&F; shaving cream, and the result was painfully different from the norm.
