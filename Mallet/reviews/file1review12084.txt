review/text: This are the only prenatal daily vitamin I've taken that doesn't make me feel nauseated, even if I take it without food (which I usually do!). And it's all natural--no nasty additives, trans fats, etc., all. It's food-based, vegan, eco-friendly, and totally affordable. I'm sticking with these.
