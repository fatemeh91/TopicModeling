review/text: Bought this after people stated that this is the best tasting powder. This powder is average at best, you can't mix it with just water because it does not have enough flavor and if you mix it with something else then you're drastically increasing the calories. I'm going back to Max Protein, it has a great breakdown , mixes well with water and tastes great. I will not buy this brand again.
