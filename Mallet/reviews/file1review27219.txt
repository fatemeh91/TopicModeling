review/text: So - you've been researching the 7000 options for Protein Powder and you've landed on Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard. Good choice. The quality of the product, the price and the reputation are all great. Now you need to decide on a flavor. After all - if it doesn't taste good - it doesn't matter how much it costs. You're a chocolate guy/girl and think that's the safest bet. If you're getting 5 pounds of something, you need to minimize your risk! But do you go with Chocolate or Double Chocolate? I had the same question, so a co-worker and I each got one and did a taste test. Here is what we found:Chocolate: very tasty! When mixed with skim milk it was pretty close in taste to chocolate milk. No aftertaste and generally one the better powders I've tried.Double Chocolate: also very tasty! Smells way more chocolately in the jar and after mixing with skim milk. This one tasted more like a liquid brownie than chocolate milk. There definitely was a "Double" chocolate kick. No aftertaste and perhaps my favorite powder to date.The "winner"? Both really. My co-worker was very happy with her choice of Chocolate because it wasn't overwhelming and I was very happy with the Double because it was more of a "treat" with a bigger chocolate flavor.So decide which one sounds like you - and buy with confidence. At 120 calories for 24g of protein, you'll be getting what you need with a great taste.
