review/text: eliminates the painful (and goofy looking) head-bob which usually wakes you up when traveling by car - of course this assumes you are not driving. might want to look at an inflatable for air travel (save space) but concept would work. fabric has a nice feel and conforms easily to your neck for comfort. velcro is a nice touch to keep in place.
