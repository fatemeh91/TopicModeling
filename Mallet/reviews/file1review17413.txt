review/text: Spent quite a while comparing this product with more expensive alternatives, and I'm glad I let the cheapskate inside of me win out this time. The sliding head piece locks into place very nicely and never gives out under pressure leaving you with bald/short patches. Long battery life, nice to hold and use.Overall a great product at a great price.
