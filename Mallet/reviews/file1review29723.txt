review/text: Let me first say that the Lansinoh disposables are better on pretty much all measures, except for environmental friendliness and cost.That being said, I switched to these reusables after about 3 months, when I was noticing that my disposable pads were almost always dry but I was unwilling to go without anything. At that point, it seemed like I couldn't justify the waste or cost of the disposables anymore.These don't stay in place as well as the disposables, which have a sticky background (for reference, I wear Bravado Basics bras and tanks from Target; they work better with the ones that are mostly cotton and slide around more with the ones that are mostly nylon). Since I'm still nursing often, I usually notice and readjust when I feed my daughter, and I also check when I get a private moment. The Lansinoh stayed in place, except during pumping when I would somehow leak out the bottom.Although they come with a laundry bag, I find it easier to handwash them in soapy water, squeeze them out, and roll them in a towel to get out extra moisture. Afterwards, they are almost dry and I set them out to finish air drying. I am able to rotate three pairs, wearing one a day.In short, I would definitely use the disposables through the engorgement phase. Afterwards, these might be a good choice, but I would still keep some disposables around for situations in which you really, really don't want to risk a leak.
