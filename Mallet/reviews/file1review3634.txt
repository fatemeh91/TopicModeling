review/text: The only thing that really works on build up burnt residue is the scraper and elbow grease. This scraper was okay, but I couldn't figure out how to change the blade, so eventually went to the hardware store and purchased a regular scraper with a pack of single edge blades. It took a lot of scraping and time to clean the ceramic top, which I had neglected. The key is to not let build up "build up" and really clean the top every day. Either regular Cerama Bryte or any of the ceramic stove top cleaners work.
