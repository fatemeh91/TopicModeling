review/text: I'm a 200 pound male with a lot of appetite (the kind that requires 2 full plates of pasta to be sated), and I wasn't expecting a drink to curb my appetite, but probably owing to its high fiber content and balanced nutritive composition, a 2-scoop shake made with fat-free milk can keep -even- me sated for hours and works great when I don't want to deal with a full-fledged breakfast.Been using Slim Fast regularly for over a year for that reason, and particularly love Chocolate Royale flavor. It has a strong and natural dark chocolate taste that makes quite a treat if you're going easy with sweets.Also, it dissolves relatively easy (way quicker than protein powders I tried), even with the 15$ , one-serving blender I purchased on Amazon, it takes 10-15 secs to evenly dissolve it.
