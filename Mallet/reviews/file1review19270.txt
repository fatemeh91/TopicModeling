review/text: After a year of trying to get pregnant, my husband was diagnosed with low sperm count (2 mill) and low motility. I did some research and found this product and figured it was worth a shot. My husband started seeing a urologist and was diagnosed with a varicocele. We told the urologist that my husband was taking fertility blend and he told us he wasn't too familiar with it, but anything my husband did would take 72 days to have an effect on his sperm. The urologist wanted my husband to be retested in three months to see if there was any improvement in his sperm count and if there wasn't he'd have to look into getting surgery to remove the varicocele. My doctor was telling me if we couldn't get an improvement, we would have to go the in vitro route since other fertility treatment would likely be ineffective in our case. Well one week before my husband was supposed to go in to be retested, we found out I was PREGNANT!!! This was my first cycle after the 72 days. I am now just over 6 weeks pregnant and we saw and heard our baby's heartbeat for the first time a couple days ago.My husband started off by taking 4 pills a day (as instructed on the bottle) for the first month and then 2 pills a day after that. I'm convinced these pills made all the difference and highly recommend them. It was other reviews like this that made me give this product a try, so I wanted pay it forward and hope others give this product a try and are also successful. Just remember it will likely take at least 3 months to see a difference.
