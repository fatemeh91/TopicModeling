review/text: I've only tried this product and one other brand's product once, so i'm not exactly an expert. However, I can tell you this product is drinkable. The flavor, while not yummy by any definition, is not offensive. It tastes like grass or (if you've ever tried it) alfalfa. The mixture was a bit gritty (after shaking it with 8-10 oz of water) but not unpalatable. The other brand that I tried was much grittier, so I would recommend this one to the brave souls interested in powdered green foods. Also, keep in mind i initially tried it with a FruitWater (basically plain water with just a hint of lime flavor and sugar). When i mixed it with pomegranate juice the flavor was barely noticeable, though the grit remained.
