review/text: We have been ready to replace our oak kitchen cabinets (hate the oak!). My husband picked up some Parker and Baileys cream, and we gave it a try. It's difficult to describe but the cabinets took on a whole new life! They are a deeper color now with a beautifu sheen. Easy to use and really only need to renew every few months. I now think maybe I can live with the oak and just replace my counters. Three cheers for Parker and Baileys! This is one of the products that I feel I need to stock up on!
