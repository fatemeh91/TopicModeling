review/text: I am trying to detox my body and my skin and this is recommended along with the whole psyllium husks. I dring it in the morning before I eat and I can say that it is working! I have a lot of poop that comes out easily and although I have been utilizing the colonic therapy as well, there is still a lot that adheres to the intestinal walls that this regimen addresses. You may feel bloated as it absorbs and the pysillium absorbs 60x's its weight in fluid. Great product and tastes fine to me. No nasty. I actually look forward to my regimen. Try it, well worth even the increased amount I paid for it. At the Amazon price you cannot go wrong!
