review/text: This black stethoscope is just as beatiful as pictured. For some reason, the doctors and residents at the hospital I work at, never seem to have a stethoscope handy so I pull mine out and they love it!It has a good, clear sound that beats the cheap stethoscopes that are around our nurses station any day! The patients love it too!
