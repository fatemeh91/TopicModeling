review/text: This is overall a great product. I am an EMT-B and i use it every day. It is nice to have the hard case with it beacause it keeps it from getting damaged while bouncing around in the back of the ambulance. I have gotten inaccurate reading from this bp cuff on a few patients, but that's not bad considering the volume of patients it has been used on without a problem.
