review/text: I recently purchased this product and was very disappointed. I have called and emailed "Discount Cleaning Products" several times. There is only a recording on the telephone number that says everybody is busy. None of my messages have been returned. I asked for authorization to return and have been informed by email that my machine may not be returned as it is used. I informed that I used for 3 minutes only to try. Have not received a reply since in spite of several emails and phone calls. THIS VACUUM DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES. I don't know who writes the positive reviews but they must be Hoover executives.
