review/text: Although two consecutive readings might vary by about 10 mmHg, from day to day the readings I get from this device are just as consistent. I'll have to see when I next go to the doctor how close their reading is, but for now, it's a great tool. It's also stupidly easy to use! You just put it on and go, and it's really easy to access the memory of previous readings and their average as well. I love that it came with batteries, too. For $30, it seems like a great deal.
