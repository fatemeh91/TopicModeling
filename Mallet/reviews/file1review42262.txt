review/text: First of all, the taste is bitter/sour (read..awful) but I take it every morning anyway. No, my tastebuds haven't adjusted to it but I know what to expect so that makes it easier.This is the best, bar none, multi I have ever used. The first time I took a capful, I was hit with a noticable burst of energy almost immediately. My first thought was, "Oh Oh, I'm probably going to have a huge crash in a couple of hours." I didn't though. It sustained me all day long!I've been taking this multi daily for about 2 months now & I'd never go back to a pill that clearly was not being absorbed into my system.
