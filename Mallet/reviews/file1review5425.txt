review/text: As others have mentioned, the odor is horrible - much worse than regular bleach and so potent that you won't want to go in your bathroom after you've let this stuff sit for the recommended 10-15 minutes.However I might've been able to tolerate the smell had the product actually done what it was supposed to do. The idea of just spraying a cleaner onto gunk and grime and then simply wiping it clean is an alluring one, but unfortunately "Scrub Free" is anything but. If you are trying to clean anything other than surface dirt, you are still going to having to scrub. And don't forget to thoroughly rinse this stuff off, because otherwise it will leave a lovely white film over everything.My other big issue with this product is the crappy nozzle. It won't work at all if you're holding the bottle at even the slightest angle away from vertical, and when it is perfectly vertical it still takes 10-15 trigger pumps to actually get it to spray, during which time foul-smelling cleaner usually starts bubbling out onto your fingers. Truly delightful!
