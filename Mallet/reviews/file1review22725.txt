review/text: I read a LOT of positive reviews of this product and was excited to try it. They advertise ridding the body of excess water, improved energy, appetite suppression, etc. For me, non of this occurred.Hunger suppression - No. I still had the same appetite.More Energy - No. I don't drink any caffeine or take other supplements during this trial, so i SHOULD have felt something, but I did not.Physical changes in body composition - No, not a thing.In the end, I felt like I had just spent money to swallow roughly 20 pills a day. Also these pills smell bad as well.Don't waste your time or money. Find a different product.
