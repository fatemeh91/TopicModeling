review/text: The WP-65 replaced my six year old WP-70 on which the hose had finally developed a leak I couldn't fix. I wish they would have included their new under-the-gum spout and that they would re-issure the multi-holed sprayer that used to come with the appliance. Except for the color of the reservoir, this one is the same as and cost $15 less than I paid for the original. The only functional difference is the slider control on the head. The old one clicked distinctly into each of the five settings while the new one slips from one to another with just the slightest touch. I don't rate that an improvement. But if this one lasts as long as its predecessor, I'll count myself lucky.
