review/text: I was interested in this product but I can't consume dairy so I'm always wary when a product is chocolate flavored. (The description here on Amazon states that it does not contain dairy.) I went to the company's website and in the "Notes" section of the description for this product was this - **Based on 2000 calorie diet.Other Ingredients: fructose, inulin, natural flavors (coconut and milk), cocoa bean powder, silicon dioxide, and organic guar gum.Too bad - I would have liked a good-tasting DGL tablet!
