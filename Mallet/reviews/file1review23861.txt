review/text: I picked up some of this Spice Island after shave at a one of those warehouse outlets last Christmas. I actually tried it for it was so cheap compared to so many of the other mens scents there. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it how strong it was, and how long it lasted. It was still noticeably fragrant on me hours after I used it. The "spice island" as they call it is actually a form of bay rum, an old fashioned but still common after shave that comes in a lot of formulas. But this particular lotion is a bit stronger and a little different than your average bay rum. A spicier version that is really nice. This after shave is well worth the price either for yourself, or would make a nice gift for some man in your life that likes this sort of thing. The bottle, the scent, and the strength in my opinion makes this after shave a real bargain that anyone not familiar with it would think cost much more. I like it and recommend it here on Amazon...
