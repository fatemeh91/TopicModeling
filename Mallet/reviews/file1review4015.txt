review/text: I first tried the fusion power razor, I thought it was great! But hold on I purchased the replacement blades and WOW! They were terrible!!! they seemed really dull BEFORE I used them. I don't know if Gillette is using the ole bait n switch or what, But my first blade lasted about 3 months and gave a great shave. The replacements are garbage, don't waste your money. Just my opinion.
