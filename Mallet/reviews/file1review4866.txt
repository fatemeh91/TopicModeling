review/text: My 13 year old son's feet smelled so awful. When he took his shoes off and left them in a room, the whole would stink. I tried drying his shoes out with a dehumidifier, washing his feet twice a day - no luck.Got the cream, had him wash his feet, then put it on that night. The next day when home from school on the couch w/no shoes, I was amazed. I actually put his foot to my nose - no odor at all. I asked him to do the same - he was amazed too.This stuff works.
