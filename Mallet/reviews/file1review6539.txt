review/text: I say the best because it has 11 therapy knobs whereas the closet competitor has far fewer. The Body Back Buddy stimulates in between muscles and pinpoints trigger points for a more finely-tuned treatment. I have numerous aches and pains since I have fibromyalgia plus I workout a good deal. I seem to always be pulling something or messing something up that causes a good deal of pain. And, in most cases, it's where I can't reach. This massage tool helps me greatly. It's especially helpful for the neck and back but also works trigger points on the feet, hips and other places.Overall length is 25 inches. Comes with a free 12 page instruction booklet. There are also instructions on their website. And there's a manual you can download. Basically, you simply put a knob or knobs on the sore area and massage. The relief you'll feel is amazing.Highly recommended.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson
