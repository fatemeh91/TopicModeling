review/text: I did Dr. Groups initial 5-day cleanse with this product. I now (maintenance) just use the oxy-powder every other day (2-3 pills). If I eat a really horrible meal then I'll take 4 pills before bed. This stuff will keep you regular. I experienced cramps the first two BM of the the cleanse and none since then. I'm ordering my fourth bottle today. I took a chance and liked the out come (no pun intended) maybe you will too.
