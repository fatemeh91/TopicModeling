review/text: These cloths are awesome. I originally started out with one of these cloths in my home and gave it a try. Once I saw the great job that a single one does with picking up messes like a sponge, I opted to buy more via Amazon. Now they're in almost every room in my home. I like the fact that they clean up without having to use cleansers with harmful vapors. They are very "Pet Friendly".
