review/text: When I received these at my baby shower, I thought &quot;What is this?...slightly cheap seeming diapers?&quot; When I brought Baby home I soon saw how practical they are. Thin, yes! But simply fold them in half and it will take point-blank projectile vomits without any problem. We use them ALL the time, lifesavers really. Great for wiping drooly little chins and messy little hands. I give them now as shower gifts....the workhorse of the nursery. I am using my first set with baby #2.
