review/text: I have used this product in the past and have always found it to be as good as the ads and literature say it is. This Optimum Nutrition product comes in several flavors and I have tried several but the Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite. It is easy to mix with skim milk "my favorite" even if all you have is a shaker. I would highly recommend this ON product to anyone seeking a high protein powdered drink mix.
