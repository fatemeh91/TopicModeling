review/text: When the first of my children was born I bought 5 dozen birdseye diapers. I never thought cloth diapers to be a hassle, even though all of friends used disposables. They were always running to the store to buy diapers. I always had plenty. I saved tons of money. Washing diapers is no big deal to me. I got a kick out of so many of the reviews here talking about all of the uses for the cloth diapers -- other than diapering. I would rather have soft cotton on my botton than paper. You don't have to worry about chemicals or fragrances with cloth diapers -- just use Ivory Snow. The "books" say not to use bleach, but when the diapers got dingy or stained I did use bleach following by three rinses. My kids are now grown and I am still using the diapers. They are the best thing to dry crystal, wash cars, and to use on your face. Pure cotton -- can't beat it.The Gerbers I bought were thick but many of the reviews here say they are now thin. I bought 5 dozen for my daughter several years ago from an online diaper store and they were quite thick.Do your wallet and the environment a favor and give cloth diapers a try -- for diapering. You can buy 5 dozen for little more than one month's worth of diaposables!!! Disposables are also a real environmental problem.
