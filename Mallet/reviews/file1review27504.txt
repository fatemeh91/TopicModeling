review/text: First of all I am a huge fan of this stuff and have been using it 5yrs, I've bought the strawberry and vanilla flavors, My goals are weight loss and nothing else comes close to this product, I've tryed countless others.Reasons I only buy the strawberry or vanilla flavors is I don't want a gunky flavor, if I wanted a junk flavor I'll eat junk, I add 10oz water 3 medium strawberrys, half medium size banana, 1/4cup blueberries, scoop of whey powder, and 1 tsp glucomannan powder, and 2tbls ground flax seeds and 1tsp l-glutamine powder, 1 tsp greensuperfood. I drink this for breakfast a half hr before I go to the gym, then I drink another protein shake after, adding only vegtables with the vanilla whey protein, I have been full of energy and have lost 30lbs in 5wks, along with drinking plenty of fresh squeezed lemon water and lots of fresh vegtables and fresh cooked fish dinners tilapia wild caught...back to the product I love this stuff and will not switch to another.
