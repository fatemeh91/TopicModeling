review/text: Ok, so first let me say, I cannot believe anyone has the ability to take up to 6 (SIX) PILLS a day....I thought I would kick start my diet and exercise by taking two pills. (BACKGROUND: I am 5'3 and 139 lbs. I want to lose 20 lbs. I am eating a reduced calorie diet and exercising 45 mins to 1 hr daily).Well, two pills for me was definitely a mistake [for me]. I took them in the morning at 930am and it is now 646pm and I feel like my heart is still slightly racing (even after exercise) and my right arm is a little tingly. And I've felt like this all day. Oh and approx. 45 mins after taking, I felt like I could run laps around the office, so um, yes, definitely TONS of energy.I am going to scale back the dosage to one pill in the morning and see how I feel. If early-mid afternoon I feel ok, with no side effects, I will try a second pill. I think for me,that will be as much as I can take in one day.I suggest strongly to take a minimum dosage and work your way up accordingly.Good luck everyone!
