review/text: I'm not gonna write some long review, because I just finished reading the others and they basically say what I was gonna say. Thera tears works for dry eyes flat out. I've been using them for about 3 years. Oh by the way, you know how it says on the boat that it take like 4-6 weeks (or something like that) till you start experiencing the dry eye relief. That is actually true (for me at least.) So don't start taking them for like 2 weeks and then after seeing no immediate effect and just stop, keep taking them. I take 3 a day in the morning as suggested. It does give you fish breath a bit as people have mentioned. but easy way to solve this issue is take your 3 pills in the morning before you brush or swish listerine, completley gets rid of the smell. oh and by the way, the reason i started using it is because my eye doctor noticed i had dry eyes and had scarring on my eyes balls. So he suggested Thera Tears. Plus theirs the whole Fish oil and flaxseed oil benefit which from all i hear is good, but never actually measured by cholestoral or anything like that to confirm that. Anyways, good product. Can't remember the price amazon is charging, but i usually pick it up at walmart for like $12.00 a bottle which includes 90 pills (1 month worth). Oh and yeah when i wake in the morning it really does get rid of the irritation and throughout the day. Seriously gotta say this is an effective product for dry eye. Oh looks like the review was long afterall. :)
