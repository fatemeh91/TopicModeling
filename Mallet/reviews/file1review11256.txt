review/text: Right this very minute I'm sucking on a Ricola as I type. I am suffering from a non-ending cold/bronchitis, whatever this is. I haven't slept in 3 nights due to severe coughing and runny nose. I was avoiding cough drops like the plague due to the offensive taste that Halls and many others have. I had been resistant to try these and even suffered while the bag sat on the table staring me in the face. I sucked up my apprehension and finally opened one and popped it in my mouth, cringing as I anticipated the horrible medicine taste. These are VERY great tasting! They also stopped my cough immediately. I slept for many hours until waking up needing another which I'm enjoying now. Never thought I would review a cough drop, but the commercials don't lie. These really ARE the best!If you HATE the offensive taste of other cough drops try these. You'll get relief and be pleasantly surprised!
