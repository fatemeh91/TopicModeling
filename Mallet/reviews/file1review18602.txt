review/text: Like the sweet nectar of a hidden utopia, this protein is one of the best things in the market. I have problems with milk and whey products but this micro filtered blend is perfect and does not cause any digestion problems. I've been using this for about a year and the gains have been great. Chocolate and Vanilla are the two I've had and if you're wondering which to go with, maybe try vanilla since it's a bit more neutral.
