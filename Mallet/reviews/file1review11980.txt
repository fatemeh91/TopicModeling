review/text: I like the nutrients derived from food-based sources and only the need to take the vitamin only once a day, which is easier and more manageable for me to follow and not having to keep track. I also like another more expensive brand like New Chapter perfect prenatal, which is also food-based, however I would have to take 3 pills a day to get the daily dose, which I often missed with a busy schedule. So for more reasonable and affordable price, convenience, and comparable nutrients, I prefer and have been using Rainbow Light just once prenatal for the last two years.
