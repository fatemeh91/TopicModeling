review/text: First beard, first trimmer (though I have had a moustache for 30+ years). I have been very pleased with the ease of use designed into this trimmer, the battery life, the ease with which it can be cleaned, and the freedom from needed lubrication. Also, the price. Thanks to all who wrote the ratings that helped me decide on this one! I add my enthusiastic endorsement to yours.
