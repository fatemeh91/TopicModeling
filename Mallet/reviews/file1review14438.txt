review/text: I initially bought this for my six year old daughter to get more vitamins into her diet - but she found out this was a kind of 'medicine' and she is absolutely against it. I didn't want to take it back, so I've been taking a spoonful in rice milk before bed and WOWZA.... my sinuses have never felt so clear before bed! How weird is that, I know, but seriously, I refuse to go to bed at night without taking a drink of this awesome stuff. I wake up less groggy, my sinuses are cleared the night before. I don't want to be without it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
