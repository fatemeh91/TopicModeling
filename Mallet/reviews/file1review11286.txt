review/text: I took this supplement on my naturopath's recommendation. I had an overly acidic body and high yeast build up. After a few months of taking the supplement along with modifying my diet for good I no longer have an acidic body - which makes yourself more prone to infections of any kind and particularly for us women, yeast infections are directly related to the vaginal pH. Why I mention the fact that I had to modify my diet for good, well because the SAD (Standard American Diet) which relies heavily on grains, processed foods, etc., directly affects our bodily pH, and the higher the pH of the body the better the environment for the proliferation of yeast.I suggest you get a bit better informed about the connection of yeast to most of our modern day maladies through Dr. William Crook's BookThe Yeast Connection: A Medical Breakthrough. Most of todays gluten intolerance is not gluten intolerance at all, it is the yeast overload in our bodies that pits the inside of our intestines severely impairing our digestion, when the pitting becomes too severe even immunological problems can occur - internal candida which very few main stream doctors are willing to diagnose is the cause of so many immune deficiency dis-eases.To those that have mentioned the dizziness, it could be the detoxifying effect, the killing of the yeast in your body and the need for the body to get rid of the waste. To those who will not take it because it contains Tea Tree a bit of info to this regard, your skin allows for the absorption of far greater amounts of Tea Tree when applied topically than the amount this product contains and yet it is considered non toxic when applied topically. We tend to forget that the largest organ in our body is our skin and are willingly applying conconctions of far more toxic chemicals on it with no remorse, yet not willing to ingest a tiny amount that will do the body much good.Remember that if you want to get rid of yeast for good in your life you have to not just treat the yeast already in your body but you have to stop contributing to it - which is the main reason some see flare ups of the yeast when they suspend this supplement.
