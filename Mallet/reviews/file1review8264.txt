review/text: Bought the OXO Good Grips Bottle Beush from Amazon first of all because of the price. It definitely would have been twice the price in grocery store. A baby bottle brush would not have been so sturdy and probably not long enough to reach all the way to the bottom of my thermos. I like the big scrubing head (not too big that it cant fit through the neck of my thermos but big enough to reach the entire sides of the thermos) so you can just scrub with an up and down motion instead of having to turn the thermos as you scrub.
