review/text: We used Glade "Powder Fresh" (PF) in the vivid blue and white container for years, loved it. Then came the "NEW Powder Fresh", washed out/faded colors on the container matched the product now inside. Undoubtably a formulation by the accounting department. It has more of an odor of swamp gas and Chinese Chestnut blossoms than any talcum I've ever smelled.I called S.C. Johnson & Co. thinking they'd run a bad batch. They sent a FREE coupon good for any Glade product. Before I used it I sampled the "NEW" PF store product on the shelves and found it was ALL watered down. I left the free coupon for someone to use on another Glade product.Remember when the bean counters at Coke invented the "NEW Coke".If you can find an old can of Glade Powder Fresh with the cheery blue sky and clouds on the can, buy it. If you like the old time talcum smell you'll be pleased - treasure it - they don't make it like that any more. PF is now PU.
