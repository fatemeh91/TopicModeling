review/text: Dymatize Nutrition is the only whey protein brand I can handle drinking on a regular basis. I use a shaker cup and have never had a problem with clumping like I have with other brands. This does leave a slight aftertaste that isn't my favorite, but what can you expect? It's not chocolate milk! Chocolate is the way to go if you're just drinking it with water or milk, and Vanilla or Strawberry if you're mixing it with fruit to make smoothies.
