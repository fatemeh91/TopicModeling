review/text: Since becoming disabled, finding items to help with getting in and out of our van has been a challenge. This Standers Car Caddie is so easy to install and works for me both for entering and getting out of the van. If I need something to hang onto before getting into the wheelchair or hanging onto a rollator, the Car Caddie gives me that stability. I don't mind that it hangs by the window, and it does not swing wildly or distract. There is some movement when the vehicle turns, etc, but the position we have it placed in is not a problem for us. I am so thankful to have this item and for such a good price.
