review/text: I have very tight shoulders, and this thing is magic. I've been using it for about a week now (1-2 times per day) and have already seen a huge difference. The main advantage of this item over a theracane is the pointed tip on one of the curved ends that REALLY allows you to pinpoint and &#34;dig&#34; much more effectively.
