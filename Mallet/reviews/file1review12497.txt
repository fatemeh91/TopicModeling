review/text: Well first time doing this kind of things, but I tried the Oxypowder after many reviews, and I can tell you it worked for me. I am 130 lbs, healthy but with constipation always. I have to take 6 pills because 4 did not work for me. At the beginning it was okay only make me go to the bathroom like 3 to 5 times. then with the days go I was only going to the bathroom in the morning for 3 times and give me the afternoon free. I take it for around 10 days together with acidophilus pearls from enzymatic (after many reviews too, it say is the only with good cover, so it get to your stomach)good bateria because the cleaning take out everything, well after getting almost close to the end of the 10 days I was really tired, really tired, with a little temperatura and feeling a little bad like a flu, reading it says that is a normal reaction because your body is taking out all your trash from your body, well it was working. I did not pupu to much for be exacty, not like the people says that they see huge and stranges things, not in my case for that reason I was a little concern that maybe is not working. But let me tell you, at the end, fixed my constipation, now I go to bathroom everyday! sometimes twice, glad for that, and I think it did something good with my digestion, because now is working great, I am still taking the acidophilus (good bateria) and drinking my water with apple juice and honey like oxypowder recommended. Ah I forgot, you have to drink water like they say in the instructions, important, because I was feeling so thirsty after some days, I was getting dehydrated, so be careful with the water, drink a lot. I am still doing the same quantity of water with the apple vinegar and my acidophilus pills and my digestion now is great!
