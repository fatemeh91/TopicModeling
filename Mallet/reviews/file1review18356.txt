review/text: These Hefty "Easy Grip 9oz Cups" are good quality plastic cups that are much sturdier than the generic types. We like the red color because it is real easy to see where I set my cup down or if the kids forgot to throw their used ones away.Buying these in bulk from Amazon saves us a good bit of time and money as well!Recommended!CFH
