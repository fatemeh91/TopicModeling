review/text: The hose broke on my first WP-65 within the warranty period. The manufacturer replaced the unit but wouldn't guarantee the replacement unit. Within three months the handle of the replacement unit lost the ability to hold the piks and they would shoot out of the handle whenever I turned it on, rendering it unusable. I purchased my third WP-65 and within fifteen months the motor/pump seized. As an aside, all units were quiet when new but became excessively noisy within weeks - like a minature jackhammer. Can't someone at WaterPik design a high quality and reliable product?
