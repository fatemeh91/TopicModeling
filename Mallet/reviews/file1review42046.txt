review/text: This product I have used to stop a sore throat as well as swollen glands right in their tracks. And I feel good using it because the ingredients are natural. It smells wonderful and I love using this to naturally sanitize my kitchen and other areas of my home that need it. If you need a boost in your immune system and want to stay germ-free like I do, please purchase this product. You won't be sorry!
