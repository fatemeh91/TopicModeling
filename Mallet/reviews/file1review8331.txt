review/text: I like to wash things "from afar" - not with a hand held scrubber. I have just gotten in the habit of using this to wash everything so I go through them often. I keep at least three in the cabinet under the sink so I won't be without. My local store used to carry this but have stopped for some reason. This Oxo model hols us better than others. I have to admit I've never washed a single bottle with it.
