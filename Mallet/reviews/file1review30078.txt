review/text: I bought a box of Seventh Generation Free & Clear dish powder because I want to use toxic-free cleaning products in my home. While the dish powder did remove all the dirt and grime and leave the dishes clean in that sense, it left a white powdery residue on the heating coils, calphalon cooking spoons, and my clear glasses. For now I'll just be using Cascade instead.
