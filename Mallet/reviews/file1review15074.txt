review/text: I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and have started to notice improvement in both eyes. My right eye was much worse than the left one and the yellowish/browinish tint I used to see is starting to go away. I hope it will continue to improve but some is better than nothing. The left eye didn't have the yellowish/brownish tint so am not using as many drops in it but have noticed an improvement in color perception. Some web sites I have been viewing say that is takes about 3 to 6 months before improvement is noticed so I might be doing a little better than normal. The only complaint I have so far is a little stinging sometimes when I use it. It is most noticeable if I use the drops right after taking out my contact lenses, but it is not too severe.
