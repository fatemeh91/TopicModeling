review/text: Mixes very well. I wouldn't describe the flavor as "double rich," but it's not bad. Actually, I prefer it over most other chocolates because it's not nearly as sweet. It almost tastes slightly bitter, like pure cocoa powder without nearly as much sugar, which suits me just fine. All that said, I'll try vanilla next time...
