review/text: I've been using Jarrow's MSM 1000 powder for more than 5 years. Obviously, I think it is a great product or I wouldn't be using it. I had major orthopaedic surgery last Spring and recuperated quickly, I did a number of natural things including Essential Oils and Laser but I am confident that it quickened my healing process.I have used the tablets and since my stomach is touchy, I personally prefer the powder but I don't hesitate to recommend this Jarrow product.I did get a sample of this through the Vine Program but it in no one influenced my review in any manner. I believe very strongly in Jarrow products over all, see my other reviews.
