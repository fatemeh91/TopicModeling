review/text: As a deodorant, it does do its job -- no complaints, and the scene it not overbearing. My biggest complaint is that shortly after you put it on, its starts flaking everywhere. Case in point, I went to the doctor, and needed to take my shirt off. Once my shirt and undershirt came off, I have deodorant flakes flying all over the place from my pits. I had only put this on about 30 minutes prior, and there is goes flaking everywhere. It doesnt matter how much you put on, it just ends of flaking, and its nasty. My other complaint is that some of the scents are way too powerful like clean slate, and its smell like you dumped a bottle of cologne on even if you only put a little. I really recommend trying something else because I am.
