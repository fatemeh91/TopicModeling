review/text: This is absolutely the best one you could get! It sits easily on your neck,and doesn't fall off. It holds the heat for a very long time. The fragrance I love. I have even been taking it to bed to use as a heating pad for different areas, and fall asleep with its warmth. I have been telling others about it, and would not hesitate to give it as a gift to others. I LOVE it! Great value for your money.
