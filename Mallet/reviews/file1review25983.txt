review/text: When I received my mask and saw it for the first time, I thought that it would fall apart after a few uses. I was wrong ! I have had it for over a year and a half and it's in as good a shape as the day it came. I also sleep on my side, and it takes a bit of adjustment , then it works fine. I use it on a daily basis, and I am very pleased with it. And I would recommend it highly to anyone that wants a good DARK sleep environment.
