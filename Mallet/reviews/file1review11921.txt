review/text: I have tried a variety of vitamins in general, and variety of prenatal vitamins, both prescription and OTC. I'v found that most of the prescription ones are okay, but they just contain the basics with limited minerals and some limited vitamins, like biotin. I found these which have a good number of both vitamins and minerals and none in super excess. They are very large, I don't have any problems with pills, so that's not a problem for me. I haven't really noticed any after-taste as some reviews have mentioned. And most of all, I have found that these are pretty easy on the stomach. I still have to take them after a meal, or with a small snack to eliminate nausea, but with many other vitamins evern that doesn't help! I would definitly recommend these!- one small note to the nauseous pregnant women- the smell makes me very queasy, but if you can over the brief opening of the jar, you should be just fine!
