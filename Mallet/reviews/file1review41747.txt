review/text: I used to have a Philippes sonicare something, then four years ago i bought an Oral-b Sonic complete. I liked it so much i bought a second one about 2 years ago. For me, these things seem to have a life of about 2 years or 2-3 times a day use. Of course, towards the end of its life, the unit is basically useless for travel unless you want to bring the charger. When my most recent sonic started to die, I was so tempted to buy a third one. However, my wife has been a fan of the circular motion cleaners and i figured that is the type of cleaner the dentists use, so i decided to get this model instead. I don't think you really need to the smart guide anyway. The first few times i used this, i sort of missed the "ultrasonic" feel of the Sonic complete. However, i did compare this to my sonic complete that requires a charge after each use. I'm assuming i had a full charge on both, and to be quite honest, the triumph totally blows away the sonic complete. It feels as different to me as the difference from using the sonic complete vs an ordinary toothbrush. PLUS, the recharge base is so much smaller and more portable for extended travel.
