review/text: I lost a tiny nut from my eyeglasses and it seems the optical stores I went to didn't have a replacement. I saw this online and decided to try it and was very happy to find that in the assortment of screws and nuts, I found just the right size to fit. Not only that, the supplied tool that came with the tiny nuts and screws also was a bit help in the installation. Very happy with this purchase!
