review/text: VERY impressed with the Omron HEM629 Auto-inflate BP Monitor. It's truly is Impressive! Reasonably priced, compact, very easy to use and accurate. First tested the unit on myself as my BP and pulse are consistent and easy obtain. Then tested the unit on my wife who's BP is very difficult to get. We were very skeptical of the unit at first because she normally requires a trained nurse to get BP using a large cuff with a stethescope and pulse taken manually. But the Omron HEM629 BP Monitor was so easy that my wife placed it on her own wrist, placed it up high by her heart while in a relaxed state, pressed the button (unit has amazing power!) and got accurate readings which were VERY close to those take in the doctors offices. The key is to follow the directions to the letter and hopefully you will have the same good experience we've had. Have only had the unit about a month so can't attest yet to duration but it comes with a warranty. Thank you.
