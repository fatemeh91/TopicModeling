review/text: Podiatrists dispense these to patients with hammer toes to take pressure off toe tips, support rigid toes and help take pressure off the ball of foot. The soft Gel is neat stuff. Pedifix also offers a foam/fabric version that some find more supportive, along with toe caps, protectors and cushions. Pedifix offers a 100% money back 'relief guarantee'. No Sore Feet! FS
