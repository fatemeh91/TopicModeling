review/text: I was looking for some heavy duty rags that were disposable..and came across the Rags-in-a-Box product..I would describe these as paper towels on steroids (without the negative side effects like enlarged breasts, acne and violent temper, which is happens a lot with the "other" brands of rags).Our housekeeper uses them and has no complaints.So for those on the fence about buying this product, the product is as advertised..200 rags in the box...does the job..mission accomplished.
