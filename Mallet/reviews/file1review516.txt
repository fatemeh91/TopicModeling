review/text: This is absolutely INCREDIBLE! I used it three times the first day I got it. I literally cannot keep it out of me! By far the best toy I have ever had. It is a little loud, but is easy to cover up with the radio, tv, or a fan. The rotating beads are absolutely amazing. It is the perfect size, but if you are used to smaller toys, you would probably have to work yourself up to it. My boyfriend and I live in different states so it gets alot of use. I LOVE it! It is very easy to use in different positions and always hits the right spots. I would recommend it a million times!!
