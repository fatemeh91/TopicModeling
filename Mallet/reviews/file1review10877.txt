review/text: I think that the product is very helpful, it doesn't sting and the price is good. But it seemed to run out pretty fast (faster that H2Ocean). One thing I didn't care for was that the spray didn't spray like a spritz spray. It sprayed a lot at a time (maybe I got a defected one, who knows). Other than that, I do like the product so i'll probably purchase it again.
