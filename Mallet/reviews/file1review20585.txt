review/text: My foil lasted approximatly 6 weeks before developing a hole. Thereafter, I cut my face whenever I tried to use the razor. After a few attempts, I understood the price of a new foil was less than the expected doctor's bills if I kept slicing my face. I called Braun Customer Service and reported the problem. They were friendly and offered to send a new cutter block. Within 1 week they had done as promised and even followed up with a letter. Great service, but I hope the new one lasts a bit longer as I very much like the razor. By the way, if you have this problem the number for Customer Service is: (800)272-8611
