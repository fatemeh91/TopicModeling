review/text: I've been using this product for years, ever since my mom first found it in a locally owned pharmacy. When we moved out of town, she would still make the trip to the drug store because no chain pharmacies would carry it. It obviously works for muscle and joint pain but I use it most for minor burns and stings and it works FAST! I'm clumsy in the kitchen and tend to touch hot things a little too much. Whenever I get a little burn on my hand, I rush for the Penetran and it immediately stops hurting and I've never gotten a blister when I use it immediately.I would give this 5 stars but the smell is a little odd, like a medicinal lemon scent that is kind of a turn off.
