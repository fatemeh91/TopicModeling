review/text: The art and ritual of old time Wet Shaving has been a passion and indulgene of mine for years. I use both straight razors and DE (double edge) saftey razors. I also collect antique and vintage razors which drives my better half crazy because our bathroom looks more like a barber shop than it does anything else.Castle Forbes is a centuries old producer out of Scotland best known for creating the finest shave creams in the world. The Lavander is specially grown, harvested by hand and the essential oils are distilled in an ardous process that hasn't changed in 100 years. The result is an intoxicating, earthy hard to describe but unforgettable scent.The cream itself is incredibly luxuriuos - silky, rich and wildly hydrating. Matched with a good razor and blade this cream ensures a Barber close shave every single time. What is more, the cream fully protects against razor drag, pulling or irritation. Leaving your skin soft and supple - it's expensive yes, but a little tiny bit goes a long way.If you're new to wet shaving or a pro and haven't tried Castle Forbes products you really do owe it to yourself. The experiance is like no other, I assure you.This classic shave cream, with it's outstanding quality will provide you with the finest, closest and most comfortable shave you've ever experianced.
