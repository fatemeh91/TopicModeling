review/text: Works perfectly for any kind of itch wether jock or around toes. Just apply to affected area and massage in medicated soap and you'll feel it work instantly, removing the itch. If you're situation isn't too serious just get the 6oz bottle. For me this was more then enough. Still have 70 percent of the bottle left. Wanna buy some?
