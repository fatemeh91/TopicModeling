review/text: I start taking Oscillococcinum whenever I have been around sick people. I was able to keep working while others missed days of work. Sometimes I had mild symtoms, but never full-blown . I love this product. They say chicken soup has an ingredient to heal. This product, to me, is a highly concentrated version of that; only it's made from the muscovy duck.
