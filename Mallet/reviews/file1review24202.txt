review/text: The card is nice and sturdy, but somewhat translucent. There are two gray lines seen on the front of the card caused by solid black lines on the back. Thes lines make reading the numbers on the front's left side more difficult. The card is the ideal Rosenbaum chart with rulers on the back otherwise.
