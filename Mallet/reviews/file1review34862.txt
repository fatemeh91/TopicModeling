review/text: This product was made sturdy. However it's really dull. In fact it's so dull that I couldn't intentionally cut myself. I tried shaving with this 2 separate times for an hour each to no avail. I ended up running out and getting some disposable blades for the interim.Mind you this is the first time I've tried shaving with a straight razor, but I stayed at it trying different angles and such for quite sometime. I'm sending mine back.
