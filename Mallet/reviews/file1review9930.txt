review/text: I was very excited about this product, and Tweezerman products came highly recommended to me. However, I was only able to use this product for a short time. My first problem was that after every in-grown hair was removed, there was a tell-tale scab left behind. I'm not sure which was worse, the hair bump, or the scab. Secondly, I dropped the tweezers, and after that the precision tips did not meet perfectly, so I had to jimmy the ends a bit every time I used it. I finally had to stop using it altogether after I misused the tweezers to retrieve something at the bottom of a narrow bottle and the tips bent.In the end, I think this is probably a great tool for an "emergency" in-grown hair or in the hands of a professional. However, it is not suitable as a primary pair of tweezers or for people who are, like me, a little clumbsy or ham handed (you know who you are ;)).
