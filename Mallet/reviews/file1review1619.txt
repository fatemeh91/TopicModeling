review/text: OK, this stuff works great because it's very strong. I had a wart on my hands that was there for YEARS and not it's gone. I even had my doctor freeze it twice and it still didn't go away. This stuff got rid of it in about 15 days.HERE'S THE TIP:The key is to isolate the wart so the medication doesn't affect the good skin. This is especially important for small warts.Tip #1: Take a large plastic bandage (not fabric), and cut off the two sticky sides and throw away the padded portion in the middle. Take one of the sticky sides (save the other one for later) and with the backing still on it and fold it into four (half and half again). Now cut the center corner off to make a small hole in the middle - you want the hole just a tiny bit bigger than the wart. Then unfold it, take the backing off, and apply it on your wart with the wart sticking out of the hole. Now you can apply a big glob of the Wart Stick medication and you wont have to worry about it killing the surrounding good skin. Apply an second full bandage on top of the medication and you're good to go.Tip #2: Make sure you apply the medication after a shower when the skin is soft and more penetrable.Tip#3: If you have a stubborn wart, do it in intervals. Apply the medication for 2-3 days, then leave it uncovered and unmedicated for a day or two so it can harden and peel off. Then repeat. My stubborn wart took three rounds but with some patience, it did finally go away.
