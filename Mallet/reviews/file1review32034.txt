review/text: This is the best thing I have ever tried. I noticed changes immediately within a couple of hours of taking this stuff. Yes, the taste is horrible. But I have a trick that wasn't mentioned in the other reviews. I mix mine with a tall glass of orange juice (get the kind that is not made from concentrate) and then I stir it up really well, plug my nose, and chug it. Easiest way to get it down and I can barely taste it. Does wonders for skin and hair and I think it is also helping me with weight loss. You should try this product. Don't be scared away by the taste. Just get creative and find the way that works for you. You won't be sorry.
