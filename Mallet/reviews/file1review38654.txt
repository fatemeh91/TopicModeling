review/text: Dash a bit into your hands and splash onto your face liberally. It'll make you smell good. It might cool your face after a shave (once the stinging sensation has subsided). But come on! This isn't facial medicine or anything like that. It's a decent product but only as much as any other run-of-the-mill after-shave/cologne product, be it Old Spice, New Spice, Nice Spice, or what-have-you.
