review/text: gonna make this short sweet and to the point . . .ths is the first vibrator (im not a very open when it comes to the bedroom) i EVER owned my fiance used it on me last night and all i have to say is if this sucker broke i would be online ordering the next one i could find. I really dont see the need for anyone to buy a 100$ vibrator this was deff 35$ WELL spent! ive had it for a while now and actually it didnt break on its own i broke it the little silver rotating balls must have plastic that drives it well i guess i have really strong kegel muscles. i cant wait to buy another. another awesome thing about it VERY DISCREET shipping. (never used it in the water so cant say much about that.
