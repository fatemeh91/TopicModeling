review/text: This product is great. It whitened my teeth, but not to the point of looking funny. The box warns about tooth/gum sensitivity, and I have heard of some people having a difficult time with it, but personally it has been quite minimal. I happen to have one porcelain veneer in the front of my mouth, and I found that while the strips whitened my teeth, they didn't do it so much that it made my veneer look out of place. This above all pleased me the most--I got whitening, but I don't look like I have a fake tooth in front.The only reason I docked the product one star is because it is a bit annoying to use. I found that the only way to make sure the strips didn't slide around was to wipe my teeth dry before I applied them (i.e. the same concept as when the dentist uses an air tube to dry an area of your mouth before he works in it). This helped the strips to stay in place while I was waiting for the 30 minutes. The only other annoying thing was that if I swallowed I got nauseous (probably from the peroxide on the strips, some of which in all likelihood gets mixed into your saliva). So while it was ultimately the least unpleasant to let a big wad of spit accumulate in my mouth (and then spit when I was removing the strips), it was not exactly enjoyable. However, considering I am without the luxury of a dental office where they use the draining tube for that, this product does the job just fine!
