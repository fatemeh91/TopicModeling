review/text: I never really thought much one way or the other about tweezers, but after hearing good things about Tweezerman, I thought I'd splurge. They work so well! They effortlessly pick up hairs you can barely see, and since it grasps the hairs well, it doesn't hurt as much as cheaper tweezers.
