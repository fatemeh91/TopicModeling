review/text: Years ago, I did a fairly extensive "taste test" of all of the major protein powders on the market. Every single one disappointed me: they were either too expensive, tasted terrible, didn't mix up well, or usually some combination of all three. This was the first powder I found that would mix perfectly (PERFECTLY) in a simple shaker (no blender needed!), tasted just like chocolate milk (the other flavors are lacking for me), and was very reasonable per scoop. Lately, the price on this has ratcheted higher and higher, but I'm not ready to start hunting for a replacement. It fills me up as a post-workout shake!
