review/text: Had a flare up and ordered this product after reading all the good reviews. It's amazing what you will try when you're in this psuedo state of missery. By the time it arrived I think I was about over the hump and going back the other way. First application was very cool for about 15 seconds. After having it on for about a minute it started itching. After two minutes I had to wipe it off with Tucks pads. Tried it again the next day with the same results. This time I tried to leave it on for over 30 minutes. Could not tolerate the severe itching any longer and had to wash it off in the shower. Days after the application the hemorrhoids got bad again and started going back the other way.Did not notice any pungent smell. Makes me wonder how quality assurance is at the manufacturer. How can some people complain about the smell and mine had no significant odor? This makes me wonder if some people got a &#34;good&#34; batch while myself and others did not.Buy at your own risk. Mine went in the trash.
