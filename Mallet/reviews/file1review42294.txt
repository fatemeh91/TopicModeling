review/text: I bought a small bottle of Source of Life Liquid to give it a try before buying online. I want a liquid version as the pills are difficult for me to swallow and the chewables are not good for the teeth (gummies in particular). As mentioned in other reviews, it is a dark green, thick liquid (like Maalox) and the smell is very strong. It does remind me of a bottle of chewable vitamins though and it tasted like I would imagine a liquid version of the Flintstones vitamins would taste if ground up with a tiny droplet of water(tart). That being said, it is a very strong flavor and the biggest issue I have with it, is the flavor stuck around in my mouth even after drinking water. I kept burping the flavor up too, even 30 minutes after consumption. I don't want to keep tasting it over and over. :P It also didn't sit well on my stomach. I have issues with indigestion and the citric acid/vitamin c feel like it's burning a bit in my stomach. Until I find a better replacement, I think I'll be resorting back to chewables.
