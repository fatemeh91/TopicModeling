review/text: I love this brush. It really is amazing how this product makes cleaning cups, travel mugs, pitchers, tea pots, and so many more items easier to clean. After debating for quite a while I decided to buy it. If you are like me and wondering without kids if you need one of these....you do! Wonderful product. I would buy it again in a heart beat. A nice quality product that will withstand years of cleaning. No more fighting to get the sponge in hard to reach places. ^_^
