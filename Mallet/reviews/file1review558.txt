review/text: I have been using Chitosan since approximately 1994. It is an amazing way of allowing you to indulge in slightly higher fat content foods, such as chocolate or pizza, and still not add fat or pounds to your body. It is made of crustacean shells (totally natural and healthy, unless you are allergic to shell fish), and it works by binding dietary fat in the stomach and carrying it out of the body without allowing the fat to be absorbed. Maximum four capsules per meal recommendation must be observed. As far as I am concerned, it is a product I do not want to be without! I wholeheartedly recommend it for weight management/maintenance. It is not a weight loss product.
