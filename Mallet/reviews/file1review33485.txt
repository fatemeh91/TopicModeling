review/text: My WaterPik was great -- I did not mind the noise and found that I ould contol the twisted coil hose by putting it in a cup between brushes. But the thing quit--just quit. What in the world is going on? Is there any recourse for inferior units like this? I am disgusted with such thinga being foisted on the public. Where is WAterPIk's quality control?
