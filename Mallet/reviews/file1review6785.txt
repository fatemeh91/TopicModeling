review/text: This allows you to access and massage away trigger points (painful knots within muscles) virtually anyplace in your body). That being said, it can be difficult to find the painful trigger point, and often difficult to massage away the pain depending on the trigger point location. For example, anywhere on the thigh can be easy but near the middle of the back around the lower edge of the scapula can be difficult to find and figure out how to massage.The Body Back Buddy allows the application of massage pressure, and leverage virtually anyplace once you learn how for that location.There are books on trigger point massage that would be a very useful supplement to the rather paltry users manual that comes with Body Back Buddy.
