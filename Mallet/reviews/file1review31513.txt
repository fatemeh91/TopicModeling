review/text: If you're hiking or camping, you're probably going to take along a first-aid kit. Since you probably don't know enough to assemble your own, then you're buying a pre-assembled kit. What you should care most about is the contents.If you compare the contents of this kit to others, there's a lot of supplies here for the size and money. I prefer this ultralight/watertight packaging instead of the heavy cordura nylon or plastic cases like you find on other kits. Regardless, I always carry my kit in a zip-loc freezer bag to make sure if doesn't get punctured or wet.The supplies are in two small heavy-duty plastic bags with zip-loc tops inside a light nylon zipper bag. Make sure they're zipped closed and you've burped all the air out of the bags, especially if you're going on an airplane. I would also suggest packaging the various drugs in an additional plastic bag to make sure they're not destroyed in the event of water leakage.Note that this is what I consider to be a comfort-type medical kit, not a hard-core first-aid kit. It's also not for tactical use. There's no huge bandage for large, bloody wounds, there's no splints, burn gel or tourniquet. This will allow you deal with cuts and scrapes and various travel discomfort, more like a well-stocked medicine cabinet at home. There's nothing wrong with this, it's just the limitations of size in a kit like this. You're not going to be doing any emergency surgery.Also, a first-aid kit isn't magic. You still have to know what to do if something goes wrong. Take a wilderness first-aid class from REI or buy a decent book.Only 4 stars because (1) there no first-aid manual and (2) I haven't actually used it yet.
