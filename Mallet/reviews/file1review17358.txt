review/text: This thing is a piece of garbage for two very specific, and complementary, reasons:1) the battery dies after two or three days of sitting (fully charged) if it's not plugged in.2) it does NOT OPERATE ON AC FROM THE OUTLET unless the battery is charged. This means that after it's discharged, you must wait for it to recharge before using it again. I want to jam this things non-functional blades into the throat of every neckbeard that was responsible for saying "yep, seems fine." during the approval process. simultaneously.In summary: the Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer would chuckle at you, if it could hold a charge, while you are forced to leave the house with a half-trimmed whatever it is that is on your face.
