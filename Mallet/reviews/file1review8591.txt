review/text: This is the toothbrush replacement. I used to use old toothbrushes to get the little corners of my sink, shower, toilet that i couldn't reach, but I now only use the OXO Good Grips Grout Brush. This brush has strong bristles that scrub hard to remove nasty gunk from all over. Pair it up with an all purpose cleaner and you'll end up with a clean bathroom.I don't recommend brushing your teeth with this.
