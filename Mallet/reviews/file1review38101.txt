review/text: Nice product but only used 2 weeks. Seems to do the job but long term use will determine if it is a keeper. Purchased because of the organics in it and for dry skin. I still notice my dry skin continues to be incredibly dry and scaly. Maybe that will improve long term but is why it gets only 4 stars.Likely to recommend. Price per size = good value.
