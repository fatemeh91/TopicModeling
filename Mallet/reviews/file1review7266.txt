review/text: I have tried/purchased more that one foot bath spa over the last 2 years looking for relief for my tired and sore feet. I hike a lot during the summer. The is undoubtedly the bast foot bath spa I have ever tried. It actually works as advertised! It heats the water to a comfortable temperature, even if it has cooled down to room temperature! The others simply don't measure up! They DO NOT heat the water and even though they advertise that hot water will stay warm, it does not.The fact that the Brookstone accomodates my size 13's and has a reasonable depth of the water is an added bonus too!
