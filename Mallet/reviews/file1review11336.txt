review/text: I bought one of these for each of my cars "in case of emergency." It's a high-quality kit with everything you need short of a severe trauma situation. The first-aid field guide that comes with it makes it quick and easy to look up various traumas and how to treat them. This kit is a little heavy to take in a backpack or daypack, but great for basecamp or the car. Also, the Adventure Medical Pocket Survival Pack fits nicely inside to round off the kit.
