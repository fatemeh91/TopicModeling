review/text: Three years ago, we re-floored the entire house. We put in wood floors in the living room, bed rooms and hall ways and polished limestone in the kitchen and dining rooms. Rough stonework went into the bathrooms. When the flooring was finished, the installer advised us that special cleaners were needed for these kinds of special floors.Bona Hard Surface Floor Cleaner was advised for the polished limestone floors and we've used it ever since. We've also used it on our polished marble counter tops in the kitchen. I suppose it could be used on many other hard polished surfaces. In any case, we've been quite satisfied with this product. We always take care to see that the floor has been swept or vacuumed first, then we use a flat mop. Bona is sprayed on the floor and then scrubbed with the mop and allowed to dry. It's done quite a nice job and I've learned to us it on the kitchen stove and a number of other places as well. It can be a little hard to find in stores is the only problem, but that's no problem here.Gary Peterson
