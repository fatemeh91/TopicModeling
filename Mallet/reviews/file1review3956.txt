review/text: I love this stuff. My father is from Germany and gave it to me when I was a kid. I started taking it again recently and it has helped with my intestinal problems such as bloating and gas. I love the taste, and it also has helped with my lactose intolerance. I think you have to take it for a long time, like most products that actually cure illnesses instead of just quiet the symptoms. I'll be taking Eugalan for months to come.
