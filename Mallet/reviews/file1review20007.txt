review/text: This tub is great as a space saver!I read a review about the folds snapping and startling her baby... I have not had that problem at all... my son is currently 3 months old. * Yes my son's foot would slide into the side and appear to get stuck when he was very little. I solved this by sticking a dish towel in the corner. He is now 13lb and we do not have that problem anymore.I would highly reccomend this product.
