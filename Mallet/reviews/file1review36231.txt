review/text: I love these tablets but I was surprised to see that a daily dosage is 10 tablets. That means that this bottle only has 10 days worth.I think that's a bit pricey.I have been having 5 tablets in the morning and that seems to work.I'm not sure I will buy this again. Might look for something a little less expensive or in powder form to mix into my morning shake.But the actual product seems good. And 5 tablets seems to be enough for me.
