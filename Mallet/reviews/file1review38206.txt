review/text: My mom got one of these knives years ago when I was just a kid. She had it for years and one day the handle started to crack. She had no idea where to buy another. I was so excited that I was able to find it online and surprise her with it. She is so happy and wants to order many more. She has had arthritis most of my life and this knife has made cooking and eating so much easier for her. Great product.
