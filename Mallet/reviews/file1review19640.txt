review/text: ... TWO YEARS LATER...I still have not regretted my purchase of these 2 seats -- they are still as strong and sturdy and clean as on day one. My daughter is now 4 1/2 and is still very comfortable on them and still uses them every day. My son is now 2 and he uses them and now I'm really thankful for the guard which works really well. Great investment - like I said before, take my advice and make this one your first choice..Finally we have found a sturdy potty seat that snugly fits our elongated toilets. The potty seat has a dial that secures it firmly to your toilet seat, is made of sturdy plastic, and has a guard, and no creases or seams to catch icky, smelly stuff. My daughter is 2 1/2 and loves this seat. She sits on it sometimes for 1/2 hour and sings all the songs she knows - so she is obviously very comfortable on it.Despite the price, we purchased a second one for downstairs and haven't regretted our decision. We will definitly use them when my now 6-month old baby boy's potty-training time comes. My sister laughed that we paid that much for potty seats (she has 2 boys), only to end up purchasing 2 of them herself!! Take my advice and make this one your first choice.
