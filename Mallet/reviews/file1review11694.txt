review/text: I very carefully followed the package instructions when I went to Ireland the summer of 2005 and I felt fine. My 2 companions used nothing and I have to be honest that we all seemed to be fine. Of course, I'm quite a bit older than they are. I'm using it again for my trip to London in December. I don't want to take any chances. They are easy to take and require no drink.
