review/text: The Prolab Pure Whey seems to satisfy everything that an individual is looking for in a protein supplement...nutrition facts that is. Apart from that, the powder tastes rather chalky. Don't even think about mixing it in water with a spoon or nything other than a mixer. I have tried almost every brand out there from EAS to Weider, and this is probably the worst thing. Would NOT recommend it to anyone.
