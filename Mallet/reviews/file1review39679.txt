review/text: After only 4 months my flossaid snapped by the brass rivet , I did write to the manufacturer to complain and I sent them a photo of the broken flossaid but they did not reply. I expected an item that is made in the USA by a an American manufacturer to have some type of gurantee but I was wrong.
