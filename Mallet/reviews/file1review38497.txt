review/text: Owned this unit since October 2006; it died yesterday. WHILE IT WORKED IT WAS GREAT; then a few months ago I lost one side of the epilator. I was just about to order a replacement head when the power base just died. I would've loved to give it 4 or 5 stars, but for the price I expected to get more than 1.5 years out of it. The trimming/shaving attachment was great. My next epilator will be a difference brand. On a personal note, it doesn't hurt that much and you will get used to it. To save that daily stubble feeling it's worth a few pin-pricks and the red marks left immediately after epilating fade within 12 hours; unlike those shaver nicks that take much longer to heal. Do not believe the advertising, you will have to epilate at least weekly depending on your tolerance for hair on your legs, there's just NO way to go 4 weeks. For me the hair seemed to get a little finer and came out easier the more I used it, but it still grows about at the same pace. With the hair being removed from the root, it takes longer to become stubble. Every once in awhile I would shave, which is o.k. in a fix, but it seemed to make the hair grow back faster and thicker; so I avoid it if at all possible. And, lastly, YOU MUST EXFOLIATE or you will have ingrown hairs. I used it on my legs, biniki area, and underarms and had no trouble with any area. I'll be an epilator user for life to save all those nicks, cuts, and razorburn.
