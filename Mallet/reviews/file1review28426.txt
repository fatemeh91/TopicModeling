review/text: I just started recently to weight lift, so I decided to give whey protein a shot. I did a bit of research and ended up with this. Overall its pretty good, doesn't smell too bad, and tastes pretty good. I was actually surprised on how good it tasted, most things I read were about how whey protein tasted bad (well most of it), but this is good.
