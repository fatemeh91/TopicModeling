review/text: Although my 1st review was basically saying how much it hurt and that after I was finally done removing the hair I was very pleased with the results. That was last night when I wrote it, but this morning is a different story. I'm feeling soreness and its still showing redness. Maybe its because I didn't put anything afterwards to soothe the skin after having hair being pulled out like that. I also wanted to mention that during the hair removal process I was bleeding from the hair being riped out. I could have been holding the machine wrong. Nonetheless which ever way I tried to hold it I still bled until I pulled out all the hairs and then it stop. I still like this product and I'm hoping that with more uses the pain will lessen with each hair removal process.
