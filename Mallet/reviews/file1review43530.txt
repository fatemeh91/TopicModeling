review/text: In ordering the product it was listed as being in stock and for a payment of about $13.00 I could have it the next day. As I elected super saving shipping it was not shipped for 8 days. On the interim days I was waiting I was informed I could still get it overnight (so it was still in stock)for a premium payment.This sort of delayed shipping is inexcusable. These vendors should be banned from sites like Amazon.But the product is a nice package, very useful and seems to perform as advertised.Omron HEM-711 DLX Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Comfit Cuff
