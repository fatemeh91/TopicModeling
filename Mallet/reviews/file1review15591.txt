review/text: => Update September 2011:I have to agree with other reviews concerning the decrease in overall effectiveness of this product. I too can correlate the change in effectiveness to the time the company changed the packaging. Instead of getting 5 - 10 days from an application, I now get 3 - 4 days... though this is still better than applying deodorant on a daily basis. My son, who still uses this product, has to now apply it every 1 - 3 days.=> Original review August 2006:I have been using this product for nearly three years now. My son uses it as well. I have found that the length of time between applications seems to be dependent on physical activity and eating healthfully (or not). I also have found that increased water consumption helps increase the length of time between applications. I average 5 - 10 days between applications. My son gets 4 - 7 days out of it but he also indulges in foods that are less healthy :-)I highly recommend this product. It is a healthier alternative to the deodorants with aluminum in them (many deodorants have aluminum as an ingredient). I sincerely hope that this company and product out live me because I would never want to use anything else! I am glad to find that Amazon.com is offering this product at such a great price!
