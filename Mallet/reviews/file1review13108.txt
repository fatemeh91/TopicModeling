review/text: Elasto-gel is so awesome.. i have tried every possible kind of heating pad and it is by far the best combo of comfort, durability and ease. Heat lasts 20-30 min. which is pretty standard. I microwave 45 sec, flip then another 45 sec = perfect heat. It molds to fit neck well, though i'm small and the velcro tab could be larger to accommodate. I'm ordering the headache cap as well, great stuff!
