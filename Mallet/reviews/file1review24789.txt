review/text: I have been using Aleve for couple ears now. Years of ballet dancing caused me to have a bad knee. Some days it's so stiff I can hardly bend it. Two Aleve and the pain is gone, the stiffness is gone. You can take Aleve every 12 hours, but as a rule once a day is enough for me. Only sometimes I wished it worked faster. Finally it does. I cannot recommend this any higher for pain relief. I was on Vioxx for a while, before they found out you could have heart attacks from it. I figured I was doomed to suffering with pain and stiffness. Nope. Aleve works better for me than Vioxx did.The liquid just makes it work faster.
