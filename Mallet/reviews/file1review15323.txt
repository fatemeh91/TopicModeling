review/text: I love this cream. It's so nourishing and pampering. The texture is perfect and smooth and it smells very light and fresh (I don't know where the other person got that its sickening sweet and too strong, they must be extremely sensitive to scents) but overall I love this product. I have bad acne and acne scars and this doesn't break me out and has seemed to help fade my scars. My face always feels really soft and plump in the morning after putting this on at bed time :)
