review/text: I have a condition where my cervix produces negative cells, which is caused by a cervix that is backwards. I cannot get pregnant because my body doesn't always ovulate. I had been told about FertilAid, so I ordered it. Now, I am regular. Every 28 days I have a period. Never fails. I always know when I'm going to start. So...to be cautious, I started FertilAid on the FIRST day that I was not on my period. I only took 2 pills per day instead of the 3. I called my doc because I was peeing out what looked like large flakes of ash. I went in for a test, this was my negative cells dying and coming out. What a great thing! So, after about a week of no more "ash" coming out, I quit taking the pills. 6 weeks later, we were pregnant! I will rely on FA the next time we are TTC. I love it, and we have a healthy 8 month old baby boy. Thank you FertilAid!
