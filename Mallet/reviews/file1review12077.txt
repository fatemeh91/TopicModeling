review/text: I just got these yesterday. I'm not pregnant but I saw on other reviews I could use this as a multivitamin so I am. Also I heard it would help with hair growth so why not try it. Anyway tons of energy! Day one I felt great. Kept thinking I can't wait to take these again. Today I woke up not tired. Which is a miracle to me because I always wake up tired .my mind would be ready to go my body would have different plans lol. Anyway waking up fully energized was crazy to me. Soon as my eyes opened this morning I felt the difference. Love this vitamin. Will continue to use this as my multivitamin. As well as combine it with my hair skin and nails vitamin. Btw they don't smell either . Totally worth it .
