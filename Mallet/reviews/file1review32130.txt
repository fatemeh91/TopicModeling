review/text: I bought a Sante Fe bowl 6 or 8 months ago. It's a nice hand-made bowl. My wife has a variety of "art" vases in our bathroom, and I have no qualms having this bowl out on the counter the mix -- albeit with my razor and badger brush on a drip stand in the bowl.:DThe Sante Fe is right at home.As to function: I love it. I also have several antique shave mugs, and I've got to say that the Sante Fe mug is much better tool for producing a head of lather from shave soap. The "classic" mug design tends to be a little deep for my purposes, since a classic shave-mug's real purpose is to hold a cake of soap and then generate lather on top of the soap. While I like the Colonel Conk shave soaps, esp. the Bay Rum scent, I more freqeuently use either a hard cake shave soap, which comes in it's own bowl (Tabac Original By Maurer & Wirtz For Men. Shaving Soap Bowl 4.4 Ounces), or a tube shave cream (Proraso Classic Shaving Cream With Eucalyptus Oil & Menthol). Since neither option requires that I store any soap in the Sante Fe bowl, I just use the bowl to whip up lather. And it's very well suited to that task: Without a cake of soap in the bowl, the curved side shape does an excellent job of containing the lather as it grows.If I broke mine, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another immediately.
