review/text: I had shingles in '02 it's a disease that has plagued me since that time. when i feel the "tingle" of the shingles coming back and i break out in a hive i immediately use this product and it instantly soothes my skin and while it doesn't take away the hive it makes it more than bearable also it's water based if you keep it a long time and it dries up simply add a little water and it reconstitutes within a day i highly recommend it
