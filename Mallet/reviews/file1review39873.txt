review/text: I had one of these for years and it finally fell apart from frequent use. I was pleased to find them on Amazon and bought this one and a smaller one, the size of a credit card. I use them just about every day. Highly recommended for anyone whose eyes need a little help. Even if your vision is perfect these little magnifiers are handy to read very small type.
