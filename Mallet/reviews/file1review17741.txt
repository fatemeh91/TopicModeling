review/text: This trimmer gives me just the right amount of stubble and is pain free. So far the battery has been holding up well. It even lasts awhile in between charges. I've only had to charge it once since I've owned it. It's adjustable too in case you want to keep your facial hair short and even or have it grow out longer.
