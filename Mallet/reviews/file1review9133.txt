review/text: This 60 day supply is a good deal here and I've tried quite a few. I take it 30-45 minutes after eating once a day and know that I've consumed a very nutrient dense green super food. It does cause some bloating and I haven't figured out the resolve for that yet. This is my last stop for green superfood so I'll continue to reorder at this great price.
