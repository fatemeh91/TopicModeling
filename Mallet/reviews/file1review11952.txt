review/text: I have been taking these vitamins for about 2 years now, They are great. They have good quality ingredients and are gentle on the stomach. Sometimes i have issues with certain vitamins because they just do not sit well in your stomach. I would recommend any of the rainbow light products. My husband takes the Men's Just Once as well and he loves them.
