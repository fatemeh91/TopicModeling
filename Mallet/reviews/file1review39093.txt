review/text: After doing some reasearch online, I concluded that the Wahl 7924 26-Piece Deluxe Hair Clipper Kit was an excellent balance between price and value. Amazon's price was very competitive and they shipped the kit quickly. The clippers are professional quality and perform as advertised. The kit includes many attachments that I do not need, but having them will allow flexibility in future use. The case that is included provides ample storage space to safely store the clippers and all attachments.
