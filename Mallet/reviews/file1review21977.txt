review/text: I am a personal trainer, currently working with a youth soccer team, and I know that that the energy levels of my day are intact with these bars. I am nearly 50, going through menopause, and in need of supplemental calories and energy that will not interfere with my overall shape and endurance. These are the best. Healthy, organic, and easy to ingest on the go... every personal trainer should look into these.
