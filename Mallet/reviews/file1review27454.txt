review/text: Whey is a siginificant source of protein. My son has been a user for over 3 years. He exercises and uses it as a source of protein as he lifts weights sometimes. He states that he fills satisified and not interested in eating junk food. His muscle mass has improved according to him.Whey's claims on the nutritional label appear to be true and effective. My son would recommend Whey for other interested individuals.Great product!Yoli Navarro
