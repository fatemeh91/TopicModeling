review/text: I used them in my Minn Kota Terrova Trolling Motor remote. They work great. There is a difference between the CR2450N and the CR2450 so make sure you get the one that will fit your device. The Terrova remote needs the one with the N on it. The remote only needs one battery so I bought an extra one for a spare. Good batteries!
