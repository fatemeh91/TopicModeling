review/text: I ordered this repellant after returing the Bite Blocker All Natural Insect repellant (from another seller on Amazon.com) due to it's horrible scent. This scent is much better, still not pleasant, but is not offensive at least. It has done well at repelling insects and ticks, so far, though it needs to be reapplied once an hour to be effective. I live in Maine and mosquitoes and insects are my everyday life companions. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an effective replacement for a deet containing product.
