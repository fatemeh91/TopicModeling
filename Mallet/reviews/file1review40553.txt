review/text: Hi, I bought this because my doctor advise me and my daughter to take Cal, mag,zinc supplement. Plus, I was told that magnesium citrate is better absorbed by the body. Only problem I have is that after taking this my teeth felt super sensitive as if I ate lemons or vinegar. Might try taking it with a straw next time. Has anyone else experience this?
