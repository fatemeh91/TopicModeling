review/text: I have been taking this product since June 2009 to help with asthma. I was using (2) steroid inhalers as well as allergy medication and emergency inhalers. I have changed diet and the way I perform my job (lessening stress). Due to lifestyle changes and the help of cordyceps I have been able to back off my steroid inhalers. I do not recommend any changes for those with asthma or other meds without advice from a health care provider. This product has been immensely helpful in the control of asthma and I will continue to use this product.
