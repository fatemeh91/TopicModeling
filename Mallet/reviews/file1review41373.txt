review/text: I was surprised to find that this arch support is simply hard, molded plastic -- no flexibility or cushion whatsoever. It wasn't comfortable, and because the plastic has no grip, it slides around in my shoes. In my opinion, this is not worth the price, I am returning.I've found that Spenco insoles are a great alternative for half the price.
