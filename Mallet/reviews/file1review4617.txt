review/text: I just got this razor today and I love it. I had an old Mach 3 razor, it was good but I needed a new razor.The design of this razor is amazing. The wieght of the Fusion is pretty similar to the Mach 3, unless you have the battery powered one, then I guess it would be heavier. I thought, "5 blades? Are you kidding me...when will it end?" But I swear to you this razor cuts better than any 3 blade razor I've ever used. I also thought that the small razor on the back of the Fusion was pointless, but I was wrong. The small razor is great for side burns and getting small places like under your lip and under your nose.I only nicked myself once, but WOW this is a great razor. I highly recommend the Gillette Fusion.
