review/text: What a total rip off! Took three hours to fully charge the batteries and lasted only 35 minutes in my Canon Powershot SX20IS. Wasted a trip out to the Golden Gate bridge. Cheap drug store name brand Alkaline's lasted far longer. It would be a great product if it delivered on the 3-hour use. Not recommended for anything other than a tv remote. BOOOO! HISSSS! BOOOO! Rip off!
