review/summary: produces weird hair texture review/text: Didn't like this shampoo at all - it didn't make my hair silky or smooth, like the Mink shampoo when I was younger. In fact it made my hair sort of wavy, or more like bent in places. Awful. Silk shampoos are much better (and don't require minks to be killed! hope I don't get any more presents along this line). Try Sleektress by Nexxus instead.
