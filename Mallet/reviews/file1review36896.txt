review/text: We bought it for our 97 year old father who was having trouble getting his socks on because of problems with reaching his feet. It worked well for him. The terry cloth on the outside holds the sock until he pulls it up and his toe hits the end of the sock. Then he can pull the aid out of the sock. He did have to experiment with how far onto the aid to put the sock so that the aid doesn't slip out before the sock is on. If you put the aid too far into the sock, it can be too difficult to get it out of the sock. Used properly it's a handy thing.
