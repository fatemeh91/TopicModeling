review/text: I have only tried 4-5 different types of whey protein shakes, but the double chocolate flavor from Optimum tastes horrible. Typically I don't have a problem drinking whey shakes with only water as a mixer. The first time tasting this protein with only water - I literally had to chug the shake so that I didn't taste it and then run to the fridge to get a chaser to wash the horrible taste out of my mouth.I assume that mixing it with milk will improve the taste some, but I highly doubt it will be improved enough so that I want to actually drink a shake after a workout. In summary, while this might be a great deal on good protein, the taste is so bad that I am probably going to just throw out the 5lb container after only using one scoop....totally not worth the money.
