review/text: I purchase this product because I was having a sever mice issue. I was catching them 2 and 3 at time every other day. That is too much. I have plug up the hole and they still seems to get through. I have to two children and worry about them getting bitten. So far since using the product I have not seen any mice activities within my apartment. I even put some of the dogs food on the floor and let it sit overnight just to see and there was non.I am very happy with this product and it was worth the money. Because it has only been several weeks, I want to see how long this product last - that is my concern now.
