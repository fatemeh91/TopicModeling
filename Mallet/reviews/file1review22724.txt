review/text: LOL.. I got all amped up.. bought them. Came in the mail. Took them for 2 days (withought taking the stimulants..) I stopped taking them before day 3.. I just started feeling like crap.. After I stopped taking them, I actually lost 12 LBS in 2 weeks just by portion control and a good diet. And working out ofcourse.. I would say normal people wouldn't need to bother taking this. probably just body builders trying to cut down before shows.. Regular healthy people should just eat a balanced diet and they would most likely see the results they want.
