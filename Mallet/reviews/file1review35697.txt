review/text: like that they are homeopathic and seem to work as good/slightly better than many others.do not burn like some brands and a little thicker consistency that stays nicer on the eyeball.This one also has the added benefit of reducing/eliminating the redness on my eyelids and lubricating/moisturizing so they do not burn. for that reason it stands above the rest.
