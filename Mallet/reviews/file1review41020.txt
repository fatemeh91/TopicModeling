review/text: My first encounter with Redline was in a mini-mart at a gas station. And when I say you might die, I mean it. I was working a patrol security graveyard shift during the Indian Summer in California, only able to get 2 hours of sleep a day because of the heat an a lack of air conditioning in my apartment at the time.After 10 different energy drinks I was still falling asleep at the wheel. It was only that moment of anxiety after I blacked out and ended up 3 miles past where I had intended to go that drove me to try this drink.I only had half of the bottle when I bought it...but it's unlike anything I'd had before or since. I could feel my heart pounding harder, my hands began shaking, irises restricted, the damn thing kicked me from asleep at the wheel to incapable of sleeping for the next 6 hours. I had the other half of the drink before my shift ended. Bad idea. I think I may have had a small heart attack.Most awesome energy drink EVER.
