review/text: I really like the lens tissues. I've used them on my glasses and the TVs. They work great! They come individually wrapped so it's easy to throw one in your purse or bag and carry it with you everywhere. Once you use them they dry quickly so there's no smudges. They made my glasses so clean I almost forgot I was wearing them. I only wish they were bigger so I could use them on more things around the house!
