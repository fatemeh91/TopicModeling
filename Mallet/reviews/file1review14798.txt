review/text: I used to take these regularly a few years back. I had trouble finding this brand and they were hard to swallow anyway so I found something else. I like this mix of B with calcium and magnesium so when I ran accross them at Amazon, tried them again.But now 4 or 5 years later, I can hardly swallow them at all. So I grind them with my flax seed for my morning smoothie or in a mortar and pestle and add them to yogurt.So they're big but they have good stuff in them.
