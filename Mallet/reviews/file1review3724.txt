review/text: This is an ineffective, filler-packed, cheap substitute for Oxy-powder (sold right here on amazon). I love oxy-powder and decided to try MagO because it was SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE... BUT that's because it's junk (literally - mostly starch)! Save yourself the time and hassle of having to return this (like I had to do), and go straight for what works. And for those of you concerned about some of the poor reviews of oxy-powder, here's more info: The manufacturer of oxy-powder told me that they are in legal proceedings with company that copied their label and put in on a fake substitute, which was sold on amazon (at about half the price) for a while. So if someone purchased oxy-powder at a super low price, it was likely the fake. Hopefully, the label is no longer being copied, so sticking with the oxy-powder label should be safe.
