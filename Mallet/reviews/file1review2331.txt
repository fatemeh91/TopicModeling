review/text: I had dry eye problems that caused filamentary keratitis (little tunnels from the surface of my eye inwards), after having them removed (painfully) several times I went to a different doctor that suggested I try Theratears Omega-3. They are a bit pricey (check your local Walgreens and keep the coupon for a $1 off that comes inside the box) but they are the only thing that have worked for me.I tried switching a few times to other brands that costs less and I immediately noticed a difference. The Omega-3's also seem to help with mood and joint pain. If you have stomach problems taking them at first just start with one pill at night and after a week go to two, and after another week 3. You can also split up the doses though I don't recommend 3 a day at first unless you are already on Omega-3s.I felt such a difference after a few weeks of taking these that I found a reputable supplier of childrens chewable Omega-3s for my son!
