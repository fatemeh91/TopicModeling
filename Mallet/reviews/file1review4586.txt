review/text: Let's get this straight from the beginning: I hate shaving. I have a very thick beard that grows very fast -- if I shave first thing in the morning, I actually need a shave again by 5 o'clock. And I have to go over every area at least twice to get a close shave. I spend an inordinate amount of time doing something that I hate. So, I will gladly try any new product that promises to make shaving a bit easier.With five blades, the Fusion looked to be the holy grail of shaving. I've been using a Mach 3 for years, and it works better than just about anything else (though my Panasonic linear electric is great in its own right). I figured if three blades are good, five should be better. Right?Well, unfortunately not. The five blades on the Fusion are on a head about the same size as the Mach 3, which only has three blades. This means the blades on the Fusion are much closer together, which Gillette says will give you a closer shave. This might be true for average beards, but if you have a thick beard, the blades are actually TOO close together. I find that the Fusion just kind of skips over my whiskers without cutting, especially if I shave with the grain. So, I actually have to spend a longer time shaving with the Fusion than I did with the Mach 3, and I have to go against the grain more often. I've switched back to the Mach 3.However, one thing I really do like on the Fusion is the single blade on the back. That is really excellent for shaving those hard to reach areas under the nose, and for straightening out sideburns. I just hope they come out with a Fusion Platinum Edition or something, with a bigger razor head that spreads the blades out a bit more.
