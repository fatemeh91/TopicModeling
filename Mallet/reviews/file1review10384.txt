review/text: though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed. i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results. the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes. still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck. i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did
