review/text: Maybe it's because I usually have really rough sex or maybe my guy is really big, but these got very uncomfortable for me. Even when I was very aroused, the condom dried me out and caused quite a bit of discomfort. It didn't break, so I guess that's a plus. These condoms would definitely be best for a man of average girth. If you're really thick, don't get them. Just fyi :)
