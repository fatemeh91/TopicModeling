review/text: I was tired of the uncertainty of several electronic scales I used, and wanted to get back to something that was mechanical and certain. And made in the USA. Thus the Detecto 337. I purchased it through Amazon.com (and their agent, Wholesale Point). When I got it, I failed to examine closely one aspect of the assembly, and as a result, mangled the "draft rod" ... both Detecto (thanks, Charlie!) and Wholesale Point (thanks, Lisa!) were very responsive, and in relatively short order I received a new part and got the scale assembled. One neat thing I discovered is that on the Detecto.com website they have a video from the "How it is Made" TV series, and you can actually view a #337 being manufactured and calibrated. And, it is made in Web City MO ... outstanding product!!
