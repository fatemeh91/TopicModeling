review/text: I have been using Emergen-C for years now and have tried other flavors but have been coming back to orange as my favorite. It is easy and quick to take and taste good as well.I will drink Emergen-C along with your classic immune boosters whenever I feel a sickness coming on -Good N' Natural Olive Leaf Extract + FREE Echinacea Goldenseal Drops (Alcohol Free - 1 oz.). I've been following this routine in recent years and for the most part, it keeps me from getting sick when it gets cold outside.I know not everyone like the taste of the Emergen-C but for me personally, I love it, and if it can boost my immune system get my body some extra vitamin C, then I'm all for it.
