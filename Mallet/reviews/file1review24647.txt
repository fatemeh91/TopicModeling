review/text: I was able to lose 30 lbs and keep it off with Zantrex. It IS caffine so what do you expect it to do to your system? And I dont think it is fair that it got a bad review just becasue someone was allergic to it!It helps give me that boost I need to workout and keep my apetite under control. It is not a miracle pill and you have to work hard but it does give you that added support whether physically or just mentally.
