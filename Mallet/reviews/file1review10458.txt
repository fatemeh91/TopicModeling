review/text: These are great. I don't use them often but they are the ONLY Tums I have ever been able to handle the taste of. The chocolate flavor IS a fake taste but it's not sickening and doesn't have an aftertaste. These get the job done for those with mild heartburn. I just wish I could find them in stores, instead my husband and I scouted everywhere for them to no avail and the price here's a bit steep (but we decided it's worth it for an infrequent use item).
