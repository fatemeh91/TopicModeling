review/text: I wish I had found this months ago, this is the 3rd potty seat that we have tried and the only one that my son will sit on for longer than a few minutes, he will sit on it and read books while trying to go potty. It fits snugly on our toilets. The price is high but well worth it, I have bought a second for our upstairs bathroom. Highly recommended!
