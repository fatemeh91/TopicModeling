review/text: This cream goes on smoothly, is absorbed quickly, not slimy, greasy, or cakey. Leaves skin feeling silky. The lavender scent is mild and pleasant (even to my husband's very sensitive nose). Love the premeasured pump - at a very good price, especially with Amazon's auto-ship. This product is effective for me in reducing hot flash severity and frequency.
