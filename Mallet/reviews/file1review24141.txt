review/text: I bought this watch for my sister and she has been using it for about a year. I've had to reset the time and then re-synchronize the voice at least 4 times. Also, my sister is cognitively limited and the watch has way too many buttons that can be pushed by accident. When she bends her wrist up it pushes the buttons. I'd like to replace it but don't see a better option as of yet.
