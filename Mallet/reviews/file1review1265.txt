review/text: These are best for quickly removing those tiny hairs that are super annoying to & impossible to pluck with tweezers. While you won't get every hair (you might have to do the same area twice to get some missed hairs), they are a much cheaper alternative to a pricy salon. My main gripe with these is that they leave an impossible amount of residue which can only be taken off with special oil (like Azulene). Overall, not too shabby for the price.
