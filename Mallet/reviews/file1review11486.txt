review/text: Purchased Model T765 because of prior experience with Model T860 by same manufacturer. Love the built-in adjustability without changing attachment shoes. So far the only difference that I can see between the old and new are in the charger, and not the trimmer. The only draw back that I can see is that rechargable batteries are not user replacable, nor were they on the old T860. I believe it's called planned obsolesence. To send unit end for battery replacement costs more than outright new replacement, hence the reason for the purchase of the new T765.
