review/text: That is truly the key to successful weight loss. I decided to take these as a supplement to se if they enhanced my performance (I exercise regularly and eat healthfully). I honestly can't tell if they helped, but I can say that after a few months of taking these pills I began to suffer from the most painful pressure headaches that would last anywhere from 2-8 hours. Essentially all this pill has to offer is sleepless nights, painful headaches and minimal if any healthy weight loss. Skip them in favor of a nice brisk walk around the block every day!
