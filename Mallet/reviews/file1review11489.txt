review/text: I have tried other trimmers, and I keep coming back to Norelco as being able to provide a basic trimmer that does exactly that - trims well. I don't have to spend 10 minutes going over the same spot to catch all of the hair I missed the first or second time like other trimmers that I have tried. I would have given it 5 stars, but when I held it in my hand, it feels like the material is not the highest quality (i.e.; the feel, look and weight of it were just off in my opinion).
