review/text: This beard trimmer seemed great when I first purchased it, and the price was perfect. After a couple uses I even bought a second one to keep in my travel bag. Within a few weeks, however, I realized this was a mistake. The batteries in both trimmers has quickly become useless, barely holding a charge for a full beard trim even if you keep it plugged in full time. This is a pathetic product and I find it disgraceful that they still sell it.
