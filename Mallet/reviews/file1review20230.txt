review/text: I received these as a gift along with lots of other more traditional burp cloths and the cloth diapers with thicker centers. I inadvertently returned the ones with the thicker centers by mistake. I must say it was the best mistake I've ever made. My son is 8 months old and we use these every single day. Drooly chin, spit up, peek-a-boo, you name it. We carry them everywhere and he loves to cuddle with them. It is so much better than a lovey because we can replace and wash all we want and he always has another. I use dressier, nicer burp cloths just for looks at church and things, but this cloth is our #1 buddy wherever we go.
