review/text: I've been using this stuff for 3 years. I love it! I don't know what the last reviewer did wrong, but this stuff mixes awesome. I put the stuff in a mixer with water and shake it for a few seconds and viola! Instant drink--no clumps. As far as taste goes it's pretty darn good for an all natural, no additives drink. I don't want a lot of junk added to my whey--give it to me all natural. Bioplex makes a good mix. That last reviewer doesn't know what he's talking about.
