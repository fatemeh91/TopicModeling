review/text: My husband was diagnosed with low sperm count and low motility due to being anemic. He was put on iron supplements and we were able to conceive after 4 months, but unfortunately we suffered a miscarriage during the early part of the pregnancy. I searched the inter-net to find a product that would increase his sperm count as well as allow for the production of healthy viable sperm. A month later we went for another sperm analysis and the Doctor told us his sperm count had increased dramatically and we should have no trouble with trying to conceive again. I'm sure his anemia was helped out by the iron supplements but I strongly believe that the fertility blend played a big impact in getting his sperm count up there. We are still trying to conceive as I type this (he has been taking the supplements for the past 2 months)and I feel more confident that we will get pregnant this month with the help of fertility blend and the OV watch.
