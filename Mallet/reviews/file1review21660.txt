review/text: We bought the Snug-Tub when our daughter was 7 months old and are still using it. She is now 19 months old and there is still plenty of room for her. The padded sides make her (and us!) feel very secure and rinsing her hair is much easier using the headrest. The tub has stayed inflated from the first time we used it - we haven't ever had to blow it up again. The attached suction cup makes it secure when in use and when you are finished, you just hang it up to dry. We haven't had any problems with mold/mildew as it dries very quickly.
