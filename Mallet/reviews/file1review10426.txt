review/text: Vendor provided great shipping, but the product doesn't do what I wanted.Bristles are still too flimsy - not actually firm enough to thoughly clean.The bristles are too tall and that's the problem. Also I didn't like the large square head of the brush.It's just an old standard toothbrush.. nothing special. I wanted one that really was firm. This is medium.You get what you pay for - price is 1/3 that of the other firm toothbrushes.I don't use it though, so it's not worth anything.
