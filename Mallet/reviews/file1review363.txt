review/text: I have tried rabbit toys in the past and they have all been great, so I was very excited to try this product. I got it in the mail, put batteries in it, and... it wouldn't turn on. I wish I had read the reviews on this more carefully before buying this, as I see now that a lot of other people have had this issue. I really hope I can return it. Don't waste your money- if you want a rabbit, you might as well buy a real good quality one so you don't waste your money like I did.
