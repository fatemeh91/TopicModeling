review/text: I grab a Clif Bar on my way to work every morning. As such, I tend to choose more fruit based bars and not the chocolate ones. (Black Cherry Almond is still the best flavor) When I first saw the Banana Bread flavor, I thought it would be a perfect day-starter flavor, especially as someone who likes banana bread. Unfortunately, they taste like they were made from rotten bananas. There was something not quite right about the banana flavor. I'd send them back to kitchen to tweak the formula.
