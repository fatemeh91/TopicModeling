review/text: I was a sun worshipper for a long time before I got smart about sunscreen, and when I found this product on Amazon at such a good price, it seemed like a good opportunity to test dermatologists' theory that using a 20% glycolic acid cream is a hedge against skin cancer. This one is easy to use, it doesn't burn or cause itching, and it's not at all greasy. I use it 3 times a week and only at night, and I'm extra careful about using a sunscreen during the day because the glycolic acid makes the skin sensitive to sun damage. Use this cream only if, as a general rule, you are careful about sun exposure.
