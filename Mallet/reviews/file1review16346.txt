review/text: In the past few years we have been using these with our dishwasher. These are great. no fiddling with soap, no mess. just open the packet and put the tablet in the soap tray.They seem to have no problem with normal loads. They clean everything we throw at it. We also didn't have any problem with the orange scent. My wife is very particular with funny smells and there was no issue with these.Another nice thing is there isn't any soap residue left when the load is done. I really can't recommend these enough.The only downside, if you would call it that, is 1 tablet is 1 load. You can't really break off pieces to get more out of it. So if you buy 20 tablets you are only getting 20 loads. For most if not all buyers, this is no big deal. But if you run smaller loads or like to use less to save money, be aware.Ultimately, the Finish powerballs are the only way we buy soap for our dishwasher.... and currently I don't think there is any competition.
