review/text: When I saw such mixed reviews about the pain factor, I was a little hesitant. But I got it and I'm so glad. It really isn't painful. Anyone who has ever tweezed or waxed can handle it. It does create a tingly pulling sensation the first time. But nothing that made me feel I couldn't continue to use it. For subsequent uses, no discomfort at all. And I felt the pain reducing nubby thing only increased discomfort and decreased the speed. No problem with ingrown hairs-I just continue to use my "puff" in the shower. Even use it on my underarms. Now that was pretty uncomfortable the first time-good thing it is a small area! All subsequent uses, no problem. Would definitely recommend to others. Still shave occasionally but that is to get that ultra smooth feel. Otherwise, the little bit of hairs left certainly can't be seen. P.S. No Bactine or Alcohol needed! Have fun and enjoy it!
