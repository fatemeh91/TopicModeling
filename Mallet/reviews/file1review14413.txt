review/text: I read as many reviews as I could about this product before I purchased it. MotionEaze claimed to be all natural with no side effects.I bought 2 bottles just in case. I barely needed one. Several people on our cruise, who were experiencing motion sickness used this product, and found it to work very well.I used it on the plane, ship, and our excursions. I never experienced motion sickness once. The smell is a bit strong, but other than that, it works like a charm!
