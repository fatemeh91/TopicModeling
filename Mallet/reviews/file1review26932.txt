review/text: I had bought this flavor in the 2 pound tub just to try it out. I've always been a fan of OP Whey products where I usually stick with the double chocolate flavor. I tried the Banana Cream and it is a bit too sweet and the powder seems to be more clumpy and stuck together compared to the other flavors.As far as the whey powder itself goes, it's great! It mixes well and tastes great with skim milk or regular whole milk if you like the thickness and calories. It provides the protein needed without much extra fillings or sweeteners. If you're trying OP Whey for the first time I definitely recommend the double chocolate as that is probably their best flavor. I probably wouldn't go back to the Banana Cream flavor in the future.
