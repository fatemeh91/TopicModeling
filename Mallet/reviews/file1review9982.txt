review/text: I guess this is a case of getting what you pay for. Since I started dieting, I've wanted to track my measurements and body fat, so I got the fat calipers and measuring tape.The fat calipers don't seem particularly accurate. Measurements taken minutes apart are very different, and, if you don't have a lot of fat in an area, it's almost impossible to pinch up an accurate measurement.As far as the tape measure goes, save some money and just get one from a variety store. It's very awkward to try and position and close, and, by the time you're done, you'd have been able to do the same thing better and cheaper with an ordinary tape from any sewing basket.If you really want to track this stuff, kick in the bucks to get something good, or use household measurements.
