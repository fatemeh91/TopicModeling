review/text: Salicylic acid is widely recognized as one of the best ways to safely remove warts. There are face masks used in beauty salons that are 30% salicylic acid, so this stuff really isn't dangerous at all. I had a wart on my toe. It slightly stung, like hydrogen peroxide would. It took multiple applications over a week or so. At first the wart puffed up, the skin opened up a bit, and then it died. I used it after showers so my skin would be soft and the salicylic acid could be absorbed. 40% is the highest percent you can get without a prescription I think.
