review/text: I have tried several differnt water massagers lately. This is by far the best. Keeps the water heated very nicely and fast too. The aqua jets are great, could be a little harder for my personal taste. I have lots of knots on the bottom of my feet and the massager is working very well at getting them out. My feet feel so much better since I started using it.
