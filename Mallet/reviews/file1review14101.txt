review/text: My son has been on Elecare for 5 months. He is allergic to everything but this formula. This is the one product that he can consume without getting rashes. Well worth the money. The formula smells really bad but he seems to like the taste so, really, I guess it doesn't matter what I think of the smell.The only concern that I would like to voice is that you should order the Elecare WELL in advance of when you think you are going to need it. I ordered it with 3-5 day delivery from Amazon and have now waited over 20 days. I had 5 cans at the time of the order which was certainly enough for 2 weeks. They changed the delivery timeframe on their website but did not bother to tell me. I called after waiting about 10 days and they informed me that it was back ordered. I again waited to that last day of their estimated delivery date and it did not arrive. I searched for the product on Amazon and surprisingly Elecare was not even listed on the website. At this point I was very frustrated and called back. They couldnt tell me when it was going to arrive. I cancelled the order. Now Elecare is listed on Amazon again but I cant take the chance and run out when they don't get it to me.
