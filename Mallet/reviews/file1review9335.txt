review/text: The Apex Pocket Med Pack with 7 Day Tray solved the dilemma I was facing regarding my wonderful mother pill taking regime. Mama is complicated in just about anything she does and had accumulated many different pill dispensers, but for some reason or the other she would still carry one or two loose pills to her room for later consumption. The dispensers she had where okey, in principle, but the Apex solved the dilemma of her having to transport pills here and there around the house. Now she takes the corresponding day container and makes sure AM are finished by 1 PM and PM before night-night. Plus the added convenience to be able to take them as needed to restaurants, theaters, etc and even to week long stays at Hotels (Mama is a Big Hotel goer, Big Buffet eater and Chocolate Guzzler, but that I am sure is another story and not up for further review) so now she can easily keep up with her well established regime, wether stationary or on the road, with the help of the Apex Pocket Med Pack with 7 Day Tray. My only complaint and minor at that, is that the actual tray is very flimsy and does not really secure the containers all that well, but since she is not planning on using it like Maracas I guess they will have to do. 4 Stars and May 2008 bring all the Happiness that the People of this Great Country Surely Deserve!
