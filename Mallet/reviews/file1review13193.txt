review/text: This is a great sheet protector, well made and durable, stands up to regular washing not delicate. Thicker than protectors sold at discount chains, does what it claims.Update - after about 1 and 1/2 years this is still going strong with no real signs of wear, the only thing worn is the tag after washing almost daily. Would give this six stars, very good product.
