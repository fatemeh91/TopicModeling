review/text: The cord is a cheap deal you have to unwind each time - not the curly kind.The battery does not last long, and when it does die, it dies all of a sudden, without warning and you can't use it while it's plugged in.It's pretty noisy, noisiest i've ever owned.Yes, it works, but really, i wish i hadn't bought this thing. It's not a rip off, it's cheap, and you get what you pay for so if you're broke, i understand, i am too and it's why i bought it but now i regret it and wish i'd just man'd up and dropped more ona better one, of course can't find one made in Germany or USA anymore, all heco in china which means they have useless chinese batteries in them.
