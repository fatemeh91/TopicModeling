review/text: I purchased these but embarrassingly enough, I am pregnant and my nipples have started to leak frequently. I got these pads to help. They are extremely soft on the cotton side and I can hardly feel them when they are on. On the plus, it makes my chest look a tad bit bigger. :)Have yet to wash these, but I'm sure everything should work out ok as it comes with a bag specifically for them. Thanks for saving me from embarrassing wet stains on my shirt.!!
