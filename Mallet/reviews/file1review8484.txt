review/text: This brush is GREAT! It's long enough for me to clean my 40 ounce LL Bean metal water bottle, and my Nalgenes, and my Polar insulated water bottles. The brush really helps me get all of the gunk and deposits built up in my bottles. The brush also seems high quality, and looks as if it will last me for a while.
