review/text: Have used foot bath for 2 weeks. My feet love it! Although water should be fairly warm when you put it in - the heater does keep it warm. Not so good on heating it up if you only put in lukewarm water. Pumice stone and rollers were Not in the box when received - but the company sent them right out. Water will splash a little bit if water level too full OR you put your feet in the way of the pulsing water. Good for big feet too - my son wears size 13 and he loves it too!
