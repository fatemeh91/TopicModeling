review/text: This was recommended by an ayurvedic doctor to use on a skin condition, so I researched it a little more. He carried the Banyan Botanicals brand. After reading all the reviews on amazon of a more pure neem oil--everyone complained of the horrific smell--I ordered this sesame seed with neem oil version. I can safely say I can use this product without the whole world covering their nose. There is enough neem oil to help skin issues and not stinking to high heavens. The sesame oil is a nice carrier for the neem oil.If you are waffling over buying a watered down version, read all the reviews on plain old neem oil and see if you find anyone who likes or tolerated the smell for any length of time. The Banyan Botanicals version has helped my skin issue and I will continue using it.Only ding on stars is the bottle dribbles no matter how I pour or squeeze, so counter always has an oil ring. Otherwise I love this stuff.
