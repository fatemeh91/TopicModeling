review/text: This bug spray works decently, considering my situation. I am a mosquito magnet and my house has standing water behind it (drainage creek, have no control over it), so the two combined make it hard for me not to get bitten. Last year I tried California Baby on myself and my son and it was as if we were not wearing any bug spray at all. This year, I decided to try this and it is a marked improvement. I still get bites here and there, probably because I didn't cover myself well enough. I am glad to have a safe alternative to deet that works fairly well, although not perfectly.
