review/text: I recomend this self massger over some of the others available because of the extra knobs on the unit. I am a former massage therapist and know the proper way and place to put pressure. This does not come with any directions on how to use it, you just have to experiment with it and figure out what feels good. It does get to spots you can't get to on your own normaly if you don't have some one to massage your back for you. It also feels really good on the feet. There are two kind of knobs on this one is round and one has a sharper point to get more intense pressure. I gave it a 4 and not a 5 stars because it doesn't come with any directions. A video would be even better.
