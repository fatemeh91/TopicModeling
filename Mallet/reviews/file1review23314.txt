review/text: This product works great for those little clean up jobs from tracked in bits of dirt that always seem to drop off shoes when coming in from outside and other small messes like crumbs in the kitchen or dining room. It is lightweight, handy, does a great job picking up, and is much much easier than dragging out the vacuum cleaner. It was inexpensive, assembled in a flash, and takes up little room in the cleaning closet. I'd recommend it to anyone.
