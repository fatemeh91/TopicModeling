review/text: I like Earth Shoes because the heel is lower than the instep and it makes your posture better when you walk. I had a great pair of shoes that weren't Earth shoes and so I got these insoles and they work great. Now I am not limited to the Earth shoe styles. I was hoping they would fit into narrower walking shoes (like ferragamo) but they don't. Use them for athletic shoes and walking shoes. I use them in Mephistos and LL Bean shoes and I am buying more of them. You should gradually get used to them because they position your weight differently and can cause muscle pain at first but since I was used to Earth Shoes, I didn't have to get used to them at all. Great product. I've been looking for something like this.
