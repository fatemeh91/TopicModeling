review/text: I keep this toilet seat in my son's bathroom along with the Bjorn step stool. My son loves using the potty with this seat! The simple design makes it easy to clean and use. I also took a plastic over the door towel hook and hung it from under the tank of our toilet (on the side). This works perfectly to hang the seat by its plastic handle when not in use.
