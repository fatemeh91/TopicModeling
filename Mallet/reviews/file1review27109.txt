review/text: I've used this for 5 weeks, 3 times/day with total whey intake approximately 0.7-1 gram per lb of body weight. I could go on and on about this product with technical details, comparative analysis and discussions of the pros and cons. Instead, I will put it in what I think are the terms that matter most to people looking to use this product. Remember, everyone's physique is different and I have a fairly intense workout and diet regimen so your results may vary dramatically. No, I am not affiliated with the maker of this product or Amazon or any muscle magazine or whatever. I don't know if other shakes would give the same results since I don't plan to switch.1. I rarely if ever feel sore when I wake up the next morning2. My muscles have grown visibly and are measurably stronger. My bench press and lat pulldown have increased by 20 lbs each3. My new pants fit and my old pants are loose.4. I can wear form-fitting T-shirts without fear of being like the fat guy in a speedo on the beach.5. Women who would blow me off are now giving me their business cards and phone numbers.6. The End.
