review/text: Indeed.... my mouth feels so clean after that.Many previous reviewers have indicated the wonders of this product. I can add on by saying why I chose this over Sonic Care.Essentially, like many others, I was deciding between Sonic Care and this Oral B since they are both king of toohbrushes, and both got rave reviews. But I bought this in the end, after researching and finding out that this supports dual voltage - that way, I can use it in UK and the commonwealth countries, while Sonic Care does not (the last time I checked.)But I highly recommend getting either e-toothbrush... indeed it's the best $100 most value added thing I could spend for myself!
