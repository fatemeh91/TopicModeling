review/text: WARNING: DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. YOU WILL GET 100 DUREX CONDOMS, WHICH YOU CAN BUY FOR 10 DOLLARS AT COSTCO. THERE IS NO VARIETY WHATSOEVER I AM FILING A CLAIM TO GET MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE I FEEL I GOT RIPPED OFF. THE GOOD COMMENTS ARE PROBABLY FAKES, MADE BY THE SELLER THEMSELVES. I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS. YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! YOU WILL NOT GET ANY VARIETY! AWFUL.WHAT I AM ANGRY ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT THEY ADVERTISED A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS, OR AS THEY PUT IT "100 Condoms Variety Pack : CondomMan's Collection of the World's Best Condoms." WHAT A JOKE, YOU WILL RECEIVE ONLY DUREX BRAND CONDOMS. I AM FILING A CLAIM, BECAUSE THE ITEM IS NOT AS DESCRIBED BY THE SELLER. AGAIN, YOU WILL GET RIPPED OFF.
