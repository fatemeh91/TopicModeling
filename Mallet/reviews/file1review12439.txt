review/text: Why don't you people consider putting a lid on this product, literally. The last two to three times I've bought it, it was never sprayed ONCE before it hit the ground thanks to my puppy and the flimsy sprayer top busted and rendered it completely useless. I can't tell you how many bottles I've put in the trash unused in the past few months. It was recommended that I use this product to defend my miniature dachshund from bully breeds on walks due to its spraying capacity of 20+ feet. I have probably bought it 5-7 times in the last three months and have not used it a single time for its actual purpose, but have had it busted before it could be of any use, thanks to a very enthusiastic puppy and your product not having a proper lid on it. Soon I'm going to upload a video showing just how easy it is to bust the sprayer on this and that includes dropping the can on its side and not even remotely impacting the sprayer directly. I hope you're paying your product packaging people what they seem to be worth, advising you to *not* put a lid on it, therefore ensuring (apparently) much more profit. Anybody else who has had the same problem, please respond to this review.
