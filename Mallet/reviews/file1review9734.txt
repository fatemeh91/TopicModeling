review/text: I disagree with previous review!!I am a home preschool and a mother of two so it is very important to me that I have a good lock I can trust.These locks are impossible for a child to open.Once you get in the habbit of having to unlock the cabinet each time I found these to be a breeze, you unlock it so easily and quickly its just the same as if it were never there. Keep in mind I have had these locks for about 3 years now, I have them on every double door cabinet in the entire home.The same locks as well have lasted 3 years going on 4..so they are very durrable and long lasting.I would like to note that as with MOST child safety locks when my children turned about 5 they did figure how to unlock them,of course by that age they figure out everything but by that age they knew NOT to go into the cabinet because they were old enough to understand why, so depending on what was in the cabinet..If this is to lock up something VERY dangerous, sharp tools..etc and you only have older children...not recomended. But for babies, and toddlers up to age 5..this will work wonders.I am actually going to be buying more right now while on Amazon : ) we purchased added storage for the home and I need more of this wonderful lock.
