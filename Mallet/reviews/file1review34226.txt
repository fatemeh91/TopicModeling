review/text: Ok, First of all this stuff does have a weird smell, kind of like flowers and dirt, not offensive, just odd. I have no idea what all they put in it, but it WORKS! I have been having problems with bleeding hemmies, for over a year now, tried all the typical stuff, Prep H, suppositories, ointments, creams, you name it, sometimes the stuff worked a little, but not for long. Now this stuff is a totally different story. The first time I put it on, my hemmies were about the size of my thumb, the cream BURNED, but I kept telling myself that if it didn't let up, I'd wash it off, after about 7 minutes the burn was gone, leaving a tingling, I went to bed. The next morning, my hemmies were less than half the size. I used the ointment again & went to work. By that evening, they were pea sized, and had pretty much disappeared by morning. I continued using the ointment a couple of days, then stopped. After a couple days, my hemmie came back, but much smaller this time. I am continuing to use the ointment at night with great results. TRY IT, remember, it may burn the first couple of times you use it, but that is a small price to pay to be rid of the pain, bleeding & itching.
