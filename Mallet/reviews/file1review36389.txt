review/text: Decent mirror. I don't use the stand since the angle doesn't work for my bathroom. For the 10x side to work, you have to bring it real close to your face. I just end up using it as a basic hand mirror with the 1x side. And yeah, those lights are tiny, so don't think of them as a factor when deciding whether to buy this or not.
