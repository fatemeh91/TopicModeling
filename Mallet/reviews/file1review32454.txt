review/text: we like this bag quite a bit and i feel like it has saved us a ton of money because when my friend and i go to the zoo (at least 8-9 times a year for an all-day trip) she spends at least 20 bucks on food and drink for her and her two year old. whereas my two year old and i eat out of our cooler bag and it costs maybe 2.50 from home? it was kind of hard to attach, but we store it seperate from the stroller so we can keep it packed and in the fridge to grab on the way out the door. you can't fill it completely with drinks, because if you do, it puts a ton of pressure on the underneath basket and it pushes the basket to rub on the front wheel. i was upset when i learned that, but once i learned that i just had to change the weight distribution of the basket and the cooler, all was well. we usually put a bottle of water and a sub, 2-3 pks of fruit snacks, a juice box, an apple/banana, and a thing of pudding and a thing of yogurt in there. as you can see, it holds a lot if you pack it correctly! it has saved us at least a hundred bucks just in the 6 zoo trips we have used it for. we will also use it for disney, the museums, aquaiums, exc, its very useful. it is not as large as some people, but i have no trouble packing meals for my husband, myself, and our baby for lunch if i don't pack the drinks in there. i also use the parent console to hold drinks, the insulated spot helps. overall, kind of pricy for a little cooler, but it does a great job and serves its purpose. i anticipate it driving up the resale value of my stroller when we need to move up to a double, if i don't transfer it to a new one.
