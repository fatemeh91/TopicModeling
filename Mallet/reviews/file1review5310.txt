review/text: These candies are spicy like cinnimon, but of course don't taste like cinnimon. Not quite as intense as a spicy cinnimon candy either. I got them because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea. They do take the edge off! One thing that bummed me out was I found 2 wrappers that were sealed up with no candy inside. Other than that, they are ok. Not something I would eat all the time, but it does help take the edge off my nausea. I would reccommend to other pregnant women!
