review/text: Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In GermanyI read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. My wife had complained that my beard was like sandpaper. I got a shaving brush,shaving soap, and used my Safety Razor which worked but still not thebest. Decided to order the above. I was worried about the plastic on therazor I read about, but no one else talked about it and people stated they used the razor over 20 years and it is still like new. So I said, maybe they improved the razor. The razor came in the mail and I could find no plastic or non metal part. The Merkur worked better than my old Safety Razor I have used since 1957. This was with the same shaving brush andshaving soap. The only change was with the razor. They have the razordesign right. I did test my American razor blades against the Merkurblade and the Merkur blade did cut closer. This may be my learning curvewith the new razor. Again I am happy with Amazon reviewers and I amone too. My wife said my result is better.
