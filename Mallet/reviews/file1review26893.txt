review/text: I've used several different brands of whey protein over the past few years and I must say that a lot of the advertising is just to get you to spend the extra $20 or so that most brands charge. Sure, people might have their opinions or their favorites and I won't knock that at all but from my personal expierence I have gotten great results off this product, just as much if not more than I have any other brand of whey protein and it's one of the cheapest out of all of them so I have been using this consistently for about a year now. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". This product works great, once you figure out a flavor you like (not all taste good) I highly suggest and reccomend this product to anyone that is looking for an excellent whey protein supplement!
