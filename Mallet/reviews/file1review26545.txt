review/text: The Back Booster is a wonderful product when it works. But after having 4 of these (2 in my office, one in my car, and one for my wife), only one has shown that it can hold a reasonably full inflation on a continuous basis. The other 3 have an imperceptible slow leak that requires new inflation about every two hours.I emailed Back Booster's CEO to let him know about this. He was quite aware and told me he was working on this with the manufacturer. He sent me some replacements at no charge, and those are working fine. Because of this great customer service, I've increased my rating from a 2 to a 4.
