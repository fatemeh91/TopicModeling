review/text: I bought this product for my GF. She has violent reactions to gluten. She took the product as per intructions and we had pizza. At first it appeared successful,no vomiting, no pain or any other symptoms. The next day however things changed dramatically. She ended up with Pneumonia like symptoms for three days and her joints hurt for a week. I feel horrible for putting her through this but maybe I can help someone else. Don't risk it.
