review/text: I have used many different beard-trimmers and hair-clippers before and this one beats them all!I use this to shave my beard AND my head. Works better for both tasks than any beard-trimmer or hair-clippers I have ever owned! It is SO much easier to shave if you run this trimmer over your face first! Most times, I don't even bother. I just use the trimmer. If you remove the adjustable length guard altogether, it will give you a VERY CLOSE trim, and will not cut you. The blades never need to be cleaned or oiled! How did they do it? This device has profoundly simplified my life! Thank you Remington!
