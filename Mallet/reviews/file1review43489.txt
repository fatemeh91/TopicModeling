review/text: Fantastic. Easy to use, digital readings are large enough to see. No more keeping track of readings. Portable enough, it can go to appointments right along with me. 20.oo less than what I priced it in the local chain stores. I am raving about it. Sure beats the wrist monitor as far as accuracy.
