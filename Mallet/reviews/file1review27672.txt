review/text: I love the flavor and it mixes great in a shaker or blender. My favorite recipe is 8 oz of vanilla soy milk, 1 scoop, and one frozen banana. May need a high end blender for frozen fruit.Update: This is no longer available in the natural version so the taste has changed a bit. Looking for a replacement.
