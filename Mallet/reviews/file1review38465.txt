review/text: I have been using the Emjoi Light Caress for the past year. I like the Emjoi Light Caress, however I was getting frustrated with the amount of time it took to do both legs, bikini, underarms and arms.I decided to try the Emjoi Optima since it has the dual opposed heads. I am very glad I did try it. It got virtually all of the hair (the Light Caress frequently misses hairs) and cut the time by about 1/3, which is wonderful. It also didn't cause as much discomfort to the skin of my underarms as the Light Caress did, which was also nice.I also like that you can remove the head for easier cleaning. I haven't tried the razor part yet, but am sure I will like it.The only down side to this product is the odd shape and small size. It is more difficult to hold because of it's shape and size. However given my past experience, I'm more than willing to overlook the shape and size issue.
