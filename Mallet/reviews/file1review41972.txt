review/text: Let me start by saying that I have moderate anxiety. This product has worked well for me over the last few days. I've been transitioning into a new job and working crazy hours, so my anxiety has been coming from a variety of areas (learning new work, working strange hours, losing sleep, being very busy). All of these stresses led me to try to Kava Kava, and I've been very happy with the results. I found it at a local nutritional store for about $13, so this Amazon price is better, but I couldn't wait for shipping.Also, keep in mind that this is not a product that is going to work for everyone. Anything you put into your body can have a different affect on you than it will on the person next to you. Just because it did not work for someone else doesn't mean you should completely dismiss this product. If you have moderate anxiety, give Kava Kava a shot. For $10 on Amazon, it's hard to go wrong. If it doesn't work for you, maybe you can pass it on to someone else that might find it effective.Bottom line - give it a shot if your anxiety is interfering with your relaxation time, if your mind is wandering and giving you trouble. For such a reasonable price, it's definitely worth trying. It has worked very well for me. I hope it works well for you, too.
