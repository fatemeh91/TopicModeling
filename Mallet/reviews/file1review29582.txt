review/text: I purchased the Dri-sleeper for my son hoping it would help him. We told him how much this would help him and it barely worked for 3 days. He was unbelievably upset at how it failed over and over. I realized the main unit had an intermittent connection and tried to explain it to the help line. They kept insisting the main unit was fine and only the sensor needed replacement. In fact they repeated the line from the on-line documentation stating "the sensor is a wearable item and should be replaced from time to time". Are you kidding!! How ridiculous is that! I repeated that the main unit had a specific fault condition but the help line would NOT replace it. At this point we do not have a functioning bed wetting alarm for my son. My son, wife and I are very discouraged with this experience and think the Dri-sleeper product should be removed from Amazon!!
