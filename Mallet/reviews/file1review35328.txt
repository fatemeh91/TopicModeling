review/text: I have used this product (4 bottles) over the course of the last 8 weeks, following the directions explicitly. I chose two areas that I wanted to see hair inhibited, my private area, and my upper back. I used it twice a day for the first week, and twice a day about half the time the following week, using it once a day all the other days, every single day. Nothing has changed. I've cut the hair back repeatedly during those weeks to keep it short, but it continues to grow back thick and full.If you like spraying a fruity smelling water solution on yourself, then go for it. There doesn't seem to be any irritation or stink (except the fruity smell) later in the day. But it didn't do anything to inhibit hair growth.
