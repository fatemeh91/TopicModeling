review/text: I am currently 5 months pregnant with twins and have been suffering from pelvic girdle pain, lower back pain, and round ligament pain since the beginning of the second trimester. I have been having trouble getting out of the house because of the pain and my OB recommended that I get a support belt and begin physical therapy. As soon as the belt arrived I tried it on and was pleasantly surprised to find that my round ligament pain and back pain immediately disappeared and that the pelvic girdle pain was greatly reduced. I am now able to spend more time on my feet and am getting more exercise and feel more active.The belt is comfortable while standing and walking, but squishes a little bit when sitting with it on. However a few quick readjustments fix that problem quickly. Normally I would have gotten an large but with twins I thought I would need a larger belt and this one doesn't disappoint, I have plenty of room to grow. However, since I bought the larger size, the top support is too large.The only thing I don't like is that the belt makes me very warm and I have to wear a thin shirt under it because it is a little itchy on my bare skin.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a heavy duty maternity support belt.
