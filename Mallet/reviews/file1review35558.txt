review/text: These prenatal vitamins are one of the only ones I found that include an aid to help in digestion. These pills seem to keep me "regular". Which during pregnancy is a good thing because it seems to really throw off your digestive track. I also do not find myself "burping" them up, like I have with other prenatal vitamins.These pills are quite large, and you have to take two of them twice daily. If you are forgetful or don't like taking large pills, these may not be the ones for you.
