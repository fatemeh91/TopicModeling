review/text: The "Gopher" is a favorite of mine, especially as I find I need the help more and more. It helps to get things close to the ceiling as well as pick up the smallest object on the floor. This is my second one. I use one for helping me get ready to move and the other for day to day care. I even was able to get hold of extra "cups" for when I will need them, if ever. Very well made.
