review/text: I have to say, the product is very vague as to what it really is. If I were just to see the bottle in the store, I would have no clue what it was. Onset of what? It does not claim to cure or remedy anything, and offers no pain relief etc. So this remained unopened for a couple weeks, until one night, I was feeling really run down, and my throat was starting to get sore, and I was getting my typical symptoms of getting a cold or the flu. Then I remembered this, and figured, it wouldn't hurt. I took two tablets before bed, and awoke to zero symptoms. No sore throat. No aches. But it says "Take 2 capsules 5 times daily for 2 days"... I took a couple more in the morning, just because. But stopped there. I do attribute the pills to the reversal of symptoms because I literally took nothing else, not even an aspirin. Is it a fluke? Don't know. But I know my illness pattern, and this most certainly stopped it in it's tracks. The problem here is if taken as directed, this is pretty costly. It would mean you would ingest the entire bottle in two days. But compared to buying cold medicine and theraflu etc., maybe it's worth it. I still have 16 pills left, so I did not take as directed. But it's also not a drug, so this is strictly take as suggested, and use your own common sense.
