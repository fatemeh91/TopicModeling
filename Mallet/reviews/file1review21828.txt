review/text: On the plus side, this is a high quality lube for a more than reasonable price. I object to this quote from the product description: "lubricating females before breeding" because it is sexist and narrow-minded. Not all sex is for procreation, even if my Lord suggests it should be. I'm human and I do have desires. Who among us doesn't? (Please, no more emails from monks and nuns - aren't you "holier than thou" types supposed to shun modern technology anyway?) I do not intend to be "bred" and I think you would find more females inclined to agree with my point of view. The whole feminist movement is alive, but not so well - and we women need to do something about it. But back to this cheap but excellent lube - they need to come up with a more marketable name.
