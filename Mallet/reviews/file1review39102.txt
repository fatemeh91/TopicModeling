review/text: I bought this bad boy 5 years ago and haven't spent a dollar on a haircut since. It seriously pays for itself in one use. It's never failed in in all this time and still works like it's new. It comes with a ton of stuff, so you have a lot of options.My only complaint is that after lots of use the 1 inch guard makes a loud buzzing noise when it's on, so I've switched the the 3/4 inch since it's annoying. Also I wish it came with longer guards since 1 inch is quite short.But other than that this thing is a beast that won't let you down.
