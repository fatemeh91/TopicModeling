review/text: I have used DipIt for many yearss - I am 60 yrs. old. My mother used it too. It cleans like a wonder. JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and you'll be surprised at what this little box of powder can do. My local stores no longer carry it and I can't travel too well (w/c bound), so I am ordering it from Amazon in a few days. As for it getting "hard" after a while --- once the box is opened, put the box in a small plastic bag, seal it tight and put it into a plastic container. It will stay powery for a much longer period of time (I do the same with brown sugar). It will make the stains in your teapots, coffee makers and even plastic containers go away! Make a paste of it for the outside of your pots and pans and watch them come back to life (NOT to be used on NON stick pans plz).
