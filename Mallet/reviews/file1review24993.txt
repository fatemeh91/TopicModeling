review/text: I started taking Fertilaid on December 12, 2011. I decided to take if after 9 months of trying and 15 periods. Due to a hormonal imbalance, my cycle would come about every two weeks, and I tried different ways to regulate it (exercise, diet, etc.), but nothing was working. I searched the internet and found Fertilaid, read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I was skeptical because a lot of women who had success with Fertilaid had the opposite problem from me, where they'd have only 4 periods a year. Still, I was up for trying anything. Two weeks after taking Fertilaid, I got another period. I wasn't disheartened though because I knew that it would take some time to work and I promised myself I would take it for at least three months. Two weeks after that menstruation, I had EWCM for the first time since coming off of BC back in April of 2011. Now I'm in my TTW, but I'm hopeful that if I don't get pregnant this month, I will shortly. My body is finally back to normal and I have a real chance of getting pregnant now. If you are considering taking Fertilaid, JUST DO IT! It regulated my cycle better then I could've imagined with four days of EWCM and ovulation cramping and it's all natural. I absolutely love this product and will recommend it to anyone and everyone TTC.(I will update when I get pregnant)
