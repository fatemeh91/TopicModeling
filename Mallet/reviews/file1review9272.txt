review/text: I ordered this item to help keep my medicine organized, plus I like to keep it in pocket so I don't forget and get busy during the day - so it helps to remind me. I also like that I can fill all of them up in day instead of every morning like before. The price is reasonable and well worth it. Recieved quickly. Would do business again with this company.
