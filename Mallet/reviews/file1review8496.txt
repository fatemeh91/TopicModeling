review/text: I'm a fan of OXO products and this one is no different. Well made and designed. The grip feels nice and has grooves, the shaft is slightly flexible and the brush is the correct size for what I needed. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think the bristles should be a bit stiffer, otherwise it's perfect.
