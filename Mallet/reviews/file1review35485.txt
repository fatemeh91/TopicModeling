review/text: The SPIRU-TEIN High Protein Energy Meal Strawberry Protein Powder is as close to perfect as a protein powder could be. One scoop blended with an orange, kiwi, apple and orange juice makes a delicious and nutritious shake. This shake will benefit you in the following ways:You get 100% of the Daily Value of all vitaminsThey have made sure you get a Broad Profile of Essential MineralsSoy Protein and Bee Pollen are added for energyDiet aids like Lecithin, Spirulina, Choline and Inositol are includedThis powder also contains Bromelain, Papaya, Chlorophyll, Bran, Cellulose and Apple Pectin. The Amino Acid Profile per serving is also impressive.Add in a scoop of ice cream and it turns dreamy. You then have a pink strawberry shake that is and very healthy and especially delicious. I'm of the opinion that a little ice cream now and then is a good way to encourage you to eat more fruit. It only takes a few minutes to cut up the fruit and this powder blends so fast, making a shake will seem like you are saving time.~The Rebecca Review
