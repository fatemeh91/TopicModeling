review/text: The Gopher is a useful tool idea that can use some product enhancement. It is nice that it folds for easier storage. It allows you to reach for items in hard-to-reach places. Small items can be retrieved from high shelves with ease. It is rated to lift five pounds, but I don't trust it that much. The heavier the item, the more strain on your wrist and on the Gopher.I tried using the Gopher to replace a light bulb. Seems like this would be the ideal tool to grab the bulb from a ceiling fixture and replace it. Not so. The locking mechanism doesn't grip tightly enough. You can loosen the bulb, but as the bulb loosens, so does the Gopher's grip. I was also unable to tighten the replacement bulb sufficiently. The locking grip didn't hold and it was too difficult rotating the Gopher while maintaining pressure on the pistol grip.The bottom line for me, the Gopher is a handy tool for reaching small, light, non-fragile items. It is a definite boon for people who are forced to be sedentary. It does not do the trick, however, for heavy items or items requiring a tight grip.
