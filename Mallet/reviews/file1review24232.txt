review/text: I have back pain and foot pain so I thought, after watching the infomercial, that this was just what I needed after hearing all the testimonials. I liked the fact that the heal was low, kind of like the Earth shoe of the 70's. But they neglected to tell you that the arches were not flexible but very hard plastic. The arches hurt like hell and I used the lowest one (they provide three different heights of arches.). Also, it took forever for them to get here. Almost a month! (I ordered from the Walkfit company, not Amazon.) I paid $10 shipping. What were they using? Pony Express? Anyhow, when I called the company about the pain, (I couldn't walk with them more than a few minutes) they told me I would have to get used to them but if I have foot problems I may never get used to them. WHAT??? The infomercial targets people WITH foot problems providing a list of various ailments such as heel spurs etc. Anyhow, I tried again and then the next day and so on for a few weeks. I really wanted them to work for me. Just hurt so bad I had to return them. After returning them, I had to call the company because the refund was also taking forever. When I called them about not receiving my refund (which was two weeks after they got the package according to my tracking number) they said they didn't put the refund through yet. A month later, I still did not receive the refund. I did eventually get the refund but had to call them three times. Crappy way to do business.Anyhow, this is not the product that I expected, especially since they target people who are having problems walking but the product made it even harder to walk and painful.
