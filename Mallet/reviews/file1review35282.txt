review/text: My husband has a snoring problem. It's not bad enough for me to leave the room, but it does wake me up frequently. I've tried all of the disposable ear plugs that are sold in pharmacies. The most comfortable kinds fall out after a couple of hours and the ones that stay in hurt my ears so badly by morning. These little orange ear plugs are comfortable, stay in place and block out more sound than any others that I've tried. I did trim down the little "stem" because I am a side sleeper and it got in the way. I also love that they're reusable. I'm tempted to buy a couple more as backup.
