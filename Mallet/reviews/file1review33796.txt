review/text: I've always been hesitant to have my hair cut at home, but this clipper took away that fear!My wife and I watched the DVD that came w/it, and in 1/2 hr I had a great hair cut! My haircut is simple and pretty straight forward. But believe me, SuperCuts couldn't get it done right 3 times! The last cut I had there was a mess, I actually had to fix it when I got home (I had to go to SC 'cos my favorite barber moved).Anyways, it's a great product. It comes w/the cape, brush to clean the clipper, and oil for the blades. And when you're done, you just stuff 'em all in a box.I'm not giving it 5 stars because I've only used it once...--------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok, this an update. I'm giving it 5 stars now, because it's easy to use and care for, and saved me $125 a year (and no more waiting to get your cut). Last week, I gave myself a crew cut (that's right, myself and a mirror) and it turned out reasonably ok. I don't have to wear a hat to work the next day, put it that way!
