review/text: I have been taking this powder for a couple years now and can honestly say it is the best protein powder I have ever used. It mixes very easily and tastes great even in water. At 24g per scoop it is one of the highest sources of protein in a powder shake. The price here at amazon for the 10 lb bag is very reasonable. You won't be disappointed. Do it!
