review/text: The new version (non-"original") has Stevia in it, I think that improves the taste. I took the original about 4 years ago and I remember I gave up because of the taste. I found an awesome way to drink it that is actually quite soothing and tasty. I also bought the Perfect Meal dietary supplement mix, Organic Chai Tea Concentrate (By Pacific Foods) and Rice or Soy Milk. I recommend purchasing a travel mug with a built in shaker/emulsifier. You can likely find one in the protein powder/health food section of a grocery or vitamin store. Anyway... pour the chai concentrate in the mug with equal parts soy or rice milk. Then add one scoop of the Perfect Meal Powder (I prefer chocolate, but they have vanilla) and one scoop Perfect Food. Shake it up! This actually tastes super good and is very mild with a slight sweetness from the chocolate and stevia. I feel like its something one would drink before bed to relax.
