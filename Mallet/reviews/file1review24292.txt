review/text: I probably have plantar fasciitis. I say "probably" because no doctor has officially diagnosed me. But the symptoms fit to a "T" those descriptions in dozens, if not hundreds of Googled results. The extreme pain with the first steps in the morning; the pain if you squeeze your heel at any time; everything points to plantar fasciitis.I've tried dozens of Dr. Scholl's-type inserts, worn different shoes, not much result. So I decided to try this so-called "miracle" treatment.Upon first walking around with the insert, I too, like many people, felt that the inserts were extremely hard and uncomfortable, but I stuck it out, like they said. Now I can't remember why, but I stopped using them.A couple of years later: now. I was about to go on a week's trip to Cuba and I was looking around in my closet and I found the ol' Walk Fits. Hmm, said I, maybe I just didn't really wear them as long as they tell you to; I'll bring them to Cuba with me.Mistake. I wore them for the week but didn't really realise why my feet were hurting more and more every day (travelling involves a lot of walking, and Cuba is full of uneven surfaces as well) until I actually got home. Then my feet REALLY started to hurt, but instead of just my heels, it was now the arches as well. Extremely tender and swollen ALL DAY, not just upon waking up.Then I put on my Cuba shoes to run an errand and I immediately realised what the cause of it was. Those hard mounds in my shoes matched EXACTLY the most tender parts of the soles of my feet.Do not waste your time on these things. I guarantee that if you wear them all the time, your condition, whatever it might be, will only get worse.This product rhymes with "Fit," people.
