review/text: I am an individual at high risk of sudden cardiac arrest. I don't own a personal defibrillator but I have the implant in my chest. My implanted defibrillator and pacemaker is tuned up every 3 months by my cardiologist. The implant needs a new battery every 3-4 years so I have to undergo chest surgery at that time. The implant hurt like the devil after they installed it, but after 6 weeks it stopped hurting so much. My point is, if you are at high risk, why don't you get the implant? Do you need a scary electric device laying around that you may not be sure if you're using it right if you ever do use it? Have you had your first heart attack yet? Have you discussed this purchase with your cardiologist? If the answers to these last four questions is no, then maybe you should see a cardiologist first before you make the purchase. If you have not had a heart problem so far, and you're worried about it, see your doctor, maybe change your diet, stop smoking, etc. I think if you're shopping for this machine, maybe the implant is a better choice. The implant does it all for you and brings you back alive, without any intervention, unlike the product which needs someone nearby who knows how to use it properly.Update 12/29/08: I recently visited my cardiologist and had my machine readout printed up, and was informed that on August 9, 2008, at about 5:00 a.m., my implanted defibrillator jolted my heart until it began to beat again and that the implant had saved my life. I did not wake up. My cardiologist informed me that without the implant, I would have passed away in my sleep without waking up.I did not wake up. Who would have been there to use an external defibrillator on me to save me? No one.
