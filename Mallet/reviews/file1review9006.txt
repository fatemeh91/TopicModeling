review/text: I've been using this powder for about two months now. The only difference I notice is the white spots on my nails have disappeared. Other then that, I don't feel or look any different. I've been taking it twice a day, morning and night. I haven't been taking a multivitamin but I wonder if I still should. I have tried other powders and they're all pretty much the same to me, I buy this one for the probiotics which I need more than anything. The taste is ok compared to others. Very tolerable.
