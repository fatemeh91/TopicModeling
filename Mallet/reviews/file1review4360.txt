review/text: When I first saw the ads on TV I thought it was a joke. Five blades!! I saw the item locally so I purchased it with the intention of shaving with it first thing in the morning. I am currently a Mach 3 user and I love it so I wondered if this Fusion thing would make a big difference. I honestly feel that the shave with the Fusion is of the same closeness at the Mach 3. However the Fusion has a HUGE bonus the extra blade (six) on the back of the shaving headto hit those stray hairs that remain under the nose that the Mach 3 normally misses. Also it is much easier to trim sideburns with the Fusion because you do not have to worry about hacking off a huge chunk with the mass of 3 blades with the Mach 3. A bit pricey and if the razor came at the same price as the Mach 3 I would commit to the upgrade, (Very Hard for guys to change hygeine products, we love the good old reliables). If you do not have a Mach 3 then I recommend purchasing the Fusion. Bottom line: Close shave, nice sideburn and stray hair trimmer, nice overall design of the handle, and a good looking razor. Thanks.
