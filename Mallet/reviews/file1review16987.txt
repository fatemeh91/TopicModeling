review/text: I had the previous version of this model for several years and was very satisfied with it. As one would expect, the rechargeable battery eventually ran out of steam, so I replaced it (ignoring the warnings of reliability problems of the current - 2012 - "equivalent").That was a mistake. After less than 90 days, the thing has run down to inoperable (even when plugged in). No drops or other mishandling.I'm in the middle of a move, so don't have time to negotiate a return. Will chalk it up to failing to heed wise and experienced warnings - this device (and probably the entire Remington brand) is JUNK.
