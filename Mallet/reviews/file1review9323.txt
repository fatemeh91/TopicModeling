review/text: I have a small wooden box I put this in. I fill up the individual boxes once a week. It is nice to only have to carry one day's worth at a time. These little pill boxes hold a lot of pills, yet, it's still small enough to not take up a lot of room in my purse. Yes, I've dropped them too and they don't burst open and spill my pills. I really like this product and the price is right too.
