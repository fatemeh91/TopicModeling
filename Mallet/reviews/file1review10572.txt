review/text: This cane is very durable. I also love that it comes in the box already put together. For someone like me (mechanically challenged at times) that was a bonus. It's really cute with the flowers on it. As others have also said, there are some huge stickers on the front of it that need to be removed. Don't quite understand why the manufacturer would do that. I had to "soak" the stickers off with a wet washcloth so I did not ruin the flower covering. Other then the stickers, it's very durable and especially cute for women. Being newly handicapped and disabled, I decided on this as it is stylish. Thanks for making such a durable product.
