review/text: I purchased this rinse aid from another website to try before purchasing in bulk. After trying Wave Jet I decided to try Ecover and compare the two. At first Ecover seemed to do the job at a slightly lower price but after using for approximately 30 days my dishwasher appeared to stop drying the dishes. Each load came out of the dishwasher needing to be hand dried. I thought my heating element was going out but I had it checked and it was not the problem. A friend suggested changing rinse aids. Ecover worked fine to begin with so why would that matter? Well after loads & loads of water covered dishes it was time to refill the rinse aid dispenser. I added Wave Jet and the first load and every load since has come out of the dishwasher dry & spot free. I still have a case of Ecover to get through but I'll be using Wave Jet after that. It works, it's earth friendly, Amazon's price is close to if not better than the nationally advertised brands, and it's made in the USA-What more could you ask for?
