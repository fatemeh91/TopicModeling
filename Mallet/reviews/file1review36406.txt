review/text: Very good magnification, but reflections blur when mirror is angled. The stand is convenient for free hand zit popping. The light is as bright as a firefly however. I suppose if you needed to illuminate AND magnify something deep in a dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and only had this mirror with batteries installed, you may actually have praise for the light feature. Of course, if you happened to be lost in that deep dark patch of woods at night during a new moon and wanted the light of the mirror to actually help you illuminate anything other than your nose, you would be as disappointed with the light as at almost any other time. Save your batteries. Regardless and overall, it is a good mirror.
