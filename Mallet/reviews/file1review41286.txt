review/text: I have been using thes pads for over 15 years and was very disappointed with the thin quality of the material and the high cost! One wrap with two pad inserts for $27.00, way too much. When you buy them they call it a 3 pack so one would assume, a set of 3 is one and a 3 pack would be 3 sets??
