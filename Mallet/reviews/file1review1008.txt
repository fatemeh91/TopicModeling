review/text: Wife didn't have any luck with this product. Much more luck with the fenugreek. She also claimed this tasted like &#34;goat ass.&#34; She has a way with words. The do not drink before and after instructions are a pain. That and the taste of goat ass that you can't wash away makes this a lowsy product.
