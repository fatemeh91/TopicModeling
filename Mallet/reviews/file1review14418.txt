review/text: I suffer from motion sickness when sailing in ocean swells. Looking for an alternative to traditional seasick pills, which always make me very drowsy (even the "non-drowsy" type), I decided to try Motion Eaze. My first time using it I got sick twice on a three hour sail, so it doesn't seem to work for me. I will give it one more try, however, since the last time out I allowed myself to get hungry, which can enhance the feeling of motion sickness.
