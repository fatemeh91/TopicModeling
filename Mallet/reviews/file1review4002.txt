review/text: These EXPENSIVE blades work as advertised. This is the closest shave I've ever gotten from a razor. I have pretty tough facial hair. But these blades cut through them like butter and with less irritation than the Mach 3 I used before. I worried that so close a shave would encourage razor bumps and ingrown hairs. But that was not a problem with these blades.My only complaint would be how darn expensive these things are. In spite of that, I would still recommend them.
