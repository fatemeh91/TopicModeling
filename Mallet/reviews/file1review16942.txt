review/text: This thing rocks. Although it has a steep price tag for an ice pack, it is definitely worth it - I wish I never wasted my money on other cheap $10 ones from the drugstore. I am 8 months out of surgery and this DuraKold pack is great to wrap around my knee after playing soccer. It is way better than the CryoCuff the hospital gave me after surgery. Although it is not as cold as a bag of ice directly on the skin, it is colder than any other reusable ice pack I have used. As far as I can tell, after an 1 hour or so of use it doesn't seem to lose its cooling effect.It would be helpful if the company listed the dimensions for the different sizes. I have an XL, which measures roughly 1ft by 2 ft.
