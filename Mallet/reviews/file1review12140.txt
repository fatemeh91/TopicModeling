review/text: Are they big? Yes, but their shape makes it easy to swallow. My prior prenatals were diamond shaped -- right angles and pills don't mix! These are oblong and go down easy and fast.Have taken these on an empty stomach (but generally with food). Never had a problem and I have a sensitive stomach. No issues whatsoever with late night use.I like the fact that these don't have a bunch of additives but do have red raspberry leaf and 800 mg of folic acid. I especially like that the are vegan. I've tried 3-4 different prenatals and these are my favorite!
