review/text: Yes, they are inexpensive, but, they do not send instructions with them and they aren't as accurate as they claim. I have been taking my basal temperature faithfully every morning, had a spike 2 days ago and still these OVT's didn't show a positive result. Don't waste your money, you'll get pregnant with or without the worry of whether or not you've ovulated-eventually.
