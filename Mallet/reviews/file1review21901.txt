review/text: This product does what it states. It gives your body the slight push it needs to fall asleep when you're having trouble. I like the sublingual tablets because they seem to work faster than the traditional pills you swallow and they have a pleasant orange flavor. My only gripe is that they don't dissolve as easily as other sublingual tablets I've taken. These require you to move them around under your tongue to get them to dissolve. Others I've taken dissolve quicker without manipulation under your tongue. Still, this won't stop me from buying these again. They do what they're supposed to and the price is very reasonable.
