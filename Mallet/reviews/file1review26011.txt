review/text: I first got one of these years ago when Brookstone carried them and I've been hooked since. I'm on my 5th one and I will never use another mask. I especially like how the foam keeps the masks away from my eye lashes. With other masks my eyelashes would brush against them and annoy me, not with the Mindfold!
