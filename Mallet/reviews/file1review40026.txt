review/text: I really don't care about flavor and this stuff has an odd after taste. Its effects are noticeable for me within 30 min. and the only "bad" thing in this drink is Sucralose. Other than that, it is a great waker-uper in the morning and keeps me awake when I need it most without all the harmful chemicals that most energy drinks have.
