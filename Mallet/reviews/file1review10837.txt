review/text: I got this scale about a year ago. After a few months it broke. Unless I lost 30 lbs in two days, something was wrong. So I called the company and they said they have a lifetime warranty on them. So I took it back to Walmart where I got it and being I didn't have the receipt, I had to get the same kind. Well now it's a few months later and I just "gained" 8 1/2 lbs in TWO hours???It's off again and I'm very annoyed.Neither scale was dropped and there is no reason for them to just break for no reason.I'm ready to go back to the 10 dollar dial kind.
