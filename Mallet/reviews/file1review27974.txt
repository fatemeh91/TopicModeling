review/text: Delivery was super fast only 2 days and also free. Product was sealed on the out site and in site. Mix ability is 100% and you don t have to use to much shaking around. Taste is in the perfect line, not too sugary but not too plain. I like strawberry cause is less polluting than chocolate or banana that makes me sleepy. Strawberry is more energetic for me and my taste buds. Digestion is almost un noticed. If you will take too much you may get your lungs to work faster and you can start to fill restless ( your respiratory system will try to help stomach to move excess protein that doesn't fit anymore in your cells}. So is better to go with servings designed to use this product correctly. You don't want to look like PIG. ,!!!
