review/text: This was my first time using any kind of waxing product. Although it was messy, it did the job well. I used the Nair on two locations -- my legs and my bikini area. On my legs I was able to successfully remove the hair. It was painful, but tolerable. As for my bikini area, that was another story. I actually had to stop because it hurt so badly. Also, this left me with only two sheets of waxing paper. My advice is to use the paper as sparingly as possible. I do think that I'll stick to traditional shaving. But, I'll try this product again for a special occasion. Like a summer vacation.
