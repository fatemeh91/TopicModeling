review/text: I actually bought this as a vacuum my kids could use while I used our "real" one. Reading some reviews I figured it'd be lackluster, but if it picked up a few things it'd be plenty. After one day of using it, I'm not sure what other reviewers are unhappy with. I think it has AMAZING power. Picks up pet hair, does the couch wonderfully, and even gets larger things without a problem. Popcorn always clogs my dyson, but this little thing has no issue with it. Same with pet food. I believe someone complained that it's cheaply made & that the collection bin doesn't stay on. It has a top and bottom latch, you have to make sure both of those are in place, I was able to slide it off easily before I realized the bottom part of the collection bin hadn't been placed all the way over the bottom latch that holds it in place. There is no way it comes off if both of those are in place. It's loud, yes, but it's a vacuum. I'm yet to find a quiet one. The price & power totally makes up for any excessive noise. I've not had any dirt come out of it or have it fall over. I think the cord is a good length as well. I have cats & 3 dogs, hair came up off the hard areas of flooring & the stairs, as well as any fabrics. Easy to use, even my 3 year old is able to use it without problems. Love it, way more than I was expecting. I'll likely use this more than the regular vacuum.
