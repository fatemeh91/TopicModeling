review/text: I bought this product thinking that, since it's such a small amount of magnesium and there's no calcium filler and it's a tablet, the pills would be small. In actuality they're huge - thin enough, but really long, so if they turn in your throat you're in trouble. Guess I won't be ordering pills from Amazon anymore, at least not until they start showing pill size.
