review/text: Take a high quality protein, give it a realistic flavor, offer it at a nice price, and you've got one of the best protein supplements around. I've tried many protein powders, and always end up coming back to ON: for nutritional profile, mixability, and taste. Yes, there may be a few others that taste a little better, but they fall short overall (i.e. having considerably less protein, or using high fructose corn syrup, among other things). I'm interested in the best bang, and this is it.Perfect for smoothies (added in order of water first, then frozen fruit, then powder, and ice last)--no clumping, side-sticking, or chalkiness. Good value too (I aim for less than $10 a pound).
