review/text: When ordering the deluxe sock aid I was skeptical that it would not work as advertised. I was wrong it works great. I thought that the sock would come off at the tip of my foot and with my arthritis would still be bending over to get the sock on. I was completely wrong. It works great. I wish I had ordered this sooner.
