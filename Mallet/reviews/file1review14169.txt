review/text: For years I've had shaver "burn" on my neck, whether I used a traditional razor or an electric one. I tried any number of electric shavers over the years. The Norelco shaver that uses the Nivea lotion is the only one that has resulted in skin that doesn't feel or looked like I used sandpaper on my skin. Highly recommended for those with this problem.
