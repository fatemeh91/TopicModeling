review/text: I am currently taking these pills. Yes, these pill are very big compaired to other prenatal vitamins and they leave a horrible taste in your mouth. No matter what I eat, the taste is still there. I dread taking these pill. I think this gave me an upset stomach,I didn't suffer from morning sickness until I started taking these pills. When I visit my doctor I will get a precription prenatal vitamin.
