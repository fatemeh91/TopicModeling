review/text: This (6 a day), along with a no-sugar, low carb diet, and also probiotics, has worked wonders for me and my yeast problem. I still take 4 a day for maintenance! A really good value compared to three-lac or five-lac, which didn't work for me alone. I can take this, and then a much more affordable probiotic such as IC Pearls.
