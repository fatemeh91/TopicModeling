review/text: Whether or not you agree that this thing works, it is pretty fun to have at parties. I like that there isn't a mouthpiece that would require constant cleaning and/or replacement covers, but having to blow into it is probably why the accuracy seems to waver. All in all, very fun and worth the $30 price tag.
