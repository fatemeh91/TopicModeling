review/text: I purchased several of these little gems in various colors for the first time a few months ago, and I have to say that my drinks have never been the same since! Their ability to add a whole new dimension to the ambience and conversation of a given party never fails to impress either the host or the guests. My only issue with the Litecubes is that once their batteries run out (about 8 to 12 hours depending on storage and usage conditions), you have no choice but to dispose of them and purchase replacements (which can get rather expensive if you own several sets of them in different colors like I do) since it is not possible to reseal the watertight plastic casing that houses the batteries. It would have been nice if they had designed them so that the batteries could recharged by placing the litecubes on a charger base of some kind, which would solve the power capacity issue for the most part without having to physically remove the batteries. (An upgrade for Litecubes 2.0, perhaps?)
