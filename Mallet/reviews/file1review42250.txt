review/text: Definitely felt a boost of energy after taking this one. My body has all sorts of issues which are unclear.. I will try the Gold version next since it has 1,000 of B-12, and I think that's important for what i need. However, the Gold version has no iron in it. I think I need both a little bit of B-12 and iron, so I'm not sure what i will do.. I may stick with the Green and then supplement the B-12 with a daily sublingual.
