review/text: i bought these, the o.b. multi-pak & some kotex applicator tampons from walmart. i always buy o.b. tampons, the ones with no applicators. they are nice & small so you can take them anywhere snugly in your pocket or purse. since they have to apply with your finger, make sure you wash your hands before applying the tampon.these tampons are great to use & are very efficient. i love to be stocked up on my monthly essentials so i bought 4 boxes of o.b. tampons.i recommend them to every woman. they are great as long as you use them correctly...
