review/text: This is my second MB-200 that I've owned. The first one was amazingly convenient. It held a charge for around a month. With no accessories, it was great for traveling. Unfortunally my cats knocked it off of the sink with the guard extended. It broke a small piece inside and the guard doesn't work anymore. So I suggest to store it with the guard all the way in so that can't happen. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied.
