review/text: A friend of mine was having problems potty trainer her son. She couldn't understand why he was scared of using the "grown up potty". I remember being HORRIFIED of falling into the toilet when I was little and thought maybe he was having the same problem. I sent this to them thinking it certainly wouldn't hurt. He did a complete 180 after just trying it once! Apparently he was scared of falling in. The toilet seat gave him all the confidence that he needed! He is now a "grown up potty" veteran. He'll even use toilets out in public without the potty seat (something he out and out refused to do before). The only problem they are having now is trying to get him to use the toilet at home without his potty seat. Every time I talk to him on the phone he says "Aunt Dawn! Thank you for the potty seat! I had cheese today." or some other totally random follow up thought. I will probably forever be "Aunt Dawn- giver of potty seats" to him. I'm okay with that title. :)
