review/text: The cookie dough flavor is okay, but not the best. The texture is a little too gooey. I have only eaten a few of these bars and I am already sick of them. I got them the same time as I got some Clif bar White Chocolate Macadamia, and those are by far superior to the balance bar.Hopefully the other flavors are better than this, but I think for now I will stick with Clif bars.
