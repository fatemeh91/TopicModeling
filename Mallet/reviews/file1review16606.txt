review/text: Great lighter for the price. The street chrome lighter has a "scratched" appearance to it (which is what I was looking for). It gives it a used, "weathered" appearance, but still looks nice. I am a pack a day smoker and have always used Bic lighters, but decided to give a Zippo a try. Aside from the fact that I have to refill the lighter about once a week, I have thoroughly enjoyed it! I love the classic Zippo click sound when you open and close it. One thing I discovered that is a plus, is that the wick is actually a couple of inches long, so when you need "new" wick, all you have to do is take a pair of needle nose pliers and pull the wick up to the desired height, and then trim it. I have been using this everyday for almost a month, and have not have to pull more wick through or had to replace the flint yet. One safety note: for anyone who has never used a Zippo before - when you light it - it stays lit until you close the lid or the flame gets blown out. If you light it and drop it on the floor by accident like I did, there is a good chance it will stay lit. For the price, and quality - I would recommend!
