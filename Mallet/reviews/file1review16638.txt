review/text: I purchased this zippo because I liked the scratched look on the photos.But the actual product is not quite like that. It has a glossy finish.I'd prefer it was more textured, so it won't slip easily from my hand while doing the tricks.Anyway, I can't complain because of its unbeatable price.P.S. Any suggestion on how to make it more textured or for other textured zippo models, is very much appreciated.
