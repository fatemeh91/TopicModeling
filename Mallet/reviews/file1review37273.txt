review/text: Along with &quot;Active Fresh&quot;, &quot;Ocean Surf&quot; is one of the best scents of the Speed Stick Clear line of products. I tried &quot;Aqua Sport&quot; and it smelled like a locker room - don't be fooled by it's name! Using &quot;Ocean Surf&quot; on the other hand is frightfully close to the actual experience of being at the beach, in the real deal! I felt as though I had been transported to some tropical paradise - and was protected from odour for OVER 24 hours. Also of note - Speed Stick is the official deodorant sponsor of the NHL!
