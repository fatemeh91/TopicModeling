review/text: I'm on my second canister, I find the "vanilla" flavor a bit too much, so I throw in some frozen rasberries and it really makes a huge difference, cuts down on the "rich" sweetness. Sometimes I want a meal replacement but do not necessarily want it to taste like dessert, so tweaking this a bit and adding your favorite frozen fruit or nut butter, etc. is a great way to go. I also like this product because it really does keep me full, like a "regular" meal would. I use this product for weight loss, replacing one meal with shake, instead of the recommended "two" because im already on a raw food type diet, so im not taking in a whole lot of calories anyway. So far in 9 weeks, I've lost 15 lbs. Im very satisfied with these shakes and glad I found out about them.
