review/text: I bought this mask about two months ago and I was completely delighted with it! First of all, it has a thin inner padding that makes it very comfortable. The open space allows you to blink, so your eyes won't get dry, and the back has a big adjustable velcro. Some reviewers have mentioned the thick velcro band can be uncomfortable if you sleep on your back, but I did not find that to be a problem with me.I'd say it blocks about 99% of the light, a little bit of light can sometimes leak near the nose, but you will only notice it if you try to look down. Otherwise, it does its job!Sadly a couple of days ago I noticed the inner black cloth is coming undone right in the middle nose area. I guess the glue wears off because of sweating and human heat. It would had been perfect had they used stitches. I will continue to wear it until it can't take it anymore, then I'll probably order another one.
