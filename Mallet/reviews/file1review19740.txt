review/text: My son is almost three, and big for his age (38 lbs, 37.5 inches), and we've had trouble with all of the other potty seats we used, as the potty guard was not nearly large enough. This one is great! It cleans easily, fits the toilet snugly, seems comfortable enough for my son, and, best of all, actually has a potty guard large enough to work (most of the time!). In fact, we've liked it so well that we're getting a second one for the upstairs bathroom. Although this is expensive, it was definitely worth the money, in my view. I'm not sure that it would be as necessary for a girl. (A side note, we've also used the Baby Bjorn potty chair--it was one of the only potty chairs large enough for my son to use comfortably).
