review/text: I bought this thing for my parents. I was looking something very easy to use, with a big screen, and numbers and accurate results, I got it!!!I think this is a good option, just press a bottom and it works!The measurement seems very accurate, we have compared them with those taken in the doctor's office and the difference is very small.It has a nice bag and an AC power if you are run out of battery. My parents like it a lot!
