review/text: I ordered a pair of these Spenco orthotic arch supports after reading all the great reviews.What a disappointment! I don't know if they've changed the design recently, but the plastic arch support is so soft and flexible you can squash it flat with your hands. Of course, when you put your full body weight on it, it flattens out completely, meaning there's virtually no arch support at all.If you have low arches or flat feet, my advice is to look elsewhere for an orthotic with more rigid arch support.
