review/text: I have acne and oily combo skin. The products I use to dry out my acne strip the natural oils from my face. This product has been used for three months now. I do not break out from it and my skin really feels great. You have to keep using it for several weeks to allow your face to adjust. I really like derma e products and I just reordered two bottles.
