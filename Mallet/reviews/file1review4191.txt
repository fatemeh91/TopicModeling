review/text: I have very very sensitive skin, and try to shave only once a week if it helps. Max 3 times. I have tried almost all damn razors and shaving gels in market worth trying, nothing has come close to Gillette, be it disposable ones or Mach or Fusion or Series gels, they win hands down. But they have their limits. Some one wrote that they last longer if we dry it, rust is what blunts a blade kinda... naah not at all. Generally I hate water, be it a razor or a towel or anything else. I dry my razors using hair dryer for a minute after shave, and consequently the blades get dry too. It helps keep water of my rack too. But no matter what, personally, I haven't seen blades remain sharper for more than 4/5 shaves at the max or more than 3 weeks if once a week shave. For a good and a clean shave, a blade lasts Max of not more than a month. No problem with it for 6 months, it will work, but would be a damn bad shaving experience. We don't need to get a Gillette for that, any run of the mill Chinese throwaways would do.
