review/text: My husband is deaf. He wears excellent hearing aids, but they don't help much. We first used Super Ear Plus at our lawyer's office; they brought out a set for him to try. Up to this point, I signed or wrote down everything that was said. With Super Ear Plus, he uses it when we talk or visit , or when company comes over. He can hear everything. He puts the headphones on over his hearing aids, and it makes all the difference in the world. He has a hearing life back again. Just that extra amplification! The second one he uses when we go anywhere, to business and medical appointments, and much, much more. What a wonderful technology! We strongly recommend this to anyone who has trouble hearing. The volume wheel is very handy, and easy to adjust as needed.
