review/text: I am in my 60's I run and ride bike and stay active. I have had 2 knee operations. I get a little pain when running abd cycling . This brace is comfortable , it breaths so my leg does not itch and sweat. It has good lateral support. not great but I dont need great. This brace is the best I have ever found
