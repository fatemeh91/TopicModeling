review/text: It just doesn't smell that good (to me).. Maybe it will smell like bacon and eggs and fresh coffee to someone else. No but seriously, this stuff works. I work out three times a week and I started to get athletes foot so I started using some cream but putting on the cream everyday is annoying. If you just wash your feet with this stuff every time you shower you should not get any fungus. It will clear up any you already have. Buy it. It's way cheaper than the powders and creams too..
