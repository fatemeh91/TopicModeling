review/text: I like this lotion cause its not as heavy as the butter types, and it seems to be working but I am only in my 6th month so we will have to see....UPDATE:after using this through months 5-10 of my pregnancy, I can say that I didn't get any stretch marks! I started off healthy and only gained 23 lbs so that could have helped. I've also read that it doesn't matter what you use, some people are just going o get them and some aren't. That being said, I gained some weight when I was younger and have stretch marks on my thighs from that. But I didn't get any new ones from being pregnant. I was also VERY careful not to stretch my skin when reaching for things, while lying down, etc. I think that helped too! I will definitely use this again if I have more children!
