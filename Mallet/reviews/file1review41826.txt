review/text: My very nice dentist gave me a Christmas present - this toothbrush.I really liked my Sonicare and I am reluctant to say it, but this brush it better. My teeth are cleaner. And it really knocks down the tartar buildup.The Sonicare would turn off after two minutes. Sure, it was easy to turn back on. But this brush doesn't shut off so I have a tendency to brush longer. And the FlossAction brush head is really great.If you don't have a generous dentist like I do, spend your money on this toothbrush. It is excellent.
