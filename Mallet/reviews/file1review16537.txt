review/text: I started using Focus Factor more than 5 years ago and stopped for a period of time because of the cost. When I stopped I realized I couldn't think as well and found myself in a state of confusion at times. When I saw I could purchase Focus Factor on Amazon for a less expensive amount, I ordered it and started taking it once again. It was very helpful when a new computer system was offered at work. I am not the best on computers and it usually takes a little longer for me to absorb the information. Focus Factor kept my mind clear, did its job and I learned the new system quite well. Now I'm ordering it again not only for myself but also for my boyfriend. Both of us are 70 yrs. young and we're trying to keep it that way. There's a lot to keep up with these days and with the help of Focus Factor, we'll do just fine.Ernie MelingNorth Carolina
