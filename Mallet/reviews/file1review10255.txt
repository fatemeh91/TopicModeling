review/text: Do not buy this package of eight D batteries. I don't know how it happened, but half of the batteries were useless, having been badly damaged. If you do order this item, be sure to open the package as soon as you receive it, and check every individual battery to make sure each of them is functional. I waited too long and was past the date for requesting a refund. Lesson learned. Benefit from my experience!
