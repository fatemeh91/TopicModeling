review/text: This is a high quality hydrocollator pack that's perfect for treating the lower back area. Just put in boiling water for approx 30 minutes and place inside a terry cloth cover by holding the tabs, which don't get hot, and wrap a couple of towels around the terry wrap and you will get 20 to 30 minutes of deep penetrating warm moist heat. As an RN, I must warn all users to never exceed 30 minutes with any hydrocollator treatment. My wife (also an RN) and I like to use a TENS unit underneath the hydrocollator for an extremely effective treatment that's also very cost effective.
