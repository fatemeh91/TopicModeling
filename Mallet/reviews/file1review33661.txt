review/text: Finally, a really good water jet. Water container is large enough so you don't have to keep refilling at one session. Good variable strength (some out there are too weak even at full strength). Looks nice. Easy to set the hose back in its cradle. Highly recommended. First decent one I've bought in a long time. Have been using it a month now.
