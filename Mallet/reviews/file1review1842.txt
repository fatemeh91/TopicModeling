review/text: I bought this product for my granddaughter to try on her eczema. It helped with her itching. I also tried as a body wash. As a women going through menopause, there are places you tend to sweat wear you never sweated before. I was noticing an unpleasant odor and tried different things to help get rid of that. This product smells funny, but it rinses off. I no longer have the odor.
