review/text: I suffer with arthritis in my knees, elbow and hands. This cream has been a life saver for me. I had been buying this cream in a 2 Oz jar from another store. I decided to check on-line and discovered that I could get a 4 Oz jar for a little more than I was paying for the 2 Oz. I ordered three 4 Oz. jars. That will last be for quite a while. A little goes a long way.I read other reviews on this cream. Don't let some of the negative reviews sway you from not trying this cream. It may not work for a few of you. However, more likely than not...it will work for you. You have nothing to lose but the pain. If it doesn't work, you can always return it. So, give it a try and I hope it works for you as well as it has for me.....Also, have a little jar available when you are out and about. It comes in handy when that &#34;Old Arthur&#34; shows up.....
