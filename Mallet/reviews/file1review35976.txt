review/text: I have really sensitive skin so it's easily irratated when shaving...My sister gave me some one year and now this is the ONLY Shave lotion I will use. It's not just for men ladies, it leaves skin very smooth and conditioned. It's kind of pricey, but a bottle last me for a 4 to 5 months way better than those cheap gel cans from target haha! Give it a try you won't be disappointed!
