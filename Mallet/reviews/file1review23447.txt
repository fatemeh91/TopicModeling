review/text: The chest piece is massive and it doesn't sit well on very many surfaces such as a slender arm. But what is worse is that the sensitivity is terrible compared to a standard stethoscope. Even with my good hearing, it was almost impossible to clearly hear a heartbeat. I was very disappointed with this product.
