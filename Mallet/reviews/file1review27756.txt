review/text: This is the perfect quick shake for me right after my workouts. I usually just shake it up with a little skim milk & ice. Even my 12 year old son loves the taste!I am a Nutrition major so I read the labels carefully & this shake meets all of my needs with the amount of protein, low in carbs, and low in sugars.All of that combined with it's great taste are the reasons I will order again.I'm looking forward to trying the banana shake next.
