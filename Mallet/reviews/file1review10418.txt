review/text: I love this tea the taste is really good and it smells good as well my husband and I are year around tea drinkers and also we dont even have to add any sugar ( well I use honey on some teas) but this one you don't need anything extra and I will say it really does work drink plenty of water threw out the day .... And usually in the am you will be cleaning it out lol ... I didn't have any stomach pains or anything but I eat well also!! I recommend this to any and everyone!!
