review/text: I have two doctors who recommended that I dring a Green Vegetabel drink every day. I have Celiacs. As a result, I don't digest and absorb nutrients as I should. With this vegetable dring I get many nutrients in a form that can bypass the digestive system and go straight into my blood stream. My problem was, I am deathly allergic to BEETS. And, almost all the vegetable drinks add beets. I have ended up in the emergency room as a result of ingesting one of them. "Vitality Super Greens" do not contain beets. What a blessing to find this wonderful product. I also need lots of probiotics. I make kefir from fresh raw milk and I know it has many probiotics, as does all ferminted foods. This is one of the things that first attracted me to Vitality Super Greens, the vegetables are ferminted. I don't want to ever be without it.
