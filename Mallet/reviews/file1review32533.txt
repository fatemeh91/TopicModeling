review/text: I'm a nurse, and I use this product for my own personal wound care. If you know what you are looking for, this product is exactly what it claims. I am 100% satisfied with it, and I am purchasing it again. It's not super soft or thick. It can be used for packing a wound, or cleansing. It is absorbant. I use it in conjunction with other products as a filler between other dressings to help absorb drainage from a wound.
