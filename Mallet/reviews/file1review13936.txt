review/text: This lip gloss is great. I've had it for more than four years, I would say. The scent is basically gone but it still works wonders! It leaves a clear shine and smooths lips, too. Out of all my expensive, &quot;long lasting&quot;, twelve bucks and up priced lipgloss, this one cannot be beat!
