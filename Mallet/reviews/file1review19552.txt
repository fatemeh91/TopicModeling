review/text: This was actually my second purchase of this seat. This one is for Grandma's house. We also have a BabyBjorn potty chair. My daughter uses both, but she's getting to the point where she's a little big for the potty chair and likes to use the "big" potty but is still to small for it. So this seat works perfect. It's easy to lift on and off and it fits her behind just fine (she's on the small side). She can easly lift it on and off herself and move it around the house when she wants. A little pricy, but recommended.
