review/text: I've always had difficulty flossing my back teeth and this was a much less wasteful solution than those disposable flossers. This seems sturdy enough to last a long while and I doubt I'll ever have to buy another for myself. It rinses clean easily, is simple to use and comes for a great price.My only complaint is that it's a little too bulky for me. I wish they came in slimmer and shorter sizes, as it would be easier to move around my mouth and use a bit less floss. I do have a relatively small mouth though, so this shouldn't be much of a problem for the average user.
