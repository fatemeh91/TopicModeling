review/text: I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a go and I'm so glad I did! Yes, it hurts a bit. No hair removal treatment is without discomfort but it wasn't unbearable. It simply feels like little pin pricks. I use it every night. The directions say to use it after a shower but for me that made it more uncomfortable. So I use it on dry skin and then smooth on some lotion and good-bye razors!
