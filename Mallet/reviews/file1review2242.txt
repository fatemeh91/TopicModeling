review/text: I am pretty old and have used Gillette blades for over 60 years, so I am a fan.I don't know this for a fact, but it appears to me that Gillette might be lowering the quality of the Mach3. I have used these since they first came out and they have been great. The last few times I have bought new blades they have been dull and uncomfortable to use. It seemed to get a little worse each time I bought new blades. Previously, I used to get about 15 shaves on a blade before changing. It dropped to 10 and maybe a little lower. With the latest batch, they feel dull right from the start and after 3 shaves, I couldn't take any more. I tried 5 or 6 blades and they were the same.I switched to the Gillette Power Fusion blade and it is Fantastic. I couldn't even feel the blade the first couple of shaves. It lasted about 15 shaves and still felt better than the Mach3 that I was talking about. I hope the Fusion blades continue to be as good as the first couple have been.I communicated with the seller and he was great. He apologized and I told him it was not his fault. He credited me with half the purchase price anyway, so he was more than helpful.
