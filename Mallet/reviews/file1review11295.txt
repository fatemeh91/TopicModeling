review/text: A direct quote from the National Institute of Health (NIH) website:"Tea tree oil taken by mouth has been associated with potentially severe reactions, even when used in small quantities. Several reports describe people using tea tree oil by mouth who developed severe rash, reduced immune system function, abdominal pain, diarrhea, lethargy, drowsiness, inflammation of the corners of the mouth, slow or uneven walking, confusion, or coma. There have also been reports of nausea, unpleasant taste, burning sensation, and bad breath associated with tea tree oil use."[...]Solaray Yeast Cleanse has 60mg of tea tree oil in it! I purchased this product based on the recommendation of the "expert" at my local health food store. I originally wanted to purchase caprylic acid and oil of oregano (which I knew from my own research that both were good supplements to fight off Candida). She told me that the Yeast Cleanse contained several other natural ingredients that were recommended to fight chronic yeast infections, so I took her advice and bought it. Two days after I began taking the capsules I had severe abdominal cramping, nausea, a blinding migraine-like headache, and pain in most of my muscles and joints. I looked up the other ingredients in the capsules and was shocked when I found the information on tea tree oil's dangers when taken orally.I realize that these supplements are not "regulated" in the same manner as other medications by the FDA; however, for a company to include a known toxic ingredient in one of their supplements is absolutely irresponsible on THEIR part. I will be returning the remainder of my bottle, along with a copy of the referenced website above, and asking the "expert" for a full refund.
