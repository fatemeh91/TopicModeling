review/text: I'm a skeptic. I'm also, like you, susceptible to getting the occasional cold during the winter months. The only other supplement I've tried to "treat" my cold was Airborne, which I feel did not help one bit. Wellness Formula, on the other hand, not only reduces the severity of my cold, but also the duration. It's not a cure, but honestly I cannot believe how quickly this supplement helps me recuperate. You have to take many pills to have any effect, about 6 capsules every 4-6 hours at the height of your symptoms. If I feel like I am getting sick, I begin a Wellness Formula regimen and I have only mild illness. Until we find a cure for the cold (let's work on cancer first), this supplement makes life a whole lot better through your sniffles.
