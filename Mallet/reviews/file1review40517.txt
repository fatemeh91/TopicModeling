review/text: The third time I used TheraBreath a horrible taste woke me out of a sound sleep. Now it is impossible to drink coffee due to putrid sourness. Only mints and highly acidic food are barely tolerable. Some say I can continue use when/if these side effects disappear. The intensity of this reaction has rendered me fearful of a possible upset to normal functioning.
