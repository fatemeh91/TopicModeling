review/text: I was purchasing this product because it seemed to have a great effect on the Argentine ants that plague us here in Southern Cal.I noticed it didn't do a very good job on the outside upper part of my exhaust fan hood. So naturally I grabbed the bottle of ammoniawhich really works great on grease.I cooked some sausage the other evening and the following morning I lifted the cover to find solidified grease in the pan and on the cover.I sprayed some 4 in 1 on the cover and watched it do absolutely nothing. I moved the grease around with my finger and watched it justbecome a mess. I had to clean up with ammonia and soap. I then tried using Mr. Mean Clean (real cheap stuff from Walmart) and noticedit did the same job on the ants as 4 in 1. I feel like a shmuck buying 4 in 1 three times now.
