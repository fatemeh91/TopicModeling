review/text: The Back Buddy is remarkably simple in concept (I wish I would have thought of it first) and while made of a sturdy plastic, is fully up to delivering on its promises for its intended use. Simply put; it says what it does and does what it says. And insofar as I am concerned; it is worth every penny I paid for it.
