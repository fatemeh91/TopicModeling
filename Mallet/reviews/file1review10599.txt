review/text: I love this product! It's the only one I can find online that has a strong suction to hold the item in place without being afraid it would drop; that has polycarbonate mirror which is 15x stronger than glass; and that has stainless steal rod which will last longer than those cheap chrome plated ones. For the price, it's all worth it! The carry case it comes with is not the prettiest nor the most sturdy but it'll do, to prevent scratches while travelling. I ended up sewing my own using a more cushiony fabric. Now I can put on my makeup without much strain on my back and eyes in those gloomy poorly-lit hotel bathrooms. All in all, highly recommended!
