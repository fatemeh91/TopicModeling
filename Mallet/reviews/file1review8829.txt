review/text: Updated post:I tried this product because an employee at Whole Foods ranted and raved about how wonderful it was. On top of that the reviewers here did so as well. I was expecting something good, but found NOTHING. I did not experience an increase in energy, my digestive system was the same, my overall sense of well being was not improved, and I did not notice any reaction whatsoever. I have always taken herbs and can tell when something is going on. There was NOTHING going on. I've since moved on to my Nature's Secret products, and immediately after only 1 day of use, I can feel them working. Now that's what I'm talking about. Give me something I can feel!Original Post:I GAVE THIS ONE STAR BECAUSE OF ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS THAT MADE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS SO AMAZING. I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY I FEEL. I KNOW OFTEN TIMES WITH VITAMINS AND THE LIKE YOU WON'T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE, BUT EVERYONE WAS RAVING ABOUT HOW THEIR ENERGY AND DIGESTIVE SYSTEMS SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT AFTER USING THIS. I FELT EXACTLY THE SAME.
