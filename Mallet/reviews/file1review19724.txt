review/text: We bought this for our 6 month old son after he started eating solid foods. We do Elimination Communication (EC), and he's been using the Baby Bjorn Little Potty since he was 3 months old. Once he started on solids and his poops were larger and less easy to clean, I wanted to graduate him to a toilet insert. This one is perfect. It fits well, is easy to put on and take off, and is easy to clean. He is just as comfortable on it as he was on the Little Potty, and it's not so large that I worry about him falling in. Highly recommend as the next step after the Little Potty.
