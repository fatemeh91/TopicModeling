review/text: The is the best so far to reach in a gap next to my wisdom teeth. Food particles gets trapped too easily for me, and this helps keeps it clear. Tough meat particles can compact, and the pulses / vibrations helps slide in the gaps and shake the particles out. Otherwise, it gets infected after 2-3 days that no amount of brushing can help along the days.I love the hummingbird, but I hate it. I go through 3-4 of these each year because it is not durable and 9 of the 10 that I have broke at the same small pieces of tiny bulging plastics that suppose to lock the green part to the motor in the battery chamber.When I use a non-powered flossers, they seem to stretch the floss from plastic handles or cartridges. Hence, it looses any force or pressure to do anything; hence, a "limp" floss. When meaty particles get tightly compacted, regular floss or non-powered flosses can put more pressure that can causes actual pain than trying to remove the particles. The slight vibrating, help it slide easily between the tight gaps between my teeth--the floss line seems stronger this way. (I have tried without batteries, and the floss stretches "limp" like other plastic floss disposibles / devices.I would give it 5 stars if I it were built to handle more durability. I am duducting more stars because I cannot find them anywhere anymore, and I am still addicted to it. Unfortunately, I am on my last one, and I refuse to pay for another one. Now, I cannot find any locally, and the one onlines are 3x the cost that I paid for it. (Seriously, I am visiting my oral surgeon to get those wisdom teeth removed; this device helped me avoid the issue for 2 years.)
