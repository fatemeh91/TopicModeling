review/text: Ohk...my lips recently got sunburned and the few vodka shots i had later surely didnt help things. So now i got painful, dry, peeling lips. I saw this product while checking out at the local walmart and picked it up. I have bought it previously and dont really remember anything good nor bad about it from that time. Anyways, this feels great as soon as you put it on but within a minute it has soaked up the liquid and your lips feel even more parched than before! Even when you add more right away it doesnt seem to improve. I am extremely disappointed with this product but the price isnt bad at $2.49. Additionally, my daughter, whose lips are not chapped loves it...go figure!
