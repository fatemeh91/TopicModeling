review/text: I've used this seat for all of my kids. I've tried others and all have fallen short of this one. This seat goes onto the toilet seat already there and there is a dial you turn on the back of the seat that secures it so it does not slide, slip or move. My kids can put this seat on the toilet and secure it by themselves. So if you're tired of emptying out the stand alone potty seats you need to buy this seat. My kids feel safe and secure using this seat. BabyBjorn really knows how to make good quality things that are practical, well priced and long lasting. I've used this seat for many years without a single problem. If you're looking for the right potty seat for your little ones, this one is the one you should get, hands down.
