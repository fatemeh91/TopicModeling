review/text: Purchased these for a friend as I have a pair myself and they are the BEST tweezers in the world, bar none. I think if you have longer fingers you might wanna spring for the regular sized slant tweezers but since my hands are small these are the perfect size/grip. I have used nothing but tweezerman mini slant tweezers for the past five years. I swear by them.
