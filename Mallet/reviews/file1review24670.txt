review/text: Mixed feelings for the Zantrex-3.For my husband -- positive results. He bagan taking the pills in 12/09, followed the directions properly and has lost 70 lbs as of today. He had the same side-effect symptoms as the other reviewers but he toughed it out and now looks wonderful. No workouts either. Just watching what he is eating and taking the pills. He continues to take them to maintain his weight...just lesser dosages.For me -- negative results. Watching my husband's dramatic weight loss, I followed his lead and began taking the pills in 5/10. As of today, I have lost 11 lbs. I have to admit, I am not follwoing the directions properly because the side-effects are just too much for me and very scary. Cannot handle the nausea, jitters, shortness of breath, chest pains and at times...sleep loss.
