review/text: These arch supports helped resolved my plantar fascsitis problem. I bought them many years ago and remembered they helped me, so i did a search and found them. My husband saw how well they worked for me and purchased them for himself, resolving his problem quickly too. They saved me from physical therapy and I'm very happy. We still use them all the time and never had another flare up. They fit very well.
