review/text: Just got it today, and tried it out, so far so good!!! It's very comfortable, a clean shave with no pulling, and it's convenient that everything is in one piece!!!! The only downside is that my buddy bought the exact same thing at Walmart for the same price! Would have been five stars, but minus one for offering it at the same price as Walmart!
