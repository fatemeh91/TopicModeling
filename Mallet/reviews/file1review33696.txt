review/text: I've been a Waterpik WP-60 user for the last 25 years, and in spite of the fact that I usually had to replace the unit every 4-5 years (either the hose or the pump wore out), I kept going back to it because it did a decent job flossing. So, when my last purchase died a month ago, I went ahead and ordered one with the reasonable expectation that this 2012 edition would be pretty much the same as the older ones. DEFINITELY NOT. Some yahoo at WaterPik decided to cut corners and &#34;improve&#34; on it, and by doing that they totally screwed it up. Waterpik should be ashamed to even put this item on the market. So, what is wrong with the flosser? The fact that it weighs about half of the old one should've been the first tell-tale sign that something is going to be messed up. Sure enough, the wattage has gone down to half of what it used to be and consequently there is just not enough pressure to do any decent job. I hate it and am going to return it and feel screwed for even having to pay for shipping it back. I used it only once, but it was once too many. SHAME, SHAME.
