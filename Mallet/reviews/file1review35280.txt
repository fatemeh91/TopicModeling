review/text: I work at a machine shop with my pops and I'm constantly exposed to noise. Not super loud ear piercing noise, more of a constant droning on of gear machines all day. It's tolerable and I didn't use ear pro for a long time because of it but then I noticed one day that my dad has terrible hearing and I believe it's because of the noise at the shop. Hmm.... I better get some ear plugs but I don't want huge muffs on my head or disposable ones that I have to keep replacing. I got these at a retail store for 3 bucks or so and I love them. I believe on the insert it says they're not meant for sudden loud noises like gunfire, but are more for the kind of noise I use them for, lower volume consistent noises. They work great because I can still hear people and have conversations but the louder noises are toned down. It's almost like someone turned the treble down on my stereo. This is an added bonus because I can hear noises that aren't supposed to be there because the machine noise is toned down.... I can hear a machine running funny that my dad can't hear because he can only hear the shop noise. Oh and they're adjustable for different ear sizes.... 1 or 2 of the 3 knobs can be cut off to accomodate bigger ears. Just be sure you need to because once they're cut, they're cut! Get 'em!
