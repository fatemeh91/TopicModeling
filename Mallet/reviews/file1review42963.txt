review/text: I use these with the Goodnight Bunion straightener because the device rubs the second toe. I put one of these over the second toe and the device feels better. Also I wear one during the day to keep my toe from bending down because it hurts when I curl my second toe due to capsulitis of the second toe. It's a little bulky in the shoe.
