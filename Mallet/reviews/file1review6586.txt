review/text: This is an awesome tool! I have to rely on myself when my muscles in my back and neck hurt and this is tool is great! Makes it easy to massage all parts of the body with out a massage therapist. The only down side is the small booklet that comes with it is very basic and only has pictures to show you. This booklet needs to be more informative but other than that this is the best tool for self massage and trigger point pressure work. I did find that to make it easier and smoother I put a little massage oil or cream on the end that I am using for the back, keeps the friction down and it doesn't feel like your tearing the skin.
