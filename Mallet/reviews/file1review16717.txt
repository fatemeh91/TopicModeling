review/text: I got a display zippo....covered in scratches from top to bottom front and back. 1 star gone.This of course means the lighter didnt click as sharply as a new one should, which made was another star deduction.Lastly it was not advertised to be a display zippo, it was displayed to be NEW. As a result of false advertisement, another star.If the company would give me back my 10 $ and pay for shipping i would return it.Sadly thats not the case.
