review/text: My son is the one that uses these the vanilla is his favorite we ordered both vanilla and choc this time and he said the choc was rich. They work wonderfully for helping him bulk up he can drink one before lifting and one shake after lifting and it greatly reduces the soreness and gives him energy. With these he gained apox. 10 lbs in the first week and now gains 2-6 a week depending on the week. My son has trouble gaining weight he will eat 3500 calories a day and not gain an ounce. With these shakes I buy him Vit D milk to mix with them. This is a wonderful way to add more calories to his daily intake while making sure his muscles are getting all the extra they need. Timing is important due to the shake being filling.
