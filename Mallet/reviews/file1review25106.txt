review/text: This powder tastes absolutely VILE. I got it because I was on a low carb diet and someone had recommended it, but I don't know what they were thinking. I drink my protein right after workouts at the gym, so I don't have the luxury of hiding it's taste with milk, fruit and ice. I mix it straight with water and it's disgusting. There are several other brands that have low carb powders which taste great when mixed with water.
