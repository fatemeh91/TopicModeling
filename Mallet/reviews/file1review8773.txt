review/text: I've been using this product for over a year. In the beginning, I drank it with water and it tasted like grass. I have since discovered mixing it in with fruit smoothies and, to me, that's the only way to go. You can barely taste it. Your smoothie might be brown or green but it tastes so much better. I feel like it does help with my energy levels and I do not get sick... not even colds. Also, one of the negative reviews always seems to pop up about the iron content issue. This does not seem to be an issue any longer. I'm receiving version 10.3 and it has 3.74 grams of iron in it. I highly recommend this green drink.
