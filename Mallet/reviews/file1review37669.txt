review/text: Nair Washable Waxing Gel Hair Remover is wonderful. It's very easy to use. There's no preparation and clean up is great, it just washes away with water. After use, my skin felt very soft. And there was no odor. For the price, this product is terrific. It performed just as well as more expensive products, if not better. I'd recommend it to friends and family.
