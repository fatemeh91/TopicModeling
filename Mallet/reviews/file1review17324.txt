review/text: This is a simple device, but also a great devise. The price is also a bargain for the power it delivers and I like the easy front dial to change the trimming height. Only comment I have would be to add some sort of lock so it stays in place when applying force under your chin / neck areas. In addition, I wish it had some type of charge indicator light or screen to show the power levels. I give it 4 stars and would buy again, just wish they added those 2 things.
