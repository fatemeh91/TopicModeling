review/text: I did not pay attention on the negative feedbacks of this item. I regret I did not. Trust me, you will suffer from this vitamin or whatever it is. My period is late 8 days and all those eight days I have a terrible pain in my female area I cannot even hold myself without analgesics. Please, listen to my review, this medicine is not helping, it destroys the body. I do not know if I will be able to recover from this. I do not know if I got any sickness such as cancer or fibrosis, because 8 days late for the period is too much for me and this Friday I am going to the gynecologist.
