review/text: I love Homedics, I own the Quad Roller 400 (which is amazing btw), but thats another review, that being said, I was really looking forward to an awesome neck massage from this company. Three things annoyed me so much that I returned it to Amazon.1. The material snagged when I took it out of the box. THAT won't work at my house. I shouldnt have to treat it like a pair of silk pantyhose to keep it looking nice. Its a pillow!2. It is way to thick for my tastes, my earlobes were touching the pillow, and the buzzing noise was most annoying as well. It should be thinner and more adjustable like a bean bag.3. The vibration itself was lame and I couldn't get the vibrator situated to the side of my neck without turning the thing every which way, then, when I did get it there, my chin was way up in the air because the pillow is so thick.So, as you can tell, I can not recommend this product. Although, Homedics, if youre reading this, contact me, I have a great idea for soothing that area of the body :)
