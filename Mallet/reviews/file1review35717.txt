review/text: I have been a long-standing and happy user of this product, although I am a bit disquieted by the price, However, I felt compelled to leave the following comment on Similasan, USA's web site:"I note with a mix of amusement and annoyance that the printed directions on this product have changed. Recent packaging had stated that one should use 1 to 2 drops in each eye. Now, those same instructions have changed to recommending 2 to 3 drops. I have very large eyes, and I can assure you that the eyedrops will overflow and run down my cheek if I put three drops into one eye.This gives the appearance, at least to me, of having everything to do with improving your financial bottom line, and little or nothing to do with the efficacious usage of the product. In short, it seems designed to sell more bottles of the product. It does not smell quite honest."Moral of the story: use the product with confidence, but limit it to 1 to 2 drops and save yourself some dough.
