review/text: I bought a couple of these for shin splints. They're a good idea but not very well executed. They're difficult and awkward to get on. It's basically an ice pack inside a stretchy sleeve as opposed to a single integrated unit. The ice pack is only sewn to the sleeve at the very top and bottom, so the rest of it is loose and likes to bunch up. Also, it never feels particularly cold, even fresh out of the freezer. It's cold, yes, but it's almost like it's so insulated that you can't feel it very much. Doesn't last very long either. I like the idea of compression + cold, and this delivers on the compression, but not so much on the cold. Better than nothing, I'm sure, but I'm now shopping for something better.
