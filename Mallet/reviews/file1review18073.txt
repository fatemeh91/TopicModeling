review/text: I got this in "mums" and black (for me and my husband). My husband has taken a liking to it and I see him use it pretty much every night. I use it occasionally... the mums print is so cute!!! But I like it primarily for the unique print and SOMEWHAT ergonomic, contoured shape. The shape looked great in photo, but it doesn't lay flat on the sides of my nose... the inverted "V" shape part is a tad too wide/big for me. Perhaps if you had a bigger nose or the entire nose area were sticking out more, this would fit perfectly. I almost wish that they just cut a slit for the nose instead of a "V", so the flaps will lay over the sides of the nose.. I would imagine that will fit more people's facial shape and will keep lights out more effectively. I wonder if I should've tried the "Lights out" one also available on Amazon... but they just weren't as stylish : P
