review/text: This is the best lubriant I've found. But, as the instructions warn, the contents may leak if the bottle is not stored upright.So wouldn't you think that would make it clear to the manufacturer that this product requires a screw-on cap? The fliptop cap provided is totally inadequate. How complex a thought process does that require?
