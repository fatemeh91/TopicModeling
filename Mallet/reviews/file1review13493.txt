review/text: Broke both leg bones at the ankle and needed something smaller than the Big Boot to wear at night so i could sleep and be more comfortable. This has been great gives support and i can wear this during the day at times in my work boot. Started wearing it after 4 months in the Big Boot and has been a huge relief. Has side support so i know i am protected too gives me more confidence.
