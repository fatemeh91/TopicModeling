review/text: We've been using this diaper pail since my daughter was born 10 months ago. We don't use the touch-free option, so I can't really comment on that. We keep the pail inside a pull-out cabinet in the changing table, and the top of the cabinet would always set off the motion sensor and cause the lid to open when the cabinet was closed, so we turned off the motion sensor and we just open it manually, which is fine. The diaper pail broke after just a few weeks of use, and now the top doesn't quite close all the way, but I think that was our fault for trying to overload it. It still worked okay for several months, even without being able to close it all the way (maybe because we keep it inside a cabinet, which keeps the smell contained for the most part).Bottom line: Even though it's not a perfect product, I am about to buy another one of the exact same thing. The one we have now has served us well enough, even though it has been broken for most of the time we have been using it. We will be sure not to overload the new one, so hopefully it will not break. I don't mind not being able to use the touch-free feature. And it just fits so well in our nursery that I don't want to risk buying a different kind and having it not work as well for our needs.
