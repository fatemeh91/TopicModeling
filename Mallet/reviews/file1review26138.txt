review/text: Texture doesn't really spread well on lips, and is a bit too solid. (You feel like you're getting too much out of the pot every time you slide your finger over it.) The glass jar made me nervous every time I dropped it, and in in the end, I went back to the lip balm I loved better from C.O. Bigelow. The smell is honey-esque and fragrant, however, but this doesn't make it a product that merits its price.
