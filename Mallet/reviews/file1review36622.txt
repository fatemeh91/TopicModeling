review/text: I was pregnant all through cold and flu season and took Wyldewood Cellars' elderberry concentrate every day to boost my immunity (when expecting you are very susceptible to illness and infection). Despite nursing my husband and three children through multiple illnesses including colds, stomach viruses and strep throat, I sailed through the season without getting sick once. This is absolutely amazing to me because I've always gotten sick at least a few times a year ever since I can remember, and since I've had children I'm exposed to even more now. Plus, while taking the concentrate my immune system was already weakened due to pregnancy.Assuming cold and flu season was over, I quit taking it around April. In May a really bad cold went through the whole family and this time I got it. Wish I had not stopped taking the supplement!So now we keep it in our home for EVERYBODY to take all year round. All you need is 1 tsp a day (2 tsp if you feel something coming on).This is really great to try for children who have repeated throat and/or ear infections and have taken too many antibiotics. And if elderberry doesn't work for certain bacterial infections, your next line of defense is Silver Biotics. Both great products that you should keep in your medicine cabinet all the time.
