review/text: I have a very heavy beard, so I was looking for something that would be preferable to the pain and mess of a wet shave, but be as close and effective. Unfortunately, like every other electric shaver I've ever tried, this is not it. It does an admirable job, I suppose on "average" beards, or for midday touch ups. But, for me, it's pretty useless and the fact that it comes with so many parts and maintenance requirements, I wish I hadn't made the purchase.
