review/text: I have tried other proteins, from local stores and from walmart (6 star), but I have had very good results with ON. I have used one 5 lb package and now on my second one. Nothing has changed in my workouts except the protein. I have built muscle and my one rep max has gone up.I am 55 years old and have been lifting steady for a few years.I wish I would have had protein supplements when I was younger...I am now trying Casein at bedtime...
