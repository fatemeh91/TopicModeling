review/text: ....with a few nitpicks of course. Price and effectiveness are fine, its much easier to floss with this thing (particularly with the back teeth!!) than it is with just plain floss or those cheezy disposable plastic flosser/pick things. In my opinion though I think they should've made it out of something a little stronger. Oh it doesn't feel or look flimsy at all at first, but in order to get good tension on the floss while putting it on you have to squeeze the arms of the floss holder together fairly firmly, otherwise the floss can fall off the holder easily or be difficult to pull out of the tight spots. I've only been using mine for a few days but I'm always worried I'm going to accidentally snap it while putting the floss on (and no I'm not squeezing the arms together more than the 3/4" the instructions specify!!) since it appears to be made out of cheap acrylic plastic, which in my experience doesn't hold up well to pressure at all. Perhaps its just me being worried over nothing...
