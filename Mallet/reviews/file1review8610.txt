review/text: This brush will make a good bathroom brush since it is narrow. It will clean behind the faucet and other tight area's. I also bought the other set of two (2) OXO brushes (a few months ago) so now I'm set for cleaning. I can throw away all the old tooth brushes. I have never found anything wrong with any of the OXO products I have purchased. Another great brush from OXO!!
