review/text: I recently bought this Support at 18 weeks pregnant and now I am at almost 23. I am a hairdresser and on my feet all day and this really helps support the baby and my back so back pain is gone. If I do not wear it now I feel like the baby is being bounced around too much. Great product. thanks
