review/text: My wife was very excited to try this one, but over all was disappointed. The rubbery feel and smell are a turn off, as others have noted. You have to use a lot of lube or it snags on the way in. She liked the length and was able to easily use it with both hands or one hand. Excellent for deep penetration but the rubbery texture pulls her pubic hair. Also felt it was just a bit to big around for comfort vaginally, but for anal fun it really does the job. We still use it regularly, but it's not the first toy she reaches for.
