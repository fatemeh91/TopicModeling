review/text: When it arrived, it was crushed at the top, and held that shape, seemed like it wouldn't be able to clean bottoms of glasses. I thought, just great, and nearly threw it in the trash, but in a drawer instead. A couple of days later I found it, and it had bounced back. Now, it's used regularly and does get to the difficult to reach bottoms of glasses, mugs, anything. $5 is still too much, but it's a good brush.
