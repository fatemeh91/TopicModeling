review/text: I had 2nd degree varicose vien.. and when I tried this one it was so comforting & &helped; to reduce the pain even the days I don't wear & easly I waer it &..I'm waering on weakly alternate with other pantyhose I bought from Amazon store but the size is large which a little bit time consuming to put on .I liked the materex of this pantyhose also , it's not niether harsh nor irritating, & I appreicate that it made with ventilation part to avoid infection from long time wearing tight clothes , which was not with my old previous pantyhose I bought years back from a local pharmacy .thank Jobst..:)I'm reordering other piece but black ..
