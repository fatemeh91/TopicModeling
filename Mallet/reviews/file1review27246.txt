review/text: Been doing P90X and wanted a protein supplement to help me recover after workouts. I went for the "Extreme Chocolate Milk" flavor and mixed a scoop up with a glass of milk and it tasted like just like chocolate milk. I used a whisk to stir so I wouldn't get any lumps and this tastes delicious. I thought I was going to have to force myself to drink a protein shake, but not with this!Love the flavor and it's a great way to get a boost of protein!
