review/text: I've been looking for a daily vitamin with extra folic acid for at least five years and I've tried about as many brands. Some cost more than 3x as much as this! All of them have upset my stomach except Rainbow Light. I'm planning to conceive soon but I think this would be a great multi-vitamin for any woman.
