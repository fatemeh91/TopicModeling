review/text: I bought mine at least a decade ago, after a couple of other models broke or ripped me up. This one has never failed. Yes, sometimes I have to smack it to make the contacts work. Yes, sometimes it starts up slowly before reaching full RPM. I have one in my shaving kit and one in my medicine cabinet. I've replaced the batteries here and there, but not so often that it seems like they drain quickly - honestly, at least a couple of years between changes. But I like it - it is small, it works, it fits in your hand, and it does the job.
