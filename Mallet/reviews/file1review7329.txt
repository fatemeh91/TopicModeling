review/text: With all the options out there, purchasing a foot spa can be tricky. Some will lure you with fancy wording, cheap prices, and seemingly attractive features. I spent a lot of time doing research, and ulitmately chose this foot spa.I bought this with my fiance in mind about a year ago. She wears heels almost every day, and with that comes sore feet. I wouldn't no personally, you ladies can back me up on that. Anyway, after trying this out, my fiance LOVED it and couldn't get enough! She said her feet felt rejuvenated, and after trying it myself, wow, this thing WORKS!The heat is fantastic. No need to preheat water as the heater works fast. The jets are powerful and massaging. The remote is a great feature for the ultimate control in turning the heater on and off, as well as the jets. The spa holds a good amount of water without splashing it everywhere, and it holds my feet with just a little bit of room left, which are a men's size 11.If you do your research you will see many many complaints about other products, and I feel if you are looking for something good, but realtively inexpensive, Brookstone has the foot spa for you.Only down side, you cannot add anything like bath salts or any of those other skin products. However, I bought my fiance some awesome foot cream, and the combination has her pleased! Definitely recommended!
