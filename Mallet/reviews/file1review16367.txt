review/text: I ordered this tub after spending the last year addicted to Proraso/C.O. Bigelow. While I love the morning "pick me up" from the mentholated Italian offering, I wanted to add in some variety.I decided, after looking at several sites (badgerandblade.com, superlather.com, italianberber.com, etc...) that I would go with an English cream, as they got some of the best reviews. I looked at and vacillated between Taylor, Truefitt and Hill, and Geo F. Trumper. The latter two were prohibitively expensive, so I decided to go with one that was about half the price. I have always loved the smell of limes and citrus, and think it is actually a rather manly scent, so I ordered the Lemon/Lime variety. Oh boy...While I have no complaints about the performance of the Taylor, I need to state that it certainly doesn't live up to my expectations of the traditions expressed from previous reviewers. Simply stated, it smells like Sprite. Flat Sprite. Flat Sprite that has sat in the sun and is starting to grow a thin film of algae on top. Well, the last may be extreme, but you get my drift. To summarize, I had high hopes for this cream. It surpasses my hopes for moisturizing and comfort, but the scent makes it hard for it to be a regular, everyday shave cream. I still find myself alternating between the Taylor, Proraso, and occasionally I toss in a Col. Conk shave soak, typically the almond or lime.Hope this helps, but if not, then feel free to comment. Enjoy your shaves - they're with you all day!
