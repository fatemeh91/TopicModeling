review/text: For a while, I thought was suffering from rosacea. The dermatologist tried a few treatments on me that ALL fried my skin and left me worse off than I was to begin with. I've been using this cream for about a year and a half now along with pine tar soap which is very moisturizing and the red, blotchy is almost completely gone and my skin feels smooth and soft now.I was buying this in the health food stores, but it's 3-5 dollars cheaper on amazon than in the stores. Plus I don't have to pay for the gas to drive there.
