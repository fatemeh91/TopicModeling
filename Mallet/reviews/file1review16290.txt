review/text: This stuff is great. It will get anything clean. I ordered it to go with my new Bosch dishwasher and put in pans that had 3 day old, baked on junk left over from making a scratch cake to which I had added, fruit, nuts and sunflowers seeds. The dirt and grime slid of the pots and pans as easily as it did off the glasses. The glasses, even in Arizona hard water, came out nice and clean.Here is how the box says they work: 1. The red ball in the tablet is a soaker agent which gets rid of dried on stuff like the old cake in the pan. The blue is a cleaner which gets off the rest of the stuff like the stain on the bottom of the pan left by the oven. The 3rd part, or white part of the tablet is jet dry which gets rid of spots and film.I have an extra Jet Dry product in my dispenser which is supposed to aid with drying as I do not have an electrical coil for dryin as my dishwasher is a Bosch. I do not know if that has any effect on the dishes at all. It should not.So, I was duly impressed and suggest that the prodct works fine.I have heard that this type of prodct wears out the dishwasher motor, but it was recommended by Bosch, so I will go ahead an use it. I am very pleased with it.
