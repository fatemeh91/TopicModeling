review/text: When told I had a fatty liver I was surprised because I've been taking pretty good care of it. But when I saw Silymarin Milk Thistle and learned of it healthful properties I was intrigued. Hoping the product cleanses and support my big fat liver, I will continue to take it with trust in my heart that it's doing the trick.
