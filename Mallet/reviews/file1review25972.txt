review/text: I purchased this watch for my husband who is blind and needs reminders to take meds. The watch worked great for about 3 months. Could not beat performance or volume. After 3 months the watch kept reseting all alarms to factory and turned all alarms on. Even after replacing the battery the problem still remained. I am going to try another one just incase this one was bad. The price makes that doable and my husband loves it. I will also buy a different watch just in case.
