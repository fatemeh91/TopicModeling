review/text: I used to use the wheybolic Extreme that they sell at GNC, but it had way too many calories in it. This was a nice mix of relatively low-calories, decent taste, and just enough protein. I drank this throughout the day, not just before or after my workout, so I went through the whole thing in a month. I have no qualms with this product.
