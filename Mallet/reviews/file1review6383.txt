review/text: I am a massage therapist, and I also have a car accident injury that doesn't want to heal. I used a Theracane before at physical therapy, but I find the shapes on this tool allow more options and advantages to trigger point treatments. It is a bit big, but following the small pamphlet included does help in managing self-therapy angles. Overall, I am happy with the purchase.
