review/text: After receiving this splint, I practiced most of the splint forms on the SAM instructional page. This thing is rock-solid when using the "T", "V", or "C" patterns; I cannot imagine any flexible light splint being any stiffer (disclosure: I have never used the original SAM splint). It is very comfortable also. I use it in my backcountry medical kit, but with pricing this cheap- why not get an extra to practice with? BTW, my splint came folded (not rolled, as pictured) which is much more convenient for storing and deploying.
