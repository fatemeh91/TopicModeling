review/text: I've recently started taking more medications, and as I've been schlepping around with more and more pill bottles in my handbag, I decided to try to simplify with a pill organizer. I take my pills throughout the day - some while I'm at work eating breakfast, some while eating lunch at work, and the remainder at home in the evening. This Apex organizer had some of the best reviews, and while it seemed from the photos it may be more capacity than I need, I decided to give it a shot. After using the organizer for a week, I don't think I'm much better off than just carrying all of the individual bottles. The one positive is that I can ensure that I don't miss any doses or accidentally take an extra dose. Any organizer would accomplish this, however.I have a few problems with this particular organizer. The first is that it's just too big for my needs - about half the size of my palm. (I see other reviewers writing that they don't feel this has enough capacity, so this will obviously vary for each person.) I think I would be better off with a one-piece organizer that I could fill up once a week and stick in my handbag, and then not worry about for the rest of the week. Otherwise, unless I want to put several of these compartments in my bag each day (defeating my goal of saving space), I need to worry that I may forget one day. For that reason, I think this organizer would work better for people who primarily take their pills at home.I do like that each daily compartment has a separate AM and PM section, but I don't like that opening the lid exposes both sections. People with arthritis will need to scoop the pills out from each section, because attempting to dump them in your hand would cause both sections to empty.From the photo, it looks as though the compartments would be secure in the tray, but they are not. They lay in the tray very loosely. This may be a feature that benefits those with arthritis, but it is not ideal for me.
