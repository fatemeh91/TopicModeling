review/text: I have a significant other who snores. A lot. I am a heavy sleeper but it was no match for me. We tried everything on his end, nose strips, nasal inserts, new pillows, nothing worked. So to avoid anymore sleepless nights on the couch I had to do something on my end. I chose these since the reviews said they were better for women's smaller ear canals. I can't say enough. They worked like a charm! You have to get the hang of using them, squeezing them so they're small enough to fit all the way into your ear. But once you do it's pure bliss. Definitely a life saver!
