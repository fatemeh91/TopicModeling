review/text: Works extremely well!!!! You will experience some burps with a strong orange aftertaste for about an hour or two after taking, if my heartburn has been especially bad then there will be some burning with these burps. But it passes and seems to rebalance my stomach acids and definitely has long lasting effects. After the first month my heartburn is nearly gone but will very gradually come back over the next 2-3 months if I eat poorly (soda, sloppy joes, pizza, etc). But this works for the long term and gets you past the daily popping of antacids.
