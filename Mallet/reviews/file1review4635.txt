review/text: Spic and Span. Cinch. Glass & Multi-Surface Cleaner: Refill 64 OZ $5.85I ordered 5 of these since they were the ORIGINAL Clean Fresh Scent and the price was outstanding for a 64 oz refill. It is NOT what I received so I can't even give it a 1 star. The company, SOAP.COM, wrote me a letter stating I needed to get back with AMAZON.... that AMAZON was in the process of buying their company but the deal basically had not been sealed.So I received 5 32oz bottles of the NEW SPIC & SPAN and it does not have the CLEAN FRESH SCENTso this OFFER is BOGUS.I wrote the SOAP.COM who told me to get in touch with AMAZON.COM so I have no idea of the out come. BUT if you order this as listed you will NOT receive the 64 oz refill as listed.Susan PChesapeake, VA
