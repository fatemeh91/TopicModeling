review/text: I tried DGL on the advice of my gastroenterologist because of severe reflux. None of the prescription meds were taking care of it. But this stuff did the trick. I take one after a heavy meal and 2 at bedtime. Finally, some relief. Just make sure you get the german chocolate flavor, and not the natural.
