review/text: I had recently tried a package of Doctors brand brushpicks and was very happy with them so I thought I'd give these a try. I was disappointed and somewhat annoyed. First, they come stuck together so you have to manually separate them and put them in the case. Of course I washed my hands first, but fondling all my toothpicks before storing them for later use is not my idea of a good idea. Second, the case is not big enough to store all 40 picks so I had to find some alternative storage for the remainder. Then later, I guess I'll have to fondle the rest of them in order to reload the case. Contrast this with the Doctors brand which come already in a case with a flip top and a hole that can dispense a single pick at a time. Much more convenient and sanitary. I had enjoyed other GUM products in the past but I won't be getting these again unless they drastically change the packaging.
