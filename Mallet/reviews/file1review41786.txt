review/text: I got this toothbrush because I was getting braces (I'm in my 30s, not a teenager), and was concerned about how to keep my teeth clean during the orthodontia. Well, my teeth do get clean with this toothbrush, definitely. But I have complaints too.As someone else remarked, messiness is an issue. Water and toothpaste and saliva drip down the toothbrush to my fingers unless I hold it at a downward-pointing angle at all times, which doesn't feel natural.Also, a full recharge takes a *long* time, pretty much eight hours; and on days when my braces are making my teeth sensitive, this toothbrush feels almost like a dentist drill. There is a "sensitive" setting, which helps a bit, but on the truly sensitive days, I just turn it off entirely and use it like a non-power toothbrush. A little ridiculous, no?I've tried smaller, cheap, AA-battery-powered brushes, and they don't seem to hurt. Granted, they don't clean nearly as powerfully either. But keep the above points in mind before getting the Braun, if you've got teeth that complain a lot.
