review/text: Well worth the money. I'm satisfied with this purchase. I do agree with another reviewer about the large sticker on the cane. There are actually 2 stickers on the front that distract from the cane. It took about 40 minutes and an application of "Goo Gone" and the problem was solved. I wouldn't let the stickers be an obstacle to buying the cane. But if you want the higher priced colors and don't want to take the time to remove the stickers then it is something to think about. The cane is lightweight but very sturdy. I trust it completely. The 4 rubber feet really give a sense of security. At [$...] bucks, free shipping, and a quality product you can't go wrong.
