review/text: We bought the Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer after looking around and trying to find another seat that will fit on our elongated toilet. This one fits. There's a little dial on the bottom that easily adjusts to whatever seat you have. There are no corners that they can get hurt on. Both my older one (3.5) and my younger one (2) fit on it without worrying about slipping through. There is a splash guard that doesn't get in the way. The only problem is that it doesn't have handles for my kiddies to hold.
