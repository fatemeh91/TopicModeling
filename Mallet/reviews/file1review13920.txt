review/text: The designer of this product seemed more interested in packaging, shipping and storage of this product that the use of it. The "prongs" are made of some sort of cheap plastic that enables the product to be packaged using less space because the prongs come disassembled. I had mine a week and the first prong broke - a week later another prong broke. I glued them but the break was in a place that would not hold. I would not recommend buying this product.
