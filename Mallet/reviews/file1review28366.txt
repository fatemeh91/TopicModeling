review/text: They used to have the single one time buy for under 40 but now you can only get that price if you subscribe to a monthly mailing of it. I don't like that because I don't necessarily go through that much of this powder. Not sure if you can subscribe, get the subscription price mailed once, then cancel before your next arrival.Otherwise, it's a great protein powder. Taste is good and not too sweet. Double chocolate is the best.
