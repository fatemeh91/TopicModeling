review/text: I started using this as a general pre dishwasher scrub brush based on another Amazon review I saw on this product. I also use it to clean the sink and to clean out my recycling cans and bottles. It is the best overall cleaning brush I have ever used. The long flexible handle allows access to almost any item. I pop it in the dishwasher periodically and even the most stubborn food items come off - things like scrambled eggs and bread dough. It has held up well under heavy daily use for the last three months. And that is a record for me as I'm pretty hard on cleaning tools. I just added it as a permanent item on my shopping list.
