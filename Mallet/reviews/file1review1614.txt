review/text: My daughter had horrible planter warts on her feet. She was embarrassed to let anyone see her feet, always wore socks to hide them. She had been to the doctor, and got shots. She had them frozen, and even tried the liquid wart remover, which by the way the bottle won't dry out if you keep it stored upside down. All those didn't work. I bought the wart stick, and she tried it, but due to lack of patience gave up, after it didn't work. Well, she saw some feet commercials for stuff she wanted but wouldn't due to the warts, so she started using it again, and did it daily. All her warts are gone after 3 years of trying different things, thanks to the wart stick!
