review/text: This product is very good for those that are on a budget. It cheap and is effective for someone who is either beginning a supplement program or for those who are trying to maintain gains or leanness. I don't believe this product would help hardcore bodybuilders and those looking for major gains quickly. As for my personal experience with this product. I noticed that I got a bit leaner with taking this product and my strength increased a little from a month ago. Granted have been working out pretty hard to get ready for the summer season.....so that does also play in as a factor. But I would say the ON whey has help a bit in my quest for the "beach body." I would also say that combined with ON Casein in a supplement program ON Whey has help me recover a bit quicker after a hard work out that I would otherwise. That is an important factor for a somewhat older guy (late 30's.) I like to get out of bed in the morning and not feel like I just work out a hour ago. So high marks in aiding recovery.Mixing and taste. On Whey is easy to mix with all types of methods. Whether it with blender, shaker, even with a spoon, I had no problem with mixing it. As for taste and consistency. It's very light when mixed with water and taste pretty good with it. Though it does leave a slightly funny after taste. But I prefer a heavier consistency. so I mix it with milk. And as far as I'm concerned it tastes great with no after taste.So over all a good solid product. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that this product does not produce big gains in strength or in size.
