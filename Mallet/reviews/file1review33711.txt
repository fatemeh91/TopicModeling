review/text: Zia has some good products. I tried the oil-free moisturizer because I have combination skin and most moisturizers tend to give me a shiny forehead. The Zia doen't give me much shine and is also good for the dryer areas of my face. During the winter, I do use a heavier moisturizer on my dryer areas as the Zia is too light for those areas but still does a fine job on my oilier areas.It's light and absorbs easily. The fragrance is very light and good for men. The ingredients list is good.The downside is that it's a little pricy for what you get. Better priced than some, more expensive than others.
