review/text: I tried this product with the fertility cleanse kit. I can say that it tastes very good. The licorice root is probably the reason, so if you like teas flavored that way you will enjoy drinking this. As for the tea being beneficial, I can't say it was. First, if you research the ingredients the individual ingredients from a legitimate source (e.g. consumer labs or the NIH), you won't find anything to support the claims of what it is supposed to do for the liver. I can't say I feel any different drinking it. But just to drink if you enjoy tea, it is fine.
