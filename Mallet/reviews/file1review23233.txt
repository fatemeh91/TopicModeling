review/text: This sweeper does a fine job of cleaning up; much better than I would have expected for a manual sweeper. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that the dumping mechanism is a bit awkward. There is a lip on the container, so you have to reach in and dirty your hands in order to thoroughly dump it.
