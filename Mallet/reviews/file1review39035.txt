review/text: I use this clipper set to trim my husband's very short hair. He used to go to a stylist who charged him $25 a cut. Because his ideal cut is very close all around, he needed to get a new cut every 4 weeks or so, and those fees really add up quickly. We finally cut the cord with the stylist and bought a home clipper set.The clipper is powerful and does not get too warm. It is easy to use and the included video makes it easy to learn to cut hair. I haven't attempted any of the more complicated cuts, we just use a Number One comb all over my husband's head and clean up the edges without any comb at all. However, we do find all the accessories to be very useful; the brush for cleaning the clippers, the lubricating oil, and the brush for sweeping stray hairs off the neck. Occasionally I use the shears to trim the hair around his ears, too. The kit also has a mirror and a plastic apron, which are helpful to have.You really could use this kit to get started with all kinds of cuts, and Wahl is a good brand for clippers. If you are looking to get started even just occasionally, this is a great kit to have. With what we've saved in hair styling fees, this kit paid for itself a long time ago.
