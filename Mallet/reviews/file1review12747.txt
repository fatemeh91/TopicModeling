review/text: Product arrived promptly and as described.This is an amazing, and affordable, product. Easily moulds to arm or leg. Very light and moldable. Compact, light, and packs easily even in small bags.Tip: I cut one splint in half to use for arm injuries on small adults or children. No sharp edges even after cutting. Well padded - no additional padding will be needed on most fractures. End can be kept rolled up to maintain hand in position of function. Combine with a sling and you are good to go.
