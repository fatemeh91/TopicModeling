review/text: The Thermophor heating pad is truling amazing. It provides deep, moist heat without the mess of soak and heat pads. It does everything it claims to do. The fleece cover takes moisture from the air and when you use it, the treatment area gets wet, but the cover feels dry to the touch. When the air in the house is particularly dry, we hang in on a towel rack in the bathroom during a shower and that does the trick. How did they do that?! The heat is so intense that you can feel your muscles 'pop' as they release. We had to buy a second, because my husband and I were wrestling each other over our first one! I highly recommend this product.
