review/text: This product is the best of its kind that I have ever used. The taste is light and actually yummy, I was so surprised. It is not a heavy greasy oil at all, like some. It's full of natural oils that are really good for you, like sunflower, etc., and no artificial sweeteners, so this is also a plus. My husband and I use it and are very pleased. I highly, highly recommend it - and I don't normally review "intimate" products, LOL. This one is worth reviewing though, you won't be disappointed. At all.
