review/text: This thing has become part of my daily maintenance. I was having extreme back cramping from surfing and other heavy activity and once I started using the buddy on a regular basis the cramping subsided and after two-three weeks was gone! 5 Chiropratic visits and 90 minute massage did not work but my new buddy sure did the trick!
