review/text: I absolutely love this. After using it for the first time, I wondered why dint I order it before. It picks up absolutely every single dirt on the carpet. Does not require power or dragging along the big vacuum and struggling with the power cable. Easy to empty the dirt bin, and the additional comb helps to remove the hair easily off the brush. Does the work faster than the vacuum, and the carpet feels fresh. I don't use the vacuum anymore.Note: This is a carper sweeper, does not work on hard floors.
