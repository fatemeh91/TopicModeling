review/text: I have normal/combination skin that can be slightly oily on my forehead but I have major blackheads and bumpies around my hair line. I bought this Microderm., Acne cream without the resurfacing tool after reading bad review's that the tool broke right away. It worked GREAT with just using a pea size amount on the tips of my fingers and rubbing it in my face and neck for about 2 minutes. I had noticeably smoother skin to the touch and I could see a difference in how even my skin tone was after the first use. The blackheads are still there but have faded. I had slightly dry skin around my chin area after the first couple uses. The directions say to use ever other day but I only use about twice a week to avoid dryness.
