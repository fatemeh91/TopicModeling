review/text: Got this as a gift and have been very happy with it. It actually does exactly what it is supposed to do, and very well.The AA battery supplied works for an hour or so. It may be better to use a rechargeable AA battery. The trimmer is well made, but is made of plastic;so, if you drop it....probably broken. I've had mine for 6 months and it is a joy to use. I also enjoy hearing the thing cut those ear and nose hairs;sort of like the sound of a electric bug zapper.I would highly recommend this trimmer.
