review/text: We bought two of these and am glad we did. We have a flat changing table, and most of the covers seem to be for curved ones. I didn't think I could find my color, but this company did have a purple option. Score! These wash pretty well, and if I were better with the stain stick I'm sure they would remain spotless (mine are not). Glad we have two so there's always something covering the table regardless of how big a mess we made on the last change.
