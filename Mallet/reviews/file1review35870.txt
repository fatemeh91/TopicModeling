review/text: The Nivea face wash, face scrub, and protective face lotion all have a mild scent. This mild version of the balm has a strong, overpowering scent that reminded me of Old Spice or Speed Stick deodorant. I now have a bottle that has been used once, and won't be touched again.The subdued scent of the other Nivea for Men products is not a problem. I'm tempted to try the sensitive skin unscented version of the balm.
