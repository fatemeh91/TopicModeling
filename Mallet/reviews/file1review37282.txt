review/text: Once I discovered how well this product worked for me - I've never changed brands. I can use just about any toothpaste or shampoo product - but I never use anything else but Speed Stick UNscented! I panic when I don't see the light blue banded stick on the shelf - not everyone carries the UNscented! I recommend this to anyone who suffers with deodorant that doesn't last the whole day. This stuff is the BEST!
