review/text: This is a tasty bar, not too heavy on the chocolate. It isn't a ""candy bar"" or ""brownie"" sort of texture (it's lots drier) but for heavens sake, this is a nutritional bar. If I wanted a brownie's moisture and flavor, I'd eat a brownie. For what it is -- a nutritional bar -- it's quite good. And I like the fact that the protein and fat are balanced in a way that helps me absorb the nutritional benefits. Overall, it's tasty snack that's good for me.
