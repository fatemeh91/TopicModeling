review/text: I take this product after my doctor prescribed Niaspan, a time release form of Niacin. Niacin can cause "flushing" which is a tingling burning sensation over your neck arms and chest due to a side effect of niacin. Taking Quercetin totally controls this uncomfortable side effect of taking a niacin based medicine.
