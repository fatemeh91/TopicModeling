review/text: This seat is great - it has a mechanism that fits it to your toilet so it won't rock or slide and is solid plastic construction, so it won't crack like the padded seats do (will definitely last through my babies and can be passed along in great condition). The pee guard doesn't work great for my baby yet (we EC and he's 13 months and small for his age anyway, so it'll probably do better as he grows). He feels safe on it, though, and can sit independently quite well and is similar in shape and feel to his Baby Bjorn Little Potty, so it works for us!
