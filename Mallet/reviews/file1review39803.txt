review/text: i have degenerative disk disease in my lower back...and almost no coushin left in my right knee..so bending down alot when im cleaning is a pain...litteraly...so i bought 3 of these..all 3 have broken in the middle joint with minimal effort the suction cup grippers like to come off..i fixed both these issues thusly...i put small machine screws through the cups and fastened the with small nuts....for the joint i went to the hardware store and bought a 3 foot chunk of 1/2 inch square aluminum channel bar cut it into 3 ...1 foot pieces and slipped over the back at the joint...with the joint in the center i duct taped it on..they work great now
