review/text: My teeth were already pretty white, but wanted a little brighter. Says you notice difference in three days, I noticed in ONE! I had tried the Listerine Dissolving Strips, TOTAL waste, I think I saw more difference just using regular whitening toothpaste. I gave this five stars because it DEFINITELY whitens AND WHITENS FAST!Strips do take a bit getting used to as they can slide around and you have to be very careful when putting them on, but I would definitely use them again. I might get the Premium Plus next time just because there are more strips and that way, if I want to brighten a little more in a few months, there are the extra strips. I also used the Classic Crest Strips and these definitely worked faster and better.
