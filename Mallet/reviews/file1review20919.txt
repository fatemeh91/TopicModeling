review/text: For years I used Norelco shavers and became unsatisfied with them when I could no longer get a good clean shave on my neck. The new Braun is doing much better, although the attached papers indicated it might take a few weeks to adapt to the new shaving heads. I'm quite pleased, I get a good clean shave, the machine is easy to clean and maintain, and quiet. What more could one ask?
