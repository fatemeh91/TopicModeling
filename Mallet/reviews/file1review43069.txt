review/text: This product received great reviews, however, when I received it and tried it on, all the bells and whistles carried no support. I felt just as much support without the straps as with the straps. Moreover, they pulled on my shoulders, making my entire back lean forward. The product did not scream "quality." Cheaper fabric and kind of flimzy. Did not work for me at all.
