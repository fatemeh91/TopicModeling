review/text: This is a puzzling product: You use it like a regular toothbrush, but you have to remember to keep your wet finger or thumb on the metal strip on the handle. It has a fancy long term cell battery in the handle, but there is no real sense that it does anything.Yet, my teeth felt different the first time I used it. I didn't even use toothpaste (and I use pricey paste for sensitive teeth). Pros: the brush head size is small, and it fits everywhere in my small mouth. The brush is soft, yet I don't have to push hard on the brush to feel produce results. My teeth feel clean. It's easy on the gums, too. It's much lighter and more pack-able than my electric toothbrush.Cons: I sometimes forget to keep my wet digit on the metal strip. The documentation that comes with this toothbrush is a little confusing. But it seems to do the job very nicely.
