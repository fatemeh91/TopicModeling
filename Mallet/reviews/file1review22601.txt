review/text: Ox Bile is essential in helping with digestion of fats in older people or in people who have had their gallbladder removed but this dose is very high. I spent the night of the first dose in great pain, throwing up a very strong acid bile that burned my throat and mouth for hours. The diarrhea was just as painful and it took several hours to clear my system. 3 different bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. Just beware if you are a first time use of Ox Bile, to take a smaller dose, start out with 125 mg and work up as needed. I will purchase some empty gelcaps and break down the doses to manageable levels so it is not a waste of money, but it was sure a shock to my system.
