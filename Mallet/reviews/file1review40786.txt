review/text: I bought the intuition with the soap attached, and used it for the first time yesterday. I absolutely LOVED it as I was smoothly and quickly shaving. By the end of my shower, I could feel the hard plastic scraping my leg... The soap was already worn down to where you could not use it. There was soap at the top of the razor, but not sure why they put that there? That part doesn't even touch your leg?! It came with a replacement blade. We'll see how long that one lasts...Schick Intuition Razor, Sensitive Skin 1Razor
