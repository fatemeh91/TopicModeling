review/text: I had bought the braun cruzer as my first electric shaver at 16 as i was sick of the irritation i would get from razors. The Trimmer and Beard trimmer were the big reasons as to me buying this product. Ill tell you this thing was pretty damn good. Like Braun says its sleek modern design does fit well into any hand, yet they should definitely have rethought the beard trimming attachment. I dropped this one time and the thing was done. cracked and i couldn't get a replacement. Also this shaver will not shave any beard longer than 2 mm very well. it takes many strokes over the area which also can cause some irritation. I find if you do have longer growth trim it with the trimming attachment (This works great and is also good for just creating the stubble look) then shave over it with the foil screen. I had recently upgraded to the Braun Series 5 Shaver. Wow. This beast gets the job done! Trimmer works great and the shaving is closer and you can definitely shave a 4 or 5 mm beard easily with the cutting comb in the center. I did have to buy a real beard trimmer for times when i do want it a bit longer. Philips Vacuum Trimmer does the job pretty well and keeps everything nice and clean.For someone who wants a shaver for an amazing price buy the cruzer.. yet be warned, it may not last very long.
