review/text: I purchased this because I've had good results from Weleda's products and decided to try this deodorant.Well, it keeps you from smelling bad for a day. That's about it.If you like the fragrance of roses, however, and are looking for a natural deodorant with this essence, you will be disappointed. The rose smell is mixed with lemon and the result is comparable to a supermarket furniture polish.If you are looking for a gentle floral, I suggest Aubrey Organics Calendula. If you like citrus, Weleda makes a nice citrus deodorant. This product just seems to miss the mark.
