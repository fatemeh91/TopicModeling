review/text: I'm a hard-gainer with an overly lean frame, so I knew I shouldn't skimp when it comes to whey. Been using the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard for several months now, and it's the best whey isolate I've ever used (but that's common knowledge anyway, there seems to be a consensus in the fitness community that this brand is the best).The Mocha flavor is really good, the best one I've had so far out of three (Strawberry Banana, Double Chocolate, and this). As I said, I'm not a coffee drinker, and this is still my favorite. Protein shakes always still manage to taste worse to me, compared to a standard milkshake of the same flavor. This one was different - something about the coffee flavor does a great job of masking the "protein shake" taste. Mix this with milk and it tastes just like a coffee-flavor shake from a creamery.
