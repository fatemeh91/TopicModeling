review/text: Everyone with Blood pressure problems must have a Blood pressure monitor.I've been taking blood pressure pills for a couple of years,and felt great,but after having knee surgery last year,I started to feel bad.I bought the ReliOn Monitor,and my pressure was sky high.I called my Doctor,and they added a extra pill a day,and my pressure finlly came down.I love this set,its easy to use,just be sure you just take your pressure once a day in the morning on your left arm,with your feet flat on the floor and your back straight.
