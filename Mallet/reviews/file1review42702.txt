review/text: My husband and I live on an island in the middle of the Pacific ocean, temporarily. We LOVE to go fishing, but we both get sea sick. I actually get worse than him. We take the ginger root capsules to help with the sickness in a natural way, and it works! My mom used to give it to me when I was younger, because I got car sick when I sat in the back of a car. This bottle is huge and I can share with new residents that don't know they get sea sick. Love it!!! :)
