review/text: First things first, bump down has single handedly saved my skin from unsightly razor bumps. I have been getting razor bumps for almost 4 years not and have been using Tend Skin...It SUCKS...smells awful and made my skin turn white. I did not like it at all. To say the least i was no happy with the results. When i found Bump Down it was a perfect match. My razor bumps are gone now becasue of Bump down...And my skin feels amazing.
