review/text: The wrist BP monitor worked great, but broke after 2 days. The troubleshooting guide it came with couldn't solve the problem. I contacted Omron's support line and they couldn't fix the issue either, so they wanted me to pay shipping both ways to get the item fixed, even after 2 days! I said forget it, returned the item to Amazon as not working, and Amazon's great customer service had a new one to me the next day. The product now works great - it's comfortable and east to use. Just don't rely on Omron customer service in the future!
