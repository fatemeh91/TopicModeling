review/text: In reading the reviews here I noticed a lot of ladies are saying they don't get a smooth feeling after using the epilator. If you have a "stubbly" feeling ladies, your hair was too long and intstead of being pulled out it was broken off at the surface of your skin. If you've waited a while before epilating, you may want to trim your hair a bit. Or you can do what I do and go over your legs with the epilator again 1 week later. You'll be surprised at the results.Also, to combat ingrown hairs, use a good loofa every day.
