review/text: My daughter LOVES this soap! It is perfect for potty training in learning to wash hands. The green color is fun and gives a child something that is their own, making hand washing fun. And the smell is great! I was disappointed when our local stores quit carrying this in stock but SO excited to see it's an AMAZON!
