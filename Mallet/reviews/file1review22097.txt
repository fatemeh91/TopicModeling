review/text: I love these- they are soft and comfy. Disposable ones make me feel gross and sweaty like im wearing a plastic diaper. I have only had occasional leaks on days when I didn't nurse or pump enough, so I simply learned to keep an extra pair around- no big deal. I wash these separately in my mini wonder-washer so that they don't get mixed in with my clothes and lost. I dont really wear tight clothes- but when I do I just wear a heavier bra to cover the lines (not that it really matters who sees im wearing breast pads, everyone looks at the kid these days- not me!)
