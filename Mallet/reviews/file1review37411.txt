review/text: I bought the epilator a month ago and never found de courage of using it since yesterday, I only used the sHaver head wich I love And find it great for maintance, since I'm going on a week long vacation I decided to give the epilator head a try and to my surprise it really wasn't that bad and I even removed the massaging head and went to speed 2 and it was still good, so since I was so happy whith the results I decided to try it on my underarms and let me tell you it wasn't pretty, it hurted so much that I'm not planning on using it under my arms any more, whith this little disapoinment, i still went on and used it on my bikini area and even though it was painfull not nearly as close as before, so overall It's a great gadget that I intend to keep using just not in my armpits.
