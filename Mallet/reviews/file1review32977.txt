review/text: I've been searching for an environmentally friendly laundry detergent for awhile; while I tried all of the other ones available at the local markets,I wasn't impressed with their performance. Persil Megapearls Color is the best by far. It has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering, unlike the Persil Gel and it gets the clothes really clean without stripping the color. Although it kills me to pay $50 for laundry detergent, I feel that it is well worth it given how my clothes look and the fact that it is not harming the environment.
