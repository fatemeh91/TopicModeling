review/text: These batteries power stuff, and these batteries are powered by the best stuff, lithium ions. I am not sure about the chemistry involved, but the chemist inside of these lil guys are better then the lazy ones in other, off brand, batteries. I use these in my Pocket Wizard photography equipment and they are much more reliable than Previously Purchased Power sources.
