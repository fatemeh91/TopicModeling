review/text: These vitamins have given me more energy, overall sense of well-being, built up my immune system, and best of all, no more painful cramps! Usually, the first day of my menstrual cycle is so painful I just lie down and can barely do anything at all. Since taking these, I have only a little discomfort on my first day and am able to function as normal! These are a blessing! I highly recommend them! I take 2 at every meal, and all my friends and roommates know how excited I am to take them each day. I think you need to take them diligently for a long period of time to see the full effects.
