review/text: It only charges for 20 minutes and not even half charged.You can take 10 pictures with them, it is useless! Speaked to vidpro, they are aware of the problems. They asked me to ship them back and pay $9 shipping and handling for replacements. The total cost comes to $20 if I want get it exchanged. It's not worth that. it is absolutely a terrible experience!
