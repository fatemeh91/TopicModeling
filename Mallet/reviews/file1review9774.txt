review/text: oh man, i love these things! so sharp! i agree the tip is needle-like. these things can pluck anything that exists. a hair too short for other tweezers to get and or too ingrown.i have no had trouble plucking with them (they aren't just sharp and pokey) they are functional tweezers with an additional feature.a word of caution, don't pull them out just before you need to go somewhere.... you might start digging at something and then have a red mark just as you need to go. I went crazy with them the first time i used them and had a bit of blood in a couple spots, i looked picked on!maybe i'll have to use restraint next time :)
