review/text: Wow. That's really all I can say about this one. Opening the box.... I was quite surprised to see just how big this one was. Because of it's girth, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is inexperienced with these sorts of toys and/or not sexually active. Insertable length is just over 5 inches and girth is about 5.5 inches around.I was surprised to hear just how quiet this vibrator is. It's far more quiet than other rabbits I have owned. And for being so quiet, it really has a lot of power! You might want some cover-up noise if you're using the second or third power levels though. (A fan, TV or covering the vibrator with a pillow all work well for this.) :)As other reviewers have stated... the smell of this vibrator is rather overpowering when you first take it out of the package. However, the first couple of washes seemed to cut it quite a bit, so I believe the smell will mostly wear off after 5-6 washes.Takes 3AA batteries, very easy to put them in. I'd suggest investing in a pack of rechargeable batteries.
