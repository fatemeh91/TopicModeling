review/text: I owned another waterpik for a few years that broke recently and replaced it with this one because i loved the old one so much. Unfortunately the button that pauses the water from spraying requires you to push down really hard or the water will still run.my fingers start to ache after a few seconds of using this. So unless you have a strong grip with your thumb and wont mind a big dent in your finger, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise stay away from this model at least.
