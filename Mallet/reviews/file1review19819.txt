review/text: After a couple hours of reading reviews I bought this seat. Many of the other product reviews said "not for boys". With this seat your boy would have to lean very far forward to not get pee everywhere. I also choose this because it adjusts on the bottom to fit long toilet seats, it fit the seat well. Another problem for me was the size of the hole. I have a big 2 year old and couldn't wipe him well. If you have a petite girl this will work for you!Amazon made it very easy to return this product at no cost to me:)
