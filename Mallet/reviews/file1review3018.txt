review/text: Both of us were really happy with the thinner condom. I won't go into detail but you really can see and feel the difference. I purchased a 36 pack and they were all the "made in Japan" variety. However I can't imagine that the Thailand version is exceptionally different. I highly recommend these if you're tired of not feeling anything.
