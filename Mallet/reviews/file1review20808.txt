review/text: I bought this shaver less then 3 years ago and it just plain quit on me. Got hot during charging and motor wouldn't run at all. Took it to a recommended Braun repair person and he said the motor was burned out and not worth repairing. I paid over $150.00 for this junker and Braun gives no way to contact them on their WEB site. Have 2 much older (non-cleaning) Braun shavers and both work just fine. Repair person said this might have something to do with the wet cleaning used for this shaver....I wouldn't get another Braun like this if it was free.....
