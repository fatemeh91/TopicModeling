review/text: I read a good number of the reviews before I decided to try Fertilaid. I thought it was worth a shot but I got pretty sick from this stuff. I started feeling a little different after a couple of days, just would sweat more than usual but did not think this was a big deal. Anyway after a week I had problems. Now I will admit, the morning I had a spell, I did take it on an empty stomach so perhaps that was my problem. I was a work and my vision went blurry and I got kind of disoriented and a little dizzy. I felt awful and had to have a coworker drive me home. After a few hours of feeling rotten, I started to feel normal but then had a splitting headache. Now, I am somewhat sensitive to some medications but "dummy me" thought that since this product was herbal that I may not have a problem. I just wanted to warn people who may be sensitive to medications that this may not be for them. I am sure it could be good for people who never have any issues for medications but I just wanted to let people know of my experience.Good luck with trying and baby dust to you all!P.S. - The reason I gave it 2 stars is that Amazon did a great job of getting it delivered fast. This does not have to do with the product. I am not a fair judge of that since I gave up on it.
