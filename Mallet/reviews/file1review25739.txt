review/text: I have to say that the Panasonic ER411 performed rather well for approximately 18 months. Considering I used the trimmer approximately once per month, I am not entirely sure I would recommend this product.Pros: effective at trimming nose and ear hair with comparatively little "tugging" although it did bring me to the point of tears a couple of times.Cons: Simply did not last very long. After 2-3 very careful cleanings, the flimsy cutting mechanism fell apart.
