review/text: Well I have been lifting for a couple of years now and optimum has a great product. I have always gone to walmart and grabbed whatever whey protein they sold. The biggest difference I noticed was the quality of the product. Optimum whey protein mixes very well and is easy to drink. The brands at walmart had more calories and were very hard to swallow. If your like me and trying to lose weight this product is great because of the low calories, compared to other brands.
