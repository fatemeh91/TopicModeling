review/text: July 26th, 2012I am 33 years old becoming 34 in October; I have learnt that I have high Prolactin when I was just 17 years old after missing 9 months period!I have been on birth control pills since then-and Cabergolin to control my Prolactin level-, Last August exactly 11 months ago, I have decided to go off of the Birth Control Pills and try to get pregnant, went to UCSF Fertility center and did all the test that a person could do regarding pregnancy, everything was normal except Prolactin, after working with their expert on Prolactin, I have learnt that my high prolactin is not causing any problems!It took 11 months to get there, and I have not had any periods, on July 21st I decided to give the Fertile Aid (FA) a try, and after just two days taking it my eleven-months missing period stared!!!!I saw my fertility doctor today, after getting the result regarding my Prolactin, he wanted to put me on Clomid, then I told him about FA and asked if I could just be on Fertile Aid for 3 months and TTC naturally, he agreed! He said it couldn't harm!I am using an ovulation kit starting today, I'll keep you updated, fingers crossed!
