review/text: I was diagnosed with a patella degeneration in my knee and was advised by the surgeon to trying healing the cartilage with Glucosamine.It's been three months since I have started taking glucosamine and I do find a difference in how my knee reacts to running. The pain has decreased and I feel slightly more comfortable with running after a 5 month lay off.Although the claims for feeling better in few days seem a bit dramatic, I personally feel it should be taken as a long term approach to healing.
