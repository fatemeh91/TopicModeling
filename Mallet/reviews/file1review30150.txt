review/text: The 120 softgel version is almost 50% more expensive than the tablet version. I thought I was getting a good deal by ordering the tablet version, having bought the softgel version previously. But the nutrition label of the tablet bottle, even though yielding the same 2mg Astaxanthin as the softgel bottle, shows a very different amount of the raw materials ( Haematococcus pluvialis algae extract ) used to make the 2mg Astanxanthin, than the softgel bottle label. I asked Source Naturals about this big difference via email but they never replied. In addition, the softgel version indicates "AstaREAL" but the tablet version does not. So one has to be careful to examine the differences between a softgel and tablet version of the same supplement supplied by the same supplier.
