review/text: Purchased this for my husband. After looking at the reviews written and seeing how others liked it, decided to buy. The price was very good and much cheaper then other trimmers sold in stores. My husband has used it twice so far and is loving it. He stated it does a great job and likes how it has built in adjustable guides.
