review/text: Considering the price, this unit was a real disappointment. Within a short time the ice blue plastic "topper" cracked and had to be tossed. The foot bath was not as deep as I was anticipating and as far as the heat and jets they were just so so. Hugely overpriced for the quality of product it is. Better than other foot spas on the market, but not $70-$80 better. If this were priced under$50, it would be worth it in my mind.
