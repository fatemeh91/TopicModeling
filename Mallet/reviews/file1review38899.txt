review/text: I really liked these razors. I have arthritis and the grip on the handles is really nice. I got a smooth shave without any nicks or cuts. The moisture strip is an added bonus, especially if you suffer from razor burn. The regular price might be a deterrent to some, but I'd buy them again because of the grip.
