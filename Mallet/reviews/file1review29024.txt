review/text: I bought norelco one 2 years ago, very expensive it did not shape pretty well, It was very expensive, then I tried a previous model of this braun ones. I work much better now I got the cruzer 3 one, It is works wonderful from the first time, no irritation, shave well. I strongly recommend it. do not waste your money on the very expensive ones as norelco ones that promised improvements that in fact do not work , this one will do the job perfectly
