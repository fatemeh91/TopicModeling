review/text: They are great for stubborn ingrown hairs. I never have seen my boyfriend become possesive with any grooming tools before, but he hated for anyone else to use them! Definelty 2 thumbs up, great tweezers I must say, they worked on my boyfriend and he has some really course and thick facial hair.
