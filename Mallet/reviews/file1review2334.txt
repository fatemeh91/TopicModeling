review/text: I had Lasik surgery a year ago and unfortunately my eyes didn't respond well. My vision without glasses was definitely improved, although not perfect, but what good came of the better vision has been countered by a terrible dryness that so far I've not been able to overcome. I wake up every single morning with my eyes so dry that it hurts to open them. After putting drops in I would have instant relief from the pain but for the next several hours my eyes would be blurry due to the dryness along with my eyes not liking my drops very well. I have only been using Thera Tears for 12 days now and although it may seem crazy to some, I'm already feeling a difference. This is so incredibly exciting to me!! From what I've read in other reviews it usually takes about a month or so to really feel a difference and you have to continue taking them forever but as long as my eyes keep responding so well I will be happy to take them for the rest of my life. Not to mention they are really good for the rest of my body too!
