review/text: I bought this table in February for $300 and have been using it regularly since. It's easy to transport and very sturdy. I've used it on carpet, wood, tile...even on grass at running events...with no trouble. Easy to setup, with warmer heating within 10 mins. or so. Clients love the heat and can still feel it through fleece pad. Reiki endplates let me stretch my legs while doing seated work at head and feet. I get lots of compliments about how soft & cushy it is and how luxurious the cover material looks & feels. Other CMTs are always asking where I got my table. Love it!!!
