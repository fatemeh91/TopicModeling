review/text: My husband has very thick facial hair that likes to grow at unusual angles and up to three (3) hairs per pore. When he shaves he looks like he is shaving off skin because he has to press so hard. He had to wait three (3) days between shaves just so he could let his skin heal.I read rave reviews of the Braun 8585, so I decided to order it for my husband for Christmas. So far, it has been wonderful.Before the Braun, he had a 3-razor shaving process: Sensor Excel, Mach3 Power, and Schick Quatro. Each of the blades could only be used at most 3 times before the dulled blades needed to be replaced (expensive replacements). The process took over 30 minutes in the shower (wasted water) and left his neck looking raw every time.Now with the Braun he still takes 30 minutes to shave, but only about 10 minutes in the shower for the really tough spots and the areas close to his gotee. He uses much less water, and we don't need to replace his blades once a week. AND, best of all, his neck isn't raw and he can shave every day if he wants or needs to.Definitely worth $140.
