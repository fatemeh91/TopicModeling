review/text: When my Wahl wore out, I went looking for a substitute. I got this prooduct. The two things I don't like about it are that it won't work when plugged in with the charger -- the charger simply recharges the battery. So if you want to use this thing, you have to make sure it is plugged in and charging for at least an hour before you use it. The other thing I didn't like is that it cuts unevenly. I have to do my own scissors trim after I use this because some hairs are not trimmed. I wish I hadn't bought this and just ordered a new Wahl brand -- one which supplies power through the outlet cord and cuts evenly.
