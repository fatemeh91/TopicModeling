review/text: I just bought this yesterday at the local store and am so impressed. I smell great.. I have been looking and looking for something that would control odor and this one does it. I am moving away from all those parabans and god knows what else they use to natural products and I have to tell you that I am having a love affair with Aubrey organics, they are really creating some great produts.I hope they never stop making this deodorant among other things in their line.
