review/text: It is very powerful and the battery lasts a long time. Only downsides are 1) The plastic adjustment comb is hard to remove and put back which makes me think it will break sooner than later. 2) When you use the blade w/o the comb, it is very sharp and irritates the skin. The Norelco G370 is a much better product. It has more attachments, the blade is smoother and doesn't irritate, and the comb is easier to remove. However, it doesn't hold its charge as well as this does.
