review/text: This protein powder is actually great! I was a little skeptical because it has been so chemically altered, but I have not noticed any bad side-effects from it. A few precautions though:Your liver is stressed out by high protein intake since it has to break it down and send it to your muscles. Drinking 10 glasses of water a day will help keep your kidneys happy and balanced. Eating something like oatmeal will ensure that your GI tract gets scrubbed clean with fiber, since high-protein diets tend to lack significant amounts of fiber. If you use plain oatmeal and add raisins and honey, instead of buying pre-packaged stuff with tons of added sugar, this shouldn't be a big deal for your diet plan.With that in mind, protein intake is key to any plan to build muscle. In fact, working out without consuming lots of protein immediately before or afterwards is almost a lot cause, since you are breaking your muscles down without rebuilding them. At $20 for five pounds, this stuff gives you all the protein (24 grams a serving!) you need for your money.p.s. the taste of the double rich chocolate is totally good, even when mixed with just water. It's not the greatest taste ever, but it just tastes like water-down chocolate milk, nothing too bad.
