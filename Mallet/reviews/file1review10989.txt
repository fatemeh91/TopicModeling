review/text: I work in a pharmacy and am on my feet all day. I need 2 knee replacements but don't really have the time to do it right now. Didn't know what to do in the mean time. A customer brought in a bottle of cryoderm for me to try. It has definitely helped me alot. I sprayed it on my knees before work and it helps all day. I recommend this to anyone that has arthritis!
