review/text: I do enjoy the relief these provide my hands. Used to be a problem shifting my car's stick and these help. My biggest complaint is that there is NO information. How tight is too tight? How long should these be worn? I wore them to bed one night only to awaken several hours later with the feeling my arms would fall off. I appreciate the relief but worry about potentially damaging my circulatory system over utilizing these and there is absolutely no direction or information provided to avoid problems - if there any. No info, no idea if these are completely safe or if there are concerns with tightness and length of time wearing.
