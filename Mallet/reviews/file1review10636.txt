review/text: I've never tried any other brand of ph strips so I really have nothing to compare to but these little things are great. I really like that you can choose your own size. I use a tiny little square about an hour after every meal (like another reviewer said) to see how what I previously ingested affects my alkalinity. Also test the first pee of the day (they say that's the most accurate representation of your alkalinity). It's kind of fun experimenting to see which foods make you more alkaline and more acidic (although it's kind of a no-brainer of you know your nutrition).The fact that it is a roll and not a bunch of paper sticks was my sell point. I feel like I'm getting more bang for my buck. It also comes with a replacement roll which I think is really nice too. But if your anything like me and use the smallest piece possible you probably won't need that second roll for quite a while.
