review/text: I had bought the full length insoles and love them. However they were a little long for certain shoes. Rather than cut them, I discovered that Spenco had the 3/4 length version. I bought them and put them in my work shoes. I love these as much as the full length. I recommend these. They offer all the support of the full length but they fit all shoes.
