review/text: This is my first electric toothbrush I have ever used or purchased. I only have used the clean cycle thus far and haven't tried the polishing tool that comes with it.I think it's an excellent product and far better than a normal toothbrush. It has significantly strengthened my gums. My teeth look and feel cleaner. Definitely recommend it.
