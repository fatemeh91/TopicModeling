review/text: keep in mind that this is my first epilator, but i was surprised at how loud it is. i was also surprised at how many hairs it would miss, therefore making it essential to shave afterwards as well as time consuming. i was amazed at the terrible amount of in-grown hairs i recieved after starting to use this product, and that is why i only use the shaver attachment now.
