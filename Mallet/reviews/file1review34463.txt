review/text: I have tried many other lubricants and this is by far the best one I have tried. It's not gooey, sticky, messy, or heavy. It lasts long enough to have a great time and it doesn't taste bad either. I literally wouldn't leave home without it (or stay home without it either).Wet Platinum Premium Lubricate , 8.9-Ounce Bottle
