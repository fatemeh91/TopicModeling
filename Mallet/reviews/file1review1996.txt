review/text: Definitely a must have for babies that have started on solids...these are great, so handy not only for on-the-go but also at home when you run out of clean bibs...you can never have enough of those!. The crumb catcher is really neat, it catches dribbles, and spills from the baby's mouth & no need to wash... what more can you ask for??. The 32 ct for $7.69 is an awesome deal!
