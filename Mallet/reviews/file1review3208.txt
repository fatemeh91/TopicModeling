review/text: These are pretty good for most people I'm sure. For me they didnt seem that much thinner than Durex Extra Sensatives and they were much tighter but thinner than my normal brand, which for me can lead to some decreased performance. All in all though I think a great choice for average sized guys looking for a good mix of thin and strong--and a really unbeatable price. They are latex, just fyi. I gave them to some colleagues to evaluate and will let you know. I also got some .002 Okamoto non latex that I will compare too shortly.
