review/text: I buy this from sharps in multiples of four at a time because it works so well. I noticed that my expensive dress shirt collection was getting all messy from my other deoderant and it prompted a change. Not only does this deoderant not stain, you don't smell ANYTHING. After a few months of wearing you can even skip a day and go unnoticed. the only problem is that your body has to get used to it which takes about three-five days since they use natural ingredients.... so start on a friday and by monday you'll be smelling perfect!
