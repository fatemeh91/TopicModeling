review/text: We first saw these straws at a restaurant and had a lot of fun with them. I found them on Amazon and they are great. You can wiggle them into lots of shapes. They are long and the flex point is extra long.They come in a case, so your supply will last a long time, or you can throw a lot of parties! They also make great thank-you gifts for kids' birthday parties. (we give a pack, not a single straw) They are unique, no one is allergic to them, they aren't noisy and everyone can use them.
