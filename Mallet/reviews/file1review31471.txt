review/text: This is an excellent kit for long backpacking trips. My girlfriend made fun of me carrying this until she needed it, now she likes it. :)The waterproof bags inside are high quality, as are the contents. I would recommend that you add a tube of Neosporin. The only other thing I added was some burn gel.
