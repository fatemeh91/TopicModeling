review/text: That's the long and the short of it. It's so thick that it doesn't go into the nooks and crannies. I much prefer the Biotene LIQUID, which is easier to get it to cover where it's needed. Biotene does make good products. My dry mouth is the result of radiation treatment. I do notice that both the spray and liquid tend to make me hoarse.
