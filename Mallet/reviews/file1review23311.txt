review/text: I purchased this as a way to keep up on some light housekeeping without dragging out a vacuum everyday. For the price, I wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it picks up items on both carpet and hard flooring. I also have not had any problems with the handle, either. I followed assembly directions and have had no problems.
