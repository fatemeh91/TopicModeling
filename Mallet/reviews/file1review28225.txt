review/text: The taste is great. The low sodium content is a huge plus even though I don't currently have high blood pressure. Low on carbs so add a banana after you work out but great if you just want to have straight up protein. The only reason it doesn't receive 5 stars from me is because it has 10% of the cholesterol you need dialy. This is not huge but I wouldn't have more than 1-2 shakes of it a day. If this product had 5% or less I would pretty much have 3 shakes a day. But compared to other protein shakes 10% isn't that much.. WORTH A TRY
