review/text: i don't understand those reviewers who complain that the product doesn't dissolve. it doesn't dissolve because it is not highly processed! what you're putting into your body is a very natural product. you should actually be happy that it is so natural and not over-processed and mixed with other crap like some pills. if you don't like it you can take the pill form, actually. i put the powder in a spoon and swallow it with juice. it is highly effective. i am 39, and my stubborn adult acne is completely gone in three weeks, and my beginning cellullites disappeared. i also feel great and healthy--yes i have changed my diet and eat lots of vegetables and drink a lot of water, so that adds to the feeling, of course. but i recommend this product to everyone and i sure do hope that sambazon does not process this product with some crap so that we can continue putting the healthy and freeze-dried natural product, just because some people want everything: natural and processed should not go together. i recommend the product as is.
