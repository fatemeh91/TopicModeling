review/text: This razor does about everything you need it to do. For the money, it is hard beat. It feels sturdy. It is sharp, and makes a decent edger. The trimmer guard rolls up and down nice and give a good trim. I was actually debating on getting the 60 buck bad boy with the vacuum, but I'm glad I paid 15 for this instead. I'm happy so far. I'm sure the Norelco 60 buck is prob cooler, and maybe better, however this one is doing just fine.
