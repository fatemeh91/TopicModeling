review/text: I have been suffering from Osteoarthritis for the past few years. It has gotten to the point where some days I cannot even work, and some days were so bad that getting dressed was the most painful thing I would do all day. In this time I have completely changed my life-style, trying everything and anything to reduce the pain I would feel on a daily basis.I have taken many medications, including prescription pain pills and over-the-counter pain relievers/anti-inflammatory medications. I would either drug myself with the pain pills, eliminate the pain as well as every other one of my senses, or I would take some type of anti-inflammatory medication and experience very little relief.As a side note, to all pain sufferers, please do your best to avoid prescription pain pills. There are other more natural and dangerous options I have found that also have very strong pain relieving properties;Warrior Mist Vicozen Combo (Vicozen Only - (6 bottles)). Herbal drinks like this one that contain the extracts of flowers like wild dagga and the white lotus have been used for centuries in other cultures for pain relief, a great alternative to other medications.Nature Made is not a cure for what I have, not anywhere close to that I'm afraid. However, compared to every similar product I've taken over the years, this one has made the biggest impact on my ability to get through the day with as little pain as possible. There are no side effects to speak of and the price is reasonable enough that for the effects I feel in my joints and range of motion I will be taking it for years to come.
