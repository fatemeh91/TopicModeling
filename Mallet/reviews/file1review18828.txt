review/text: I have tried mineral rich for a month now. The first week and a half this product made me so sick. I was experiencing a lot of nausea as if I was pregnant but I was not pregnant. It did give me a little boost of energy but not that much. My skin was okay. My skin was more beautiful and glowing when I took vitamin b complex than with this item. I did experience hair growth..which means I had new growth coming from my scalp in a wavy pattern. The only thing is that the vitamin made my hair grow but it made it shed a lot and I experienced breakage. It was to the point that every time I washed my hair or combed it, my hair was coming out a lot. It made my hair hard and brittle and Ive never had issues with my hair before. It grew it from the scalp but had a bad effect on the shaft of the hair. I have not taken mineral rich in a week now and the shedding has completely stopped. Maybe if you're taking this vitamin for hair growth you should take one tablespoon instead of two tablespoons to see how your body will respond to it and take it with food. I got to get my hair back healthy and once I do, I might start backing taking this item but only take one tablespoon to see what's going to happen to my hair. If it does the same thing then I know that my body does not like this product if the shedding does not occur then I know that I only need one tablespoon. Remember what works for others may not work for you!!
