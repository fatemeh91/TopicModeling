review/text: We purchased the Nordic Naturals liquid DHA as a supplement for our 2yr old twins. It is easy to use and seems to work great. I will say the best option is to mix it in applesauce or a food pouch. It is oily, so I don't know how it might taste in a drink. But could probably be easily hidden in something like apple juice. We use this supplement every day.
