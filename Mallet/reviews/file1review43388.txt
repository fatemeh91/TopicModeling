review/text: I like the idea of this product. It was easy to figure out and felt like it would give some support. However, the straps that go between your legs weren't lined up right front to back. The straps ended up being off center and there was no way to correct it. I had to wear spandex underneath the V2 support and they still cut into my legs when I was sitting. Finally, the material used made it sound like you were wearing a diaper when you walk. People would definetly be able to tell you had something on. When it come down to it, it was more uncomfortable to wear than and support I got out of it.
