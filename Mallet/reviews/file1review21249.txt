review/text: I previous had a elite sonic care tooth brush that cost over $100.00 and died a few years later...the sonic care people did not to fix my old toothbrush, instead they wanted me to buy a new one.. so i would never buy sonic care again...i saw the reviews on this toothbrush and decide to try it...1st my teeth feel a lot cleaner than with sonic care elite..the only thing is that when you use to toothbrush longer than 20 seconds, a fully charged battery runs out in about 4 -5 days..so you have to keep in the the charger everyday...also it louder than the sonic care elite..but you get use to it....your teeth are really squeaky clean after you use this toothbrush, i know i ran my finger over my teeth and it squeaked...this is a great toothbrush at a great price....
