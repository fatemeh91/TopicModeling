review/text: This is a quality product that works like its supposed to. I had terrible heartburn, was eating antacids like candy, nothing helped. Because of the effect on my vagus nerve, I was also having heart palpitations on a regular basis. A nurse I work with suggested I try digestive enzymes and told me Garden of Life was a quality brand.Noticed almost an immediate difference. One capsule with each meal and no more heartburn and the palpitations are just about non-existent. I have been using these for several months now and I have not had to use an antacid since then. I can eat anything, even bananas, which I had stopped eating years ago because they caused me so much of a problem.Its a lot better taking enzymes than antacids and other medications and Garden of Life is good quality and the cost is reasonable.
