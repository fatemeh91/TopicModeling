review/text: Aquafresh has scored again with its Advanced Whitening Toothpaste with Fluoride. This product works as smoothly from the tube as it does on your teeth. The end result is a clean fresh taste without the abrasive grit that many competitors have. All this and whiter teeth too. It's very convincing when you compare it to all the other toothpaste products on today's market.
