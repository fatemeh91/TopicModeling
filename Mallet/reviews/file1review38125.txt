review/text: These are wonderful! They clean eyeglasses very well. We can do up to two pairs of eyeglasses with one wipe. They don't cloud up when you put them on after using the wipe. The wipes also work great on computer monitors. They evaporate and dry out within five to ten minutes, so you need to use them as soon as you take them out of the package.
