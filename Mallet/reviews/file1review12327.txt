review/text: I have owned this product for a couple of years and absolutely love it. It has two sides...medium and fine....and you first use the medium on your heels and then finish with the fine side. I used to have terrible trouble with my heels cracking, especially in the summer when I wear sandals. I've had no trouble since using this product. I highly recommend it.
