review/text: I got the 2 pound chocolate malt flavor from my gyms nutrition shop about 2 months ago, and this stuff is great. It was pretty expensive there, but I'm so glad I found this on amazon for about half the price! The chocolate malt flavor wasn't that good, and at first I didn't like it that much, but I'm used to it now. I see that a lot of people recommend the double chocolate flavor, so I'm just about to order the 5 pound double chocolate and see how it is.
