review/text: It seems like a good idea...an environmentally-friendly daily shower spray that saves you the work of scrubbing the yuck off of your shower. And maybe -- maybe -- with a less offensive odor this product might be worth it. I'm not sure if this stuff is what Ylang Ylang really is supposed to smell like, but after enthusiastically spraying my double-shower with Method Daily Shower Spray, what I've got is a bathroom that now smells like a tank of wet diapers steeped in a cubic yard of rotting gardenias. Unfortunately, this was after giving my daughter a bedtime shower, which means I'm periodically gagging as I check in on the bathroom to see if the stink has dissipated enough for me to get some sleep. Thank goodness my bathroom has both a window and a fan. I've also tried running the shower a few minutes to rinse the product away, but it hasn't helped yet. If they come out with an unscented version of this product, I'll give it another try, but this stinky one is going to be returned.
