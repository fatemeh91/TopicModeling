review/text: All the potty seats I looked at say they are for older children, including this one. My daughter is almost a year old. I had started, earlier this summer, putting her on the regular potty when I noticed her struggling with a #2. So rather than watching her be uncomfortable as she sat in her diaper or stood on her hands and feet in awkward positions, I decided to take her to the potty. It was tiring and uncomfortable holding her on the regular toilet seat, but using the toilet was effective at helping my daughter do the job she needed to do, plus I've saved several diapers this way.After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Babybjorn Toilet Trainer. It is perfect! My daughter seems comfortable on it, and I don't have to use as much strength to support her on the toilet since the Babybjorn seat provides a better and more stable sitting surface without me having to worry about her little bottom sinking into the toilet.I have a very small bathroom and just recently purchased a Potty Hook from Babies R Us. Now the potty seat hangs from the toilet tank and is easily accessible and neat looking.Pros:Sits securely on toilet seatEasy to cleanFlexible handle for hangingCons:Expensive (best price at my time of purchase was here at Amazon)I would recommend it, but I am wondering if the Arm and Hammer seat (which seems to be similar in shape) is comparable. It is less expensive. I would like to get another seat for Grandma and Papa's home, but am not sure if I want to spend the same amount of money I spent on the Babybjorn seat since my daughter will be at my home more than at her grandparents' home.
