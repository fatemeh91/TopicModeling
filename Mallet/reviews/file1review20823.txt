review/text: I have had it for a couple of weeks now. I have used Norelco and Remington shavers in the past as well as the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo. I can honestly say the shave is as close as a blade. However, there is no mess. Also the self cleaning feature works wonderful as well. No more disgusting stubble clean ups. You can get the refill for $9.95 for 2 month supply. You can't beat it. I love it.
