review/text: Great item. Played tennis all summer 50 lbs. over my old tournament weight of 40 years ago, and my feet paid for it by being so sore I was practically crippled, and they weren't getting better after a couple months of rest. A week of this footbath and my feet were back to almost normal. Very well made with great water jets and good heater.
