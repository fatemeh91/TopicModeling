review/text: This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it. It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.
