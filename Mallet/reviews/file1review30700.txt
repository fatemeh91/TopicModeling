review/text: This razor gives a satisfactory shave, but if you drop it in the sink the threaded portion will break off the head, and you'll have no way of attaching the handle. There is no way I know of to repair it. I tried soldering it and ended up with the head melting -- apparently it's made of die-cast zinc, like a Tootsie Toy or Hotwheels. Epoxy isn't strong enough to hold.I've broken two of them by dropping them on hard surfaces. So beware!
