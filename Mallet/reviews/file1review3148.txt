review/text: I ordered a bunch of things off of amazon one morning. (video games, a mouthguard, this etc.) I must say this was the first to arrive. by a few days. They came in an inconspicuous bag and inside that bag was a clear bag that had them in it. I ordered twelve.First off, too small girth wise. I'm not a giant, just an average 6 foot tall guy. I'm a runner so i'm skinny, not huge like some people. So putting these on shouldn't have been a problem. It was. It was hard to roll down and just a bit lubricated. They have a pink tint to them but no one's looking so who cares.They weren't like putting on an extra small t shirt or anything uncomfortable, just a little tighter if that's what you're wanting.Overall great price for good condoms. Eventually I tried some trojan exctasy and they were much better.
