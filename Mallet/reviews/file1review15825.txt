review/text: I had taken glucosamine tablets from Trader Joe's a few years ago, for only a couple of weeks, when my knee began acting up. When it started feeling better, I stopped taking them. My husband's knee had been bothering him for some time, and he eventually bought these (they work out cheaper than the Trader Joe version), and the pain has since gone away.
