review/text: I was a Futuro customer for many years, but Jobst offers a better color choice for me: Sun Bronze is a flattering, natural tan color that I love. I am a flight attendant and these are fabulous for my work because they hold up to the demands of my profession, last a long time, and do not look like ugly &#34;support hose&#34;. Definitely worth it!
