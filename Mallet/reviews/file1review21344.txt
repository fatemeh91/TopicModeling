review/text: I bought this electric toothbrush years ago on the recommendation of my dentist. Years later, it's still going strong. Even better, I stopped getting regular cavities.The brush heads have a long life similar to the toothbrush. I didn't even realize how long it had been since I replaced them until I took a survey that asked when I last replaced my brush heads and realized I was an outlier. So I've ordered another batch.I use one brushhead and change it to another for my toddler son to use. Effective and and long-lasting. I can't ask for anything more.
