review/text: Warning: Don't go producing ozone in the house just to purify the air. EXTREMELY HARMFUL. When using this open a window for air exchange.Now now the good stuff: This purifies water like none-other. Kills lingering bacteria in your toothbrushes, detoxifies the leftover chemicals on your store-bought fruit, cured my external toe fungus (I wear my shoes too long throughout the day), revitalizes kefir grains, oxygenates your oils (use it with flaxseed and other oils you don't cook with for maximum effect).The main thing is your water. Charcoal doesn't get rid of the chlorine or floride residing in your tap water. This does. Fantastic.
