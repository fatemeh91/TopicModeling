review/text: I am a 22 y/o African American woman with deep brown skin. (think of Kelly Rowland or Gabrielle Union complexions) Recently I have been focusing all ny attention on getting flawless, radiant skin. My post ancne marks stick out horribly and some of them had been around for years! I have been using this product for over a month now and the results have been great. Most of the marks have either faded completely or are now more faint. Even my darker hyperpigmentation marks have dramatically faded. However I have completely changed my skin routine and am taking hair skin and nail vitamins along with a biotin supplement that have really kicked my skin into high gear. I use this cream as the last step in my regimine. I'm not even done with my first tube and I see a dramatic difference. I can't wait to my skin once I complete the tube! This cream does not lighten your whole face only the dark marks and makes your skin look more bright.
