review/text: This scale really works. Finally got serious about dieting and this scale has helped to keep me on track. Weighs the same as when I am weighed at the doctor's office. Very good to have a scale which weighs accurately and does not vary by several pounds from day to day. Very pleased with another Amazon purchase.
