review/text: I'm at that age folks... you know, when the hair stops growing on the top of my head, and instead, decides to grow in my ears! It's disgusting! Until now, I've been taking a small scissors and a couple of mirrors to try to trim those pesky things. There hasn't been too much blood shed, but the whole process is ridiculous. I went searching for one of these gadgets not knowing what to expect. I could never figure out how they worked. I mean, how do you get an electric razor that small? ...I got it, popped the battery in, and was totally amazed! It's hard to describe, but if you can picture the top of your little finger -- that's the size of this rotary electric razor that spins in a circle. I thought it might "pull" the hairs out, but it doesn't. This gadget has changed my life! They ought to put me on a commercial, but I'd be too embarrassed. This thing should be in the medicine cabinet of every man over 40... I highly recommend this product and am surprised they aren't doing mass advertising for it. If more people knew about it, it could take off and be a staple for family use. Amazon.com shipping was flawless, the product professionally packages - overall a 5 star experience and something that will save me a ton of aggravation in future years. Now if I could just get the hair on the top of my head to grow back...
