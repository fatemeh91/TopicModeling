review/text: First off, this is the first silicone-based lubricant I have tried, and I have to say I have mixed feelings about it. I was expecting it to be more slippery, but it turned out to allow almost a pleasurable amount of friction without being dry. My expectations with trying silicone lube was that it would last much longer than water-based lubes. My only complaint is that it seems to dry out (or be absorbed) too fast (which is what I was trying to avoid with the switch to silicone). When reconstituted with water or saliva it becomes really slippery again, more so than KY or Astroglide. It seems like just your standard KY stays slippery as long as this does. I'll have to try the Wet Platinum next time.
