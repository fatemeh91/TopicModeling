review/text: I've noticed this trimmer shaves accurately at it's corners (when the guard is off, of course), which means far less trimming with scissors afterwards. It's simple. The previous model had a flip-out mini-trimmer which really wasn't necessary. I'm glad this one doesn't have that. My wife likes it. It seems to keep a good charge. I wish I didn't have to shampoo before and I wish it would clean itself out after I'm done, but that's just silly talk.
