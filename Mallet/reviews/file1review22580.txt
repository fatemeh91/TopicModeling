review/text: Love love love the girth. Only a couple complaints: it took quite a while for the 'new toy smell' to fade. It would be a dead give away if you were trying to keep it private. And the 'uncircumsized' ridges are there I'm sure for stimulation, but with the amazing girth of it, is a little rough to start everytime. Other than that, amazing toy. Like I said, the girth is great for someone who likes things a bit bigger than the average toy and the length is good for SOOOO many things. Be creative, we've found a few uses. Looking forward to my next swedish exotic purchase! Oh and for the price! Every sexually active woman needs one.
