review/text: I'm a long time user of this product. Been using it for 8 years now. I've suffered my whole life from constipation, ever since I was a young child. I've tried so many products over the years to keep myself regular. Mag O7 is THE BEST !!! You can use it two different ways, as a colon cleanser or as a maintenance product to get yourself regular and keep yourself regular. Mag O7 causes absolutely no cramping like laxatives and many other cleansing products do.You need to find the dose that's right for you, whichever way you wish to use it. Taking too much can cause runny stools. If that happens, you need to take a capsule or two less until you find what works best for you. For me, I take 4 capsules once a day, only every three days. That keeps my system working well. Some will need to take 2 capsules every day or any other combination. Play around with your dose until you find what works for you and gives you the result your looking for.If I want to do an actual cleanse, then I'll take 4 to 5 capsules a day, every day for 7 to 10 days. Some who suffer from occasional constipation due to short term medication use or any other reason will only need to use this product as needed.I highly recommend this product !!! BEST OF THE BEST !!
