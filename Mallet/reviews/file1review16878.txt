review/text: This is a marvelous product! We have a nice rescued poodle who is eight years old and not yet (sob!) housebroken. His frequent accidents are fertile food for Motsenbackers. Only problem: I couldn't find a large refill bottle, as we need help with the three spray containers we have around the house. If you have similar problems its worth a try!
