review/text: The only balm I will ever need. So luxe and effective! As others have noted, texture is very thick and "grainy." Yes, it is thicker than your average balm. More of a thick butter than a waxy oil, which most balms tend to become on your lips. It is not grainy, or at least mine wasn't. I think people are referring to the very thick buttery kind of whipped texture it has. Or maybe they didn't warm it up with their finger enough. You do need to let the balm warm up to make it easier to apply. Even then, it takes a little more rubbing to get it on there. That beign said, I think it takes more effort than other balms to come off! Feels great on your lips and lasts a really really long time. I can feel the moisturizing effect as soon as I put it on! Feels like pouring water on dry skin! If you have dry skin or like in a dry climate like I do, you will understand that skin quenching feeling! It smells like grapefruit, and if you ever lick your lips with it on, kind of makes your tongue a little numb like grapefruit does. A lot people might not notice this though.It goes on matte, not glossy. I love this. Your lips look healthy and clean. It was hard to put my finger on it but I finally know... the consistency and texture of this lip balm reminds me on Lush's Lip Service. Still, I like this one better.The frosted glass jar is so cute! But it is pretty heavy and large! I still tetris it into my tiny purse just because I love it so much! I wish they would make a more travel friendly version of this! The price is steep but I tend to stop using lip balms I don't love to try another, so spending more on a balm I will finish is worth the money right there. Anyways, life is short, use the products you love!
