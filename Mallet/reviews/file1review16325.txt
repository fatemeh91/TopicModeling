review/text: I am gonna go right out there and say it....we are an Indian household and some of our food stains can be extremely tough to wash off of plates, pots, pans, etc... We need some heavy duty stuff that cleans, deodorizes the dishwasher, and leaves a shiny clean feeling.... These work.We use one powerball for the heaviest of loads and have yet to find one dish left dirty.....Our dishwasher tub is stainless steel, and even that looks a bit shinier after using these for a bit over a week.Simple, effective, and excellent product. Try them and you wont be disappointed. They are going to become a regular item in our household.5/5
