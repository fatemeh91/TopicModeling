review/text: This is an amazing product for any diabetic who wishes to have something in the house for an emergency. In fact, it's such a good product, I know of many paramedics who carry it with them while on the job.I was always taught to have cake frosting in the house in the event of an episode of low blood sugar. But Insta-Glucose is much, much better. It works faster and one tube can bring you back from a state of almost being in a coma to alert and ready to go to work. It gave me a little bit of an upset stomach the first time I used it, but I'm the only one that seems to have experienced this. Besides, an upset stomach is a small price to pay for having your blood sugar recovered quickly. This is an excellent product that every diabetic should have in their home.
