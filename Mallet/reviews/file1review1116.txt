review/text: You know those First Aid kits you get from the dollar store? The ones in the small, white plastic box? Well, those are better than this. Why? Well, for $8, I'll list what you get.-A white plastic box, measuring 5" X 4" X 1-1/2"-Eight plastic bandages, 1" X 3-1/4" (bootleg BandAids)-Four 2" X 2" gauze pads.-Four BZK towelettes.-Two single-use packs of 1% hydrocortisone cream.-Two two-tablet packsets of aspirin (325mg each tablet)-Two two-tablet packets of acetaminophen (325mg each tablet)-Roll of breathable tape, 1/2" wide by 72" long.-Gauze roll, 2-1/2" wide by 24" long.-Pair of low-quality bandage scissors.This kit isn't compact, isn't cheap, and doesn't even have good contents. Buy the dollar store kit, add some extras to it, and you'll be more prepared for less money than this kit. And it will be smaller.
