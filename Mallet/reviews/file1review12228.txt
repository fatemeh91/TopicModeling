review/text: Before I discovered these I was going to walgreens and literally paying double the price for a brand I can't even remember now. Rainbow Light is a good brand, has the same ingredients as the more expensive one's, and has the exact nutrients someone needs for prenatal care. I like too that they are natural and don't make me feel sick which I've heard of happening to others. Also, these vitamins have the ingredient insitiol i.e. vitamin B8) in them. Besides being something good for the fetus and for milk production, if you take 20-30mg per day, you also see a noticeable difference in the health and look of your hair, nails, and skin. These pills only have 10mg per serving so I also take it in powder form to get the extra benefit,200 Gram (7.06 Oz) Inositol Bulk Powder, pretty neat bonus.During my last pregnancy I actually kept taking this multi after I had my baby since I was breastfeeding. It wouldn't depend on it entirely to produce breast milk, but it is an all-around great multi-vitamin and the one I recommend to all my friends. For both children I had trouble with producing milk and both times I took fenugreek and blessed thistle,Nature's Way Blessed Thistle (390mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Fenugreek (610mg) 100 Capsulesand as a result neither child has tasted formula. I'm sure it would have been a longer process if I weren't supplying my body with the nutrients found in Rainbow Light, but fenugreek and the like have always been a quick fix for me.
