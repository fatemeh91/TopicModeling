review/text: When my Gucci sunglasses lost a screw, I looked everywhere for a gold screw that would fit. Without success, I opted for this case due to the various sizes. The price is right and it has all different sizes as well as the tools needed to fix your sunglasses or glasses yourself. My sunglasses are still doing good with the replacement screw and I'm glad I have this kit in handy in case I need to do another repair. Be warned, when you get the kit, the screws are all over the place, which is inevitable. You are going to have to sort through the screws and put them in the right compartment.
