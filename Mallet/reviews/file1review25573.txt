review/text: THIS TYPE OF NOSE TRIMMER IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. PANASONIC USE TO MAKE ONE FOR BROOKSTONE AND IT CUT MUCH CLOSER . BUT NOW BROOKSTONE IS HAVING ONE MADE FOR THEM JUST LIKE THIS PIECE OF JUNK. OPEN IT UP AND IF THE CUTTING BLADES ARE STRAIGHT UP, IT'S NO GOOD. LOOK FOR THE ONE THAT HAS BLADES AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE AND YOU HAVE THE GOOD ONE.
