review/text: I purchased this at the advice of a friend. I wanted something natural (non-medicinal) to take before flying for anxiety. My flight is not until March '11, but wanted to test it out. I used it before a couple of dentist appointments, and it seemed to work. I was not as anxious and I seemed more calm and was able to have the dental work done that I needed. The dose is only 4 drops in a little water or straight on your tongue. The test will come on my trip in March. I will take it before my flights and keep it with me to take in-flight (it's an overseas flight). I'll post an update after I return.
