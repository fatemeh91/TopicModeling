review/text: A GREAT LITTLE RAZOR! Comfortable to hold, easy to use, quiet and does a great job trimming those hairs you just don't want people to see. Painless, bloodless, and quick. Twice the price of the comparable Remington but worth the difference. A real keeper, too bad they didn't come out with this razor a lot sooner.
