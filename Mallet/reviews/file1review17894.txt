review/text: I use them sometimes to sleep if I'm a little congested, and it does cut down on snoring, even if it's not severe snoring, and eliminates the dry mouth in the am. But I do use them almost always when doing a long treadmill run/walk. They really improve the exercise experience because I can breathe more through my nose. Since this might happen before I cleanse my face at night, I have to remember to swipe my nose with some witch hazel and then dry it so it sticks. At about 30 cents apiece, they are well worth it if they help me stick to my exercise program!
