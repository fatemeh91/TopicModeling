review/text: I was looking for a product or supplement I could take to give me more vitamins and minerals so looked up different companys and decided to give this one a try,I thought the product would be natural based on the companys website but the product has fructose in it and I hate the taste of fructose and it's not healthy for me at all,the 1 oz on the bottle is not a real 1oz dosage,once refrigerated the taste turns bad,and lastly the product didn't give me any energy at all.I found a much better all natural product called Moringa Oleifea which i can grow in my own garden or order natural sundried crushed leaves with not sugars or artificial ingrediants added plus Moringa has 10 to 15 times more potassium,iron,vitamins and mineral than any health drink on the market.I tried Maximum Living and got a maximum letdown..people get moringa you will thank me and get better benefits from a natural tree than a bunch of ingrediants put together with fructose added.
