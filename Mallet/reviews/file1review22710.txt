review/text: I have panic attacks a lot and was looking for something that could help me. A friend of mine turned me onto this product. After I read hundreds of reviews I finally got some. With just a couple sprays or drops I felt a lot more calm. I could really tell the difference. My heart raced a lot less then normal and my nervousness has been a lot less. It also doesn't taste bad either. I highly recommend this product. Oh, also I am a nagger but while taking this I don't pick arguments(Great for the wife or husband.lol) The product also doesn't leave you feeling dopey or sluggish. The best way that I can describe this product is that it makes the little things that might work you up not bother you.
