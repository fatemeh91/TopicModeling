review/text: These condoms are every bit as advertised. I was not impressed initially though - they didn't fit me all the way and were a little smaller. But turns out you should not leave any room at the top near the tip, which I used to do with other condoms to not risk them breaking. But once I started wearing them flush at the top, they fit me just right and the closest to not feeling a thick condom as I have ever gotten. Great value for the money but I recommend initially buying just a dozen to test them out.
