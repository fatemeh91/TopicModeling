review/text: This thermometer is great. Just give it to your baby like a regular pacifier. It will sound a tone when the temperature is taken, and shows it digitally on a lit display. If the baby has a fever, it will play a little lullaby rather than just sounding a tone. It also stores the last temperature taken. You can also be guaranteed an accurate temperature, unlike the ear thermometers -- and so much less expensive! A best buy in my book.
