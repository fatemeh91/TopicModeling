review/text: This is my first time trying Whey Protein and I decided to purchase this product because of the amount of reviews it has. It took 1 day in transit, received it yesterday and couldn't wait to try it. I mixed 1 scoop in water after my excerise program and let's just say it's a taste I have to get used to. This morning, I tried it with 6 oz of Fat Free Skim Milk and 3 frozen strawberry and boy was that good. A lot better than just water. Just water and powder does leave an after taste in your mouth, but thats's easly fixed. Let's see how it works.
