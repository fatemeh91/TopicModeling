review/text: Back when my children were little I bought this toothpaste because it was cheep. I remember being stopped on the street by a couple of ladies inquiring on how I got my teeth so white and I didn't know what to say. I was actully embarrased to tell them that I used a dollar tree toothpaste. It's been several years since that day and I think I've tried my fair share of expensive whitening toothpastes out there all of which were a great dissapoimtment. Not only did they not whiten my teeth nearly as well as this product but they left my mouth feeling unclean and did nothing for buildup. I was so sick of spending all that money that I decided to grab a tube of ultrabrite at the dollar tree on a whim. At the time I just figured that if they're all crap anyway why waste all that money. I was quickly reminded of how great my smile can be. It works better then any other toothpaste on the market in my opinion. I'll never switch again.
