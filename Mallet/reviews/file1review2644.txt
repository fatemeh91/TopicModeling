review/text: a slippery silicone based lube. Applies easily, does its job well. Not too messy, use sparingly if you need to. No fragrance, which is a plus.I found the package itself to be way to small, I dont deal in ml mind you. But as far as a lube, its a good one, applies easily and never loses its momentum. the tube is about 2 inches, and not even an inch in diam. I like the size of say Astroglide for a package, and at 9-11 bucks, I think you could probably find something better for your money, but as a lube it gets a 8.
