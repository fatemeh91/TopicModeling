review/text: I have been using this product for over 25 years. It was recomended to me by a lil ole sweet Irishlady in a health food store. She said not only was the calcium good for you but since it's time released it will help you to sleep; if taken fairly soon before bedtime. She was right!!!! It is by far the BEST product around for the intake of Calcium for us women who NEED to take it for our bones.Also the delivery time was great. I received the product within a few days of ordering.:) I recommend it over any and all other products conatining calcium. I never buy at a phramacy; only a health food store. The majority of time I must order in advance, (which can take up to 2 weeks) they can't keep enough on the shelf fast enough!!!!
