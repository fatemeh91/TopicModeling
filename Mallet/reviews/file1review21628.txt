review/text: This product makes it easy to transition the baby to the big bathtub after they grow out of the infant bathtub. We tried the Safety First Swivel Bath Seat first and hated it. Then we got this and it was great. It's just the right size for children who are comfortable sitting up on their own (about 6-8 months) and my daughter never felt intimidated by being in a big bathtub. We also traveled with it and it made bathtime away from home comfortable, easy, and enjoyable for everyone.
