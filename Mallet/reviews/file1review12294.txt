review/text: When I was told at a recent hospitalization that I would qualify for a hospital bed, I really didn't want to get one. But, I have seasonal asthma, so being able to adjust my bed for better breathing is important. I searched local stores, but the only thing I could find was twin size linens, and they don't work too well with adjustable beds. The bed in a bag that I got from Amazon does a really good job and the quality is fine. I am very pleased with my purchase.
