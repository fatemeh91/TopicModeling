review/text: As a frequent NOW customer, I was surprised at the poor quality of their coconut oil. It was yellow, cloudy, and smelled so rancid that I didn't dare eat it. NOW usually sells good products, so maybe I just got a rare bad batch of coconut oil - who knows? I think I'll stick with Nutiva organic VCO, which has never disappointed me.
