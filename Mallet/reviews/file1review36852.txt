review/text: Ok not much of a writer but since I always like reading reviews on something that I am looking at buying I figuard its only fair that I try to give my imput. First I have bought several types of sock aids. This one works the best for me. A few issues that I have and I think that are areas that could use some improvment. First the blue cloth is coming unstiched at the top. Next the sock aid should be wider at the top so you can insert your foot in the sock. Next the sock aid should be longer by about double this would allow you to put a sock on the aid completely. I think it would make the sock aid even better. In fact I bought another one and experimenting putting two together. Now the postives before I bought this I would need my wifes help to put my socks on no longer I now do them on my own again. I have learned a few tricks that make using the aid a breeze and I once again I am able to put my socks on by myself. Hint if you are putting your socks on and are able use your other foot to push on one side of one of the straps to help open up the mouth of the sock aid. This makes inserting you foot in to the sock easier.The other thing you can try is to wiggle you foot as you slowly pull up on the sock aid this seams to help walk the sock up higher. Over all I would buy this again but it would be better with some improvements, but for the money its a get deal.
