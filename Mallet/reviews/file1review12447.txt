review/text: I received this splint in mid-December and by the end of January I no longer had any pain in my foot due to plantar fasciitis from which i suffered for almost a year. I tried shots, stretching exercises, and was receiving physical therapy. I know the physical therapy was helping but very slowy. After 4 weeks wearing the night splint I am pain free. This splint really works! THANK YOU!
