review/text: The microwave slippers feel great on cold feet. They stay warm for almost an hour. You wouldn't want to walk with them on, but they are great if you are going to sit and watch tv or something. The only thing I don't like about them is the scent. I'm not a big fan of the herbs they use in them. But the smell is worth the wonderful warmth
