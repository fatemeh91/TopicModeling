review/text: I'm weight training to be less of a noodle and this protein has really made a difference. My only advice would be to be choosy about the flavor you pick. You'll be stuck with it for a while as this powder goes a long whey (tee hee).I tried a 1lb bag of the French Vanilla Creme first and loved every scoopful. Just mixed it with water and loved the flavor. Even looked forward to drinking it after my workouts. After the trial run I purchased a 2lb bottle of Delicious Strawberry and YUCK! It doesn't mix as well with a spoon (though a shaker works great!) and it's got a weird taste to it. Artificial strawberry, not natural strawberry. I'm starting to get used to it, as I'm not going to let it go to waste, but I had to come online to find the French Vanilla Creme to order more, as my local vitamin shops don't seem to carry it regularly.
