review/text: Exactly what is advertised. A backup battery for your camera. Essential when shooting long sessions or infrequent sessions when your other battery runs out of power at the worst of all times, either in studio, at home or outdoors. Will hold a full charge out of the camera for at least 8 months (the longest that I have not had to swap out the battery to date). Essential for anyone who has a hard time telling how much battery life is left using the meter built into Olympus Camera's (which I find almost impossible to read). This is especially true when having a charged battery is critical to catching a spontaneous shot or at important/lengthy events. Recommended for anyone owning any appropriate Olympus camera that cannot use standard widely available batteries as a back-up.
