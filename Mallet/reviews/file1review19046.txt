review/text: Great tasting Tang-like taste with only 15 calories. I however, drink the product (2 tsp) in about 16 to 20 oz of water so I have not experienced the overly strong taste... and it taste great at that concentration. Nobody said you have to mix it in ONLY 8 ounces of water. If it is too strong, add only half the recommended dose and drink more. The BM's are easy with less cleaning unlike many type of high fiber dietary foods like brown rice, whole grain breads etc.
