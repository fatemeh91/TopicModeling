review/text: These blades are very comfortable, and the single blade on the back gets into every nook and cranny. When I shave every day, I can use an electric to keep up. When I'm on vacation or just don't care to shave every day, these guys do the job when I get around to it. If I use them exclusively, I get 30 days of use out of a single cartridge, whether I shave 30 times every day or 10 times every 3 days. My son has the power version, which is fun to use but doesn't seem to work any better.
