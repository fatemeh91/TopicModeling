review/text: This is my third bottle - and I am certain I won't use anything else. I really feel super clean after using it - like all the pollutants and grim is washed away at the end of the day. I have super sensitive skin and hormonal acne, and this hasn't irritated me one bit. I highly recommend this face wash!
