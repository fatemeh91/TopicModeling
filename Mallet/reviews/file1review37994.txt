review/text: This device can make a huge difference. I read the instructions and there is a practice unit. It has a computer monitor that determines if electrical shock is needed reducing error. It can repeat treament immdiately and automatically if warranted. Public events and institutions require them inmany jurisdiction. Why not in your jurisdiction. The iphone or ipad can wait.
