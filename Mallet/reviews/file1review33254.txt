review/text: While these booties do warm your feet, the heat pack inserts are a rough uncovered sack that comes directly in contact with your feet and are uncomfortable to me since my feet are very sensitive to texture. Also, the fit is loose with no way to tighten the cuffs around your ankle so it's awkward keeping them on. I'll probably end up getting something else.
