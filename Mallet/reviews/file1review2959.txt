review/text: I used the very excelent Sea Foam motor treatment to clean the carbs on a very rough sounding motorcycle after being stored for the winter. Biased on my success with that product I decided to give this penetrating fluid product a try. In the past I have used many types of fluids that claim to help break up rust and grime that keep bolts from coming lose. Most are junk for a number of reasons but Deep Creep seems to work.Deep Creed claims to be paint safe, working around cars this can be very important. I tested this and those claims seem to be true (be sure to test for yourself before going crazy). Next up is that the product foams and seems to stay mostly where you spray it. Light fluid sprays like WD40 just seem to run but Deep Creep clings much better for a few seconds until the foam slowly turns to liquid. I would say the foaming is much like the old Break Free products. So for a large area Deep Creep would not be my first choice but for stubborn bolts and such it works perfectly.My first test of this product was some stubborn bolt/screw combo heads used to hold a license plate on the back of my wife's car, your standard SUV that has been covered in salt and grime for years without ever removing the plates. The bolts were of course cheep and started to strip as soon as they saw a screwdriver. More then that, getting behind the bolts would be hard because they had a wide head and the way the plate rested inset into a decorative bracket directly against the SUV. Basically the rusted bolts were half striped, hard to reach, and right next to surfaces I didn't want to damage. A quick squirt of this product with 5 mins of waiting and the bolts came right out, no problem. The foam quality really helped get behind the bolt and license plate to reach the body panel insert where the bolt connected.This is the best thing I have ever used to tackle rusted bolts and worth giving a try.
