review/text: The Oral B Humming Bird Flosser is the only flossing product that works well consistantly. The regular string floss hurts my fingers by cutting off the circulation. Other flossing products already attached to some sort of disposable reaching gadget always break on the floss and become disconnected. This product is so good and is wonderful for tight teeth. The vibration helps to get in and out of the tight areas. It works that much better than all the other products I've tried and worth every cent!
