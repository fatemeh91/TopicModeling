review/text: Just received my 10 pound bag of vanilla ice cream gold standard whey. First things first, The bag weighs a little over 10 pounds and it is FILLED to the brim! that seems to be a major problem with protein lately is a huge tub only filled up half way, well that is not the case here.Taste, I love this stuff because its easy to slam down quick and in my opinion that is what a protein shake is for. I have some Amplified Wheybolic Extreme from gnc that I had to buy in a pinch a couple weeks ago and I can honestly say the Gold Standard stuff is unbelievably better... not only taste but how it mixes up and the serving size, I don't even wanna mention the cost lol, think the 3lb gnc wheybolic cost around $60 and I payed $97 for 10 POUNDS of gold standard...Needless to say I have found my go-to for protein now!
