review/text: When my Sonicare toothbrush stopped working after only 18 months, I asked my dentist for a toothbrush recommendation. He recommended this toothbrush, and I love it!. The 30 second indicator to move to another section of your mouth frees me up to think about other things than brushing. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I enjoy the clean feeling and the brushing so much, that I find myself brushing more often and for longer than 2 minutes at a time. The brush takes up little room on my bathroom counter, and the toothbrush was a great price. Overall, a really good purchase for me.
