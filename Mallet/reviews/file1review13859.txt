review/text: Got these as a Christmas gift. They work great. I agree with the other reviews, these are not slippers that you want to walk on. I recommend wearing socks with these because I find that it tends to be too warm on my bare feet. The drawstrings are nice because it really keeps the heat inside the slipper.
