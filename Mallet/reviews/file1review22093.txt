review/text: I've tried four different products. I'm working to test each product I can get a sample of. I believe most products fit one or more specific needs. I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far, each brand's strengths were as follows:>Kushies (3star)absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers,>La Leche League (3star)appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras,>Medela (2star) was easy to find in stores and absorption improved with time,>NuAngel (4star)was very affordable. "White/patterns" absorb a bit faster than "natural" so I like to put "natural" as an outer doubler and "white/patterns" as inner doubler during heavy let-downs.If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine. Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable, free samples, and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use unless otherwise noted. No fabric softeners were applied as they can cause repelling. All samples were used at least a month before final opinions were noted.Categories: dry shirt test, rate of absoption, appearance, leakage, light use, heavy night use, doubler.

Still fresh white color after 2 months use. 100% cotton, 4 layers, med contour and dart/seam, 6 pads/pk, ~5" diameter, Made in Canada.LA LECHE LEAGUE:Single layer/light 4 starInner doubler 1 starOuter doubler 4 starheavy night solo 2 starRate of absorption 2 star: (3ml in 13-40 sec, variable)3ml within ~5 seconds after couple months of useShirt test - shirt visibly wet in 5 minutes (3ml)Appearance 5 star (Especially good for C/+ size in my experience)Best appearance for 36C wearing tank top/tight clothes. Variable speed of absorption. 13-40 seconds to absorb 3ml--improved after 2 months use. Excellent outer doubler. 95% Cotton/5% Polyester, outer shell 100% cotton, seamless deep contour, 4 pads/pk.MEDELA-baby shower gift:Single layer/light 3 starInner doubler 3 starOuter doubler 2 starheavy night solo 1 starRate of absorption 2 star: (3ml in 23 sec), 3ml within 5-10 seconds after couple months of useShirt test - back of pad damp in 20 minutes, not visible on shirt (3ml)Appearance 3 starAbsorbed 3ml in 23sec, absorption improved thereafter following additional months of use. 100% cotton, min contour and dart/seam, 4 pads/pk w/ mini laundry bagNUANGEL INC:White/White Lace/PatternsSingle layer/light 5 starInner doubler 3 starOuter doubler 3 starheavy night solo 2 starRate of absorption - 3ml within 3 seconds after couple months of useShirt test - White/Patterns: back barely damp in 30 min / White Lace back not discernibly damp @ 30 min... in both cases shirt barely felt damp but not visibly dampAppearance 4 star (flat. smaller you are, better it probably looks)Natural/Natural LaceSingle layer/light 5 starInner doubler 2 starOuter doubler 4 starheavy night solo 2 starRate of absorption - star: 3ml within 5 seconds after couple months of useShirt test - Natural: back damp in 30 min / Natural Lace back not discernibly damp @ 30 min... in both cases shirt barely felt damp but not visiblyAppearance 4 star (flat. smaller you are, better it probably looks)NuAngel had the best price per unit. White & patterns absorb more quickly than natural tone (3ml in 24sec), absorption improved thereafter following additional month of use. Probably best to use white alone or as inner doubler depending on anticipated flow, and natural tone as outer or alone if only slowly dripping. May work especially well for smaller sizes like A or B. 100% cotton flannel, 4 layers (+ optional lace), 8 pads/pk (4 pair), no dart/seam, 4.5" shrinks to ~4" diameter, Made in USA.Definitions:Fully absorbed. liquid no longer beads/flows on surface when tiltedHeavy let-down. Can soak a Lansinoh disposable (most absorptive disposable I'd encoutered) in a single feeding and leak. Equivalent to about two & a half washable pads stacked to catch the flow. Heavy flow requires very absorptive inner doublers and low(er) absorption outer doublers so they have time to soak it all up without affecting your shirt. Hopefully a washable pad out there can improve on these statistics. I just haven't met it yet. I'm still hopeful that the other 2/3 of these brands can provide a more efficient answer. I will gladly try any brand and report on my findings.Rate of absorption. 3ml water dispersed in 2 seconds. Dispersed/absorbed time: 2/2 = absorbed immediately. 2/20= 18 seconds after water dispersed until fully absorbedShirt test: After 1+ month of use, lay pad on favorite tank top, apply 3ml water, time how long until back of pad is damp to touch or shirt is visibly dampened. Check at 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes.If you would like another product reviewed, please let me know. This review goes into more detail at "[..]
