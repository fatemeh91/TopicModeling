review/text: I was very hesitant to order this at first, but I'm so glad I did! I love this detergent.I only need to use a heaping tablespoon of powder in my HE washing machine and my clothes come out fresh and clean. With 5 daughters we have no short supply of laundry, especially since the three youngest ones sometimes go through two or three outfits in one day. I run at least two loads of laundry every day and one box of Persil lasts six months to a year, compared with a similar sized box of Tide that only lasts 8 weeks if I'm lucky.
