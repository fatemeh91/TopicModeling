review/text: This product really makes doing the dishes easy. Just open the wrapper and pop the tablet in the dishwasher. It's so much less messy than using liquid dishwasher detergent. However, sometimes it seems like these leave a bit of a residue and don't get dishes as clean as liquid Cascade Complete did. I will still continue to use this product because I like the ease of use, but I think the Cascade does do a somewhat better job getting dishes clean. This is still a great and easy product, though.
