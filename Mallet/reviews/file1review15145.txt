review/text: Of the countless power or meal replacement bars on the market (I've tried most everything), the honey peanut Balance Bars are among the best taste wise. I'm trying to watch my weight and especially what I have for breakfast or lunch. These are tasty, convenient, and better for me than other choices I could make. They are especially good for calorie counters like me also. They are moist, and the chocolate coating on the bar really does taste like chocolate.
