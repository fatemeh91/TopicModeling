review/text: Will it get the job done? Probably.The lack of multiple settings it a bit frustrating.Strong for it's size. The first time we tried it, I thought it would rattle my fillings loose. Too much for me.If you need something portable, it seems small enough although I'd say that if it falls out of your hand bag, ain't no body gonna mistake it for something else.I got mine free with purchase so I can't complain about the cost. But I wouldn't have spent much for it. However, it seems well like by other reviewers. I guess I just prefer something more along the lines of a rabbit or the Wee Vibe.
