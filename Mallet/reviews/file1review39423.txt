review/text: We found this massager on clearance and picked it up on a lark. I was not expecting to enjoy it, I was expecting it to not be worth the money.I was pleasantly surprised. We call it the pummeler. It beats the muscles that absolutely refused to relax, you know those sore shoulders and that spot in between the shoulder blades. Ohhh, so nice. It has been a joy to have when I wake up in the middle of the night with aches and pains that just will not let me go back to sleep.No, you aren't going to get a massage as good as that of a professional, but this wasn't designed for it. But it works wonders on those recurring spots of tension and stress that seem to be just out of reach, or impossible to relax.I will lay on my stomach, turn it on and rest it on one of those sore spots while I read or just try to relax. (It is amazing if you combine it with massage oil and have someone using it on your back and legs.)I really recommend this. It is a great way to beat the stress. --- speaking of the pummeler, I think I could use it now.
