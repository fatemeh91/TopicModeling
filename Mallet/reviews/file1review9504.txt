review/text: This product did work fine until earlier this year when it became impossible to buy replacement strips. I have been contacting Lifestream for several months, by e-mail an phone, and can't get a response. I found out last week on a health forum that the company has gone out of business, due to lask of financial backing.Don't waste you time and money!
