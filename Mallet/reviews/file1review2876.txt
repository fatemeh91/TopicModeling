review/text: I had to return my bottle, because the 1st thing I noticed when I opened it was the odor, and the capsules literally looked like they had been put in an oven and toasted! They had a burned smell. I had been trying to take them for my digestive problems, but these were actually making me worse! Very defective bottle. I will not be ordering them again from Vitamin Shoppe if this is what you get. I have been taking Betaine Hydrochloride for several months, and this is the first time I've ever had a problem. I had been buying them from the local health food store, but was trying to save money getting them on Amazon.
