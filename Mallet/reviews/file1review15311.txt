review/text: I'm not one into strong perfumes or smells - just walking by someone who has too much perfume on can induce a sinus infection in me and I don't like most "floral" scents. I do enjoy a mild, natural aroma, however, and vanilla is about as mild as they come. The incense sticks burn for about 30 minutes or longer... if you have a ceiling fan going, it will burn up quicker, but the scent will disperse further in your home. Burning sticks are held in a holder that I then place on my brick hearth - incense sticks rarely spark, but I'm not one to take chances - and I never leave the house with incense burning. The scent of incense is soothing and can really help to cover the odors of burnt food, pets, etc.
