review/text: Kleenex has always been my brand of facial tissue because of two simple facts: QUALITY & COST!!! Kleenex ColdCare Ultra tissues feel fantastic because they're thick, soft, and gentle. They're more reasonably priced than ""that other brand"" without sacrificing quality. My kids and husband love them and so do I. Another great product from Kleenex!!
