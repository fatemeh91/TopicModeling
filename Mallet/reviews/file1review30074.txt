review/text: I have been using this product for over a year. It works just a well as Cascade or any other top brand. However, if you have hard water you need to use a little less and/or a rinse aid. I used it before and after we had a water softener installed. After the water softener was installed I no longer needed a rinse aid. It works and I find comfort in knowing its safe for my family.
