review/text: This protein mix has a great formula. The post workout effect on muscles is outstanding. Almost too good to be true.But... the flavor is awful. Chocolate is really bad. Vanilla is OK only if you add something to mask the flavor.It is also hard to mix.The solution for the flavor is to get the vanilla and add cocoa powder yourself. A lot of it. Still the awful flavor is there, but acceptable.The other alternative is to add a fruit and use a blender. In that case there will still be chunks of powder that do not dissolve, and you have to clean them up with the blender blade.If using a shaking container to mix (with the spring ball), there will be powder that does not dissolve. The solution is normally to add as much water as possible, both in the blender and the mixing cup. At least one cup of water per scoop. One and a half cups of water is OK. It still comes out pretty thick.To sum it up, forget the chocolate powder. Maybe some people grew up on artificial food and fast food and find it acceptable. At home, use a blender with some additions, and if you mix it in the gym or in the car add cocoa to the mix before you leave home.
