review/text: I don't normally write reviews unless the product blows me away and I have to say this one really did. Over the years I've noticed I perspire more and more especially in the summer months, but I recently started taking a medication that makes me have a body odor I've never had before. I started doing the research and found this stuff and if you have the same issue you have to try it. Not only does it work, but its almost instant. I literally notice the difference the next day. By the second or third day the odor is 100% gone. I almost can't believe it myself. Don't be alarmed if you see green when you go to the bathroom, its normal.
