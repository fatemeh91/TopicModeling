review/text: My knee measures a size large so that is what I bought. Big mistake. This brace has stretched out and is no longer snug. The magnet feature is a great idea and I do feel relief when I wear it. I just don't like pulling it up when I should have ordered a size medium.Other then my own error it is a great product that helps my aching knee.
