review/text: Ever since I started shaving using soap in a bowl, Taylor of Old Bond Street has been a favorite of mine. It lathers up very nicely, and the Lemon & Lime scent is unbelievably good and refreshing. This combined with the face food of the same scent are an awesome duo and treat for the face.
