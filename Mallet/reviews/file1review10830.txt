review/text: So far I have found that the scale is very accurate and consistent regarding body weight. I can get on the scale 5 times and get the same weight each time. And it seems to be consistent with scales at the gym, doctor, etc. But I don't think the boby fat analyzer works well. I've lost 20 lbs, been working out at the gym lifting weights, etc, and haven't lost 1% in body fat. I had a body fat analysis done at the gym and the results were WAY off from what this scale does. The scale said 33%, the gym said 15%. Truth lies somewhere in between probably, but I don't buy the 33%. So in conclusion, good scale for weight. Not for boby fat calculation.
