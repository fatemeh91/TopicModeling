review/text: The Elasto-Gel Cervical Collar fits well around the neck, offering cold/hot treatments to the neck and upper spine. I use it for neck arthritis and strains. I also use it for hot and cold therapy on my wrist for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. (For the left wrist, place the Elasto-Gel on the arm with the logo facing so it can be read. Grab the Velcro strap and pull it around the wrist and into the palm of your hand, grasping the strap between the thumb and forefinger. Then wrap the Gel securely around your arm and wrist, and fasten the Velcro strap to the Velcro tab on the Gel. The extended portion that normally covers your upper spine now warms or cools the underside of your arm. The right wrist is a bit more tricky, but easy enough to figure by first grabbing the opposite end--the one without the strap--between the palm and small finger.) It seems to stay hot or cold for 15 minutes or more. Be sure that you let it sit for a few minutes after removing from the microwave, per instructions. It will still be heating up and can burn a tender wrist or neck.
