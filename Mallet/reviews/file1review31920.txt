review/text: If you like the taste of a whole bunch of grass, algae and seeds chewed up by a cow, and then spit into your glass in the morning, then by all means, Perfect Food is for you. You will be brought back to the days of your youth as you hunted for tadpoles in your backyard pond. Scoop up a glass of pond scum and there you have Perfect Food. Who knew!! It was right in our own back yard...or field. All kidding aside, this stuff could rival some Fear Factor dares in the taste department. However, if you mix it with Trader Joe's Green Drink, it's totally doable. With water, you will gag without holding your nose. I mixed it with vanilla ice cream and it was just like Green Tea Ice Cream. But, I'd be packing on the weight doing that every morning. With all this said, I will continue with Pefect Food and enjoying the benefits as long as I can cut it with a mixer!UPDATE 3/03/09:As bad tasting as this product is, I had to come back and say I have not been sick ONCE while taking this just about every day, if not every other day. If I feel something coming on, I do a shot, and BAM! I'm telling all my friends that have a rotating bi-monthly cold to try it. Office colds are rampant, and I'm typically the one that catches everything and then it turns into chronic bronchitis. So, I'm here to witness: This stuff gets RESULTS.
