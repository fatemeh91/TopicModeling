review/text: My husband and I TTC for 5 months and I decided to use some herbal remedies for assistance. I looked up reviews for fertilaid and decided to give it a shot. I took it for only 3 weeks and it seemed to make me feel healthier. When it was time for my next cycle, I noticed all of my pms symptoms were more exaggerated. A week went by and I still had no period so I decided to test. I was so shocked when that stick said "PREGNANT" I actually gasped. My husband and I have a wonderful little 1 year old boy. Couldn't be happier. Next time around I won't hesitate to use this.
