review/text: I have been using electric toothbrushes ever since the first Sonicare toothbrush came out when they were just selling them in infomercials. I have used the original Sonicare and the 2 models that came out after that and then I went to theOral B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrushtoothbrush which I liked better than the Sonicare brushes. I used the first one until the battery died after about 2 years and I got another one and used it for about 2 years and I was completely happy with it. That is because I didn't know what I was missing. I had seen the great reviews on this toothbrush so I thought I would just try it out. I am glad I did. This is not a Sonic type toothbrush which I knew before I bought it so I was kind of skeptical but all my concerns were put to rest the first time I used it. It gives you the fresh feeling you have when you leave the dentist. My teeth are smooth and much cleaner than they ever were when using the sonic type of brush. Combine this toothbrush withCrest Weekly Clean Intensive Cleaning Toothpaste - 0.85 Ozand you can practically skip going to the dentist for your biannual cleanings. Well you can go just so you can hear the dental assistance tell you how clean your teeth are. So to sum my review up, this toothbrush is AWESOME! Get it! you won't be sorry.
