review/text: I bought an ER 411 years ago and it's been a pretty good product. It was the second nose/ear hair trimmer I bought. The other one had a straight (not round) head and was awful. After probably 7 or 8 years, I would say the $25 I paid for the ER 411 was a great investment. Why the heck they think it's worth $50 now is beyond me. Is this a collectible? Try the ER 415 if you're looking for a trimmer.
