review/text: I ORDERED FROM 2 DIFFERENT COMPANIES. THNAK GOODNESS I ONLY ORDERED 1 PAIR FROM THIS COMPANY. THEY SENT THE WRONG PRODUCT IN THE WRONG SIZE. I COMPLAINED TO AMAZON BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE. THE OTHER ONES WERE FINE. I'M NOT A HAPPY CAMPER. PROBABLY WON'T ORDER THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN. I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE COMPANY AND THEY DIDN'T SEND A RECEIPT OR PACKING SLIP OR ANY PAPERWORK IN THE3 PACKAGE.
