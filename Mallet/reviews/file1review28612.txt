review/text: I really like the ON double chocolate. Very lean with high % of protein per scoop. ON leaves out the higher fat content without much sacrifice on taste. It mixes VERY easily. I even put a scoop on a bowl of cereal. Chocoolate Rice Krispies and Shredded Wheat with a scoop of this stuff makes a great tasting snack!!!
