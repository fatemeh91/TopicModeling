review/text: THIS IS A GOURMAND IT SMELLS LIKE FOODSTUFF AS GOURMANDS DO. THAT IS MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT GOURMANDS THOUGH IS THE SUGAR COOKIE SMELL TO IT, LIZ TAYLORS BLACK PEARLS IS A GOURMAND AND IT SMELLS LIKE COOKIE DOUGH. NOT EVERYBODY APPRECIATES IT BUT IM MADLY IN LOVE WITH IT. THIS REMINDS ME OF FENDI'S FANTASIA PERFUME. THEY ARE VERY MUCH Alike EXCEPT THIS IS MUCH MORE MILD AND MELLOW SMELLING AND LESS TOBACCO.
