review/text: I take a lot of medication and the compartments were not big enough to hold all my pills so I had to use the dinner and bedtime slots for all my evening pills. Also within 8 weeks, the Thursday morning compartment door broke off and so I was no longer able to use that compartment. Wish it had been a little more durable.
