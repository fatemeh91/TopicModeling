review/text: It's a great first aid kit and a great value for $40! Adventure Medical Kits tend to be more expensive than other mfg's but a deal on Amazon. I use this kit on 3-8 person backpacking trips. For the larger trips I add some extra supplies and this kit's bag has a little extra space to accommodate it.
