review/text: I love these bars and they really can keep the hunger at bay before going to the gym and they never upset my stomach when working out.Okay, look corn syrup is in pecan pie. It is not like they are putting mercury in them.Not sure that I would give to my kids. Why not? Gives you more energy than a snickers bar!
