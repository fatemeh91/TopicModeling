review/text: having gone through several (cheaper) seats - and tons of clorox wipes cleaning up the dribbles off the toilet and floor - I read reviews and tried this one for my twins. the adjustable mechanism makes all the difference in the world - as long as its adjusted snugly on the toilet, no leaks, dribbles, messes! i bought one for each toilet that they use and it's worth the $, no question!
