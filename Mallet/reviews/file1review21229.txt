review/text: I received this toothbrush for a Christmas present. I had thought about getting an electronic toothbrush, but I had not done any research. In any case, I was eager to try it. When I first used it, it took a few seconds to get used to it. I thought it tickled my gums, but very shortly I realize how much the "sonic" action of the toothbrush is working on cleaning your teeth and you just make small circles with the brush and let the sonic action do the rest. I have used it a couple of times and already my teeth feel cleaner. I also find that it is fun to use so I end up brushing my teeth a lot longer than with a regular brush.I went to see how much refills were at Wal-Mart and they were $7.97. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not five. $8 every three months is a bit more espensive than a regular brush (that I usually get free from Target when they have the tooth paste / tooth brush packages).
