review/text: I LOVE THIS. We've run through several other potty seats that got messy, didn't fit right, etc. This adjusts to your toilet seat (we have a larger than standard seat), has a ring that kids can hang the potty up with, is easy for them to handle, easy to use, easy to keep clean. I almost didn't purchase this because of the higher selling price, but now I wish I had gotten one sooner. Considering purchasing multiples to keep in various bathrooms. So, so wonderful, encourages autonomy! I don't have a single negative comment on this product!
