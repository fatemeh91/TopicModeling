review/text: The Glide Dental Floss comes in a trim, round container. This packaging is superior to the square packaging and fits neatly in my purse. The floss itself came off easily and didn't break during use. I am a daily flosser and go crazy with flimsy floss that shreds and breaks. I was very pleased with this product and even if it costs a little more, I plan to switch to Glide.
