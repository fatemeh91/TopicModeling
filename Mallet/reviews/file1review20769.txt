review/text: I've had the Braun 8585 for four months now. The device does not age well.Despite the use of the included cleaning / charging base, two screws under the foil screen are rusting. I'm considering this a cosmetic problem until something actually falls apart.The main problem I have is with the cleaning / charging base. When I put the razor in the base, I have to jiggle it for several minutes to get the "Charge" light to come on or to get the base to determine a cleaning cycle to use.When I do get the base to start cleaning the razor, the razor always shakes lose during the same stage of the cleaning. At one point the razor turns on and begins running, and it's at this stage that the razor shakes itself lose and disconnects. The end result is a razor that refuses to charge in the base and isn't being cleaned.My wife managed to get it to hold still for a cleaning cycle with the careful use of a Q-tip to jam the razor against the wall of the case. This is an art I've been unable to master.While I can still charge the razor using the electrical cable, the major feature, the self cleaning functionality, is completely useless.In the end, I'm disappointed in the razor, and have no intention of purchasing a Braun razor in the future.
