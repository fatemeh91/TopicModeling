review/text: I don't know if it was a coincidence or placebo effect, but my forgetfulness and inability to hold a conversation without au, au, au, a thousand times has greatly improved. Im like my old self again, sharp and witty, even remembering names. I thought about seeking medical help, and tried FF out of desperation, soo glad I did! No problems sleeping like some reviewed. I take 4 pills a day and noticed a difference after two weeks; no effect if I miss a day. It's expensive but worth the cost for me, even if I had to give up coffee - the results are better. I don't think it's a cure all, but whatever was affecting me, it really helped, like night and day, ill take it for life if I have to. Give it a try, hope it helps you....
