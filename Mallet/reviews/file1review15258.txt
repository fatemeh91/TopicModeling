review/text: The first thing that impressed me was the taste! Yummy! I've tasted protein/energy bars before and been disappointed with the taste. This was really like eating a chocolate brownie! Even my husband, who doesn't like nuts, enjoyed the bar. As far as the ""energy"" from the bar, I was again impressed. As an ER nurse, there are times I don't get a chance to eat on time. This energy bar really helped me with that! I was also impressed with the nutritional value of the bar and the fact that the fat content was not high. This is a product I'd definitely buy again!
