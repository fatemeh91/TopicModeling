review/text: When I bought this I was just wanting something that didn't leak onto the seat when my son and daughter when pee, and something that doesn't slip around. The seat definitely doesn't slip around, but it does let pee get on to the seat a little. I'm still happy with it though. Compared to the one we used to have from Walmart, it does it's job perfectly (and it cleans really easily).
