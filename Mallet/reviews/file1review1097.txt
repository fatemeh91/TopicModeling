review/text: I like this elbow support very much. I am wearing it right now and have had it on all day. It is very comfortable. It is so hard to find the right support, that I was so glad that I found it on Amazon.com. I have had a nerve problem for many years and have had to wear a support just about every day. If I don't I have major pain down my arm and into my fingers. This support does what it is intended to do.
