review/text: Trying to find something to help with premenopausal symptoms: hot flashes, insomnia, irritability, and strange aches and pains with shorter periods. Vitex is a WONDER! Taking a daily dose of 800mg during the days leading up to ovulation and then 800mg 3x a day from ovulation to beginning of period. Symptoms have vanished, sleep great, mood improved and the blessing of a shorter cycle without any struggle. And NO premenstrual headache! I plan on continuing with this product all through the change! Hallelujah!
