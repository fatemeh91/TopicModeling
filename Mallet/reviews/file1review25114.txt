review/text: This is the worst tasting protein shake I've ever had. Ever. I've tried at least six different varieties. I don't know who these people are that have the time after their workout to make a nice fruit and protein cocktail from their protein shake, but I'm not one of them. I tried having this shake once with bites of fresh fruit, and it was still barely edible. It's low fat, packs a ton of protein, calories are almost all from protein, it's low sugar, and all that. But, I still want something that's going into my body to taste good, and this doesn't fit the bill at all. I'm going back to Monster Mass or Muscle Milk.
