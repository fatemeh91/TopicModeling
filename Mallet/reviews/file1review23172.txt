review/text: Oh, this is really neat. A manual sweeper than can pick up the kitty litter and kitty hair on either carpet or wood floor. Easy to assemble (remember to hit the top of the handle into carpeted floor really hard to set the handle in for good)..Only thing that would be great is that it went into corners and closer to the wall, but for the price you can't beat it. Don't have to get out the giant vacuum every day now.
