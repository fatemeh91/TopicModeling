review/text: Blk cerry juice is supposed to aid in the aches and pains of joints, although not terrible tasting when mixed with water, it does taste like cough syrup. Has it helped my joint pain, too early to tell, maybe someone using this long term can testify. but I will keep taking my cough syrup water
