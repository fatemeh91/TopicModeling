review/text: I cannot rate this product highly enough. I am no fan of powdered supplement mixes. Never have been. They all taste chalky to me. I tried this product by accident after a relative's husband had passed away from cancer. He had been drinking them when nothing else was going down. I was astounded at how delicious the shake turned out to be! The powder dissolves completely, leaving no chalky residue at the bottom of the glass. With milk, it's absolutely wonderful, but add ice cream and it's like a premium shake! If you have a need for a supplement, this is the highest-cal you can get, AND - it's gluten-free!! I tried the chocolate and the vanilla and both were yummy!!
