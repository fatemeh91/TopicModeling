review/text: I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm. The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with, and the product is fantastic. The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous. The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
