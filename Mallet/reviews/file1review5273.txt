review/text: I have an eight-year-old daughter who is very allergic to mosquito bites. Bites on her leg swell up till it's so painful that she can't walk. If the bite is on her arm she won't be able to use the arm in a day or two.Tried everything to help her and it didn't do much good.I just happened to think about the fact that the mosquito injects something that makes the blood thinner and I remembered that vitamin K helps to coagulate the blood.I used to work in a vitamin store and I have a lot of old stuff from that time.I just happened to have an old bottle of Vita-K solution for stretch marks. It is at least five years old. I have used it on her bites twice now and can't believe how fast it goes away. She had one this afternoon the bite area was about the size of a dime and that was surrounded by about three inches of redness. I put it on twice in an hour and it is almost gone. Understand in the past she would fight these bites and their painful effects for weeks.I don't know if any old vitamin K cream would work but this one has a cooling effect. It gets very hot around the bump so the cooling feels good!I will give her a few vitamin K pills. I am wondering now if the mosquito's might be put off by vitamin K on the skin. I am sure going to give it a try, an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure. I don't know how much vitamin K would go through the skin into the blood stream. It might be worth remembering that Vitamin E thins the blood.
