review/text: I bought this because of the high reviews. The taste is much better then other protein brands, berry blast may not be as popular as the other flavors it its starting to get recognized! I mix it with 20oz of water (tried berry sparkling water and it was REALLY REALLY BAD)and it was great. Highly recommend buying a blender and mixing this with Apple or Orange juice, frozen raspberries, frozen strawberries, and frozen black berries. It makes for a great protein shake with a sour/tangy kick to it. If you can't get a blender right away, go to your local gym and they will mix the berries in for you for a fee.
