review/text: I recently purchased this for someone else to take on their backpacking trip. I am an EMT in Montana, and I am very impressed with the amount of quality equipment they packed in there. Weight is a huge factor when you are hiking, and this kit weighs next to nothing, yet still has enough stuff to do a lot of work if needed. This has got to be, by far, the lightest and most versatile first aid kit out there for hiking/backpacking, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
