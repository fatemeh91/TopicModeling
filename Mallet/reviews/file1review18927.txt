review/text: This knee brace seems more costly than some other options but it's worth the money. It's very sturdy and stabilizes your knee. The metal brackets prevent your knee from moving side to side. You can adjust the sizing to your comfort. Easy to rinse and dry - just take out the metal sides first. My physical therapist commented that this was a very good brace and to continue using it during my treatment.
