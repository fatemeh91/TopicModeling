review/text: I love it, I love it, I love it......(over and over again). I got a cheap version of this product just to try it out and when it broke I felt lost. I bought this one to replace it and it has been the best purchase I have made in a long time. I like it so much that I got 3 more and I am thinking about getting 2 more some time next week. I have given them to family members and they just rave about how they love it. If you are thinking about getting this product go for it. The pain is minimal if you are some one who waxes or uses suger like I WAS. This thing is great there is no mess and you don't have to wait for the hair to grow out. If you are some one who shaves you WILL feel pain (how much depends on you), but the pain will be less as you continue to use the handy dandy little thing. I just love it and what can I say I just love it.
