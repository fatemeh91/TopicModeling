review/text: I liked a few things about this product. First, there was no scent, which means no clashing with perfumes. Second, it kept me dry! I tend to sweat (unfortunately) and even while exercising, I was fine -- much to my surprise!! I've tried other products that claim to work, but this one has really proven itself to me. I have recommended it to my sister, since we're alike. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to stay dry and keep from ruining good blouses, which I've done too many times to count.
