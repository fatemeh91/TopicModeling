review/text: I would recommend this product to anybody trying to stay regular. Especially pregnant women. I am about 3 months pregnant and was having troubles until I started taking this product regularly. Chew two a day and there are absolutely no worries. This product is consistent. It works through the system naturally so you don't end up with bloating or gas. I just bought the supplements that include Calcium and Vitamin-D. I have no doubts that this will give me and my baby the stronger and healthier bones we need!
