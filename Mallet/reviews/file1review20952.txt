review/text: I take alot of meds , vitamins and try supplements. I got a free bottle of this stuff over the phone listeng to the radio for postage alone. My Cholestoral usually runs around 240, all of the time, I got blood work done after I stopped taking the gelcaps and my cholestoral went from 240 to 175!!!! Never been that Low, tried a couple of cheaper ones, but they upset my stomach and left a fishy taste. Plus these cost a total of 50 dollars plus about 9 bucks S and H @ Iceland Health for 30 gelcaps, browsing thru here , found a bottle for 24 plus 6 bucks for shipping, that is half price, ordered right away. Hey, I felt better too, helped my arhtritis.
