review/text: I have tried every ice pack on the market! The ace ones are great, but every single one leak! No matter how careful I am with them.....they leak at the seams. These are less expensive and with proper care last forever! When using them cold, you do need a cover of some sort........an old pillow case works well folded over several times. Plus the size works well. Big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily. Sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck, which makes your head worse. Defeats the purpose. For the money, this one is a good choice!
