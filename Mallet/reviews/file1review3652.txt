review/text: My chiropractor suggested magnesium to help my muscles recuperate from moderately strenuous activities because I tend to ache a lot whenever I do something slightly out of the ordinary. This seems to help a lot. My muscles do seem to recuperate, usually within a day or so, when it used to take much longer.The best price was through Amazon.
