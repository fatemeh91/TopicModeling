review/text: I decided, on a whim, to buy a bottle of Aqua Velva since my Dad used to wear it. As soon as I opened the bottle I remembered the couch we used to have in the living room and his spot next to the lamp where he used to read the paper in the mornings before I got up. That arm rest would smell like classic aftershave (Aqua Velva, Skin Bracer, Old Spice, or English Leather) for hours after he left the house!When my two year old son comes downstairs in the morning to find me reading on our couch (next to the lamp, of course) I have the bottle ready for him because he loves to smell it. I wonder if I can teach him to call it "Smellygood" like I used to.These are the things that make life worthwhile. Don't feel guilty for "not spending enough money" on something trendy.
