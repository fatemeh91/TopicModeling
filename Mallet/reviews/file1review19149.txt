review/text: I took a double dose, two caps, twice a day for two months as directed. Nothing. Nada. You ask,"Would the same apply to me?" I think so for the following reasons:There are two groups of ingredients in Ringstop.The first group is homeopathic preparations. As far as I know there has never been a valid double-blind placebo-controlled study demonstrating the effectiveness of any homeopathic remedy in treating any condition, let alone something as intractable as tinnitus.The second group of ingredients is a list of minerals, vitamins and herbs, but with no amounts given. No mgs or mcgs. In the supplement industry when someone does this it is usually thought to be "pixie dust". That means the quantities are so small as to be nutritionally insignificant but you can still claim that they are in the product. Even the lengthy brochure inside the box says nothing about the quantities of these ingredients. It does mention that there is no cure for tinnitus though. But I did not even experience a temporary reduction of symptoms.Given all of the above I am not only disappointed in Dr Bob, I am downright suspicious of him.
