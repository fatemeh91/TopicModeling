review/text: I purchased my WP-65 in May '05 and started using it just about every night for the last five months. My dentist was amazed that my gums were in such good shape when I went to see him. Typically I'd go to the dentist and get a half-hour lecture about gum care and then I'd have to go to weeks of subgingival cleanings which were painful & expensive. Not anymore... my WaterPik has saved me the pain, the bills & the lectures.
