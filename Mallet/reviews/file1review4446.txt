review/text: Before I tried this razor, I didn't know what to expect. After all, how many blades does a razor need? A world of "hype" had made me cynical. Well, the Gillette Fusion blade is worthy of the hype. It does what it is supposed to do, give you a great shave, and does it better than any other blade I have ever used. That's it. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. No hype!
