review/text: I suffered from Insomnia since I was about 17. I got into the habit of staying up late and doing work in my bed at college. It soon affected my working skills when I graduated from college and entered the workforce. I was devastated. All I wanted to do was sleep. So, I did a few searches and came across this innovative product called SleepKey. It seemed great over the web, so I decided to try it out. For the first week, I just told it when I went to bed and when I got out of bed. Then during phase two, it emitted a low tone or vibration and wanted me to press a button if I heard it. I followed the instructions and it worked great! It told me to get out of bed if I wasn't sleeping for a long period of time. It made my bedtime later so I would be more tired and....it even made me sleep more soundly. It was amazing. I can't believe I can actually crawl into my bed at my normal bedtime and fall fast sleep. I would definitly recommend this product to anyone with insomnia or sleep problems!
