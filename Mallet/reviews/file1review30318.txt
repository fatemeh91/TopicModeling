review/text: Let me start by saying that there are 3 kids and pets in the house and there is always food and pet hair on the ground especially the kitchen. I purchased this hand vac after buying several cordless hand vacs over a few years. While the cordless hand vac's were good, after a few months, they would loose their charge in 30 seconds. This was very frustrating when you need the cordless vac to finish the job.After I purchased this model, here is what we love about it:PROSThe power is amazing. It picks up everything that we need to pick up. One word of caution is to keep wet and sticky items away. What we love is the power, ease of cleanup and ability to finish the job. The attachments allow you to go on shallow carpets as well which is great. The attachment also allows you to skim floors without bending over. Emptying the vac is a snap.CONSNoneJust one suggestion for the cord - is to build an automatic retractor. It is a pain to manage constantly.Other than that I have to say I really love this and we are purchasing a second one.
