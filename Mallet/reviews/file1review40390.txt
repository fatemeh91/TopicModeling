review/text: Cepacol sore throat lozenges really do the trick when I have a sore throat but I still have to talk where I volunteer or work. These lozenges have a fairly pleasant citrus flavor to them; but you really buy them, of course, for the relief of a nasty sore throat.Read the label instructions and cautionary notes before taking this product. This product contains glucose and sucrose so these lozenges are not for everybody. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist before using these lozenges.The company also provides customers with a toll free number and a website in case they have other questions. Good PR!Overall, I think these are probably the fastest working sore throat lozenges out there. They always work for me; and I highly recommend them.
