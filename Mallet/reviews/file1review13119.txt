review/text: I have 2 herniated disks in my neck. I have good days and bad days. There are times when I take some pretty powerful pain medicine and I still can't sleep. The elasto-gel collar feels so good on my neck I am able to fall asleep. I love it so much I am ordering two more today. I have other cold packs but this is really soft and conforms to your neck. I also like the fact that I don't have to lay down to use it. Being able to velcro it around my neck still allows me to get things done around the house.
