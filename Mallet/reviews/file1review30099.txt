review/text: These are the breath-freshener of choice for one of us at home. The flavor is sweet-cinnamon, a bit hot but not unpleasant. Almost like a candy redhot. If you don't like mint or mouthwash, these may float your boat. The tin is cute, and tiny enough to stash in a cummerbund, watch pocket, even (hmm!) your bra.
