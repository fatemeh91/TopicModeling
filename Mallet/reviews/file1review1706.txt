review/text: we suspected my husband has athletes foot. It showed up after he got a pair of shoes from a second hand store and he's had it for years. This product helps a lot, but it's still there. Maybe there are different levels of athletes foot and my husbands was just too far for this product. It did relieve itch, dryness, pain and swelling so I would say it was worth it.
