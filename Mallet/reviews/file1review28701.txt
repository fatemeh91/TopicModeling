review/text: I'm on my second container of 5lb double rich chocolate this month. It tastes really good. I mix my protein powder with water because I'm lactose intolerant. Sometimes it get my bloated, but It usually isn't a problem. I am seeing great results with ON. I'm on a high protein low calorie diet. I'm gaining strength aswell as shedding the fat at a good rate!
