review/text: I have done a lot of research on the health benefits of vegetable and the greens. This is one of those products that will work in varying degrees for different people, depending on how your body wants to respond, but really, this will do nothing but good for your health.It is shown that cultures with diets high in the the natural form of what is contained here live a longer lives.In addition to regulating the digestive system with the probiotic strains, the vegetables also contain a lot of phytonutrients that help the body, regulating the blood, and allowing your enzymes to work optimally. Very cool. I have felt more energetic and, the most interesting result so far is the clearing of my acne. I used to have pretty bad acne (I'm 23, come on), and probably about a month later from taking this daily, my acne is gone. Pretty marvelous.All in all 5 stars for sure. Worth the money. Really does not even taste that bad, just suck it up, its good for you. In my opinion, if you're gonna drop like $50 on 600g of green powder, it seems like health is more important than taste.
