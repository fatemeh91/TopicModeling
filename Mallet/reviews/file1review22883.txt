review/text: My son is terrified of the vacuum so I had to purchase this. It is absolutely the best purchase I have made in some time. It picks up finger food with ease, paper in a snap, just about any mess a toddler can make it can handle; A wise purchase at our house. The Swiffer products are harmful to small children and pets, plus you have to refill them, this you do not, just dump and store.
