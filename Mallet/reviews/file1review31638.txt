review/text: I bought this kit for my mom to use on her face. She has very coarse hair and complains that it usually takes several applications of wax for the esthetician to get all of the hair. I got everything on the first swipe. It is VERY sticky and left little sticky strings from where you pulled the spatula out, but I've never seen a wax work quite that well. I would recommend buying a larger size of the wax removing cream because it does take a little more effort to get rid of the little spots left behind (and on off your fingers). Overall, I was very impressed with this product and would buy it again.
