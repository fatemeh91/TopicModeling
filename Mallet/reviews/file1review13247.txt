review/text: I never write reviews, but this thing is awesome. I have a male siamese cat, and when he gets stressed he pees on my bed. Gross, right? And very hard to clean up. So, I bought one of these, and laid it across my bed for a couple weeks. I am moving so the stress was building, and it happened, and the blanket was PERFECT!
