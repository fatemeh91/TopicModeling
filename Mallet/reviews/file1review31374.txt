review/text: I've suffered from redness and flare ups on my cheeks for a few years now, I've tried numerous over the counter products with only mediocre results. Right from the first application I noticed an instant and dramatic improvement. I'd estimate the redness has been reduced by 90%, and my skin is much smoother and healthy looking. I've been using it 2-3 times a day and I've got to say my face looks the best it has in years. Nothing short of amazing! I highly recommend giving this a try!
