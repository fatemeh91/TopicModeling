review/text: I hear alot of people complain that the waterpik is so loud - and it is - but you only use it a few minutes a day, and the benefits far outweigh the noise. This model comes with 2 heads and a tongue cleaner and I think it looks nicer than the other models with its deep blue bin that doubles as a cover. Best price I found (without having to wait for 7 day auctions to end grrrr) and it has various settings for the water pressure. I took away a star because it tends to leak a little (they all do) and for the noise, but overall a great value.
