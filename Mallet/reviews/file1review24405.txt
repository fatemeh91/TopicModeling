review/text: I dont think I can really rate this product in fairness. I take Ambien and have for years. I'm trying herbal sleep products in hopes of finding something to help me go to sleep other than Ambien. I have tried many different herbal sleep meds. They do absolutely nothing for me. But if you have never taken prescription sleep meds this may very well work for you. But for me it did not. I dont know that there is any herbal product that will work for me. If you are not used to prescription sleep meds, then I would try at least once.I buy everything thru Amazon. They are the only company I ever order through. I trust them. Products come quickly, no damage, or if you want, easy return.
