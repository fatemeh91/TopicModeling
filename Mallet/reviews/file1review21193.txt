review/text: I was a little put off by the price, but very tired of buying cheap, drugstore pads that burned out with constant use. Once I plugged this in, however, the intense heat reminded me of why I needed a good one in the first place. The pain relief is amazing. It takes a few tries to get the hang of the control (I just hold it in place with the back of my knee) but it's a small trade off for the almost instant relief. I'd have given it 5 stars, but like all the others, it's hard to use on my neck.
