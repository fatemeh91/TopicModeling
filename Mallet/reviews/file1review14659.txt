review/text: Vinpocetine in general has many short and long-term benefits. Short-term benefits include improved memory, cognition, and learning. Personally I noticed an immediate and remarkable improvement in cue-based recall. These benefits last even after cessation of the supplement according to studies. Longer-term benefits include prevention of cognitive decline as demonstrated in humans. Because vinpocetine increases cerebral bloodflow it may aid BBB transport of other supplements taken concurrently.Source Naturals in particular makes a good vinpocetine tab. The tabs may have better absorption properties than capsules, according to many anecdotes (unsure if this is a fact). My lifelong plan is to take 10mg of vinpocetine 2x per day, as a 210lb male. Divided dosing is a good idea, and it's probably best to avoid night-time dosing (although some people report interesting lucid dreams) for sleep quality reasons.
