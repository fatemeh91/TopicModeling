review/text: Hi, I have bought this pen one week ago and I am very surprised about the feeling with this pen. Since the very first day, I am very comfortable with it an any situation. It is true that you cannot feel it as solid as an only ballpoint or mechanical pencil, but quality in general is fine. All metal and good mechanism. I don't think it will be broken in few time.Be careful refilling pencil leads not to break them. It would be helpful if you can take out the one you are using by pushing the button until you can pull it and then, dessasembly the pen to fill others.Balance is perfect in the middle! (you have a video in YouTube)Reliable in general terms and very practice in the everyday work, trust me!Jose.
