review/text: The product itself, the FatTrack Gold and Myotape, comes with quality packaging and good presentation. Both devices appear well made and in line with the product description.FatTrack Gold:Simple operation as far as user set-up and instantaneous calculation of body fat percentage. Simple features and a compact design. In use however, there is the common problem of "user error". Prior to receiving the device I sought out a number of articles and descriptions to accurately take my own body fat measurements. I must say that despite a good sense of the placement of the calipers and practice, readings still vary on a fairly wide level. At this point the device is not being used as a tool to monitor my progress any more than the mirror.MyoTape:The MyoTape was as much a desired purchase as the FatTrack. It is simple, locks into place, and has ample tape to track your various measurements. Easy to use.Conclusion:Give the FatTrack a fair shake on developing consistency, however as an immediate tool I believe the mirror and the scale are more effective.
