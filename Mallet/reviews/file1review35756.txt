review/text: I've been taking this supplement for awhile-I like the solaray brand because they do a really good job of being hypoallergenic. Besides that, this is great stuff to help your liver detoxify-it aids in the body's production of glutathione. That being said, the bottle is rather small, but a good trial size.
