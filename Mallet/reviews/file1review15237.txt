review/text: The only way I can describe these bars is with the word sweet. Too sweet, in fact. They have a good taste as long as you have a real sweet tooth. They're good on the run, but unless you're used to lots of sugar in the morning, I wouldn't recommend them for breakfast. Maybe in place of dessert though.
