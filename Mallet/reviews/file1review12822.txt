review/text: This is a fantastic versatile wrap like most of the Elasto-Gel wraps. I use the cold sinus mask for another purpose. i use it behind my neck when i go to bed. I warm it up in the microwave and set it on my pillow and it provides moist heat pain relief for my tight neck muscles so I can get to sleep. I have a cold right now so I'm gonna try it as a cold sinus mask today. Thank you Elasto-Gel!!!
