review/text: Our son is 3 and well below the charts. Great product to be able to help bump up the calories for picky eaters and kids under weight. We started reacently using this and noticed that his weight is starting to pick up ever so slightly. Couldn't be happier. Can't beat the price on Amazon subcribe and save in comparison buying at the grocery store.
