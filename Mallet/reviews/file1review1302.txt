review/text: Worked great the first few times. But doesn't work near as well after that. It may be due to the large number of prescription drugs I take (blood pressure, chlorstereol, narcotic pain pill for chronic head paink etc). I also take a lot of supplemnents (vitamins B12, C, D, COQ10, Cinnamon, ....).I would recommend you to try it.
