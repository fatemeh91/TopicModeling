review/text: Order via Potters Gifts, I never receive the item. The item shows that it was delivered but I never receive it. Email them to inform them of the issue, and they wanted me to track it down. This is a small ticket item, under $20, it is too petty and they stated that they cannot trust me. Unlike other companies they would resend the item and track the lost item. Never order anything with pottersgifts.
