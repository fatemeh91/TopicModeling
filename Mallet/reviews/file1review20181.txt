review/text: I tried both this and the Tart Cherry variety, also by Dynamic Health, for relief of gout symptoms. I feel more significant relief from the Tart Cherry. The Black Cherry type didn't give any noticeable results. It is still a good product, it is tasty and makes a nice juice when mixed with water. No reason to skimp on stars, but for information purposes, those looking for gout relief may find better results(as I did) with the Tart variety.
