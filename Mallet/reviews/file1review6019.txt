review/text: The reviews seem generally good, but clearly a high proportion of what they turn out is defective, and customer service serves mainly to obstruct rather than replace. We bought two in succession and had the same experience. When they worked, they were fine. We followed all instructions and made normal use of them. In a short time, they began to show error messages or simply not register anything. Thinking logically, we replaced the batteries. No difference. We called customer service. They put us through an inquisition, suggesting that our (normal) wrists were the wrong size, that we used then too much, etc. Really outlandish. The aim was clearly to blame the victim. We passed every test, but all they offered us was an unwieldy return, charges, an indefinite period without a meter.My local drug store tells me that they have received similar complaints and are no longer carrying this item.I wouldn't gamble on this one: you may be the person who has a good experience with it, but, after two bad experiences, I think the odds are poor.
