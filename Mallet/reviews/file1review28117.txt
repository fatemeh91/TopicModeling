review/text: I like the reputation and value of this protein powder, along with the low calorie count, and low contaminant level (as measured by consumer reports). But I did want to point out this isn't the best tasting powder (Double Chocolate Flavor), and it doesn't mix thickly in water. I just came form a powder I bought locally, (1st-phorm level 1), which mixed well with 4 oz. of water and tasted like a shake. It also cost $43 for 3 lbs.! I previously mixed my shakes in milk because they didn't taste all that good with water. I haven't tasted many different current powders, but I can say this isn't the best tasting stuff out there. Due to price and reputation, I'll stick with ON, and will just keep trying different flavors.
