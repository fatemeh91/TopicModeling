review/text: If you are looking for new ways to incorporate soy products into your life, Clif Bars are one of the best tasting energy bars on the market. I've given up trying other bars that are mostly disappointingly filled with all sorts of oils I can't eat. Take cottonseed for example it is in everything! Not to mention, peanut butter and all the palm kernel oil saturating the health bar market.The ingredients in the Carrot Cake Bar:Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Soy Protein Isolate, Rice Flour, Malt Extract, Organic Soy Flour, Organic Roasted Soybeans, Organic Rolled Oats, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Dried Apples, Cocoa Butter, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavors, Apple Fiber, Oat Fiber, Organic Milled Flaxseed, Chicory Extract, Psyllium, Organic soy Butter, Dried Carrots, Raisins, Coconut, Sea Salt, Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Cloves.Each bar is 240 Calories and is delicious for breakfast with a cup of tea. I eat a Clif Bar almost every morning and never really feel overly hungry during the day.Gary (The Owner of Clif Bar Inc.) seems to have also found out that "other" energy bars were not really that tasty. After his "epiphany," he spent lots of time in his Mom's kitchen working on making cliff bars. What a guy! I was at the point where I was trying to make my own granola bars, but after discovering these bars, I'm hooked. They are portable, delicious and basically, I love all the flavors. You can take them biking, hiking, walking, anywhere.This bar is especially delicious and I seem to fall in love with it again each October. Must be the spices and the creamy white chocolate chips. There are just enough chocolate chips to remind you of cream cheese icing. If I had to choose between a piece of carrot cake and one of these bars, the bar would win.Also look for the Cranberry Apple Cherry Bars and the PumpkinSpice Bars.~The Rebecca Review
