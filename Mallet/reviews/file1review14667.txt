review/text: I've been taking Ginko and Gotu Kola for years and notice a difference when I stop taking them.However I had a definite improvement within a couple of weeks after I started taking this. It feels like the fog has lifted. Also it's easier to wake up in the morning. My mind is sharp throughout the day. I will continue to take this.
