review/text: The AccuMassage is a great way to easily put pressure on tight neck muscles to get them to release. The Body Back Buddy has more knobs & a great tip on one end that is angled in to better put pressure and pull on tight large muscles along the spine so it has more functions than the Theracane which I had been using for years. The hook ends are a little small for a big guy like me (6', 220 lbs.) but I can still get to the tight spots, but I wouldn't buy one if you are any bigger than I am. My wife likes this one a lot better than the Theracane. The Body Back Buddy seems to be available at a lower price than the Theracane.
