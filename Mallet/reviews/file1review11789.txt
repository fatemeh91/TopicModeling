review/text: I agree! As a gastric bypass patient, protein is a number 1 concern, and of the products I've tried, this is my favorite. It's breakfast everyday these days. Delicious warm in the winter and cold in the summer. If you want it a little more chocolatey you can add a teaspoon or two of Carnation Instant Breakfast, but this stuff is good as it is. I like to add it to lactose-free non-fat milk for an extra protein boost.
