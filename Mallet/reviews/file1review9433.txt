review/text: I lost a microbead pillow over the summer (which I loved) I figured Amazon was the place to find a replacement. I did indeed find one, which arrived in it's usual timely manner (I have Amazon Prime) I was very happy until I discovered microbeads IN MY BED. Upon inspection I discovered a small hole (Ah ha! The bead escape path!) I took my handy super glue gel, put a dot of it on the offending hole and now all is well (a bit unsightly but no beads escaping)
