review/text: These Thermoskin arthritic gloves from YGM, LLC are wonderful. I have very bad arthritis in my hands and I wear these gloves every night and my hands feel so much better. One of my fingers is bending to the right. These gloves are helping to make my fingers straighter. The gloves are very sturdy. The stitching is very neat and the seams lay down well.As I liked the first pair so well I decided to have a second pair. That way I could wash one pair and wear one pair.I ordered another pair not realizing they came from another company, Spectrum Alliance Inc. The second pair, although Thermoskin, is very cheaply made and nothing like the quality of the first pair I received. The first pair give support for my fingers, and are much warmer. There is little support in the second pair. The seams are roughly sewn. (I sew so I notice things like that).I shall be returning the second pair as unacceptable. Both pairs are made in Cambodia but they have different numbers.
