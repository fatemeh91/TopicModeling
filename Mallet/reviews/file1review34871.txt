review/text: Well, don't expect too much, but it will good enough for about 4-5 shaves before you have to hone it again. Yep, I consider myself an expect on straight razor and have sold quite a number of razors in ebay. Search the name straightrazorsmith, and that is me.Back to the review of this razor. Good solid razor is what it is all about, but when I hone this razor, I can feel the softness of its metal. It is very easily to hone because of it soft metal, and so it won't hold the edge long. This razor is really not something you want to buy. Even you know how to correctly hone your razor, it will take too much work.But if 4-5 shaves is what you really looking for, it is not that bad for the price, though you still have to get a good honing stone, since it is not a shave-ready.But if you want a good blade (not for shaving), it is a great letter opener. It actually comes pretty sharp compared to a normal knife.
