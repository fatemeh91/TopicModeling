review/text: I love these pads. I'm using them for a stud cat who tends to leave a puddle or two at the door of the room I confine him in at night. What prompted me to try these pads were the sticky tabs to hold the pad down. They are very good for cats who tend to dig and claw. I'm impressed that the stickum on the tabs actually does stick, and is effective again and again. If the pad is not used I can fold the tabs back and they can be used multiple times. The only caveat is that in the folding process at the manufacturer the tabs often are slightly askew and will catch on the backing which needs to be ripped to release the tab. However, so far this has not affected the effectiveness of the pad which is excellent. It absorbs a lot of moisture w/o leaking and stays dry on the surface.
