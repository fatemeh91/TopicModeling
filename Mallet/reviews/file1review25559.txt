review/text: I'm unfortunately getting to the stage where hair starts growing in more and more places that I don't want it to. So I needed a trimmer, and one that could handle the ears and nose. This little guy works great. I doesn't pull and gets in pretty close. My only complaint is that the vibrations from the head tickle the heck out of my nose. But all in all, a good choice.
