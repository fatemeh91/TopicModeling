review/text: We love our pad cover, and we're not having any of the issues others are having... it fits nicely on the Simmons contoured changing pad and doesn't pull up on the corners. I wash mine in cold water and dry on medium, haven't seen any ripping, loose threads, or anything. I'd definitely buy another one. Maybe I just got a good one, or maybe Simmons is making them better now?
