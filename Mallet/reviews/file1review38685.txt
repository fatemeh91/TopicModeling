review/text: I used to use the regular Opti-free, but switched to the Replenish after my eye doctor recommended it. My eyes get so dry, that some days as soon as I would get off work, I would have to take my contacts out. After using this for a week, what an improvement! As soon as I put my lenses in in the morning, I can feel a difference on my eyeballs. The contacts kind of feel like a drop of cool water being put in your eyes. This solution keeps my contacts moist all day, without me having to put eyedrops in my eyes. I'm finishing up a bottle of the regular Opti-free, and there's such a difference between the two. It just doesn't hold any moisture at all and the contacts feel dry in my eyes right off the bat. I can't wait until that bottle is done so that I can go back to the Replenish.I've not had any irritation with this porduct like some reviewers. According to my eye doctor, it has the same active ingredients as the old Opti-free.
