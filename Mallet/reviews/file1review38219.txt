review/text: I was first introduced to psyllium husk over four years ago by a coworker extolling the benefits of it. After researching the subject, I began by adding a tablespoon to my morning "super-antioxidant-fruit-smoothie"--or if traveling just mixing with a glass of juice. I have rarely missed a day since and baring a worldwide shortage will continue to make it part of my daily diet.Not wanting to include a graphical description, I will suffice to say it took the mystery out of my daily bowel movement and turned it into an innocuous and brief experience. I cannot recall the last time I suffered any kind of stomach orintestinal discomfort and believe psyllium husk has played a starring role in that. About a year ago I convinced a very close friend to give it a try and now he too has become a daily user.If you decide to try it, do purchase the powder (any brand will do) as I have tried coarser grinds on occasion and they did not seem to work quiet as well.
