review/text: I've used this one in the past, and just ordered more. It's got a fairly good taste and is very palatable, mixes OK. But best of all, I got really good results with it. Just remember to use a loading dose for five days, then change to the maintenance dose, and cycle off during the very hottest months of the summer. Drink plenty of water while taking creatine.
