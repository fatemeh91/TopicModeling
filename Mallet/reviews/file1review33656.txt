review/text: I have used this for about 2 months and find it to be a very good dental device. It performs as expected, and has the features I need. So far there is no leakage of water from anywhere on the unit, but that may come with time. The one downside is that it is a bit noisy, but I don't think that can be avoided, given how the unit has to operate to do its' job.
