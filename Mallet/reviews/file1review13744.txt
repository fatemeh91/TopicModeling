review/text: I live in the Northwest and find after working in the yard on cold fall days when I heat this great thing up and snuggle up with it, all my aches and soreness fade away. I am delighted with it's weight, the soothing herbal aroma, and the length of time it stays warm. I haven't tried a cold application yet, but expect to when the circumstances arise. This is an excellent product.
