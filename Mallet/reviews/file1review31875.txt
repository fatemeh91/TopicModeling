review/text: It's not that the Art of Shaving products are a scam, they are just very over-priced. In each of their products, I've been able to substitute a cheaper alternative with the exception of this after shave balm.This balm gives my sensitive skin the best relief over any other after shave I've tried, and I've tried many. Fragrance is present, but not as over powering as most after shave balms. Also, like Eucerin (a dry skin cream), the balm leaves a residue, which some might not like, but for me it seems to be the key in making the product both unique and effective.Please, someone find me a cheaper alternative!
