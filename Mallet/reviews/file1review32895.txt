review/text: The thing about this product is that it's not an easy subject to bring up. For a long time I've had issues, the kind that this product was made for. I tried different products meant to do the same thing without much help. I had tried some natural medicinals tea for a cold once and it worked well so I decided to try Smooth Move out and the morning following the night I had some everything worked like it should. So well, I'm addicted now. I feel great and more normal in that area than ever before. It works.
