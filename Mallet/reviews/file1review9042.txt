review/text: Product is power packed full of nutrients. The smoothies I make are filling and I actually save money over time because I am eating less. I drink the Rainbow Vibrance in the morning, and then drink this in the afternoon. I will be adding Miracle Reds in the evening (comes as a 3 month supply), but that hasn't arrived yet.Okay, so this stuff tastes as bad as many of the reviewers say it does. So...what to do? Well, I like chocolate. I blend this powder with almond milk, a few almonds, organic raw cocoa powder, raw antioxidant honey, a bit 'o kelp (a tiny bit, mind you), and organic vanilla extract. YUMMY!! (if you are willing to pretend the aftertaste doesn't really happen, hehehe). Seriously, this ends up being a solidly rich and healthy chocolate afternoon meal substitute. And, you spent less money than you would have if you had packed a lunch for the two months straight that this stuff will last....my two cents.
