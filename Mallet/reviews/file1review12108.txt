review/text: These prenatals are great. Swallowing ANYTHING during the "morning" sickness phase was difficult, but once I got it down it seemed to actually settle my stomach. Maybe it's the ginger. They have helped with my energy level, which really tanked right at the beginning of the pregnancy, and like I said they helped my MS. I also like that these are food based- food based vitamins seem to sit better in my belly. Great product!
