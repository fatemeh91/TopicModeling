review/text: This is near impossible to drink. It is impossible to mask the taste. It tastes like rancid fish and smells like bleach. Dilute it in as little water as possible. I used to dilute it with 25oz of water with ice tea mix to kill the taste. It didn't work. Then I just did it with water because there is too much sugar in the ice tea mix. The taste was just impossible to bear. It is slow torture. Dilute it in half a cup of water, close your nose, and chug it.It works. I am less sore the day after a workout. You recoupe and heal much faster. The day after a workout, you feel slight soreness, but nothing compared to what you would feel without drinking arginine.
