review/text: My husband and I just bought a new house and therefore several new appliances. I bought this after having positive experiences with other Method products and must admit was extremely disappointed.This product does NOT actually clean the steel. When we had the fridge and hood installed there were tons of fingerprints all over it, and this product only made the already visible smudges even larger. We actually used the Method all-surface cleaner to get the smudges off and polish the stainless steel.The only thing I can that this product does is protect the surface from getting smudges once it is properly cleaned.... so only about 25% of the intended use.
