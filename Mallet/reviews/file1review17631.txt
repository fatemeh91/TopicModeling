review/text: This is a great little trimmer and the first one I've ever owned. Compared to the laborious comb and scissors I was using before, the Remington trimmer does a much better job in a fraction of the time. It cuts without any tugs or pulls, and fits my hand well. It seems solidly made, and I have yet to recharge it after 3 weeks of use. Wish I had bought it sooner!
