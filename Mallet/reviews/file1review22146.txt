review/text: I take these because my diet is poor in some nutrients such as zinc, chromium, and some of the B vitamins which I need in relatively high quantities to deal with my various issues which I don't want to get into here. Taking supplements for each of these nutrients individually is not really an option for me.The product does seem to supply me with what I need. The only problem is that it also causes stomach upset, even if I take it with a meal, and especially if I take it on an empty stomach.
