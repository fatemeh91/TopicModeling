review/text: Honestly, this was the first time I ever got hemorrhoids and I was desperate to finding a cure because it was excrutiatingly painful going to the bathroom. I'll tell you right now the secrets to getting rid of these bad boys in a matter of 2-3 days (or at least reducing pain by 80%). 1. Take a shower and clean the inside of rear with very very warm/hot water, this will relax the tissue and minimize the pain by a very significant amount. 2. Use Tucks Medicated cooling pads to deeply clean that area and provide some additional relieve. Basically this acts as a primer, before you apply this cream on. 3. Afterwards, apply this cream on and around the area. There is no need to apply generously, use a small amount. It will feel as if its a cooling sensation, but its working. This cream is unbelievable and I tell you now, after you get this, you'll never fear those dreaded roids ever again. Excellent product, you will not regret it.
