review/text: I first saw this on a commercial and decided to do some research. I clicked on the first couple of links and read only good-great reviews. I should have known better, being from a marketing backgroud with search engines.....only the positive reviews are listed first. Well, I bought the blue pills and took my first pill this morning. I only took one pill and ate breakfast (and a ton of water) within the next 30 minutes. Let me tell you that it has been over 12 hours since I just took ONE capsule and I still feel miserable. From the get-go, I started to feel disoriented. Then, came the uncontrollable urination, then the non-stop vomiting, never-ending dizzines and lastly, consistent jitters. I really felt like this was the start of what an overdose would feel like. I kept drinking water, even drank some milk. This stimulant is supposed to give you energy to work out, but how can you work out if you instantly start feeling adverse symptoms? False advertising if you ask me. Imagine if I had taken the "recommended dosage" of 2 capsules with two main meals. After feeling the way I have felt today, I have realized I would rather have some chunkies than to be the desparate person who will continue to experience symptoms and be miserable and skinny. It is simply not worth it.
