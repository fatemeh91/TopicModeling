review/text: I bought this for my brother for Christmas. We have a connective tissue disorder which causes chronic pain. Specifically, he has incredible pain in his shoulder, under the shoulder blade. For years, I have watched him press his shoulder into walls, doorknobs, and window frames to find some relief. Even though I thought the Body Back Buddy was a little expensive, I'd done my research against similar items, and thought it was the best choice to give him.He wasn't sure what to make of the contraption, at first, but after putting it to use, he was blissed out! When his family wanted to test it, he acted like Gollum with his "Precious", pulling it to one side in a "Mine!" maneuver. No one else is allowed to touch it. He wanted to give it a name, so he could confess his love to it over and over. We finally decided on the name "Prince", because it looks like the symbol that (the artist formerly known as) Prince uses now. (I can't believe I just typed that.) So, now when speaks to me, he just tells me that "Prince is still serving him well", or he "still can't go a day without Prince". LOL!He loves it so much that I bought the smaller (purple) version for myself. It arrived yesterday. I also bought a trigger point book to go with it and it's fantastic! I feel the same way about "Princess". HA! Mine...all mine!Yes, it was expensive, but relieving that kind of pain is worth every penny. I feel that this tool is sturdy and will last a long, long time. It's well-designed and that's worth paying for.
