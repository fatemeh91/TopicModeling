review/text: I have been purchasing the Balance Bar Yogurt Honey Peanut bars for over three years. I have tried other products but these taste the best. They contain 15 grams of protein. They are a great tool for maintaining weight or loosing weight. I use them in place of a meal or for a healthy snack. They are nutritional and satisfying.
