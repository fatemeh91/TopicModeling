review/text: Based on all the hype I decided to give this a try. I have very sensitive skin with a tough beard that sems not to grow in any particular grain. OK, so it has 5 blades; truth is it doesn't shave any better than the model with 3 but the blades are hideously expensive. I also have the 3 blade power model which is another bad joke unto itself. I still have to go over and over the same area, shave from different angles over the same space and it takes just as long and gives no better shave. True it was a nice touch to add the precision trimmer blade to the top side but I'm not sure that justifies the cost either. I will probably use the 2 blades that came with it and then put it in the goodwill bag. Oh yes, by the way, it is very pretty, if that makes a difference when you are shaving.
