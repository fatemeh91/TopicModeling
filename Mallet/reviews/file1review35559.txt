review/text: I bought these along with Nature's Way prenatal vitamins to see which I liked best. To be honest, I didn't think there would be much difference. I was taking these for about a week and felt great, no problems. Then I took the others one day and felt sick an hour afterwards for several hours. It just seemed too harsh on my stomach. This brand has DHA, Ginger (good for morning sickness), and digestive enzymes. You do have to take it twice a day (two pills at a time) but that way I know I am getting adequate absorption of the vitamins and nothing is getting flushed out. Also, liquid capsules are more easily absorbed by the body than tablets.Highly recommended!
