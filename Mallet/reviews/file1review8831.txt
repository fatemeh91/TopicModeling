review/text: Does this taste great? Definitely not. Aesthetically pleasing? Even more unpleasent to look at than how it tastes. Is it worth it? 100% yes!The health benefits of this product are exquisite. Reading the label might create a placebo effect of feeling healthier, but that in itself would make me purchase the product. It creates an energy boost a short while after drinking and left my body feeling much closer to homeostasis the next morning. For those who have taste buds of steel, there's no reason to not take this product at least once a day by just mixing it with a glass of water. However, for those picky eaters who are either taste sensitive, or just now making the transition to a healthier life style, here's a few suggestions that have worked for me. (aka, a fellow picky eater)I also have Vibrant Health's Rainbow Vibrance, and this is a much more pleasent taste. I consider it a natural fruit punch taste, as do many others who have purchased it. I take a scoop of green vibrance and rainbow vibrance together, and either add 8 oz of apple juice, 8 oz of water with a crystal light packet (the fruit punch flavor), 8 oz of a light lemonade (the one I purcased is only 15 calories) or 8 oz of orange juice. Any one of these, or any combination of several of these, SHOULD be able to appease the taste buds and cancel out the taste of the green vibrance.Also, I'd like to note that I use a small personal blender (there's one on Amazon for 15 dollars) to mix all my shakes. This should prevent clumping in the green vibrance. Warning, it will turn your shakes green!Best of luck!
