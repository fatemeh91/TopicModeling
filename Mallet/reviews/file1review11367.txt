review/text: I make it short: This product is cheap garbage!No support, not really elastic.If you want great ankle supports then buy the ones from TWINS (Muay Thai and MMA products for a tight budget).I also can highly recommend Bauerfeind ankle supports, "Aircast" ankle supports or taping with Leukotape, which takes a little time and practise -but it has the best support and protection (my personal opinion).
