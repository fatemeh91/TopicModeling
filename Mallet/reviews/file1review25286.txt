review/text: Read the book and was impressed. Have been using End Pain for over 2 years. It does have a blood-thining property, but not a problem unless you're having surgery, then it should be stopped about a week or two before surgery.I started taking 6 pills a day, then over time tapered off to 5, then 4,then 3, then 2, then 1, which seems to maintain no pain for me. However, it takes time for the product to accumlate in the body. Further, it didn't work for the muscle pain I was experiencing, as a result of using a floride toothpaste. Stopped the toothpaste, bought one (Tom's of Maine) without floride, muscle pain now gone. So, it is important to know what kind of pain you're treating.
