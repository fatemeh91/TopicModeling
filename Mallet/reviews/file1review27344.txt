review/text: I love the taste of this with my almond vanilla milk because it taste just like a strawberry and banana smoothie. adding water is alright but it just doesn't taste as great. The powder blended really well you don't really need a shaker and i didn't feel bloated after. low on carb and fat so overall best protein shake i ever had.
