review/text: WHEN I RECEIVED MY 2 SHOULDER WRAPS I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE WRAPS WERE COVERED IN A FURRY KIND OF MATERIAL AND AFTER BEING IN THE FREEZER FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS LAID OUT FLAT I PUT ONE ON MY NECK AND THE FURRY MATERIAL WAS HOT NOT HELPING COOL ME DOWN. I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER BOUGHT SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THEY HAVE A PERMANENT PRESS LIKE MATERIAL AND ARE THE GREATEST. CHANGE THE MATERIAL THEY ARE MADE OF ON THE OUTSIDE AND GET BACK TO ME. THANKS SUSAN
