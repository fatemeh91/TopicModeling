review/text: this really doesn't matter, just something curious about what i got. instead of getting a single pack of 8 AA batteries, i got 2 packs of 4. it doesn't matter, i still got my 8 batteries, and they are supposed to be good for up to 10 years, so i'm not worried about them being expired. i got what i asked for, can't expect more =].
