review/text: My son has been using a trainer potty, but if I never have to wipe one of those out again it will be too soon. Borrowed another type of toilet-mount seat, but it slipped around and pinched his legs. Then I came across this one, and it is THE BEST!! I never knew I could get excited about a toilet seat, but this has really made my life easier.
