review/text: Our Sonicare finally died after 4 years. It has a nice long track record so we were taking a chance when we decided to replace it with the Triumph. We loved it so much that we bought them as gifts for our family. The small head is great for hard to reach back teeth. It is also great for small children. We use the extra soft head on the soft settings for our 21-month son. One minute of brushing with this toothbrush is as good as 2 minutes with the manual one. Sometimes he brushes his own teeth because he likes the techy-gadget toothbrush.
