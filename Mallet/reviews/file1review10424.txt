review/text: about 20 years ago all i would use is tek toothbrushes. i am someone that likes a firm toothbrush, my teeth have never been damaged by a firm toothbrush. tek used to make a quality firm toothbrush that lasted a long time. those days are gone! i was happy to find out that tek toothbrushes still existed but disappointed when my toothbrush arrived. now it is about the quality of what you would find at your local $1 store. firm is no longer firm and it's not long lasting.
