review/text: This is a review of the D-size battery packI bought these for a flashlight. They work decently, but the flashlight doesn't seem as bright as it did with the previous set of batteries. Unfortunately the old batteries got tossed before I got to see what kind they were. Anyway, these batteries do work and the flashlight is working again, it just seems slightly dimmer than it was.Not sure yet how long they'll last, but that's why I got an 8-pack! They do so far seem to be holding up well for use in a flashlight that gets used briefly on a daily basis.Bottom-line: I don't have many devices that require a D battery, but I am glad to have these on hand for when I do need them. If you need a pack of D batteries on hand, grab these.
