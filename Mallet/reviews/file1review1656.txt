review/text: Well I didn't know it was a health food! I just bought it because friends were always bringing some tasty dish to a pot luck, and when it was one of those creations that made you ask for the recipe, well, most of the times the'd say "and it has some Bragg's amino's in it.." Kinda salty, not in a bad way, kinda like soy sauce, like a rich expensive soy sauce, kinda smokey, like adding a special kick to some foods; greens, mashed taters, soup, rice, even popcorn.Contains Amino Acids? like in protein? yep. And it's cruelty free eating, so there.
