review/text: A nose trimmer is not a complicated piece of machinery, but is a necessary one. Using clippers or scissors just doesn't make it and you risk infection. This device has tiny surgical stainless-steel blades and runs fast and smooth. No pinching and no discomfort. It is a bit touchy to clean as the central shaft and blades once out rather easily for cleaning under tap water. I could easily see losing a piece down the drain. But for a small, lightweight and packable `nose and ear' trimmer, it does the job and it's not that expensive. I'll be the first to admit that nose trimmers are not sexy, but neither are nose hairs!Battery not included. Also, when I first got my trimmer, the ON/OFF button wouldn't turn off. I returned it and was given a new one within a week.
