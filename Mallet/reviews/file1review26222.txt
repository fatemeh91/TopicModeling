review/text: NOW Plant Enzymes are the vegetarian version of pancreatin which is usually derived from pigs or other animalsNOW Foods Plant Enzymes, 240 Vcaps. There are many digestive problems originating from a lack of digestive enzymes secreted by the human pancreas. The pancreas and gall bladder secrete the enzymes that are necessary for the small intestine (jejunum) to absorb the nutritive molecules after food has been broken down first in the stomach. Due to various reasons, the stomach may not produce enough acid, gastrin, secretin, and the food is not broken down enough for the pancreatic enzymes to finish the job. Consequently, the molecule which should be no more than one to one and a half in size cannot be absorbed through the small intestinal wall and the person over eats, feels constantly hungry, and is malnourished. Taking a supplement of pancreatic enzymes can help correct this.NOW does a good job for me because the pain and inflammation have subsided since I began taking them. The digestive enzymes in plant pancreatin from NOW are designed to increase the power of the enzymes the body does secrete: amylase (sugar), protease (protein), lipase (fat). Also are cellulose and lactose. These plant pancreatic enzymes help to digest food more thoroughly and along with other medicine and aids, can help improve health through more nutrition being delivered to the body. I did find that they helped but I also stay on a diet to help the enzymes do their job.
