review/text: Well, i bought two of this blood pressure moniter to my parents. They are working well, so far. Some suggestions are as following. i wish the manufacturer will see the suggestions.1, the battery cap is very hard to open. not complain, but you really need a sharp nail to dip it up.2, a little confuse if you do not read the manual before first time using. you do not know how to set up the the monitor. actually, it needs two times of reboot to begining its original working.3, very easy to scratch the LCD surface.Overall, it is a good deal~
