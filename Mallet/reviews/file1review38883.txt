review/text: I have the curse of every dark-haired girl with any ethnic background - profound leg hair. Each hair is thick enough to string a tennis racket and I just don't feel clean unless I have thoroughly shaved my legs and no stubble is showing.I don't care much for the hollow handle that drips water everywhere, or for the cheesy pink color and embedded flower pattern, but the blades can't be beat.I have tried different razors, those marketed for men and women, and I've tried single, double and triple blade disposable razors, and non-disposable varieties. The smooth lubricating strip at the top and the perfect distance between the strip and the blades makes for a perfect shave that does not involve accidentally peeling off a strip of skin - carrot-peeler style, as I've had happen with other razors.As I mentioned above, the crazy grooves all over the handle and the back of the unit catch water and then spill all over your hands and legs as you shave, rinse and continue shaving - it's enough to drive you crazy!I like to be a smart shopper and there are many times I will opt for the &quot;store brand&quot; at the grocery store, but not when it comes to these razors. The store brand versions of the Daisy Razors bend too easily and you end up accidentally stripping off parts of yourself along with the hair - makes for a painful, long cut before you realize what you've done.It's beyond me why they can't make these in black - or at least yellow, without the embedded flowers and other features that grab every droplet of water so you can spill it on yourself again... but for now, it's the best I've ever used.
