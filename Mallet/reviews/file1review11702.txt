review/text: My five-year-old twins don't eat much and are very picky on food. They've been drinking PediaSure for their breakfast since they were even younger; it's the only thing they drink, eat in the morning. They drink some juice, mostly soy milk for the rest of the day. It seems to work for them as they are healthy, seldom get sick. The only complaint I have about PediaSure is that it's too sweet! Thankfully, my kids don't eat much other sweets.
