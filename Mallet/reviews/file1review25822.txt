review/text: I've always used Norelcos.. and my last two were great. My last Norelco broke, and I bought their new top-of-the-line. I use this both to trim my beard and head.. and it was uneven, cheaply made, required lots of effort, and would not operate without a charge (couldn't plug it in when the battery died.)I replaced it with this panasonic which has:-really sharp, even-cutting (!!) blades-quiet (yes!!)-doesn't have the norelco's vacuum, but oh well. It didn't work well anyway (and probably caused most of it's problems.)-works on multiple voltages.. yeah!!!!-has a screw to open it up and change the nicad battery when it eventually won't charge anymore (the new norelco's have NO access to the battery.. basically like a disposable.)-comes with blade oil, you can tell they take their blades seriously.Get it before they outsource their production to some third world country.. hehe (the supposedly made in austria norelco is 100% made in ***** inside... no offense to *****... but you know..)
