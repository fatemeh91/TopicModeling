review/text: Very happy that I've found this brand and quality of prenatal vitamins. Prior to this I was using One a Day and also tried the CVS brand. I'm preparing my body to try to conceive sometime and I thought this vitamins have very good ingredients. One thing is it does not have the DHA that other prenatal does. DHA is good to have. However if you take fish oils (make sure they are the safe kind and without mercury; some recommend plant based DHA) like I do, then you're covered. I'm tolerating this vitamin. I take it with DCI first thing in the morning and together along wih other supplements, I use it to heal my PCOS symptoms naturally. These do not have those additives that other vitamins have. I got it for a good price $9+ for a 90 pill bottle. When I came back though it's already $14+. Hopefully, it will not go high much in terms if price. definitely will purchase these again.
