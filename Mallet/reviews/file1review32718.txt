review/text: I bought this wrap to use while is cleaned the brace I got from my Orthopedic doctor. I found the size (4X) just a little larger than my brace from the orthopedic doctor, but was able to wear this wrap to help stabilize my knee while the brace was drying. This wrap is not as sturdy as my orthopedic brace, but the price is much less and it works for what I wanted it for.
