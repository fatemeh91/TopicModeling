review/text: I got my 20 oz. bottle of Tropical gel and used some right away. Seemed to do me just fine on an hour-long run. The taste wasn't great, though. I was a little surprised, though, to find caffeine (25mg) listed as an ingredient. It was very surprising considering that the Amazon description states that the only flavor with caffeine is the espresso one. I feel a little cheated there since I wanted something without caffeine. The Hammer website does show caffeine, so it's Amazon's fault really. I'll try another flavor next time.
