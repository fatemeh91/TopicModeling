review/text: I love this self-massage tool! It has many knobs, allowing you to manipulate to all body parts needing massage. You get to control the depth of the massage by using the convenient handles. I was amazed at how well it really worked for relaxing those tense/tight muscles. I have Fibromyalgia and I am accustomed to aching muscles in my back and ribs. This tool allows me to get deep into the aches and release the toxins. My only regret is that I didn't buy two of them so I would have one to use at work. The price was reasonable for the quality and the use.
