review/text: This has been the perfect answer to my problems. As a mature adult, I was concerned that I was having to get braces and after dealing with my children's experiences with braces (almost 20 years ago), I knew that I had to be really careful about daily cleaning. I love the design which keeps up to 3 nozzles on the side and under the water tank. The waterpik water flosser has helped keep my teeth and braces so clean that my dental hygienist was impressed.
