review/text: I owned two Sonicares and most recent a Rotadent (which was boasted by my own dentist). The Sonicare has consistently delivered results for several years. The Rotadent stopped working after less than 3 months (which I will never touch again). I purchased the Triumph 9000 and was so impressed the cleaning power of the brush. I conducted my own un-scientific study and concluded that the OralB was more superior to the Sonicare. The superiority comes in the form of the smaller and rotating head vs. the side to side motion. I highly recommmend the Oral-B Triumph 9000.
