review/text: I just want buyers to have fair warning that the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor tastes absolutely awful. I've been trying to choke it down for about a week - thinking maybe I'd warm up to it or find a way to tolerate it - and I officially give up.First off it does not dissolve well, which is something I've heard as a positive for the brand in general. Nope, not this flavor. No matter how much liquid or the method of blending there's always thick floaties and residue. That's even with a high speed blender. It's gritty, and worse - if you try to mix it with a spoon or shaker bottle you'll get big clumps that stick to your teeth like cotton candy.Those clumps - and the drink in general - tastes awful. If you've ever had powered milk then have the basis of the yucky flavor - add to it a sort of vitamin-esque pungency and you've probably got a good idea where it all went wrong. At first I thought it was my creatine that i mixed in with the protein - nope. Then I tried water, milk, and even juice to try and blend it. I even tried low fat and 2% milk to see if either made it more tolerable. Still disgusting. And you know what? It's not even a vanilla flavor - you sort of a "cream" that I don't associate with vanilla at all. I'd say it's more like almost pancake mix.. not sweet, not really flavored, just kinda of chalky and gritty with that weird pungent chemical taste.. Maybe described as like if you took Bisquick powder, added water, and tried to drink it.I regularly drink protein shakes so it's not like I'm adverse to them in general. I trust the reviews of the other flavors and the nutritional value, but the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor was just awful.
