review/text: I have to say that I bought this protein due to so many good reviews on this site and others. I was taking Cytosport Complete Whey when I began reading the reviews. I had not worked out or taken a protein powder in years and was trying to get back into working out. Many people who liked Cytosport also like this protein and some were switching saying that it was more cost effective, etc. It does have a good amount of protein, and it doesn't have some of the cholesterol and other undesirables that Cytosport's Whey has. It is cost-effective and relies more on isolate than concentrate as opposed to Cytosport's whey. I got the vanilla bean when I bought the Cytosport and naturally gravitated toward the vanilla ice cream flavor of this one. I don't really care for chocolate protein shakes. I will say that the Cytosport Whey tastes better especially when mixed with water. This one is hard to handle for me in just water. They both are great when mixed with milk (e.g. skim milk). Having said that, Optimum Nutrition's whey protein is probably the best for you; however, I do not look forward to drinking it the way I did when I was on the Cytosport Complete Whey. I know now that they have another vanilla flavor and maybe I will try that one instead. But that's just my opinion. In most of the reviews I have read, people have really liked the taste. Ultimately its your decision.
