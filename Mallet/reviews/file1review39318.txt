review/text: Previous product reviews stated that the device was uncomfortable to wear even over clothing to prevent chafing. I thought I would be able to modify the item but I was wrong. One size does not fit all and my attempt to add commercial bra extenders was not successful. Perhaps someone of slight size might be able to use the support brace. I could not. The picture is accurate and should be looked at carefully.
