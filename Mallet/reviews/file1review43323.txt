review/text: I normally use the Windex Natural Glass & surface Cleaner but this was on sale at my local store so I thought I would give it a try. Well I wish I could be one of the positive reviews on here but my experience was not the same. I had a TON of streaks on everything!! My husband is the one that noticed a few hours later all the streaks on the mirrors and windows AND it took me a lot longer to clean the faucets that normally wipe clean because ever time I wiped another streak would appear. I will say that it smells wonderful ! Very minty and clean but that was about the only pro for me. I did see some of the reviews saying that they used a Microfiber cloth instead of papertowls so I will give it a try so I dont waste $5.00. I will keep my fingers crossed....
