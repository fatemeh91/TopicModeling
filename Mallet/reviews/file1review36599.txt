review/text: My wife is the Irish one in the household but Irish Spring is my soap of choice for the simple reason that it is one of the few hand soaps I have found that does not irritate my sensitive hands. I do not exactly remember how I stumbled upon this happy fact, but ever since I discovered this to be the case I have stuck with Irish Spring. When I go out of town on trips even I take along a bar of so I do not have to deal with whatever strange generic soaps I might encounter in a hotel room. The scent is nice enough, the color is different from most soaps, and the bar is shaped in such a way that it is easier to hold on to in the shower. It is also readily available in bulk packages and I like the touch o' class that it is one of the few soaps that still comes in boxes rather than individually wrapped. I can not speak to the idea of being "waterfall clean," but as long as hands are happy the rest of my is content as well.
