review/text: I have had neck and shoulder pain forever. Usually begging for a massage and dragging myself to the spa for one when I have the time. The rest of the time suffering with neck pain, which often results in a headache after a while. Saw this a few days again and thought what the heck. Just came in the mail and tried it out. Within minutes my neck and shoulders feel fantastic. I cannot believe I waited so long for this! This really is one of the best purchases...my family thanks you as well because I don't need them anymore :) Anybody suffering from neck, shoulder, back pain this is definitely worth a try. Worked for me instantaneously. Thank you!!
