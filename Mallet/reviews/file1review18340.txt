review/text: I've had this battery for about 3-4 months and am highly disappointed in it. The first month or so it worked just fine, but after that, it started losing charge rapidly. I have missed many photo ops because my battery has died after just a short period of use. You clearly get what you pay for; I didn't want to spend the extra to get the name brand Olympus battery, but I will be now after a lesson learned--and a lot of photos missed!
