review/text: These individual pill packets are probably fine for those on the go who take a day's worth along or who have few pills to take; however, those with more than a half dozen will have trouble getting them to fit if the medicine is in large capsules and/or tablets. For older adults or some having large hands, filling the Apex Med Pack can be problematic. With the lid open, they will not lay flat easily for loading and can be knocked over readily. The packs don't form a tight seal, so don't plan on taking them to the pool.
