review/text: I used the Panasonic Linear for almost 3 years. I came across some advertisement for the Braun. After a little research and reading these Amazon reviews, I was convinced to try out the Braun. The 8585 has not disappointed. While my Linear gave me very good shaves it took a lot of time and manipulating (stretching) my face to really get a close shave. The Braun shaves my face closer, in less time, and with much less stretching and contorting of my face! I still have to pull my skin to get some hard to get spots. I have to say that shaving with the Braun is the closest thing I have experienced to shaving with a blade.Also, the self-cleaning system works extremely well. I kind of like the lemony smell of the Braun after it has been cleaned.
