review/text: This supplement comes in a very large pill, but it's got an excellent shape and a good coating that makes it easier to swallow than smaller calcium-magnesium-zinc supplements. You have to take three pills daily to get your minimums from this source. One note, if you are deficient in Vitamin D3, the 200 iu of Vitamin D3 supplied by this product is not sufficient to meet your daily needs based on current research which recommends at least 2000 iu a day for individuals that get little noontime sunshine or are dark-skinned. Dark skin is a natural sunscreen that protects from tropical sun but severely limits the Vitamin D3 a person can make from the sun in the mid and northern latitudes of the US, Europe and Canada.
