review/text: Walkfit saved me from continuous pain.I have Plantar Fascitis (heel spur) and tried everything. The Orthopedic doctor gave me Cortisone shots, custom made orthopedic insoles for $250. Chiropractic treatments - none of those helped. As a last resort I got the Walkfit.After a few days of getting used to the inserts the pain lessened somewhat. Slowly it got better. Now - a few months latter I have no pain at all. I do start to get pain when I don't wear the inserts so I try to walk only with the Walkfit.Great product for Plantar Fascitis.
