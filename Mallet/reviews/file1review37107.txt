review/text: I did not like this product. The handle for this flosser short. I threw this away without even using the refills and went back to using my Reach flosser.Reach Access FlosserReach Access Flosser Refill Pack Disposable Snap-on Heads, Unflavored 28-count Packages (Pack of 2)Reach Access Flosser Cleanpaste Refill Disposable Snap-on Heads, 28-count Packages (Pack of 2)I also recently tried Glide disposable flossers and the floss broke too easily on those. I had to use up to 3 a day. I have found the Reach flosser to be the best so far as I have found.
