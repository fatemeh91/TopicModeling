review/text: If you take big pills (ie... Fish oil) this is not for you. I have taken prenatal pills, on several occasions (I have three children, lost three others) I have no idea how you could fit anything else in this if those are what you are taking! The two end compartments are bigger, but still not enough to hold my pills... 2 fish oil, two multi vit, 1 B complex and then the room is full and that is only the two end sections that are bigger. I still have 10 pills more to go! It will work for keeping some of my kids vitamins and perhaps a few pills to throw in my bag for work in case a shift goes long and I won't be home (that happens a lot with me) but for everyday... nah. At least I didn't blow a lot of $$$ on it.
