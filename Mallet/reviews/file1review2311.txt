review/text: This brand was recommended to me by my Holistic doc. I especially like this multi because it has at least 75 mg. of the B vitamins (which I need) plus other minerals, bio flavinoids, & green food stuff. The capsules are easy to digest and I don't get nauseated or experience vitamin back lash when I take it. In order words, it goes down easy.I've been using supplements for the past 34 years and Solgar is by far the best.
