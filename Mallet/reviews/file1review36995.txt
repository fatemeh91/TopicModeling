review/text: Seeing that this had a powder scent, I gave it to my girlfriend to try. I must admit, it did smell nice and clean. She said it held up as well as the deodorant she usually wears, but she didn't care for the extra scrubbing in the shower to get rid of the residue it left at the end of the day. The good thing is it LASTED the whole day.
