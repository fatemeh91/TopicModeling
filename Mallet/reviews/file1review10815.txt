review/text: I bought this to help with getting out of the car, not realizing how perfect it would really be. It's extremely sturdy and gives just enough assistance and leverage to keep from tumbling to the ground. It also has general safety features, such as the seat belt cutter and window breaker in case an accident. Great thing to have in the car!
