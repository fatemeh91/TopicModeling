review/text: I've been using this at work for a few months now. Many compliments. Some of my coworkers questioned if I could even hear anything with it because they thought it was too cute to really work well. They even said that they could hear better with this stethoscope than some of the others they've had. Unfortunately, the plastic heart has cracks(but is still in tact) because I've knocked it around here & there, but it still works fine.
