review/text: I damaged my knee repairing home flooring two years ago. My doctor told me that an operation might be necessary on my knee cap if things got worse. For every day use this support I have found comfortable and effective in stabilising the knee cap. I dont always wear it, but when I get a twinge and when bike riding I grab it. It washes easily and is not so uncomfortable and sticky as some of the more complex supports. Innitialy I did need and together with hydrotherapy used the cross over type support. Currently I am very greatful that this Cho Pat Dual Action Knee Strap is keeping me away from the surgeon. I live in the U.K. and several people have asked me 'where did you get your Cho Pat ?' A tip to home maintenance weekenders - When doing kneeling jobs use decent knee pads to avoid injury.
