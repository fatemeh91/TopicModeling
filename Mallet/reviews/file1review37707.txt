review/text: The product performed as expected. It kept me fresh and clean all day! No sticky residue, easy roll-on application. The scent was a wonderful feminine, yet clean, scent. It was also hypoallergenic, which was a big plus in my book! I would definitely recommend it to friends, family, and even neighbors! I'm sure I'll be purchasing more of this item since the price is great too!
