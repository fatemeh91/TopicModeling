review/text: I use the Hammer Gel primarily prior to practice when I am crunched for time and need to get some calories consumed. I paddle with Lanikai Canoe Club on Oahu and this stuff gives me the energy to endure a long 2 hour practice. I believe the Montana Huckleberry is a new flavor and it sort of tastes like a blueberry/grape mixture. Overall, I am satisfied. Will come in handy when paddling the Molokai Hoe 2010.
