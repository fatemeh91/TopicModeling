review/text: The People at BP Medical fail to mention that %MOST% of their products are either overstocks or factory rejects from Ever Dixie EMS Supply. Their bags fall apart, have bad seams, etc. Then, when mentioned the bags are falling apart, they promise a replacement and you never hear from them again.
