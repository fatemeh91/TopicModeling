review/text: I've been taking Source of Life liquid for only a month. I really think it helps me kick-start my day, and reduces my desire to drink too much coffee by giving me a mild energy boost. At first the taste was hard to take, but I'm use to it now. I find taking it just before I eat a light breakfast keeps that taste from coming back. The nutritional value is far better than any multi-vitamin I've found.
