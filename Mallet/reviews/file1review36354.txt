review/text: This product, when applied, created a somewhat burning/tingly sensation that was supposed to act as a numbing agent. It became more a distraction which also left the penis skin with a strange dry texture. Overall, it did not numb as it said it would. Would not buy it again. Threw it out after the first session.
