review/text: Came highly recommended by my yoga instructor, so I tried it. Worked a little on my heel spur pain (for which it doesn't seem to be designed), but for aching in my finger knuckles, did nothing. I really did want it to work. My yoga instructor said it worked miraculously on what sounded like a trigger finger. So maybe just not for everyone.
