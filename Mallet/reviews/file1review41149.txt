review/text: I've never felt better since starting to take these caps. I've been taking one cap in the morning and one in the evening for about 2 years now. Great product! Keeps everything "moving" and me happy. I never forget to take them on vacation now, they make a huge difference! I'm so glad Amazon has them on subscription! I've heard that these caps don't HAVE to be refrigerated, but they last longer if you do. I fill up my daily vitamin cases for a week at a time and leave them on the counter to remind me to take them. But I make sure to leave the rest of the caps in the refrigerator.Update: Sadly Amazon has stopped carrying these on their Subscribe and Save Program...hopefully they bring it back, it's so nice not to have to worry about ordering. However, Amazon still offers the best price I have seen for them.
