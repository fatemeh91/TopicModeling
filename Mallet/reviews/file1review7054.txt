review/text: I have had a Wahl shaver for about 10 years before it finally quit. The new one I just purchased gets the job done just as well, but it feels so cheap in hand. The trimmer functions okay, but the fit of battery holder is very poor and does not stay together. I use my old Wahl trimmer. Cheap materials are a disappointment, but performance is definetly as good as always. Another plus is that it's the only shaver made in the USA I believe.
