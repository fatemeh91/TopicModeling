review/text: Excellent value when purchased via Amazon using available discounts and free shipping. Hard to find in stores at any price. Not sure if the cleaning power is as good as Tide's, but I can't in good conscience use P&G products, so 'all' is my choice. One negative: the lines on the scoop are hard to read, so I probably use too little or too much powder per load.
