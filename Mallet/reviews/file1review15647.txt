review/text: I'm not sure why this product didn't work for me. I really like Jarrow and use many of their products. And I know how important NAG is in protecting the gut. When I takeDesigns for Health - GI Revive 225gm Powder [Health and Beauty] I feel a very noticeable difference. But when I take this product as a stand-alone with some of the other ingredients in GI Revive, I notice no difference. I had been taking these individual products to supplement GI Revive, because it's expensive and I use so much of it. Unfortunately, I've had to dump the cheaper supplements and stick with the more expensive, comprehensive product.
