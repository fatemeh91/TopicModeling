review/text: I bought this ages ago and while my son liked it at first, it is a disaster now that we're trying to get him TRULY potty-trained (ie completely independent, pees on his own, dumps pee into big potty, reassembles potty, flushes, washes hands). It has a weird design where you have to take off the outer layer to remove the bowl part, and then to put the outer layer back on is like assembling a puzzle. It's hard even for me to take apart and put back together.The high five hand is, as another reviewer said, in a bad spot. My son bumps into it accidentally which makes the whole thing seem absurd. He's sitting there, not peeing or pooping but hoping to, and Elmo's shrieking "Way to go! CONGRATULATIONS!" And now the batteries are starting to wear out, which leads to bizarre middle-of-the-night episodes where Elmo suddenly starts talking on his own. Creepy.I am trading it in for one of the simple models with a bowl you can easily lift out and empty, and no bells and whistles. What's the point of being able to turn into into a (very low) stool later, when by the time he's not using it as a potty any more you certainly will have needed to buy stools for every sink in the house anyway?
