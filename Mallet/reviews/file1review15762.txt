review/text: A handsome pen with three tip options, pretty easy to grip, does a valiant if ultimately hopeless job of making my nerdiness a bit more covert. I believe this pen is made for Cross by Yasutomo and Yasutomo has lots of experience with this type of multipoint mechanism. However, this particular version of the mechanism is largely plastic and suffers for it in durability. The first one of these pens I owned seized up after about a year and attempts to lubricate it (with WD40) actually seemed to worsen (partially dissolve the plastic?) seizure. These make nice gifts for people who tend to lose pens within a year.
