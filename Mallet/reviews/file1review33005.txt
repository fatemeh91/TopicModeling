review/text: Very happy with the product, very unhappy with the company. Despite paying a lot of money for shipping was left with an 11.90 bill for customs before i could receive the parcel. Emailed the company and did receive a prompt reply offering a credit note to use for other orders. When i rejected this offer and requested a refund no reply was received. I would not use this company again!!
