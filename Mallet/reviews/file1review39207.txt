review/text: My son is 2 1/2 and has had his hair cut at a kids barber about 5 times. Each time is terrible - he sits on my lap fussing and crying the entire time. At my wits end, I bought these clippers and they worked great. We sat outside and my husband read him books and gave him a mini M&M; when he started to get uncomfortable. (The power of chocolate...)The haircut is a bit of a hack job, but I'm sure I will get better with a little practice.My only comment is that I probably would have preferred the clippers with colored guards because everything is black. The case is black, the guards are black - it is hard to figure out which guard you have when you are trying to move quickly.
