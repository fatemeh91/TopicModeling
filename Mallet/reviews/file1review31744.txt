review/text: I've been buying and building and updating emergency preparedness kits for over fifteen years now and this is a great package. Doug Ritter's put together a real wealth of stuff in a small package and it's all top notch materials. Individually the parts cost more than this total kit.This is a great EP kit for all experience levels. The novice user will find the tools easy to use and the instructions appropriately detailed. The seasoned outdoor traveler will find this a kit they go to for the odds and ends that it contains.This isn't an all inclusive kit and could use a few additions if you have the room. A small lighter is easy to squeeze in the bag. The kit does not contain a knife (there is scalpel blade) and I think that a deck of cards belongs in everyone's EP kit.And important note is that this kit is not approved for carry-on luggage due to the scalpel blade included...
