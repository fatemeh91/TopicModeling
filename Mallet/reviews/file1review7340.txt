review/text: It just came today 4/7. I am using it now. Here the scoop on the foot bath. If you see a comment saying the heat does not stay on, it's true. It has an automatic 1/2 hour cut off. Simple turn the heat back on. Rollers are inserts, you have to move your own feet but there are pluses. It comes with a pumice stone. It has heat. It suggested room temp or warmer water but I put in cold to see how long it takes to heat the water. Under a minute was all it took to get the heat going. It has high and low water jets with adjustable air pressure for the jets. I wear a 7 1/2 shoe and if I place my feet on the roller the right way the jets blast water up my toe nails which feels uncomfortable to me but I am a woman and my nails not clipped to the nub. Solution: I put my heels on the rollers and prop my feet up with the arch on the jets, still feels good. Hint: to avoid misting water from the jets (on high with high air pressure) don't fill to fill line. Yes, it comes with a splash guard and remember I did say 'mist'. It tells you not to put anything underneath to avoid fires but I would suggest having your towel in a U around the machine to catch misting water. Still using it, water is getting much warmer now. It has a remote that turns on the power, heat and jets - the remote does not adjust the air pressure. It does say 'do not use bath salts or oils due to possible clog of the air holes'. It's too expensive to muck with so I'll save the salts for the real bath. The package was not damaged. I can't speak on the noise, everyones house has different acoustics but it's a machine, it going to make noise. All in all it's the only one I've seen with a heater that actually works. It was worth the money to me.
