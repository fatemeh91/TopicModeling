review/text: This cushion was great and was used everyday for about 8 hours a day for exactly 4 months(to the day) before a pinhole leak....so if you consider its hours of use, cheap material, and price it lasted quite a while. However, I won't repurchase as I need something made of a more durable material that I can depend on.
