review/text: EDIT (12/16/12): I am very pleased with this product. I bought two so I always have one clean and ready to go for my toddler's bed--both have held up to several washings in hot water. The top layer is soft enough that you could let your child sleep right on top of it without a fitted sheet if needed.I upgraded my rating to five stars--I would 100% recommend this mattress cover.****(03/2012): I only gave this item four stars since I haven't used it yet. But, the quality right from the packaging seems great and it laundered well following the directions. The real test will be when I use it with my toddler when we start potty training, but I don't expect any issues with the mat.The cover has elastic the entire way around and has a really nice material cover over the plastic lining. Looks like it will be perfect for what I need it to do--protect the mattress!
