review/text: I purchased two of these,this month, one for myself and one for my "domestic partner" (she thinks she's my "girlfriend"), separately, one for $65.99 and the next for about $75.00, through Amazon. I see the price is skyrocketing.This was a great decision, as it turned out - it caused me to put my Rota-Dent electric toothbrush "in mothballs" along with manual toothbrushes.My not-too-bright DP put toothpaste on the brushhead and turned it on BEFORE touching the brush to her teeth and wondered why there was toothpaste all over the bathroom. DUH ! That's why I don't consider her to be my girlfriend - too much sawdust instead of brains. But she is pretty and has a great asset.Summary: Very powerful machine you'll love to use - may become addictive.Shop carefully for best price, including S+H, on replacement brusheads, including Pro-White polishing brusheads. Makes a great gift BTW.Buy it !Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush
