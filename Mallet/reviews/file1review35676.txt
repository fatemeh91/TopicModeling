review/text: I bought two of these - one for my 3 year old son with sensory integration disorder, and one for my very active eight year old daughter. They both LOVE these, and play and wrestle together in them. When they first got them, they slept in them. Highly recommended for your active kids, especially ones that need some proprioceptive input therapy.
