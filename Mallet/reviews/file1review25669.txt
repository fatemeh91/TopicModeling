review/text: This groomer has been great. It hasn't nicked me or pulled at my hairs. It dosn't vibrate and create an uncomfortable feeling inside you nose. And it dosn't just trim you hair, it will compleatly clean out all the nostral hairs in you outer cavity. I can now breath clearer and my nose dosn't itch.
