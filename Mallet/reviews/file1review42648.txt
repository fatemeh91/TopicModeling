review/text: Many of you may already know this, if your in the market for a petite rollator they are few and far between. After searching several web sites and dealing with sites that the items were out of stock. I was gratefully surprized when Amazon had them in stock and at a great price. I called the dealer directly on this item as I had never used Amazon before. The dealer was much much higher. So I took the plung and ordered it for my grandma. She LOVES it.
