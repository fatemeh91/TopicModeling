review/text: I really like this sleep-mask. It's fun and funky and versatile. I love the velcro strap, especially since I have a rather small head. It's shape is good for blocking out light without putting pressure on the eyeballs and I can see myself wearing this on a plane - with make-up on and not having any issues.
