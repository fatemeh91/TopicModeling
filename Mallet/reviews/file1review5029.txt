review/text: These blades truly last a long time and they have conditioning strips and four blades. Reading magazines in the tub alerts me to all the personal care products I'd love to try. This particular razor was featured with a few other razors and sounded like the ultimate razor for women. Well, it honestly is superior to anything I've tried so far and it is the first four-blade razor to touch my legs.Yes, you really can skip a day here and there due to the supremely close shave. The smooth lime moisture strip helps the blades to slide gracefully over your most delicate skin and there are four tiny strips of wire over the blades that create a protective environment. The artistically designed fuchsia rubber grip on the metal handle (the weight is still light, but heavy enough to make it more stable) encourages precise control and it doesn't slip out of your hand. The shower hanger is a true bonus and attaches easily to the shower wall with a suction cup.When you order the razor there is one razor, one shower hanger and an extra blade. The shower hanger is great for keeping the razor out of the way.Results: Smoother legs than ever before! Lasts at least two days. No cuts or razor irritation. No scraping feeling across your skin.Comfort: Superior comfort while shaving. Slides over knees with ease and never irritates sensitive skin. This razor glides across your skin like silk on satin and truly delivers on its high performance guarantee.One of the additional comfort features is the aloe and vitamin E enriched strip at the top and base. This prevents that "scratchy" feeling while shaving.Definately the most luxurious razor for women I've tried. Also saves time because you don't have to change the cartridges as often.~The Rebecca Review
