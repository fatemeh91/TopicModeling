review/text: Good points1)single capsule per day2)Has all the necessary minerals and vitamins3)Stops nauseaBad points1)My wife started having constipation and with the color of the stool we figured out that the amount of iron intake was getting more for her.SO to check the theory she stopped taking the prenatal and voila..she is back to normal again but she gets nauseated with the other one.2)Have to take an extra supplement for DHAI don't know why but I also felt the calcium amount is very less compared to the daily intake for a pregnant woman and that's why my wife always had 1 glass of milk everyday.
