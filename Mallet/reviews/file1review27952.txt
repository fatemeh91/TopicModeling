review/text: I love this protein. compared to others it's the best tasteing, mixes well with milk and water (trust me use milk) and I've gotten better results than with any other brands It has 23grams of Whey per serving ( if I remeber correctly), and these are quality Whey Protein and amino acids. I've been lifting and taking protein for well over a year and have tried many brands but got hooked on this one pretty quick. It's got a decent price compared to most other high end proteins.I like the Choc, never tried the other flavors.
