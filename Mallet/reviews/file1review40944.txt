review/text: I've used the patch for 2 months now. I've had an 11 pound loss the first month, and a 12 pound loss the second month. That's better than I did on any oral diet aids. I did have a rash from the patch, but I do have an adhesive allergy. I'll continue to use the patch. For me, it's alot easier than trying to remember to take a pill 30 minutes before I eat.
