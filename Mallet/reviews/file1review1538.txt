review/text: This simple and safe product works so well, my 5 year old son has had a series of wart problems, spent money on doctors and was going to spend more on one big one that he had on his finger and under his lip, I used this product as directed, cleaned and soaked warts so they "open up" and after drying them I applied product directly on wart a couple to three times a day, in just four days the face one got black, dry and fell off after a bath, and the one on finger is about to fall off too, this finger one we tried everything on, it is literally dried out, this product sucks the life out of them, it is so inexpensive, efficient, easy to use and I fell it's safe, even though I just put it directly on wart, not near healthy skin. I would recommend this product to everyone!!!! thanks for the comments that made me buy it!!
