review/text: I work at a computer for several hours of my day. My back and neck were suffering greatly...until the Body Back Buddy. Truly saved me from a chiropractor or weekly massage - all for under $30!! If you are on the fence between this model and its predecessor, choose this one, simply for its ability to provide more options and really get into those tension spots. I use it daily for ten minutes and what a difference!! I haven't had difficulty turning my neck...no pain in the upper left hand side of my back and a difference in my posture as well - all because this product really was well thought out and can get to those "tough to reach areas." Save your back AND your wallet...you really can't go wrong with this one!! Check out the videos to assist in use too.
