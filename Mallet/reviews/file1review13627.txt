review/text: I have a oxyfresh water pic which is probably the best in the market. But I travel quite a bit and this is ideal for travel. Oral B always makes good products. I thought I was getting a floss refill pack but instead I got a pik refill set, no big deal. This is no replacement for a real water Pik but perfect for on the go or in the car between stoplights.
