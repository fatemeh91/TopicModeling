review/text: I bought the Merkur after reading lots of great reviews, and because I have a nostalgia for old fashioned things. I used it for about a month, and then for comparison I switched back to my Sensor Excel. No comparison. For closeness and ease of shaving the sensor was just much, much better. I was really disappointed because I was rooting for the Merkur. In reality I shouldn't have been surprised. How would newer models ever have sold successfully if they were not, in some way, improved? Maybe it's because I have a really tough beard; I can't say for sure. The one place where the Merkur came out ahead was that I noticed I never got any nicks or cuts while using it. But again, I didn't get a close shave either. So, the only thing I can say for sure is that it must be great for some guys (based on the reviews), but it isn't for every beard. For what it's worth, I hope this helps other guys who might be taking a look at the Merkur or other classic safety razors. Happy shaving.
