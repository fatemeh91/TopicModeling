review/text: I got my first OXO bottle brush at Target. I loved this brush and lasted me a long time. When I went to get a new one they did not have it anymore. I am really happy I found it at Amazon. One thing I really like about this brush is that all of the bristles touch the bottom of the bottle to thoroughly clean.
