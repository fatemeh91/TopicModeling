review/text: Okay, so the first time I tried Crest white strips was back in 2000 or so. I must admit, I wasn't impressed with the results at all. So I never tried using them again. However, I recently bought these Crest Whitestrips Premiums, and I am amazed with the difference already! I've been using them for about 4 of the 7 days, and the difference is already quite dramatic! I am thoroughly impressed with how much whiter my teeth are, and it's quite a bargain. I wasn't expecting good results from these, and was planning on paying around $150-200 to get it done at the Dentist's office. I would have expected results around these (and it's not even done yet).. I'm 26 and most of the stains were yellow from food/coffee/wine/and smoking... yellow stains.2 Negatives though: 1. There are 14 packets and you're supposed to use them twice a day. Each packet has an upper and a lower. I didn't like having both strips on at once, especially because the lower ones are kind of hard to keep on and are kind of uncomfortable... so with me anyway, it meant a total of 2 hours of wearing strips, and they're kind of awkward and taste a bit funky... but it really isn't too bad and the results are definitely worth itAlso, it didn't work nearly as well on my bottom teeth, but that may be an individual case for me, as my bottom teeth seem to have worse enamel loss than my top teeth (I grind my teeth in my sleep)Anyway, overall, I highly recommend them, I'd definitely recommend giving them a try for the $30 they cost (well that's what I got them for from Target) before spending $200 or so at the Dentist's office
