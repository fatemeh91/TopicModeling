review/text: I purchased the Oster Fast Speed Clipper through Amazon after much research & many reviews.My husband has very short hair & trims it perhaps every three weeks or so. The first time he used the clipper , the 1/4 inch guide snapped in two! Thinking that it was just one of those things & probably a fluke, I purchsed this set. Again, he used the 1/4 inch guide (twice this time) & it snapped in two! Unbelievable.In retrospect, we should have just got an "off-the shelf" trimmer at Wal-Mart. The clipper seems like a fine product, but the quides are just plain flimsy!
