review/text: This container is large enough for a few large size pills! Filling the individual containers may take slighly longer than when you have all the morning/lunch/afternoon/evening compartments in a row, like in some other products. However, when you get the hang of it, it goes smootly. I do enjoy taking just one day's worth of pills along - not need to carry more! The text lables could be a bit of a larger print, but I solved it by writing the times myself by using a permanent marker. Also the texts in the darker green and blue hard to see. One door is starting to come off slightly, but if that happens, I'll keep using the other six containers. Overall, even with those little defects - I am very happy with this product one and would order it again! An excellent choice!
