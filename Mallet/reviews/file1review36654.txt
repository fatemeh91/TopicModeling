review/text: It's a pleasant fragrance but it's not close to the original.Recently, my wife bought me a pair of Irish Spring Body Wash liquid containers. My love affair for Irish Spring was born again. It left me fresh for many hours with that rich fragrance. Those are virtually gone except for a small dispenser I tote with me when on a road trip. It was time to get more.This time, however, I opted for that pack of 3 bars of Original Irish Spring. Yes, I'm being frugal as much of that precious liquid escaped to the shower floor.However, the fragrance of the bar soap is not the Irish Spring Original. Not even close. Yes, it's the same striations of various green hues. And it's a pleasant fragrance which I really don't know how to describe.My suspicion? Colgate-Palmolive got their perfume batch from one of their other products mixed in with the Irish Spring.
