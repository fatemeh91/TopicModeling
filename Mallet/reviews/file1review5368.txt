review/text: I actually didn't need the razor for grooming, just as a prop in a show. So, I have no idea how good it is at shaving.For my show, though, it was excellent. It's solid, doesn't fall apart. From the shoulder to the blade is about 3 inches long. When it's closed, it stays closed and when it opens it shines in the light.Again, I didn't use it for shaving, but for my purposes it worked great. Fast shipping too.
