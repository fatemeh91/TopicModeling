review/text: I reviewed several gel masks before purchasing this one. Most of the other gel masks had only the plastic covering. You need a thin towel/washcloth, and for what good is a thin towel/washcloth???I also love the size of this gel mask. Most of the gel masks for the eye area were quite small, covering only the eye area. This is great not only for headaches, but it helps reduce swelling in the eye area.I'm very glad that I purchased this.
