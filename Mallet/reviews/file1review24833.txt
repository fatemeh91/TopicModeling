review/text: I never bought this from Amazon and I never write reviews but I just wanted to warn people...I wish I would have looked more into this product before taking it. I'm sure it works for other people but it was the opposite for me. While I was on it I had 3 cycles that were 36 days and I would still bleed but I never ovulated once. I know I never ovulated because I take my BBT and my OPKs were always negative. I then switched to prenatal vitamins and I am ovulating again! I am in my first cycle without FertilAid and my cycle is still not right but at least I ovulated. I didn't ovulate until CD 39 this cycle and my cycles are usually 33 days. Now I know to do more research on a product that is going into my body, even if it is just herbs and vitamins; It would have saved me some heartache and I wouldn't be out 3 cycles. Hopefully my cycles will be back to normal next month!UPDATE: My 2nd cycle off of FertilAid and I am back to normal and I'm pregnant!!!
