review/text: Good product, great price, decent taste. This was my second "tub" of protein I've purchased. The first was a big drug store's own brand in vanilla. The generic brand actually tasted better; but this one's not too bad (but I mix it with water only--might taste better with milk and some additives). Filling and feels good after a workout. I'm hooked on protein!!!
