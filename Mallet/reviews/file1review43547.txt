review/text: I purchased the Omron HEM-711 AC Automated blood pressure monitor on 2/22/2010. From the beginning it gave unreliable readings varying by over 60 points reading to reading. We took it to our primary care physician and was told it only gave a "close" reading 1 out of 4 times. I contacted the seller in May 2010 and was advised that the Amazon 30 day warranty had expired, and to contact the Omron. My wife felt we must be doing it wrong based on other reviews but I disagreed. Last week I went to my cardiologist and the monitor was reading too high by over 25 points. Today I contacted Omron and they took the serial number and asked me when I purchased it and if I had purchased it new. I told them I bought it new in Feb of 2010. They said the serial number told them it was manufactured in 2006. They walked me through resetting it and taking the pressure correctly. It read 186 over 85 compared to the doctor's reading last Friday of 122 over 82. No wonder the seller is offering it at a deep discount-it is 4 years old. Omron is allowing me to return it to them for repair or replacement but this seller appears to be unethical.
