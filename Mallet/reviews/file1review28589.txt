review/text: At first I was using the cheap 5 lb bags of EAS protein from Sam's club. When Sam's stopped carrying it and replaced it with MuscleTech brand, I switched as well. I found the MuscleTech to be absolutely awful and when looking for a replacement found that the Optimum Nutrition NATURAL Whey was on sale, so I picked up a tub of that in the Chocolate flavor. It was leaps and bounds better than both of the brands I had tried previously. It tasted much better, but the biggest difference was that it mixed much, MUCH better. I usually use 2 scoops in 12 oz of milk (sometimes 3 scoops in 16 oz milk) mixed in a blender bottle, and it mixes really well with maybe 10-15 seconds of shaking. No clumps at all. I ran out of the ON NATURAL and bought this tub of ON Whey in the Double Rich Chocolate flavor because it was cheaper than the NATURAL this time around. It is every bit as good as the NATURAL in all aspects. In fact, I can barely tell the difference between the two. I actually mixed the rest (a dozen scoops or so) of the NATURAL Chocolate in with the Double Rich Chocolate to avoid having two giant tubs of this stuff lying around.This stuff is considerably more expensive than most other proteins out there, but as a pretty big part of my diet - it's worth it to spend a little more to get something that tastes and mixes so much better.
