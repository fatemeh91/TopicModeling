review/text: I have had one of these for several years and bought this so that I would have an extra when my husband wants to use mine.You can use this from the freezer to apply cold or microwave for heat. the flexible shape works for the neck but I have used for my knee and shoulder also. I have recommended this to several family members and friends.
