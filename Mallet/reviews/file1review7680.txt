review/text: The scent for this product is overwhelming. Rather than reducing unpleasant smells I found it tried to drown them out with its fragrance. Definitely not a friendly choice for anyone with sensitivities to perfume or even chemical sensitivities. Odor eliminator is not a good description for this item. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
