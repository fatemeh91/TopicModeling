review/text: I bought this along with a 5 power Magna Lite unit. For my needs the 5 power one is superior with less distortion and a flatter field. If your specific needs are for the greater power then this unit may work for you, but you are definitely sacrificing optical quality for greater power. By the way, I bought both units from Maxi-Aids. They are terrific. I ordered them on 7/5 at 7:00 pm and received them on 7/8.
