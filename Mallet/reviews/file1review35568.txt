review/text: This cup is the only product on the market that I am aware of- that reduces the flow administered during drinking. I work with adults with developmental disabilities as well as adults with neuro and cognitive deficits, and this product is excellent in helping them reduce the amount of liquid that is swallowed per sip. I find 5 cc's is desirable with most dysphagic patients who require this level of support. It can occasionally leak, but I don't find that to be a major problem. Sturdy design and goes through an industrial dish washer without issue.
