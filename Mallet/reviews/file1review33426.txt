review/text: Pop in the microwave for a couple of minutes and you'll be toasty warm.Great for warming cold sheets or on sore muscles. This is the perfect size and the pocked has herbs that smell great. A great product and a great price. Last forever and everyone in the family will want one, especially on those cold winter nights. You can take the cover off and wash it. Also good for a house warming gift.
