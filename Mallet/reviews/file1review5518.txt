review/text: I have not used this in an emergency setting. I bought this because I was taking a CPR class. So far I haven't washed the thing, (since I've been using it on the same mannequin), but I don't think it would be that hard to clean whenever I do get around to washing it. Seems like a good enough size, although obviously it's probably too big to use on a baby's face. But overall it looks like good quality material and I'm glad it came with a case, including instructions on how to use it and a pair of gloves.
