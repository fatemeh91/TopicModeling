review/text: This is a good product, great amount of protein per serving, low sugars and among all that I have tried.. one of the better tasting. I often mix it only with water to keep the calorie intake down when using it as a snack.Even when mixed with soy milk (I am lactose :( intolerant) it is a nice thick and tasty beverage:)~ I use a hand belnder to mix it up with frozen fruit and add my glutamine and flax seed oil to it to make it a more complete shake for a snack or meal replacement.While I find that the BSN SYNTHA-6 casein protein is the best tasting, I will grab a scoop from the 5lb container of Champion Whey and mix it with a scoop from the 2lb Synta-6 Vanilla, Chocolate or Strawberry. Studies have shown that blending proteins such as whey, casein and soy are more effective and your body can use them alot more readily. I reccomend giving it a try over brands such as EAS.L-Glutamine 400 grBSN Syntha-6 Ultra-Premium Sustained Release Protein Powder, Chocolate Milkshake, 46.56 OuncesFlax Seed Oil 1000 Mg Certified Organic Cold Pressed Hexane Free Flaxseed Oil Is the Worlds Richest Source of Omega-3 Fatty Acids - 250 Softgels #1942
