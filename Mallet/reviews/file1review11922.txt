review/text: I have used various prenatals before that have cause havoc on my tummy. Rainbow Light are on the medium size (I've had bigger pills), but easy to swallow because they don't have a nasty taste if you need to hold it in your mouth for a few seconds or break in half. Other than that con, they are great for sensitive bellies. Make sure you always discuss with your doctor before taking them and/or whether you should continue them.
