review/text: It's sparkls suspended in gel. It has a pleasent smell, and the gel is not thick and heavy but light and easy to apply. The color of the gel showes the color of sparkle, and it applies a clear coat, a pigment can be added to give it color, if desired. The Stardust, when applied, lasts for a long time if clothing is not rubbing agaisnt the application. Thier customer service is promt in anwsering any questions via e-mail. Note, you get one 2 oz jar per order, not all four as shown in the picture; although, if you order more than one, you might get a free sample of another style gel.
