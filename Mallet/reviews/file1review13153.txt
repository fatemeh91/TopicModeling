review/text: So many of these products SAY you can wash and dry them but then they leak. These are awesome. I have put mine through hundreds of wash/dry cycles and they are still so waterproof that you have to be sure all the water spins out before you pop them into the dryer.I actually use them as easy-on/easy-off mattress protectors UNDER the sheet. I think if you lie pretty still they would likely stay put on TOP of the sheet, but I have a restless child so we keep them underneath. One fits up and down on a twin, and we have two, side by side on her queen. We also have two side by side on our king since she often falls asleep there, but they don't go all the way to the edges of the bed on the king so that is a bit uncomfortable if you're sleeping near the edge. It's still such an easy way to be able to pop off the fitted sheet and replace the wet pad if there's ever an accident. Also, my husband sweats with most waterproof mattress protectors, but not these. Don't know how they do it, but since it's working I keep using them.
