review/text: These go in the microwave, but only the sole gets really warm -- it's filled with gel stuff (herbs?). The sole also gets lumpy when heated up, so you cannot walk around in them -- they are for lounging only. Stays warm for about 30 minutes. I'm not wild about the smell, either. However, it is comforting when your feet are freezing, and you can heat them up and relax with a good book or watching T.V. so it's nice to have this option.
