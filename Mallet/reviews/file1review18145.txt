review/text: Let me start by saying this is my preferred travel eye mask. It's thin, lightweight, and doesn't look as awkward as some of the other masks I own. It's pretty good at keeping the light out without putting pressure on your eyes. However, it does tend to leak _some_ light in around the nose piece. This is exacerbated when you are lying on your side since you tend to deform the molded contours such that the gap gets bigger.If you want a travel mask or can live with a little light leak, I'd recommend this. Otherwise, get the Tempur-Pedic Sleep Mask. The only down side is that you have to clean it somewhat frequently (it picks up facial oils easily) and you'll look pretty dumb wearing it (if you care since you're already wearing an eye mask). Other than that, one of the best purchases I've made.
