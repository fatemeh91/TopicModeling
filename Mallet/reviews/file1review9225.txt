review/text: I love these mops for my hardwood floors. They don't scratch, pick up dust like magnets, and the mop heads are machine washable and dryable. They are very easy to change and I keep a spare mop head to put on while I'm washing the other. They last for a long time and O'Cedar has been in business for years, so they'll be selling these refills for a long time.I also use these for walls and ceiling crown moldings.
