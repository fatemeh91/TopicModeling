review/text: I expected SOME heat, but feeling no heat at all. Applied to Rt. ankle/calf as directed, an hour later still nothing, only felt like I had rubbed 'ointment' on. Tested another product (T.Balm Ultra) on Lft ankle/calf, felt right away. Complete waste of money, returning product. The other product doesn't heat up enough for me, so that is why I tried Cramer Red Hot, stating it was the hottest. Maybe a bad batch, but no heat at all, should be concerning to consumers. Recommend you try another product, if you are needed heat relief.
