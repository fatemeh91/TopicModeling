review/text: I like the idea of a quick, inexpensive near-instant thermometer. But after using this several times, both healthy and sick, it has never registered above 98 degrees. Repeated readings in a short time resulted in significant variations. Now, sick and feverish, I find I am at 97.8, while the old mercury thermometer has me at 101.Not the diagnostic tool I had would depend on.
