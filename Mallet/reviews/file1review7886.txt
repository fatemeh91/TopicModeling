review/text: i mainly used it on my legs so your hair has to be longer than the average stubble or else it wont work but all in all its pretty good. takes off most of the hair just make sure you do it evenly because i didnt and now im stuck with patches of hair that i keep having to go back and remove. my skin got some red bumps but it went away after a day. its been a week or two now and my hair still hasnt grown back which is very exciting and i think its worth it because i hate shaving. This product smells good but i wish it came with more applicators and more cloth strips because i need to get more now.
