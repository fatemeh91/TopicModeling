review/text: Let me just say a lot of doctors don't really know much about hemorrhoids except that their a pain you know where. I am an expert having them and getting rid of them. First the most important thing to do first is when having a bowl moment never sit on the toilet seat. Instead stand and stoop like your skiing and don't force. This is how we have evolved and takes the stress off your body as you go and it takes less time. After a couple of times you will get used to it.Good diet drink lots a fluid and check your stress. Stress was a big factor with me. if they get really serious find a hemorrhoid specialist. A good book to read is "Putting hemorrhoids and constipation behind you". Good luck and don't give up. I have read the reviews on this product and they sound pretty good. I am ordering some for a friend.
