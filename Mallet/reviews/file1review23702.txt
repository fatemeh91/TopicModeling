review/text: I bought these hoping they would provide me with sturdy HIGH arch support and they are the only insoles I have bought (and I have tried many) that do just that. I have sore arches and need high support. They provide this and a cushiony insole too. Plus the plastic is moldable to make a higher arch if I needed such. Excellent product, high quality.
