review/text: If you don't eat a lot of leafy greens, beans, fish, and a variety of whole grains and seeds, you probably aren't getting enough magnesium. This brand is very effective ingredients in addition to the cal-mag, such as vitamin D, Zinc,Copper, Manganese, and anti-inflammatory. It has helped me to ease muscle aches, sleeplessness, and itching from seasonal allergies. Great to take before bed.
