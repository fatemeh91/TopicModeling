review/text: I have always had very irregualr cycles steming from 13 yrs old to most recently 28 years old. I always had an underlying feeling that I would have a problem getting pregnant. I tried for months to get pregnant & nothing was happening. My doctor gave me a prescription for clomid, which I really didn't want to take so I began searching the web for an alternative. Lucky for me, I found FertilAid. I took it for 4 weeks & became pregnant. I am now 7 weeks along. I highly recommend this supplement.
