review/text: I have been using 40blink masks for about 8 years. I used them all through college and then at my apartment. I even got my parents a set(Mom is tiny and Dad is 6'4" and has a huge head). I have had a few die from using Benzo-peroxide products but that stuff eats through fabrics. After the first few nights the elastic loosens so it's not too tight and is also softens so it doens't hurt my ears. After awhile they do loose their shape but it took mine about 1 year of constant use for this to happen. I am very satisfied with this product and I'll continue to buy them in the future.
