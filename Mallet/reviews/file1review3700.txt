review/text: Wasn't sure if this product would keep my bandages dry while showering the 2 weeks after foot surgery,but it did. It has to be secured properly to prevent any leakage but it was perfect. I was able to shower with little concern. It held up very well, it will be available for use in the future (if needed). Also, it arrived very quickly after I placed my order.
