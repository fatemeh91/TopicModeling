review/text: The family convinced me it was time to trim my nose hairs, so I purchased this Panasonic personal grooming device. It is compact, runs on a single AA battery, comes apart for cleaning, uses stainless steel blades, and seems safe to use.Unfortunately, it does not cut nose hairs. It vibrates, tickles, and twirls them around, but too often fails to actually trim them off. In addition, the non-replaceable blade is designed to wear out after about two years of use.There must be better products on the market.Note: My experience is with the ER115KC version of this product, which is a washable variation of the ER112BC product.
