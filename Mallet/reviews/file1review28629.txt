review/text: The quality of this product, like ON Whey, is really good.. I just can't say that the flavor of this Chocolate Mint as good at all.. The chocolate is overpowering of the mint at most times but when you do taste the mint, it's kind of bitter. Smells better than it tastes, really. I'll probably be going back to cake batter or vanilla.
