review/text: Years ago I found an S shaped device, made out of brass, with a wooden ball affixed to each end. It was wonderful for reaching those knots of tension in the muscles of the back, neck and shoulders. I used it on many friends, as well as myself. I was never able to find another like it. I knew it was from Japan, and I had ordered it from a Kind oh Hippy health catalog, back in the '70s or 80s.This Body Back Buddy accomplishes the same thing, with a few innovations.It has several "handles" attached to the S shape, which, with a little practice, help provide leverage and helps the user to reach that "Sweet Spot" of pain and tension. It makes it more manouverable.On the down side, the Back Buddy is cumbersome and large. Which Is good, I guess, in case one of my guests tries to smuggle it away from me after seeing how well it works.
