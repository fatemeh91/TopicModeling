review/text: My son has mild motion sickness. He applies when we go to a theme parks, on airplane and boat rides. When we visited Germany, he also applied it behind his ear to tolerate the train motion. Great product that goes on topically. Moms like that- unlike Dramamin. I would recommend it to all who have motion sickness. It does have a herbal smell to it, but we find it pleasing.
