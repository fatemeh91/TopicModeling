review/text: Compared to the generic clippers I've been using for the past several years, the Baldfader did cut a little closer to the scalp, though it's definitely still a "crew cut" and not a what I'd call a "shave." A bigger concern is that the unit I received is *extremely* loud, to the point of making my ears ring. I wouldn't consider using this in my apartment at night - would upset the neighbors. Last but not least, the Baldfader irritated my scalp, which the previous clippers did not.Summary: I'll probably keep these around as an emergency backup, but I consider it money wasted.
