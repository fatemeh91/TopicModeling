review/text: I ordered it for a wart on my knee. Although I did see it begin to work by turning the wart black, this was a very thin layer. After the thin layer turned black and fell off I began the process again. Again, (2 weeks later) a thin layer turned black. I used this wart stick for almost 2 months before I grew sick of it's results and went to the doctor to have it frozen off.
