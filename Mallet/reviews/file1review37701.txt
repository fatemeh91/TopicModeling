review/text: This deodorant is awesome. It does not contain Aluminum Zirconium which is a notorious chemical used in deodorants for it's antiperspirant qualities. If you're like me and break out in a rash when you use deodorants with Aluminum Zinc, then this deodorant is for you. I had to use Tom's of Maine for a while because it is all natural but is pointless as a deodorant because it does nothing to guard against sweat or odor. Then I started using this product and I am very happy that it actually works as a deodorant and does not make me break out. I highly reccomend it.
