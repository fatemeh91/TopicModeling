review/text: When I was a child, my mom also gave us this during the cold/flu season and we hardly ever got sick.When I had the flu in March this year, the congestion in my chest was totally blocked. I went to a store pharmacy to inquire about Father Johns because other products I had just did not do the job, but I forgot that most pharmacy youth of today would not know anything about it. I came home, searched the web and was VERY VERY pleased to find this available thru Amazon.com. My thanks to AmericaRx for being there in my time of need. I ordered 2 bottles and gave one to my daughter to keep on hand in case she needs it.I began taking this immediately after I got it and the chest congestion began to loosen and cleared up in short order. I continued taking this until product was gone and I felt the better for it. I will be well positioned next cold/flu season by having this product on hand in advance.
