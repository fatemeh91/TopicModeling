review/text: Last year, I used Crest Whitestrips, and this year I decided to try a different whitening solution. I regret that decision.ABOUT MY TEETH:I drink a lot of tea and a bit of coffee, but my teeth were more dulled than yellow prior to using this product.GOOD STUFF ABOUT REMBRANDT WHITENING STRIPS:- They're fast and easy to apply... no goopy mess!- They stay on well... no slippage.- I didn't experience *any* gum/teeth sensitivity.BAD STUFF:- It's like having pieces of waxy styrofoam in your mouth. Uncomfortable! Definitely can't talk on the phone.- Results were strikingly mediocre. My teeth are possibly a tiny bit whiter, but not noticeably so.Compared with the Crest Whitestrips, I suppose the lesson is: No pain, no gain. With the Crest product, I was annoyed by the goopy, fussy application process, and I didn't feel that they stayed on very well sometimes. Additionally, I felt significant (though not show-stopping) gum discomfort after a day or two. With that said, though, the Whitestrips were unobtrusive (I could easily talk on the phone) and VERY effective... making my teeth very noticeably whiter in just a few days.SUMMARY:Rembrandt Whitening Strips are uncomfortable and ineffective. Go with Crest's Whitestrips instead.
