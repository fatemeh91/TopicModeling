review/text: Like others who've reviewed this I've tried other colon cleanses with varying effects. One in particular worked pretty well but my BMs weren't consistent. Sometimes I'd take a couple of pills and I wouldn't have a BM all day, then the next day I'd have a couple. So with Oxycleanse I found that I'd definitely go every day, even if I forgot to take the pills, which was nice. I've also lost a few pounds, although that wasn't the reason I was taking it (just a nice surprise!).The only side effect is my bladder feels weird after I take it, kind of like the pills have a numbing effect on my bladder. I know my bladder is full of water and I should go to the bathroom, but I don't ever have that urgent feeling anymore. Not a big deal, but hopefully it's not doing any permanent damage there!I did some research on Germanium 132 and there's lots of information on it and how great it is, I suggest reading up on it just to be informed about how it works and what else it's good for!
