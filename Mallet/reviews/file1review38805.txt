review/text: I have used this for years whenever I go 10 pounds over my ideal weight. For those who say it does not keep them full, here are a couple of ideas that have worked for me. When I worked in an office, I would take 1 can (now bottle) and 1 can of diet soda like Pepsi One or Coke Zero, to work each day and put them in the refrigerator. At lunch I would pour half of each into a Solo cup, and slowly sip with a straw, keeping the rest seperate and still in the refrigerator. Sometime after lunch, I would use the rest, usually finishing about 3:30 in the afternoon. I never felt hungry. Now that I work at home, this is what I like to do to cut down on the sugar, increase the fiber, and end up with twice the volume to drink (eat) for 222 calories: Put 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of water in a blender along with 1/2 scoop of the Slim Fast (2 Tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons). Add 2 Tablespoons of cocoa powder, 1 Tablespoon of malt powder and 1 Tablespoon of Splenda. Grind 1 Tablespoon chia seeds in a coffee grinder, and add to blender. Blend. Add 1 cup of ice. Blend again. This gives you a little over 16 ozs. of thick, thick chocolate malt ice cream for 222 calories. You have to eat this with a spoon. Be sure to drink some extra water, because the chia seeds will continue to expand and keep you very full. This cuts down the sugar in the Slim Fast by one half, and the chia adds a lot of fiber and also Omaga 3 fat(the good kind). I get the bulk chia seeds and large malt powder at Amazon also.
