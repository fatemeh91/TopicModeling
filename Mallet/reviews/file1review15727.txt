review/text: I've been a fan of Cross pens for a number of years (With my first being a Cross ION collapsible pen when I was a teen). So when I was in the market for a new pen I naturally viewed what Cross had to offer and was not disappointed. The Tech3+ is a lightweight pen for the multitasker on the go. The ease to go between pen to red pen to the stylus on the top of the pen make it easy for me to be able to go from my Nexus 7 to paperwork to spreadsheet audits with relative ease. The smooth black finish also makes the pen rather stylish in my opinion. Access to low cost, standardized Cross refills also makes the life of the pen far more cost effective in the long run. I will definitely be recommending this pen to coworkers and friends.
