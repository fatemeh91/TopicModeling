review/text: I bought the Wahl 4000 to replace an older Wahl model that I loved because it cost less than replacing the cutters and screen. The 4000 shaver seems to effortlessly suck the hair off your face without any sensation but, the trimmer is about as useful as a dull butter knife to remove hairs too long for the shaver. So, I'm still using the trimmer portion of my old Wahl.
