review/text: I totally agree with the other reviews. You don't need expensive multi-blade cartridges or fancy electric razors to get a great shave. You can get a better shave with a reasonably-priced safety razor like the Hefty Classic. Forget paying several dollars for a single shaving cartridge for a silly vibrating plastic razor. Excellent German-made razor blades are avialble for next to nothing. Forget shaving cream, too, if you choose. All you need is a few drops of shaving oil and some hot water. Best shave this 40-year-old has ever had, period.
