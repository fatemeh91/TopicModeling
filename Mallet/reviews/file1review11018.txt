review/text: This liquid chlorofresh mint flavore was horrible, smell was terrible, mint flavor just made it worse. it made me want to throw up and makes your teeth green for a long time.i took it for 3 days and it DID NOT HELP AT ALL. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE CHLOROPHYLL PILL. ALSO GET IT FROM A DIFFERNT COMAPANY.
