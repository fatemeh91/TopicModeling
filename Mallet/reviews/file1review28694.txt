review/text: I have only been using the stuff for about two weeks, i have seen some muscle build. Which is good for this fast, my advise is to eat many protein filled meals such as tuna or red meat along with a protein shake to see better results. It definitely helps the building process and maybe some amino acid supplements to make sure your body is usng all the protein you take in. A major plus is that the extreme milk chocolate tastes pretty good. I like it.
