review/text: This drink is great for putting on some extra weight. If you don't mind a semi apple juice flavor, not bad mind you, just not real apple then this is for you. The serving size is fairly small, like a juice box, but packs 300 calories vs about 120 for regular apple juice or 140 for white grape juice.
