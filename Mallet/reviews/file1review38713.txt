review/text: Positive: size and feel of this toy are good.However, I will never use it again. It is made of rubber and smells really bad. I cannot even store it in the same room where I sleep: the stench wakes me up, it is that bad.Another negative: I do not know the chemical composition of that rubber, but when I use it, it burns my insides... It feels like a chemical burn.Too cheap to return. Ended up in the trash.
