review/text: I like this product. The only con I can honestly admit to is that it takes a little time as opposed to shaving. You may have some hairs that are stubborn and repetition is necessary; however, It lasts longer than shaving and it has a smooth feeling to it. My husband loves it. Also, the hairs grow back thinner so therefore if you are pressing for time you basically wont look like "Wolverine". Try it! I love it.
