review/text: Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Cake Batter is a pretty good product. I prefer Optimum Nutrition's Hydro Whey. But I thought I'd give this version a try. I mix my proteins with water and this product dissolves very well, even in cold water. I haven't had any gassy after-effects or bad aftertastes either. As for the flavor, I don't quite think it tastes like a cake batter (maybe it does with milk???). I think it actually tastes like watered-down condensed milk...or kinda like those chewy Japanese Milky candies, if you've ever had one of those. I'd recommend it if asked.
