review/text: This product really works. After having difficulties conceiving and staying pregnant a friend gave me Fertilaid and after five week of taking it I got pregnant and stayed pregnant. My little girl is now two and a half.Once again we have been on the same uneventful path ttc baby number two, so once again we turned to Fertilaid. In a little under three months this time we finally have got a positive result, baby number two will arrive mid 2013. If we ever decide to try for a third child I will certainly be using Fertilaid again. Thanks for a great product.
