review/text: I received the product a day before it was scheduled to arrive which is always a good thing. My only complaint is that the protective seal on the container (under the top) wasn't all the way sealed. I didn't wig out about it because there was a safety seal around the outside of the container that was in tact. So I'm pleased with the product.
