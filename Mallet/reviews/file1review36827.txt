review/text: Not bad for the price.Sometimes you need to put some baby powder on it to help slip on the socks a little quicker.If I had to purchase another sock aid I would go with the plastic with the handles on it.This one bends,the plastic will not !For a few more dollars ... go with the plastic one rather then this one.
