review/text: I wanted a new all purpose lube and a few people recommended Jo H20. I'm glad they did. This doesn't dry out quickly, has a nice slick texture and has a very low stickiness factor compared with other lubes. It also does not have a noticeable odor or taste. I have used it directly on skin as well as on toys and it has performed very well. And a little goes a long way, which makes this a really good value.
