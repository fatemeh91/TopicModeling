review/text: And they are great! I used them on my husbands thick, coarse, curly hair. It was quick, easy and like a hot knife cutting threw butter. I will update and let you know how these hold up as this is 3rd kind I bought now in 3 yrs. So I hope they continue to work well considering the cost. Also even with little light the hair was cut even pretty much the first time even with long, thick, curly, coarse hair! Not to bad on my hands either as I have fibromyalgia and arthritis. It did get a little hot at the end when I was done and making sure I got every where even. It took 15 mins for it to heat up and even then it was not as bad as my plastic osters.
