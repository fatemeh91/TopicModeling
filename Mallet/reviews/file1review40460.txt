review/text: I have been using this lip balm for years and absolutely love it. I buy it in quantity so I can give some to friends, who generally become hooked! The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is: sometimes it's not completely smooth going on your lips - there are bumps of what may be shea butter or something else, but they can be rubbed in.
