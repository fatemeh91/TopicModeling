review/text: Bought this product based entirely on the rave reviews. I have 2 toddlers and I need to keep myself healthy when they are sick. Well, I take it daily and overall eat well. However, I have a cold right now and had one last week. So much for that.The pills also produce some serious "repeating" on me. I burp up the flavor for a while after taking a dose. That is not good, the flavor is pretty bad.I mean I made it through horse pill size prenatals vitamins!!!I will not be buying these again. I'll stick with tylenol for a cold.
