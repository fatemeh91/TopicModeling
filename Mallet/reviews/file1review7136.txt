review/text: I purchased the Wahl Custom Shave System 4000 after viewing a video on youtube (ill include the link) on how to bald your head using dry shaving, a technique used in barber shops that cut African American hair. It is a simple technique that involves using a hair trimmer to bald your head and then using the Wahl 4000 shaver to get an extremely close shave, but not too close that razor bumps develop. I just did my first shave and I like how close the shaver can get. It comes with 3 blades to be used depending on how prone one is to getting razor bumps. Having the option to pick the closeness of the shave is VERY good in my opinion, because you can pick what you need based on personal preference. I started off with the "sensitivity" blade to see how close it would get and I ended up going all the way up to the "extremely close" blade for the stubborn hairs on my head, but all in all I got the close shave I was looking for (the 3 blades are sensitivity, close, extremely close). The only downfall right now, is the button you press to change out the blades. I have to press it several times in order for the blade to come off, which is annoying, but other than that it delivers what I need. Im going to write a follow-up review to this to let other potential customers know the outcome of this product for my use.How to do a Dry Electric Shave[...]
