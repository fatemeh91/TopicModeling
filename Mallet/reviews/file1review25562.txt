review/text: I purchaed this trimmer to replace the old one that I dropped on it's tip. The original was excellent except that it was not drop resistant. The original never snagged and pulled and I was extremely fearful of the possibilty and was generally apprehensive with each use. When I dropped it and damaged the blade cone I new I would try to buy an exact replacement as this one had never "bitten" me. But when I tried to find a replacement there were of course multiple models to chose from. I picked the most expensive model(still around only twenty dollars) as it looked the most similar to the original and with the inside of my nose I won't skimp on price. If I could find one that cost $50 that I could be sure wouldn't cut me or yank out those hairs I would have bought that one. I had read some discouraging reviews about this model being a torture device but was stuck with trying it, as it was a Panasonic similar to my fine working original. I found that although this replacement is not as good as the original, a break-in period may prove to correct the problem of pulling. I believe that they have probably found a cheaper method of manufacture that leaves the blade and shearing edge of the cone less refined than the original, but hopefully will wear-in to provide a snag free instrument. The only other concern, as with the original, is that of dropping it on it's tip. If you do, it will be instant junk, and you will be in the market for a replacement and the possibly painful break-in period.
