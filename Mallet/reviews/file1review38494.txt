review/text: I've had this epilator for several years and I love it. It removes unwanted hairs efficiently and it takes a long time for the hair to grow back. Therefore, I would never go back to shaving. It is also a reliable product since I've had it for a long time and I never had problems with it. I highly recommend the Emjoi AP99 Optima epilator.
