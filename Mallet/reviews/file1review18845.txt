review/text: I purchased this product for hair growth. My hair is very healthy but only grows about 1/4-1/2 inch per month. I have only taken this product for 3 days so far and immediately had diarrhea about 3 hrs after taking a little less than half of the recommended dosage. I accidentally measured it out wrong to 1 1/2 tspn. The only change I had in my diet was the Mineral Rich which is why I can only deduce it was the drink that made that happen. I did drink the recommended 8 oz of water and I also took the drink after last eating 3 hrs before. The next day I took on a recently full stomach and only took 1 tbsp as I've read some experienced hair shedding on full dosage. No change in the bathroom. :-( I also haven't noticed any difference in energy however it has only been 3 days. I do plan on continuing to take for 2 full weeks only taking 1 tbsp along w/8 oz water on a full stomach. However, if i notice dehydration from running back & forth to the toilet :-(, I will stop taking it and pour the rest down the drain along with my $28.28. I will update this review in 1 month (if I remember) to inform about my hair and whatnot.*UPDATE* It has been 2 weeks since 1st starting this product. I still haven't had any change in energy. As far as my bathroom situation goes, it hasn't gotten better or worse, but simply changed. This product literally makes me go to the RR 15 mins or less after consuming it. I make sure to take on a full stomach and quickly drink the 8oz water after the product. It makes no difference. I am still only taking half recommended dosage. I will cut it down to 1/4 recommended dosage daily to see if any changes. Will update again in 2 weeks.*LAST UPDATE* I stopped taking the product 1 week after my last update. No increase in energy noticed. No hair growth noticed but most likely due to lack of time. No change in RR habits. Lowered stars to 1 as I only had cons with this product and have to pour it out.
