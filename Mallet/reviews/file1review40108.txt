review/text: This is a great Yoga starter kit, everything you need for a good practice. I found the mat to be as good a quality as some more expensive mats. The blocks are good, sturdy and comfortable to use. Since the mat I use for classes is always in my car, (which was always an excuse NOT to practice at home)I purchased this for an at home kit. For the price you cannot go wrong. A typical mat alone will run $10-$15. The storage case is adequate to tuck everything into for on the go or just to put away when not in use. I am very happy with purchase.
