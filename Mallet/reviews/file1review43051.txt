review/text: Since my goal for 2011 is to get into shape, the first course of action was to get an exercise regiment going. I lacked energy especially around four and five in the afternoon and turned to the FRS Healthy Energy Soft Chews Pineapple Mango - 30 Soft Chews products. If you've seen those, you know how expense the product is. When I read an article comparing FRS Healthy Energy products to a much more economical Vitamin Shoppe's Super Antioxidant and thought I'd give it a try.The Vitamin Shoppe's Super Antioxidant is much lower in cost and has more such as Grape Seed Extract. Physically, I feel no difference in energy between the two products.
