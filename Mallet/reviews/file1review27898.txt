review/text: While the product mixed very well and tasted fine with milk or water, it was VERY SWEET to my taste. I did not expect it to be sweetened since, silly me, I only checked the label for sugar content and didn't think to check for artificial sweeteners.I bought the vanilla flavor so it would go with smoothies. It also makes a kick-ass iced latte-- out of coffee or tea. Brew it hot with twice as much coffee/tea leaves, pour over ice, swirl it around to make it cold, and then take out the ice cubes before you add the whey product or else it will clump all over the ice.Overall this is a good product, but I would prefer an UNSWEETENED variety. Maybe that would taste like crap, but I would rather add honey, maple syrup, or Stevia to something if I want it sweet. I will try the "Natural" version of Optimum Nutrition's whey protein when I am out of this one.
