review/text: I bought these tights to give me some mild support during pregnancy. The material is sturdy and does not run despite constant pulling and tugging. This is because the stomach and crotch are too loose and require frequent readjustment. I would either order one side smaller or the thera firma brand which is just as sturdy and stays in place.
