review/text: I got this cream. Worked great nice lather. The cap cover was broken right out the box so I could not screw it back on. The cream itself was great as reviewed. I only got a few uses out of it as it started drying out. You would think the product would have better packaging for what the company makes itself out to be. Bottom line get the tub not the travel tube.
