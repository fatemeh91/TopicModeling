review/text: Allercare was recommended by my Chiropractor/homeopathic doctor for my grandson. This is a wonderful product. It dries up the allergy runny nose and helps subdue the allergy cough. Our grandson has had much allergy related improvements with Allercare. It even helped dry up his ears so he didn't have to have tubes put in! Highly recommend it!
