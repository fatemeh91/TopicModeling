review/text: Taste-wise, I would not say this is delicious; it has a shredded paper sort of aftertaste. Moderately chemically-tasting.No supplement, other than fresh food, can truly taste delicious, at least for me.But this would serve as a good substitute for a quick lunch shake as I only have 30 minutes to ingest, digest, then function normally.Eating a heavy lunch is not conducive to bright thoughts; I'm often dense right after lunch if I were to consume a carb-laden meal.So, if you're looking for a meal substitute at a reasonable cost with edible taste, then this is not a bad bargain.Also, if you already get Glucerna, Ensure, or other types of supplement from any program(s) that you participate in,then those would suffice, too. The benefits are comparable.I will report back for any weight loss, although this is not for weight-loss, per se.
