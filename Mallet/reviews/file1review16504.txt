review/text: My immune system has been going down really bad the last few years. I used to use Echinacea all the time, and I had forgotten that I didn't get as sick when I used it. Since realizing I needed something to give my immune system a good jump start I ordered the Futurebiotics brand. It really has a lot of herbs that are great for a healthier immune system. I've just started taking these, and I've been experiencing more energy. I also started to get a sore throat a few days ago, but it only lasted one day this time, instead of a whole week! In the past if I got a sore throat, then I'd get a cough, since I have seasonal asthma, which would usually turn into something worse. I swear to my testimony of this product, that it stopped the whole cycle dead in its tracks! I'm feeling better than I have for quite a while. I'm very happy that I found this blend, because I know that I'm going to get healthier again, and that my immune system is getting the support it has needed! I highly highly recommend this product to jump start your immune system back to a healthier immune system!
