review/text: I know this is not sold as a travel pack, but all it would have needed was a clear cover to fit ontop of the little yellow tray to hold the daily packs in place and it would have been perfect (now the seperate boxes fall out of the tray and loose in the suitase or handbag.Other than that, great product. Good quality, perfectly sized compartment for vitamins (big enough to take Omega pills and the like).
