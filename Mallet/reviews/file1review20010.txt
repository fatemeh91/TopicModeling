review/text: This product has a great price point and in some respect you get what you paid for! I love this tub for it foldability/storage aspects. True you cannot fill it too high, but you can easily set it inside your tub or shower stall to remedy that problem. My 10 pound+ baby girl is not at all challenging the integrity of the hinges or other aspects of the product. This is not meant to be balanced on edges of kitchen sinks etc as other commenters have noted. Love this product and would buy it again!
