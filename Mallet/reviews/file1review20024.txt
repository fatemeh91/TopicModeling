review/text: This is a great idea but with several problems. We bought the tub for our newborn and he loved it. However, now he is 10 weeks old, the tub is too small (our baby isn't very big).The folding mechanism is problematic on 2 counts:1. The baby can (and ours did) get fingers and/ or toes caught where the tub folds. This is scary for both the baby and parent and is potentially very dangerous. Thankfully our baby wasn't hurt, just frightened.2. Because of the way it folds, the tub can hold only a little water without it spilling out all over the floor. I don't mind this too much, but it does make bath time very messy and with a new baby, no-one needs anything extra to clean up.Because of the safety & size issues, we are searching for another tub and are disappointed that we wasted time and money on this one. Although it saves space, I would in future, buy an inflatable tub (which can also be used as a sled, apparently). PLEASE take extra care with your little one's fingers and toes if you buy this tub, but do think very carefully about other alternatives.
