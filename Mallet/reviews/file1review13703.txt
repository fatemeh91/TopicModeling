review/text: I really love this product. We have hard water (or maybe it's called soft) but anyway it's the kind of water that leaves a pink residue over time. And I used to have to scrub my toilets every 2-3 weeks to get ride of the water mark for the toilettes we use frequently and about 1-2 weeks for the toilette we don't use often. But with the Kaboom Neverscrub, the only time I have to scrub is when it's time for a refill - which is about 3 months for my bathrooms. Some are even longer, especially the ones we hardly use, it'll last a year! So literally, no scrubing needed. I just LOVE this product. Yes, it does have a bleach smell but I can handle it and it's totally worth it. The refill is expensive but at least it lasts a long time.
