review/text: I bought this to replace a Wahl hair trimmer because it only had 1/4" and 1/2" guards and I wanted more control over the length (1/8th inch or finer). I also wanted something that did not have to be plugged in while using so I could use it in the shower stall with a shaving mirror. This meets all the requirements and I have been very happy with it.- Ease of use -> Very GoodThe device has a guard that easily adjusts with a dial on the device to give you various lengths. Much more convenient than replacing guards for different lengths and much more fine grained control of length. I also take the guard off completely to make clean lines around the edges over the lip.- Build Quality -> Very GoodIt has good grips for using with wet hands and when I have dropped it (a couple times) it was fine. I have not attempted to submerge it or even use it while the shower is going, so I can't speak to how it deals with being wet.- Charging -> OKIt holds a charge for a long time. However, when it runs down you can't plug it in and then use it while it is charging. This would be more convenient and a feature I would like to see.- Overall -> Very happy and would recommend it.
