review/text: Pros:Has soft fuzz-type exterior.Cons:Strap did not fit around car seat well. Will not fit any bucket type or indented seats. It would work on a flat backed chair, but otherwise the strap is superfluous and gets in the way.The curvature is not adequate and being inflatable it does not hold its shape well. A firm type foam back support I had once that has a similar (but more pronounced) curvature and is much better.After a day or so of using it in my car it went flat.
