review/text: This is the second time I have purchased this tape and I was not disappointed. It is a 3M product so it's not some generic flimsy brand. It sticks and then some. I have to use it for bandaging my legs with big pads and it hold them on just fine. I have sensitive skin and so I can only use this paper tape. Much less expensive than any of the local grocery or drug stores.
