review/text: i am very disappointed with the service as i ordered it many days ago but i still did not get it i will never purchase any thing from anazon.com and i recomend to every one never to purchase any thing as after this order i placed one more order and they are telling me that they will ship on 17 of FEB which is 1 more month from hte order placed so i am really sorry to say that FROM NOW I WONT PURCHASE ANY ITEMS FROM AMAZON.COM AS THEY TAKE MONTHS TO DELIVER. IF YOU SEND MY PRODUCT WITHIN A WEEK THEN I WILL THINK ABOUT PURCHASING MORE THINGS FROM YOU GUYS.
