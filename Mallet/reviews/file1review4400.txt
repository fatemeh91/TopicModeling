review/text: If you (like me) suffer from that terrible combination of a tough beard and sensitive skin then you'll find the Gillette Fusion shaving system a real godsend. Yes, the replacement cartridges are very high-priced BUT you'll get an ultra-smooth and very clean shave every time--and your skin will thank you. The idea of a 5-blade razor may seem extreme to some but it really does work well and (with proper preparation) will give you the smoothest shave possible. For me, the best thing about the Gillette Fusion system is I can shave (both my head and face) with virtually NO irritation, redness or razor bumps AND get it done very quickly (at least in comparison to single or twin-blade razors). Case in point: I used to literally tear up my neck (especially around my Adam's apple area) years ago when shaving with single or 2-blade razors but with the Fusion I get a nick-free shave almost every time.
