review/text: I am a hair stylist and travel a lot to clients homes. I found that this is the perfect alternative to the big pot of hot wax on the go. The one thing i did find was that the facial strips while great for lip and chin were too thick for brows. But i was able to cut them to size and that did the trick just fine. All in all i have really liked this product. No allergic reactions, or break outs.
