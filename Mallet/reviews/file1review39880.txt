review/text: I recently purchased Surf after seeing it in a store for the first time in years. I thought it had been discontinued but was surprised to see it at a national chain retailer for only $12 for a 120 load box. I figured you can't beat the price so I bought it and I'm really sorry I wasted my money. The first thing that hit me when I opened the box was the sickeningly strong fragrance. The scent is called Spring Burst but it smells more like overly perfumed detergent. If you have any sensitivity to fragrance, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!! Not only was the smell unbearable but the detergent does not get out stains. Not even new stains. Apparently this product has a large fan base in the UK and Australia but don't ask me why. Sometimes the saying "You get what you pay for" is true, and Surf is no exception.
