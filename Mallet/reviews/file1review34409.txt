review/text: A few drops goes a long way giving a smooth silky skin texture. Too much applied at once feels oily and does not improve overall lubrication. Avoid using on fresh shaved areas will cause irritation. Best stuff for body massages and vaginal penetration feels extremely smooth without that wet loose feeling you get with water base lubes. Also can be used in combination with water lube if that wet feel is desired. Not all silicon lubes perform this good and rapidly dry. Be aware that silicon products can stain fabrics so handle carefully
