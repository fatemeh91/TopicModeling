review/text: I received it yesterday and tried it right away. Based on negative reviews, I was expecting a horrible smell and taste. I was pleasantly surprised. I may be in the minority but I really liked the smell and the taste. The smell reminded me of recently lawned grass. The taste was chalky but not bad. If you just gulp it up without stopping, you don't taste anything at all except in the end. For the benefits the product offers to the body, it's worth a moment of chalky after-taste. I tried Anthony Robbins' green drink before. I think this product is superior in quality, more quantity and less expensive. I think I just found a supplement for life!
