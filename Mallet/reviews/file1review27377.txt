review/text: I ordered this just to try out since I ran out of my ISO Pure protein shake and wanted some change. So if you're switching from Dutch Chocolate ISO Pure to this Double Chocolate ON Whey, you would find that ISO Pure had a much better taste when mixed with water.It took longer for ISO Pure to mix with water and it leaves some sort of residual white granules after you drink it all, which to date I don't know why they were there in the first place. However this product mixes easily and well with water a little too well to an extend that you'd feel you're just drinking flavored water. So initially it took me a while to get used to it but then I found a great way to get around its viscosity, I started mixing it with my Banana shake in the morning and to tell you the truth, my shakes never tasted better.I would recommend this product for two reasons. 1. It tastes amazing with milk and 2. that it is more affordable than ISO Pure by almost 30 bucks or more for the quantity. Both of them have similar specification so the results should be similar too.
