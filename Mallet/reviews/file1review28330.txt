review/text: Optimum Nutrition is one of the best product to use and affordable. I always stick to the Whey Gold Standard instead of Hydro Whey and Hydro Builder. I'm not saying to buy those even though it's expensive but if you know how to use the "Standard" then you will get great results.My routine use on this product is simple and make sure you remember because you forget after your workout. Here it is for me as a weight lifter:1. I take two scoops of protein powder and 16oz of SILM milk (makes it two cup by measurement)... yes slim milk if you want to tone up without the fat in the milk. Make sure you have a Blender bottle to mix perfectly.2. When finishing workout make sure you drink the protein within a 30-minute window.So again... buy this product today from Amazon today with a prime account because it's better than the other store prices like "GNC" and "Vitamin Shoppe".Stay Healthy
