review/text: These are my favorite tweezers. Perfect for eyebrows and ingrown hairs. You need to grip hairs JUST right to prevent breakage, but it's easy enough to learn. The tips are super sharp.When I accidentally dropped my pair on the tile floor in the bathroom, the points bent out of true straight and no longer worked. I mailed them to Tweezerman, who does the repairs and then bills you. They accidentally double billed me. When I asked for clarification, they apologized, waived the fee entirely, and sent my tweezers back all nice and sharp!
