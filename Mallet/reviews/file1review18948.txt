review/text: I had a ACL reconstruction about 4 months ago. I didn't need the post op brace after 2 months. Now, I am trying to get back to sport very slowly, but I am also very uncertain about how stable is my knee. Put this knee brace on at the night I received it, very tight, but very comfortable. I do feel great support of my knee. Of course, I am not trying to play at a competitive level, but definitely gives me confidence.I measured my knee around the knee cap, and it is 12.75", so I ordered a small (12-14in). It took me 4-5 pulls to pull it up and fit in place, but I had trouble taking it off. I think it has to be tight to give you the support. So, I rather to have it tight then lose. Once again, it is very comfortable once you have it on.
