review/text: This tea is exactly what I was looking for. Some of the other licorice teas for sale at Amazon also have other spices mixed in with the tea. This tea is pure licorice root and it is delicious. My only suggestion is that the manufacturer not include in the bag the very fine particles (dust) of the licorice root. That is why I am giving this tea only 4 stars. Some of the fine powder can seep out of the tea bag and collect at the bottom of your cup. Although this also might be true for other types of tea. However, the tea is delicious and I would definitely purchase it again.
