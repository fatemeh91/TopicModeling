review/text: I suffer really badly with acid reflux and was upset when they stopped making my brand. After trying many other chewable antacids, I came across this make on Amazon and decided to try them. I'm glad I did. The come packaged in 2 tablets per packet which makes it convenient for travel and they taste great. Definitely not chalky or over flavored.
