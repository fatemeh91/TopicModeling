review/text: My old 2 blade Panasonic Shaver was not giving me the close shave it used to so I started shopping for a new one. For the price, I thought this was a good deal and decided to go for it. It cuts through my beard like swiss cheese and afterword my face feels as smooth as a baby's bottom. The charge lasts a long time and the charge indicator is helpful in letting you know when its getting low. Clean up is easy using lotion soap. This method has kept the shaver from smelling funky like my old one. One complaint is the on button being hard to use when wet because of several factors such as it not being raised enough to get a good purchase on and the amount of force needed to move it. Also, a chunk of the foil came off while using it. But, I think this is because I had dropped it a couple of times and dented it. The foil is NOT covered under the warranty and costs about $25 so be careful.
