review/text: I'd actually give this a 3.5 star if I could. The pillow itself was a good size and good value. It's filled with buckwheat husks I believe so it is a pretty firm pillow. I actually like firm pillows, but I would've preferred that it were a tad softer. Nevertheless, it worked well. It was a nice size.I wish it had a small snap button loop on one end (as is found on another travel pillow I have) so that I could attach it to my carry-on bag. Sometimes, the carry-on is just too full to stuff a pillow in and carrying by hand always leaves the chance of you leaving it behind. I found the little scent packet a little gimmicky.
