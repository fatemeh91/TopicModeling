review/text: I purchased this item because I was experiencing a lot of pelvic pain. It helped remove a lot of pressure off the pelvis and hips and helped me walk better. The wobbliness that happens in pregnancy was not as bad when wearing this item. It stabilizes the hips. It helps best if you wear it daily. When you first begin wearing it it might take two or three days to start feeling the full effect of lessening soreness. It's a worthy investment.
