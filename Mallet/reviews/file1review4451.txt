review/text: I went back to my old Mach III for a while to save some money and things I have noticed -- shave is much better and closer, blades last longer, skin looks great after shaving. I also purchased directly from Amazon and didn't have any problems of having any knock offs. Also, the easy packaging is helpful as well. I hate getting the big boxes and have to cut them open with concern of cutting myself.
