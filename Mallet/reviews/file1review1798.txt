review/text: First off we need to clarify a few things. While tea tree oil and tea tree products are amazing antifungals, a significant portion of the population is allergic to them (nothing to do with the burning sensation, that is the fungus dying off). Depending on the severity of your case (especially T. Versicolor) you are going to have to follow a rigorous hygiene schedule. For best results YOU MUST use pure tea tree oil in conjuction with this product. Put the oil on your spots 1 hour before getting in the shower. This will kill and remove a large portion of the fungus, but it is still on your skin. Then you hop in the shower LUKEWARM TO NOT IRRITATE THE SPOTS! DO NOT USE A SQUEEGY OR WASHCLOTH AS THESE WILL SCRAPE THE SKIN AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE FUNGUS TO RECUR, ONLY USE YOUR FINGERS AND MASSAGE THE WASH IN. When you are done, dry yourself with a towel being as careful as you can to dry the infected areas last to prevent spreading. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU DAB THE INFECTED AREAS, NOT RUB AS THIS WILL CAUSE SPREADING. Use a clean, new towel after each shower. The fungus lives off of fats that you eat, so try your best to maintain a low fat diet. When you sleep make sure you change your bed sheets every two days. You must also put a hand towel over your pillow if you don't want to change the pillow case every night. YOU MUST WEAR CLEAN, LOOSE FITTING PAJAMAS TO BED EVERY NIGHT TO KEEP THE FUNGUS OFF YOUR SHEETS FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. On average it takes people with T. Versicolor 4 MONTHS to see an extreme result, BUT YOU MUST PERFORM THIS HYGIENE PROCESS FOR A MINIMUM OF 6 MONTHS TO A YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFECTION WILL NOT RECUR. IF YOU ARE NOT SURE THAT IT IS T. VERSICOLOR PURCHASE A BLACKLIGHT AND PUT IT NEXT TO THE SPOTS, THE EDGES WILL GLOW YELLOW-GREEN, trust me I have one. You can either step up and do this routine or live with the infection for the rest of your life.
