review/text: I love tiny gadgets, especially when they prove to be this useful! I also love my Tweezerman tweezers, so when I saw these, I had to buy them. I just got back from a two week vacation, and these travel well in my purse. They work great, as do my regular tweezers. They are not just cute. They are functional!
