review/text: The price on Amazon is way cheaper than at the local health food store. It is also apparently made from whole foods, and alot of the ingredients (if they are what they say they are) are higher quality than a typical woman's daily. It does not upset the stomach, and you don't need to take it with food. Regular vitamins have made me queasy, but I take these on an empty stomach.
