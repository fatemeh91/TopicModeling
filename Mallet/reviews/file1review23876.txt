review/text: This product is very effective. It definetly reduces underarm wetness by atleast 70%. The fragrance is also good and subtle. It does not interfere with the perfume fragrance.Now the folllowing problems:1. There is something seriously wrong with the product. When you rotate the bottom lever for the wax to come on top, it comes up only after several rotations (even when using for the first few times). And now, when you want the deodarant wax to go down, you rotate the lever, the other way round. But now, it does not go down. I use the plastic cap to press the wax down. Initially I thought the 1st package may be defective; now I am using the 3rd one and that too is the same. Surprising, that unilever did not do this basic testing?2. Now when you reach the last 30% (after 15-20 uses), the deodarant just suddenly breaks off into small pieces when applying. The pieces fall on the floor and its very difficult to clean, as they are like wax/oil.3. I did notice some residue on the front side my light colored shirts, at the end of the day.In a nutshell, its a great product, with a very cheap packing.
