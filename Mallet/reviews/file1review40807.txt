review/text: This is the absolute worst razor I have ever used. I am a 35 year old woman who has been shaving for over 20 years. It is usually a rare occasion that I cut myself while shaving. Since using the Intuition razor, I have mutilated both my ankles and both my knees. The shape and bulk of this razor does not allow for precision movements around curved areas. Even on the smooth sections of my legs, the razor catches and skips, and I am stubbly by the end of the day. And forget about using this razor on armpits or bikini line. Even if this razor worked well on my legs, I'd need a different razor for those delicate areas. I am extremely dissapointed in this product, as are most of my friends who have tried it. And, yes, I did wet both the razor and my skin, and shaved while in the shower, so that is not the problem. What a waste of money. I should have listened to my intition, and left this worthless product on the shelf.
