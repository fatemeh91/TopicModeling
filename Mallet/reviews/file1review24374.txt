review/text: I bought the gel (apple cinnamon flavored) along with the capsules and powder to try to help with my electrolyte imbalance issues at competitive trail ride events. I've done 2 in the last week and the first one was on a chilly day when I didn't drink enough and I ended up still having a headache and leg cramps at the end. This past weekend though I made sure I stayed on a schedule with everything and the difference is just amazing - no leg cramps, no excessively sore muscle and almost no headache. This was a great investment for me.
