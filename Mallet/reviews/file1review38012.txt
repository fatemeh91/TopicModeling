review/text: Honestly haven't had the time to open it up and look at it. But we live in a rural setting and even the fastest emergency paramedics wouldn't be able to get here for a good 20 minutes. So it's peace of mind for me in case anything happens because by 5 mins of not breathing your brain dies. Both my parents died of heart attacks and also we have friends over and once we open it and read all about it I will feel better knowing we can possibly same someone's life if a heart attack happens.
