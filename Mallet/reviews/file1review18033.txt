review/text: I'm an eye mask addict & I've turned all of my friends onto them - i'm obsessed! Each one is a little different & each has something that bugs me just a little from time to time. Sometimes I want a gentle pressure on my eyelids - in those times, this mask would not be my "go-to". Your eyes can open and close freely in this mask - so, if that's what you want, there you go :) The only actual complaint I have with this mask is that sometimes the strap is a little uncomfortable - but like some other reviewers said, this is probably a great strap for sleeping while sitting in a car, plane or train, b/c the strap is nice and sturdy. One other tiny complaint is probably unique to just me...sometimes the skin on my cheeks feels very slightly irritated by the material - my skin is sensitive, so i'm guessing this isn't a real problem...more an "MP" than a "YP" ;)
