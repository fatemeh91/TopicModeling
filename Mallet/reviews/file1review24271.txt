review/text: I had multiple sports surgery to my knee and had knee pain, with possibility of replacement. I tried walk fit and the knees gradually improved, pain reduced and now I have no pain. I do not know how or why they work, but it was the best $20 I have spent. I now own 3 pair and would not go out without wearing them. This is for real.
