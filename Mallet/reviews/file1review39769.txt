review/text: I have water-damaged dining room table that I've been trying to re-condition. After reading the reviews, I thought this polish might cover the water damage. Unfortunately, while it is an excellent polish, and smells really good, the water-damage areas are not soaking this in.I'll definitely continue to use it for other wood furniture.
