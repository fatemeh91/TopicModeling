review/text: This is great. I have subscribed to get 2 boxes of these bars every month. I usually eat one a day during the week at work to count for a meal. Only 3 grams of sugar and tasty for a high protein bar. I would be careful if you have never eaten one before as they might give you gas due to the sugar alcohols. If you have no shame then the gas might not bother you. Gas is a normal thing for weigh lifters:)
