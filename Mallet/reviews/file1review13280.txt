review/text: I have finally found the perfect pad at the perfect price! This stays in place, covers a good portion of the bed, and doesn't let anything leak through. Plus, it's a lot less bulky in the machine then full mattress pads. It's also very soft, and easy enough to rest on without a sheet, if you choose. I put my sheet over it, but hardly can tell it's there. I'm going to order more!
