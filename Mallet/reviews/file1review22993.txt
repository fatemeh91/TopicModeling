review/text: We found the best baby cream. I started with their shampoo & had to write a review. I have never been excited about baby products till now. The shampoo is a must have for any Mom who buy's the best for her baby. It's expensive and worth it! This cream is so delicious smelling in the real, soft beautiful way babies smell. I use it on my baby, toddler and me! It leaves our skin soft & dewy, never greasy. They don't use mineral oil or any bad ingredients- LOVE It! Lu
