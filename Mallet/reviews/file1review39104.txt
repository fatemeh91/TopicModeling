review/text: I needed clippers since my husband "forgets" to get haircuts and they never seemed to be that good anyway. I don't really know how to cut hair, but I do a pretty good job with there.There are a ton of clip on measurements for different size cuts. It comes with a few combs that really where useful.For the price, I think its a great product. I've been using it for three years without any problems.
