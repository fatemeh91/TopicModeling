review/text: I decided to try these straws because my 2-1/2 year old son loves to drink soda and water out of the bottle but tended to spill a lot. These straws are great for that purpose! They come in several colors and he likes to choose the color each time, which makes him think he is a Big Boy. They also work great in taller mugs. They are a good length even without stretching out the bendy part, but the kids really like the extra bendy length to make loops or corkscrews. Being able to buy so many in a case is really nice too since they are very hard to find in our area. We won't be scrambling around trying to find straws and having to wait for shipping every couple of weeks.
