review/text: I have used this tape before this order. It was difficult to find the wide, tan tape. This is a wonderful tape as it is porous, flesh color (not a glaring white), and adheres to the skin without being difficult to remove. The order was sent very quickly so I had it before I ran out of the one I had. I recommend this tape to anyone.
