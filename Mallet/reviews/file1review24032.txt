review/text: I love the service, I received my new stethoscope 1 day and a half later after I placed the order. It was impressive. Everything was in the box as the seller says. Also, I love the color. The next day I was using it and I listened everything in the way it suppose to be. I love littmann, this is my third stethoscope of this brand. I compare not just the quality of the materials but also how good the quality of the sound with other brands, and littmann always beat all of them. The other ones are a classic II and a cardiology one. They're still working perfectly fine but I didn't have a pediatric one. It seems that this one is cheaper cause the color but I love it.
