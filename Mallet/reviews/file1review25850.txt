review/text: I was looking for a shaver that had as many of the features as possible for under $50 for Father's day. My wife had already purchased a Norelco for me, when this shaver popped up in my Gold Box ... You have to get used to it, especially if you shave with a razor like I did, but I'm really liking it. It's wet/dry, easy to clean, 1 hr charge in the base, quiet. Oh, and I took the Norelco back. I would recommend this shaver.
