review/text: I started on the Dermologica products after using Clinique for 4 years and having it stop working. I went to get a facial and she suggested I start with them. I've been using the special cleansing gel and multi-active toner for 6 months now and really like them! My skin is very fair and is brighter, is toned, and bounces back from the occasional (hormonal) breakout nicely! This doesn't mean it's the best product out there, but it's worked for me!
