review/text: This is the second time I've purchased these here. They fit my Oster Fast Feed 21-53F ok; but my 1/4" Comb keeps breaking? The original 1/4" Comb(that came with my clippers,) and the first 1/4" comb(I purchased here) broke in the same amount of time. So I'm assuming this one will too; though at this price buying the whole set once or twice a year isn't too bad. I just wish they came in aluminum, or anything harder than this plastic.
