review/text: We have had this table for over a year; unfortunately it doesn't get enough use. It is made with really nice materials and has a decent corded remote control that operates the heated table top. The heater is strong and provides even and comfortable warmth. The item has a nice carrying case that has rollers. I paid less for it last year, but I think this is the best table I could have purchased at the time for the money. Also, I like the flannel sheet top for it I purchased on Amazon.
