review/text: I've had the shaver for about a month now and used it like 3 or 4 times. I am satisfied with it's operation and capabilities, but do see some shortfalls. Gripe no. 1, the trimmer for full beards leaves something to be desired as the teeth seem a little light and you have to make a number of passes over the beard to get a good trim. Since it does an alright job on with the initial first pass, you have to follow that up with a hunt for individual hairs the trimmer might have missed and touch up the whole beard.Gripe no. 2, the shaver also give me problems shaving under my chin right around where the jaw meets the neck, forcing me to do a once over with my razor to get it truly clean.One of my favorite things is the mini side of the trimmer as it makes certain detail work much easier.
