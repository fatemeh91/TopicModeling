review/text: I have always had gas problems and a weird onset of lactos intolerance and all kinds of stuff. I was just backed upped terribly! I took this and have been so happy and pleased with it, you just wouldn't believe. Yes it does get you going but not painfully. It's an instant stool softener as well.I wouldn't recommend any other product at all..and I got to lose some weight! Can't beat that!
