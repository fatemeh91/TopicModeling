review/text: We have an elongated toilet downstairs and a small/standard toilet upstairs and we have one of these seats for each bathroom. They fit perfectly on both. I read another reviewer who put over the door hooks on her water tank which is what I did to hang the seats up between uses and it works perfectly. My kids (2 & 5) can put the seat on independently which is nice. They are easy to clean and I have no complaints.
