review/text: and it's still going.I can't say I've taken care of it...maybe dropped some oil between the blades twice and brushed out the hair thrice, but it still does a great job.I use this to keep my goatee trimmed and to that end, it works great. It's quick, cuts even, and holds a charge for months.As for the blade to edge around or trim your sideburns, it's not that great. I never use it.Overall, I'm very happy with this and glad I was so wise all those years ago.
