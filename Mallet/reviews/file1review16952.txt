review/text: i ordered the medium size and was very i happy i did, as it is fairly large. i can't imagine how big the marketed large size would be. it's of very good quality, and i have boiled it several times without noticing any type of wear or tear.i wound say the medium size most resembles what would be used at your ob/gyn (as a general reference).
