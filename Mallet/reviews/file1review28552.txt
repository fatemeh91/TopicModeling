review/text: After sticking with EAS, Monster Milk or Gaspari Nutrition for the last few years I decided to give Optimum Nutrition a try. I was impressed with the quality, nutritional content and value I received with Gold Standard Whey. It's amino acid profile is excellent, comes in at only 120 calories and has 24 grams of protein per serving. It helped me more effectively build lean mass while losing fat.While arguably the worst of the chocolate protein supplements I have tried, it's quality and performance have made me a repeat customer. It can be pricey but is worth the money. Since finishing this product, I've ordered two more - one for home and one for work. Amazon's free shipping and low price saved me at least 25-30% on each purchase over my local vitamin store.Quality: 5/5Nutritional Content: 5/5Price value (from amazon or vendor): 3/5Taste: 1/5
