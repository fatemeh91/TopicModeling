review/text: I bought this brush because I've recently switched from using sponges to brushes for sanitary reasons. It's a good brush and well made, but I find the design somewhat awkard and wind up using my long handled brush much more. This one is really only appropriate for larger items that you can easily get your hand inside of - no small bowls or cups.
