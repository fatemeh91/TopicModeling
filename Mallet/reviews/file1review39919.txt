review/text: Not your average tissue. Kleenex has gone to some trouble lately to make their tissues a little better. These tissues seemed pretty strong. However, I was a little disappointed at the softness factor. I thought they could've been a little softer, especially for those who have colds. I would recommend this product to family and friends but only if they don't have a cold.
