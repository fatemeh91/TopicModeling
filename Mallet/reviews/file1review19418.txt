review/text: I live in NYC and discovered some unwanted mice in my apartment. I bought this product (and I also sprayed peppermint oil and had my super fix any holes in the apt)...and so far, I haven't seen another mouse. I am hoping it's a combination of all three things. One thing to note about this product - when you first plug it in (day 1 through day 7), the noise will drive you crazy..especially if you live in a small place. It not only drives mice out but it may drive you out. The good news is...either the noise has subsided or I no longer can hear appropriately. I think it's worth it to have no mice.
