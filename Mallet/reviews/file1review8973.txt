review/text: Green Vibrance is an excellent product. I have been taking it about a year and have not had a cold or flu throughout this season. I have introduced the product to family members and they say that their digestion problems have gotten better since taking the product. I've tried mixing it with different juices. Although I don't usually care for the taste of apple juice, apple juice is definitely the best for the green powder. I would say that grape juice is the second best juice to use with it.
