review/text: I'm a relatively healthy person, I workout about 5-6 times a week, eat healthy and drink at least a gallon and a half of water day (not because of the pills, I've always drank plenty of water). I don't drink coffee or soda, so I don't really get much caffeine in my system. I assumed since I take pretty good care of myself these pills wouldn't make me feel sick. Boy was I wrong. The first day I took them before my workout and had a mild stomach ache that only lasted about five minutes. On day two I took a couple 15 minutes before eating like the bottle suggested. Things were okay until after I'd finished my lunch. I felt so sick that I ran to the bathroom and immediately threw up my entire meal. I was in so much pain I couldn't even leave the bathroom. My husband had to come and bring me a tall glass of water while I sat in fetal position waiting for the stomach pain to go away. I was soaked in sweat, my whole body was shaking and I was in such intense pain that I swore I'd never take the pills again - and all this happened in just five minutes. I sat there until the pain went away and the shaking stopped, and for the rest of the day I couldn't even eat. If these pills actually do work it's probably because they make you so sick. I'll just stick to diet and exercise from now on.
