review/text: Working in pediatric acute-care, I finally took the plunge and purchased a pedi specific stethoscope. The days of hearing bowel sounds along with heart sounds are over! Works especially well for smaller children, but works for teens as well - you just have to be a little more exact about placement. Sound quality is superb, as per my expectations for Littmann. I have it in Navy, and it's a nice deep inky blue - darker than I expected, but pretty.
