review/text: While a bit pricier than many of the other models, I took heart in the strong consumer reviews from fellow buyers. And I have not been disappointed. The Aqua-Jet Foot Massage Spa unit is well built and solid, with a nice wide base and sturdy construction. The high and low jet settings and variable bubble action, coupled with the heat selection, allow for a variety of customization options to achieve the right level of action for individual users.My only complaint is that although well built, I've yet to find a unit that accomodates large feet! My wife has size 9 feet and I have size 11 feet. While the unit is large enough to massage our feet if we keep still, we can't really use the massage rollers on the base of the unit without smacking our toes or heels at the front and back. Ah well -- a minor quibble, since the rest of the experience is top notch and it's proven a great overall value.
