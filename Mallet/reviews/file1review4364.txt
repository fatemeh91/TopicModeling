review/text: I have been using this from shortly after it initially came out, moving from the Gillette Sensor. The difference between the two is pretty significant. These are more expensive that the Sensors are but they last you forever. I found I got maybe 4 or 5 shaves max out of the old Sensor where I can use these blades for a good month and a half before I feel the need to replace them. The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.The comfort of the blade is by far the best I've experienced. It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.The blade on the back I have found to be very useful which is something that, if I remember correctly, the Sensor doesn't even have.
