review/text: Biotene Mouthwash, TheraBreath Oral Ringe, twice/day brushing and once/day flossing together helped us (me and my family) to get rid of bad oral bacteria and bad breadth. Manufacturers claim (Biotene and TheraBreadth) was OK for us. The TheraBreath Oral Ringe was able to clean bacteria (including sulfur bacteria in tonsils), but you know, bacteria grows fast. After TheraBreath, only Biotene was able to promote good bacteria (and not bad bacteria). Based on proving I personally recommend both of them twice (this sequence brought success: morning brush/TheraBreath, noon Biotene, evening brush/TheraBreath and before bed flossing/Biotene).
