review/text: on the eye chart, the lowest lines 20/20 and 20/10, the font is readable but the ink is worn off. It appears that the ink is not very well adhered to the plastic sheet. Also I think it could easily wear off because the card is not glossy, it's plastic with ink on top. It's pretty cheap though and it might be more durable than it appears...
