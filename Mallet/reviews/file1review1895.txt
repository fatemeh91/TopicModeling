review/text: If you just wash your feet with this soap each time you shower you will not have any fungus form on your feet, and it will clear up any you already have as it did for me. Not only is it cheaper than the powders and creams that are made for the same exact thing, but it is so much more convenient to use this soap instead of dealing with smelly creams and messy powders.The magical ingredient in this stuff is the tea tree oil. I've been using it for years, athletes foot being just one of the many uses. I also use100% Australian Tea Tree Oil + FREE Tea Tree Oil Soap Barsfor my face and neck. I don't really get acne but just for the way it makes my skin look and feel and getting rid of any red blotches, well this stuff is truly amazing.Do not try putting the foot soap anywhere but your feet. It would probably work on other parts of your body as well because of the tea tree oil but it doesn't smell the greatest. That's why if just apply it while in the shower, its no big deal and you get all the benefits without any issue.
