review/text: One of the product features reads "Organic Quality Whey Protein Isolate". I was, and I guess still am, looking for organic whey isolate. I cannot find any indication on the container that would let me assume it's organic (and not in the chemical sense, but in the food production sense, ergo from organic milk, or in other words, cows that have been fed only natural foods, not treated with hormones or antibiotics etc etc). Hence, the description in the product features seems misleading.
