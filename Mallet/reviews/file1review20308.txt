review/text: Love these! Absorbent, soft, inexpensive, held up well after many MANY washes, no stains, ect. My only complaint is that they shrink quite a bit.My daughter has always hated wearing disposable diapers. When she was a newborn, she'd holler whenever we tried to put one on her. As she got older, she'd arch her back, scream, and try to get away as we were putting the diaper on her. So when she was a newborn, I used these flat folds wrapped oragami style (no plastic cover, although you could use one) to give her a break from her disposable diaper. We've actually made the switch to cloth diapering full time. Now I use these as a cloth insert for the gdiaper (fold in fourths, then half) and Thirsties (fold in thirds, then half). You could also easily use these to stuff pocket diapers.
