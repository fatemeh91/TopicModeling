review/text: I hope the health benefits are substantial because the taste is almost prohibitive. I have found with some reluctance that apple juice is the trick. I was mixing it with water and cranberry mixed juices and it was not too bad but I finally tried apple juice/ water and found that it is tolerable and even almost tasty. In general I feel good but I consume several supplement products. I would recommend this product if you feel you are not getting enough veggies and would rather slam them down in a few gulps.
