review/text: I laughed when I saw this thing in person but I wasnt suprised due to the price I paid for it. The current price is way to high for the level of quality your getting. I've yet to take this in the shower because I don't think it will survive. At least I can still use it externally for some stimulation.Pros:1. Silicone: phalate free toy for under $4 (at least when I placed my order)Cons:1. Cheaply made: you generally get what you pay for when it comes to toys. Mold lines, asymetrical shape (one side is bigger then the other) and a very very cheapy vibrator motor and battery compartment.2. Size: unless you really like a very thick diameter toy your not going to have much luck with this one plus the odd extra "wave" which apparently was designed for extra g-spot stimulation make penetration pretty difficult. I can imagine this being very uncomfortable for the average user.
