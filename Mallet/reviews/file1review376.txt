review/text: This is my first sex toy, and I didn't make a mistake with this one. It's gi-normous, and I LOVE the jelly-like material, it's firm but the surface is soft and flexible. I don't use the rotating thing much, though, but it's nice to have as an option. It took me a while to figure out where I like the bunny ears and his little pointy nose, but now I use it every night my boyfriend's away. Lots of things you can do with this one: just using it on the surface, or thrusting it like mad. I recommend it 100%.
