review/text: My caterer only provided generic disposables, and i wanted to get something more elegant but not have to worry about renting and having to collect, clean, pack, and drop off the dishes after the event. So i chose to use these and they were so beautiful! They are WELL worth it since we could just toss everything away with out looking tacky, chincy or cheap. They are time-saving/labor reducing, and elegant.
