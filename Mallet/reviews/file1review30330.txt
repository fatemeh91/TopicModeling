review/text: Literally, this thing sucks: dirt, pet hair, whatever! I was quite amazed at its sucking power. The rotating brush attachment is a wonderful thing. Instead of the usual type of bristles, it has rubber 'fingers' that make picking up hair a breeze. The filter is easy to access. I clean it every time I use it, but that just shows me how much crap it is picking up.A must buy!
