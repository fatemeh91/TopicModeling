review/text: I am responsible for my own weekly weigh-ins and needed a scale that was accurate. I found it in this Tanita. It also has nice features like body fat measurement and storing 2 differant people's info. My husband and I can both use it! It also has a guest function if I want to just weigh the kids. It was pricier than other scales but well worth the money for an accurate scale with a 3 year warrenty. You can't go wrong!!
