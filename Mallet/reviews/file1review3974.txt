review/text: In the literature it always states that it is extremely rare for people to experience side effects. However, I do NOT think this is the case if you are very sensitive to medications. If you are, you will want to take a much lower dose of this potent herb. The recommended dose threw me into a detox that was utterly miserable and lasted for weeks. It took me a while to put two and two together as I just thought I was sick. The same day I stopped taking this product, my symptoms went away.
