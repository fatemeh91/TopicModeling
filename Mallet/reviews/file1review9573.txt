review/text: I got the Chocolate Chocolate Chunk flavor and it is by far the best protein bar I have tried. It taste amazing and has 32 grams of protein. I recommend this to anyone that is working out and needs protein bars. I usually take one to school with me and have it between classes. It fills me up like i just had a whole meal
