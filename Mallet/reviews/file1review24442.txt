review/text: I've bought Ray-O-Vac batteries for the past couple of years, because of their low cost and the fact that their AA batteries worked as well as the more expensive brands. About 18 months ago, I bought 16 Ray-O-Vac "Maximum Plus Alkaline" "D"-cell batteries, a 12-pack and a 4-pack, and put them in my emergency kit. Each set was labeled as good until Dec. 2016. My emergency kit was kept dry and in a closet at room temperature. Tonight I got out the kit to use some of the batteries and found that all my Ray-O-Vac batteries were corroded. I can't return them to Ray-O-Vac for replacement because I didn't keep the original sales slip.It's a good battery at a good price, but don't plan on storing them for any length of time.
