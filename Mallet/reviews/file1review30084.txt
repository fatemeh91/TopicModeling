review/text: Well, let's put it like this - I don't believe that there are miracle pills that will make you lose 10 lbs in 3 days. This product works for me, because it really helps me to go to the bathroom. Especially after I ate something a little bit more greasy, like pizza or so - I had to go almost immediately after I finished eating. I tried the maximum strength ones at first, but they gave me stomach cramps - so, I stopped using them. But these are really great - they don't have a bad after taste once you swallowed them, and even though they are not the smallest items there are, they are small enough to swallow without problems. I will keep using them - because they really do work. Now of course everything works best with the right diet and exercise... it is not a miracle pill - but it does what it says.
