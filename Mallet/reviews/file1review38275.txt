review/text: I wanted to start taking a multi now that I'm not necessarily a teen anymore. I researched the heck out of what goes into a good multi and Source Naturals seems to be one of the few vitamin manufacturers that actually cares about the ingredients they are putting in our bodies. It has the right forms and quantities of things so that our bodies will absorb the most. For example most of their multis don't have iron so that they can be used for both men and women but this one being a women's multi has a very small amount of Iron in the correct form so it won't build up in our bodies. It also has things that have been proven in Europe (my sources not theirs) for spider veins, eye sight, tissue health, the list could go on for a while. I didn't want to be plunking down a sum each month for something that wasn't really helping me so I did the research to educate myself first. Unfortunately most of the multis out there are crap, I couldn't believe how many had things that build up in your system or had one thing but not the other thing that was needed to absorb the first. I found some much more pricier products but obviously why pay more. So this was the one I found that was the most balanced multi for the most value.
