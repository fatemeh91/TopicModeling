review/text: If you love caramel and need something sweet these bars work out perfectly. I use them in place of a candy bar. They are only 150 calories but they taste like more. I use them to diet with even though they are for people with diabetes. They fill you up and don't give you the sugar high. I eat one and I'm not hungry again for a few hours. My husband likes them too! I have tried many low glycemic bars and these have been the best tasting. They satisfy the sweet cravings.
