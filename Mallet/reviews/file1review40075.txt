review/text: I thought this was a good product. I liked the gel version of Crest. It was easy to squeeze the toothpaste out and it never got messy around the cap. I don't think that the packaging is very eco-friendly though. It seems that we should be moving in the direction of smaller packaging. This toothpaste dispenser seemed to be wasteful.
