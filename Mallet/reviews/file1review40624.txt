review/text: Without a doubt the most ineffective dishwasher detergnt I've ever used. I have a very good Bosch dishwasher and had no problems getting my dishes clean until I used this product. Every knife and cooking utensil has to be rewashed, regardless of how dirty it was to start with. Even butter knives are left with a scummy film. I don't see how this can be good for the environment if everything needs to be washed twice. Unfortunately, I bought it at Costco so I have to use up several bottles before I can go back to my old brand. Don't waste your money.
