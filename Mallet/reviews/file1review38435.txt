review/text: I've used a few other &quot;epilators&quot; and I liked this one least for several reasons. I found the tweezing plates revolving in 2 directions, as opposed to one, rather uncomfortable. Also, the plastic pieces at ends (bordering the tweezers) were sharp and often scratched my skin. The biggest reason that I don't care for this product is it's size and shape. It's small and thick and difficult to hold comfortably, often grazing my fingers during use. While this wasn't painful it was certainly annoying. Of the products commonly found on the market, I prefer the emjoi &quot;Gold Caress.&quot; It's easier to hold and use, and it's less expensive. (The Gold Caress, however, doesn't include a shaving head.)With this model you also have the choice of AC or rechargeable. Hope this helps.
