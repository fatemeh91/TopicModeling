review/text: You can purchase these locally at Albertson or Homeland if you wanted to try them out first.As far as I can tell, these are the only roll-on chapsticks out there. The formula used is light and feels like a liquid. I prefer this formula because traditional chapsticks tend to melt, magically collect lint in my pocket, or become messy with balm buildup on the cap. This chapstick might not be for people with dry lips or want superior protection, but it is great for maintenance or moisturizing.PROS:+light, clean feeling+doesn't melt in your pockets or car+roll on applicator, biggest plus for meCONS:-protection not as good as other lip balms
