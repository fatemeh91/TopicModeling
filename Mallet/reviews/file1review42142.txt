review/text: ....I had terrible upper leg cramps too frequently, thought originally it was because I was not drinking enough water, increased water intake and still had them. A visit to the MD to discover other causes and discovered a magnesium and potassium insufficiency can also lead to cramping. Began using CalMag approximately 5 months ago and I have not had a cramp since!
