review/text: I absolutely swear by Optimum Nutrition protein. No other brand compares in terms of quality and taste. I have tried pretty much every flavor and they all taste great but strawberry is still my favorite. It mixes better and tastes better than any other brand I have tried. This is by far the best whey I have found.
