review/text: I bought this ottoman for my mom for her birthday and I am returning it because the massager is a joke. It vibrates the whole floor (she has wooden floors) and even if you put it on a rug, I could feel the vibration from the couch next to her! The ottoman itself is decent, but has no storage space because of the "massager". The massager doesn't do anything really, other than tickle your feet and make a loud noise. Don't bother with this ottoman, it's awful.
