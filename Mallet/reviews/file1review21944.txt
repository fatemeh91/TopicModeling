review/text: I was nervous about ordering energy bars via Amazon because of the reviews I'd read concerning stale bars. However, each of my three orders over the past several weeks resulted in the receipt of perfect, fresh bars. I really like Clif Bars for nutrition and appetite curbing, and the chocolate chip peanut crunch flavor is delicious. I tend to eat these bars as a quick breakfast or as a snack before going to the gym - especially if I've had a light lunch.
