review/text: Documentation was poor as we needed to change the display from Fahrenheit to Celcius. We finally decided to search the Internet to find the answer. The thermometer was great after that but then when we needed it less than a year later it failed us as the battery had died. We had only used it that first time so we basically only got that one use out of it. When trying to open the battery compartment we were shocked to find that it was impossible to open. We have also read other reviews stating that once opened it was impossible to actually find a replacement battery. Makes a great first impression but doesn't weather the storm when you need it later!
