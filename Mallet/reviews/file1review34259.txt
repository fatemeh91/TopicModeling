review/text: I agree with other reviewers - this stuff works and is better than any prescription type ointments or cremes (vitamin E in an open capsule or liquid form) is another good solution but may not be efficient enough for some).So the only other thing I am going to add to the review is read up on Fargelin as well (http://www.amazon.com/High-Strength-Fargelin-36-Tablets/dp/B000VZW4L2/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t). You can find my review on that product with additional information regarding hemorrhoids on that site
