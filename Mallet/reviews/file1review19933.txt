review/text: My 3 yr old loves this potty lid; it is lightweight enough for her to put on and take off the toilet by herself (very important at this age!)Although the seat is lightweight, it is NOT cheap plastic: It is very solid and sturdy. The best thing about this seat is that it fits my obolong toilet seat. The seat has a mechanism that you can turn (like a screw) to lock the seat in place, but it doesn't slide with my daughter even when I don't lock it in place.She is 28 pounds and petite, and doesn't feel like she is going to "fall in" like with some of the other seats out there! We used a step stool from another potty chair, but you can buy one to go with this seat.
