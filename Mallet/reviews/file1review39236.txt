review/text: I bought these for my fiance for Christmas and returned them the next day. He has been shaving his head for almost two years now and these are by far the worst clippers either one of us have seen! Not only did the clippers NOT cut close enough on the second or third pass, they also left large patches of uncut hair no matter how many times you went over it. We were previously using a set of Andis Pet Clippers bought at PetSmart for the same price and will be going back there for a new pair! If you have thick, coarse hair these clippers are definitely NOT for you.
