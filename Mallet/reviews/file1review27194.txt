review/text: I was looking for something to give me that extra edge in my workouts and games, and ON's Gold Standard Whey worked beautifully. It is especially important for me to supplement my exercise this way because I don't consume a lot of protein in my diet - I frequently get very fatigued only halfway into my workouts. I've tried some protein powders in the past (namely GNC's Wheybolic Extreme in vanilla) and while I got some boost to my workouts, I just could not handle the taste. I don't have to tolerate ON's Extreme Milk Chocolate - it is a pleasure to drink and easy to mix (I use a shaker bottle). Yum!
