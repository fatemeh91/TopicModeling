review/text: After trying multiple seats, padded; with handles; with characters, we landed on the BabyBjorn seat. First of all, it caters to my daughter's want to be independent. By securing into the toilet seat, I don't worry about her climbing up with her stepstool, and sitting down on the potty. She gets on and off without issue. It is also light enough for her to articulate on and off of the toilet after she cleans it (she's 2 for reference). We bought two for the house, and another for daycare. I highly recommend this seat.
