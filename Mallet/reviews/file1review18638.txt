review/text: This vacuum is even better than expected. All metal constructions with locking tubes so they don't fall apart while vacuuming. The flexible part of the tubing is really high quality that won't be wearing out or cracking. This is the third small canister vacuum I have had over the past 20 years. This is the most rugged one. Built to withstand lots of use. ightweight for over the shoulder carrying.
