review/text: The engineer who designed this massager should go back to the drawing board! Some years ago, Conair made an excellent massager called the "Body Trainer." Mine finally wore out, but it was powerful and could be set at just the right angle to reach sore back muscles and get the job done. This model WM30N has inadequate power, even on high speed. If you reach over your shoulder and press down/massage a sore muscle, the head falls off! Repeatedly. There's no "lock" to hold it on; it simply slips over two inner prongs, and as soon as pressure is applied, off it goes. I'm not going to the bother of sending it back, but it leaves much to be desired.
