review/text: I've used the original headblade for years (once a month)and I've been very happy with it. The stupid wheels on the tail end of this "improved" model reduce your directional control and, because of the vibration they produce, reduce the sensitivity you get from having the tips of your finger guiding the blade. You end up having to run the blade over several times to get it completely clean.With the original model, I rarely cut myself. I cut myself twice with this version. I tossed it in the trash halfway through the shave.They should fire the product engineers that decided it would be a good idea to make this thing. "I know, people will buy it if it reminds them of a sports car." Is that really true? I hope not.
