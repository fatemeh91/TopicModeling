review/text: I've used Ambi products before and my dermatologist carries sample products, but I have a hard time finding them in local stores. Thank goodness for Amazon.com. The cream works well for fading hyperpigmented areas (brown spots) on people of color related to mild acne, etc. Of course you have to use it daily for it to work and you have to wear sunscreen. It would be nice if Amazon sold the version that has sunscreen in it- but since I'm pretty good about applying my own sunscreen it's ok. The cream does have a slight odor -but I've noticed this with all hydroquinone creams. The odor disappears as you rub it into the skin and is not lingering. 2% is the over the counter version and certainly much more affordable than the $160.00 -4%prescription strength cream (that's not covered by insurance). So if you have mild dark spots you want to fade and are willing to use the product consistently for several months, it's definitely worth using. The 2 oz (57 grams) is a nice size and last several months depending on the area you are applying it to. But don't forget to wear the sunscreen or it won't work.
