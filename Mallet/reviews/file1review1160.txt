review/text: I love these picks. I have trouble flossing, teeth are too close together and little places you just can't get to or the floss breaks. If this describes you at all, these picks are for you. NEVER, have food stuck in your teeth again. My dentist says my teeth have never been cleaner since I started using these a year ago. The hygienist says I have very little plaque at all on my teeth now. I am totally addicted. I pass these out to my friends and they all love them too.
