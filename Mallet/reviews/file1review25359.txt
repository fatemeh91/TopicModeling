review/text: Every time I stepped on mine, it gave me a different result. This was both for the fat measuring and the weight.The weight only measures in .5 pound increments, and the fat metrics require you to enter your height and sex and whether you are an adult or child. I do not expect perfect accuracy for fat measurement since it is very hard to measure, but obviously if this info is being used the fat measuring is completely worthless. For anyone who had a different than normal build, basing fat content off simple height and weight is ludicrous - may as well go back to the ideal weight charts of the 40s.It also takes a fair amount of time to enter this info, and it is not possible to my knowledge to just weigh yourself without entering it. If I seem to be ranting, it is recalling the time I spent each morning for a year uselessly entering all this info in.The fat % indicator would jump around between 18% and 45% for me, and even stepping off and reweighing myself 5 minutes later would result in weight discrepancies of up to 5 pounds at times. Occasionally it would even say I had under 10% body fat, which I believe even less than the possibility I have 45% body fat.When I finally measured myself with a balance it turned out the scale was 10 pounds off on average. Simply pathetic.I eventually got a taylor scale without the fat monitoring, and weighing myself several times in a row always gives me the exact same results, and it seems to honestly be within .2 pounds of the weight I get by using a calibrated balance at the doctor's office.Overall this has to be one of my worst purchases of all time.
