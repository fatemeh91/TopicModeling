review/text: I bought this deodorant expecting lax coverage but a great smell. The deodorant melts directly into the 'pit'. I had to run my hand over it to reassure myself I even had any on. The smell is a bit mediciny when you smell the stick- a bit like melding vicks with a rose honey scent. I thought maybe if I exercised I would knock some of the scent into existene.Nope, nada, none, and to make it worse my pits were dripping.Good only if you are seriously allergic to other deodorants-but I'm sure their are better ones out there even if you are.
