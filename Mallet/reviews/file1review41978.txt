review/text: I have purchased this kava product because it's the cheapest on Amazon. I wasnt expecting much and I received nothing much. I took 4 on an empty stomach with no relaxing effects whatsoever than 9 more on an empty stomach whith NO effects. I'm not surprised, but even though I didn't expect much I did expect a little from 13 capsules! If you want good quality kava never buy dietary capsules like these but buy the fresh kava extracts. I always knew this, but i wanted to try them myself, and I sure regret trying. Again, you get what you pay for. I do approve of this compony, because their other products are great. Just never buy dietary pills of kava kava as I said above, because they are usually bad quality and stale usually due to inproper storage atmospheres and age,this goes for all health supplement companys not just this one.
