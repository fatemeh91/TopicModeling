review/text: I bought this shaver based on the many positive reviews on amazon. My Trusty old Norelco was just not cutting it anymore. Yes, pun intended. While it was a good shaver, I still had a problem with shaving rash every morning.The Braun turned out to be better than I expected. I get a good shave, though I still have to work it under the chin to get all the hairs that don't grow straight out. I think everyone has that problem, and even a blade can be cumbersome there. All in all it's a great shave from a foil shaver, and at least in my case NO rash anymore. I love it! I also really like the self clean feature. I do not have a heavy beard, so I clean it every other day. It's nice to have a perfectly clean, fresh smelling shaver each time. The cleaning tank seems to last a reasonable amount of time and I have no complaints. The noise it makes while cleaning does not bother me at all. Do some people keep these next to the bed??? The cost of refills is not bad at all considering you don't have to spend time poking and brushing out your shaver every morning. A small price for convenience. I am glad I bought this.
