review/text: I've been using this product religously for the past 2 months and working out at the same time. While i've seen some weight loss and my eating habits have lessen its not always that way daily. Some days i'm good and go from meal to meal not snacking in between while others i feel like i'm starving myself. I guess it all depends on what type of activity your doing. If you want something simple,quick, and not too expensive this may be your item.
