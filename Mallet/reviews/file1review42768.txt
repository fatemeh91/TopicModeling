review/text: On a few occasions over the last 12 years I have used this product because back at the beginning of that time span an 'alternative health" MD recommended it for some IBS symptoms.In every case I limited my use of the product to one or two tablets total in one day, then waited for the effects to manifest. In most cases, for about a day I felt mildly ill - like a mild case of flu affecting my gut and my overall energy level, with some weakness and achiness in muscles & joints. However, after a day or so the digestive symptoms that caused me to take the product in the first place did seem to improve.Now, however [late December 2010] I took the product - just one caplet - and shortly thereafter had serious cognitive impairment unlike anything I have ever had. Dizziness is quite pronounced, along with mild tinitis [ears ringing/noises] and a bit of thinking fog or 'brain fog'. This all sent me to searching for side effects. On the web you will find some serious doctors questioning the safety of this product and any product containing high concentrations of HSO's. None of such have been thoroughly tested in humans and the longterm effects of HSO's in humans may be unpredictable because the organisms persist in the body and morph, adapting genetic material into their cell structure.Also, another reviewer mentioned "FDA" action against the company and its principle. I don't see FDA involvement but there is an action by the FTC to stop deceptive advertising practices for the product. You can find a pdf of this complaint on the web.
