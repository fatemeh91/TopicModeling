review/text: Versatile product. Be forewarned that this listing is not for two CR1220 3V lithium batteries, one face up, the other face down, as the photo implies. If it were, the face down battery might be jostled into the face up position during the shipping process, and vice-versa, the face up battery might be jostled into the face down position. Hijinks then ensue. Seller alleviates this potential hiccup by photographing two batteries on opposite sides within one frame, thereby inadvertently intimating something about the duality of man.These batteries may also be used for games of tiddly winks when charge has been depleted. Keep in mind that you will, however, need to purchase more than one battery for an effective game of tiddly winks.
