review/text: I have been using Old English oil for about 35 years now, starting with giant Pioneer HPM-100 speakers in the mid 70's during the legendary global audio wars.The walnut wood veneered boxes soaked this stuff up like a sponge and emitted their satin luxuriousness throughout the room.In those days I used the red version which they no longer make, so along the way I switched to the lemon version and never regretted it.Just this morning I oiled up 2 hand turned wooden bowls of lovely spalted maple which are displayed on my Etsy store named Wood Magic or at the BrownCountyShops dot com site or even at my blog woodmagiccreations dot comSo if you have something made out of real wood and believe it is beautiful invest in a bottle of Old English, a brand new baby diaper, and have at it, then sit back and enjoy the radiance.
