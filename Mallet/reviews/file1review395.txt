review/text: This vibe is easy to handle, waterproof and hits all the right spots. I have owned 4 vibrators previous to this one and it is by far the best. It has good girth and decent insertion length and is also pretty powerful and quiet. I finally found my g spot with this vibe, and I use it often!!
