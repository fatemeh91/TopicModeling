review/text: I cannot tell you how many water pik I have had over the years. It is an integral part of my teeth and gum maintenance. I am 64 years old and I just got a cleaning. I don't think I been to the dentist for two years. I saw the x-rays and all the teeth roots are healthy, no cavities.I don't know what I would do without the waterpik, even after flossing, and brushing my teeth, the water pik finds something. So does it make noise, I don't care, it could send up ballons, as long as it does its job.I love my waterpik
