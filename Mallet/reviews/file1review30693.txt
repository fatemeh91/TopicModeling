review/text: I used this razor for the first time this morning. Once with the grain and then once more after relathering. I only knicked myself once under my chin when I was going against the grain. I'm not a master shaver or anything so I don't know why so many people report having so much difficulty with this razor. Take your time, use a little common sense, and you shouldn't have a problem.
