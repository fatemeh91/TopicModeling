review/text: I never thought I would wear anything like this. This is my first pregnancy and I found myself needing some support. This cradle belt does help with supporting my back. I would rather wear this then have the pain of my back. The only problem that I have with it is that it's hard to wear my clothes with it without wearing a high neck tank top or a button down shirt. The crisscross in the front shows with everything. What I wear is built around this belt. It limits my wardrobe tremendously but the support is great and I'm grateful. If you plan to purchase this item just know you may need to adjust your wardrobe and purchase high neck tank tops or wear the ones you have backwards.
