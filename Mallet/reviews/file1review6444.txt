review/text: This item was supposed to include a manual which was not shipped and the company made no mention of missing manual. Contacted them asking for the manual. Turns out they ran out of manuals and offered $6 back for missing manual. I didn't like the fact that they just ommitted the manual hoping that I wouldn't notice it. To me that's poor service.On a positive note, it is the best back massaging tool (non-electric) I have ever used and is far better than theracane imho. I own both and this one gives a lot more leverage and have more versatility than theracane. Only advantage of theracane is that is is easier to pack away in a tote to take on a trip. I would give this product even 6 stars if it weren't for their lousy service. I ordered 3 more sets of this w/ accumassage. Had to pay $20 for shipping and they estimated 3-5 days shipping. 6 business days have passed (10 days total) and nothing yet. The tool delivers, but the company doesn't.
