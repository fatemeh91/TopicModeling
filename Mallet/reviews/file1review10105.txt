review/text: I started using this product when I got a low level UTI. Seems to work exactly as I hoped it would. Just one issue - the large, uncoated tablets can be difficult to swallow. This is not normally an issue for me. If swallowing larger tablets is an issue for you, this may not be the right product for you and the capsules might be a better choice.
