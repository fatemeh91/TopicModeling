review/text: Really like this prenatal vitamin. Appreciate that it's a "once a day" PNV, compared to many others that are several pills a day. It is all natural, which I wanted, and does have a 'grassy' smell...but that doesn't bother me at all. It is a significantly large pill, so if you have trouble swallowing pills, this is not the one for you. No issues with stomach upset, but I do take it with a meal. Highly recommend this for women!
