review/text: The good news, this kit has almost everything you'd need to repair whatever sunglasses you need. The bad news, if you are even remotely clumsy like me, or don't have a totally steady hand? This case spills and mixes the contents up very easily. It's not the end of the world, and certainly more my fault than the actual product, but there's gotta be a better way to organize the pieces so they can be easily found if the box isn't always face up.
