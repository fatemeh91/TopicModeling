review/text: I first started shaving with one of these things many years ago. For nostalgic reasons, if for no other, I ordered this razor. After receiving and loading it with a blade, I became painfully aware of why these things are no longer commonly available on the market, and why I was so glad to see the banded razors come into play. The Merkur blades are indeed sharp. However, it still felt as though my beard was being pulled out one hair at a time. Guys, there is a reason the single and double edged "safety" razors fell out of favor and style. The term safety razor is an oxymoron. The primary reasons relate more to comfort than to blood loss, although both are valid concerns. One thing about ownership of this thing; your wife won't be borrowing it. If she does, it will only be once. Still, it does give a reasonably close shave, or as close as you dare. With my banded razor, I could bear down on an area of my face that came out less than smooth after the first try. If I try that with this straight edged thing, I'll be going to the emergency room. A few years ago, I got into straight edged razors. Those things are also fine and will give you a reasonably close shave, providing you have the time to devote to shaving; God help you if you oversleep and look in the mirror with thoughts of doing this "quickly." The moral of all of this is, get the double edged razor if the rising cost of banded razors is your primary concern. However, don't throw away your banded razor and ensure you take your time with the double edged razor. If you get in a hurry, or are otherwise heavy-handed, you will need plenty of towels, styptic sticks, and band-aids.
