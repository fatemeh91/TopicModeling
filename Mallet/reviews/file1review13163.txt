review/text: I don't often write reviews but this protector is the best one I've ordered and offers great coverage. We have a 2 year old that travels all over his twin bed during the night. The size of this protector is excellent and quite often saves Mom from having to change the mattress pad cover. Buy 2 or 3. Many of the other options are simply not big enough if you have a child that moves a lot during the night. This one is also the highest quality of the few options I tried through Amazon.
