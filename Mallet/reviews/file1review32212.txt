review/text: It's adorable! Soft and smooth, just as advertised! The vibrations are strong, though maybe not strong enough for me... It only takes one AA battery, which is nice, and it seems to last a long time. Haven't owned it for long, but it seems very well made. It feels great, the textured cap is really nice, easy cleaning - overall a great adorable little product! It could be stronger, but it will probably work well for most people. It's a lot of fun for not a lot of money; I highly recommend it!
