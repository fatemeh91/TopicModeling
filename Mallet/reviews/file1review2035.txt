review/text: My foot doc recommended I use this first instead of going in for surgery for a bunion. He told me to wear it for at least 3 months at night. So far, it's been about 3 months, and I do see a minimal difference with the severity of the bunion. I can wear a pair of narrow shoes now that I previously could not. It's not an overnight cure, but I would recommend this for anyone with a Stage 1 bunion issue. It looks cheap, but it's surprisingly durable! It may feel a bit uncomfortable for the first few nights, but you get used to it.
