review/text: I have low tolerance for pain, that's why I put off getting an epilator for long time. After I tried an epilator once, I thought it was not for me - too painful. A few years later, as I got tired of time-consuming and short-lasting shaving, messy waxing once in a while, I decided to give an epilator another shot...Yes, it does not feel like you are getting a massage, but it IS bearable even for me with low tolerance for pain. You get used to it and after a while it does not hurt as much, just a little, plus - as opposite from shaving - your get less hair that grows back - at least that's how it works for me.Now I do not worry about waking up with prickly stubble after shaving it clean just 8 hours ago - not a very romantic feeling.A few smaller hair do stay - to get a complete sleek surface you are better with a razor (which I use sometimes), but I'm happy with the results I get from this epilator - it saves me a lot of time and does the job.I hope this feedback will be helpful for some of you ladies, and you need to try it to decide if it is good for you. I'm so glad i gave it a try.
