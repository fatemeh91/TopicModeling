review/text: I've seen a marked difference of pain from when I first started using it over a month ago. I don't have bad bunions, just the beginning of one and my shoes on my right foot always cause it to hurt, even my running shoes. But after continually using it, I've noticed a decrease and in some cases disappearance of pain in the joint. Love this product, would highly recommend it
