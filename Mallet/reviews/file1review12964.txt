review/text: I had high hopes for this product because I ice my neck almost every day on my commute to work. I liked the idea of the velcro in front to keep the ice pack in place. But it's too big around for a woman's neck. I feel like I'm choking by the time I get it cinched up enough. And it doesn't get very cold, even after being in the freezer over night. I haven't tried it as a hot pack yet.
