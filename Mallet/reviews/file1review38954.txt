review/text: I've been buying these razors since I started shaving. They hardly carry them in stores now--they want you to upgrade to a more expensive razor and blades. I was so lucky to find these razor refills online. I always get a close shave, and because there aren't too many blades (like in most of the newer models), I feel like I can really get around the hills and valleys of my skin. Other razors seem too bulky to do that.
