review/text: I have tendonitis in my hand that's probably caused by writing too much and pressing too hard on the paper. I have to routinely grade many papers, so writing a lot is necessary. During those times, the tendonitis in my hand gets pretty bad, it's painful to even hold a fork, and on the worst days I can feel it all the time even when I'm not holding something.I've tried many things--more ergonomic set-ups, different kids of pens, other braces, hand stretches, but this has worked best of all. It allows full hand motion unlike the thick braces.Perhaps I'm lucky that my hand size is good for this glove/brace. It puts a good amount of pressure on my palms. I'm unfamiliar with the biology behind the pain, but that "squeeze" seems to work, especially when combined with a little Icy Hot balm (don't use the cream or gel with it as it's too messy). The glove is stretchy and could probably accommodate a range of hand sizes, but I imagine that if your hand is too small or exactly in the middle of two sizes, it might not work well. Give it a try though.The only complaint I have is that the part in between the index finger and palm has a tendency to stretch and become thinner, even if the rest of the glove/brace doesn't stretch that much. As a result, you will have to replace your glove regularly if you use it often.Still, the price of the glove is nothing compared to the benefits that it brings and the ability it's given me to grade so many papers without pain.
