review/text: I'm a nursing student and needed to purchase a stethoscope for labs and clinicals. However, as a student, I did not have endless funds to purchase a high-end device. This was the perfect solution: a decent stethoscope with a reasonable price. It will last me through my schooling, at which time I will purchase a higher-end device, but for now, it's fine!
