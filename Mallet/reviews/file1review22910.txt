review/text: This sweeper is more like a child's toy than an adult's tool. It works only when pushed in the forward direction and barely does the job for small quick pick-ups. (If you pull it toward yourself, it just jumps all over the place and spills what little it has picked up.) My husband dislikes it even more than I do. Would not recommend unless purchased for a child.
