review/text: First had a cup of this herbal tea almost 20 years ago in the Rocky Mountains. It was given to me as a "cure" for dizziness, nausea and slight altitude sickness by a Native American shop keeper. I instantly felt better and have looked for this tea for years. I am a big fan of the original Ricola throat drops and the tea is just like it in liquid form. I use the tea for slight colds, upset tummies and queaziness. I also like it on "regular" days, too.
