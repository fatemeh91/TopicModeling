review/text: I have tried so many different brands of condoms from Trojan to Durex, and I must say that these are the best experience I've ever had! I randomly googled best condom brands and this came up as the #1 award winner for the past 4 years. With the other 7+ different brand of condoms I would probably only climax 50% of the time due to the constricting nature. However, with the Crowns I've been able to each and every time.Pros:+ Very thin, the closes to nothing!+ DurableCons:- Could use more lubrication- Latex scent
