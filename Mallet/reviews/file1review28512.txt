review/text: This whey protein is the best I've tried. It tastes good, actually works, and it's cheap. I've only tried delicious strawberry but I've heard great things about all the other flavors. I've also tried GNC's Wheybolic Extreme 60. I hated the flavors so I can't say if they really work or not. The Gold Standard is my new go to protein. You can pick up 2 pounds for around $27 or 3 pounds of Wheybolic for $70 at a GNC. The Gold Standard is just as good if not better and it's much, much cheaper. I recommend this protein 100%. Don't just take my word for it, there are hundreds of other happy customers out there. Don't even think twice about buying this one. It's awesome.
