review/text: I lived in an Asian country for years and I realized that the diet there (high in soy protein) can cause a lot of unexpected problems. What people don't know about soy protein (tofu, soy foods), is that soy turns into (excess) estrogen in the body. Once I returned from overseas, I purchased DIM to regulate my periods, and I am still having the same bloodflow but NO PAIN AT ALL!!!! I am not sure whether this is because of DIM, stopping the soy diet, or BOTH!
