review/text: This product did not do anything for me that I could notice. They have you taking an insanely amount of pills 30minutes before your meals. I followed the directions exactly and have been watching what I've eaten. My cravings have not gotten any better and I have not felt any more energy than usual. I would not recommend this product again but Natures Secret is not a bad company. I purchased 15-Day Weight Loss Cleanse & Flush through them from Amazon and found it to help me more, with more regular bowel movements and slight energy increase.
