review/text: The Energizer batteries are often the best value for the price as these batteries tend to run longer than "discount" batteries at a near discount price. We have been using Energizer as our primary battery brand around our home for many years due to the consistent reliability.One caveat - we've found these batteries tend to leak battery acid "easier" than the gold capped batteries if left in a device for any length of time after they have discharged. I almost lost a NOAA weather alert radio last fall due to Energizer batteries corroding into the battery compartment.UPDATE: The battery corrosion caused the death of my weather radio, had to throw it away as non-repairable after repeated efforts to make it function. Another pack of Energizer was fine, but then later another pack seemed to be rather defective, we kept having an issue with another device until we switched back to the copper type batteries. I'm not sure if the issue is due to expired product or if it's a manufacturing issue, but I want my batteries to be reliable so I recently bought the copper top once again. Simply keep an eye out on the supplier, the largest retailers will usually have fresh batteries, a less reputable seller maybe not so much.
