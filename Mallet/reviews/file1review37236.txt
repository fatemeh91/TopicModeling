review/text: This was my first time buying gloves to alleviate the beginnings of joint pain and stiffness in my hands. They definitely provid compression and heat which helps significantly. I use one pair for equestrian sports and my hands no longer freeze up on me after prolonged, strenuous use. The gloves are holding up perfectly even for riding. I use another pair for sleeping when the symptoms are the worst and wake up with much more flexibility and less pain in my hands. After getting these results I purchased a pair for each of my parents who are in their eighties and have significant arthritis. They are very pleased with the gloves.
