review/text: A friend recommended 3-in-1 for age spots. Doubtful, I rubbed 3-in-1 on my arms, which have many "age spots". In about a week, I noticed, as did several co-workers, that the age spots were indeed lighter. They are not gone, but are definitely lighter. And with the zinc oxide, it made for a good sun block, too. Very disappointed that I cannot find it at any local stores, so I'm stocking up. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this product.
