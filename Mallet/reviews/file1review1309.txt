review/text: Pedi-Quick Step-N-Smooth Shower Foot File is perfect from mobility impaired people or anyone that wants to use it. Due to an accident I am unable to easily care for my feet. I keep this the foot file on the floor of my shower and stand on it. Moving my feet in different directions removes old skin and caluses from the bottom of my feet. I hate those little creatures stuck to the bottom of the shower to prevent skids or falls. When I stand on this, not only am I gooming my feet I am not slipping and falling so not only does it groom it makes it safer for me in the shower. I had had one some time ago but it was damaged in a move. I was so thrilled to find I could purchase this at Amazon.com.
