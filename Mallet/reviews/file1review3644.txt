review/text: OK the cleaner itself, I give 5 starts. It is indeed all that and a bag of chips so to speak.However, I'm sensitive to salicylates and something in this gives me awful respiratory reactions when I spray it. "Chemically sensitive" does not mean that every non-toxic, natural thing is OK (I'm allergic to aspirin, so aloe is a problem, etc.)That isn't the fault of the cleaner; the 3 stars is because if you're having it shipped, buying the spray is silly. Much better to buy the 32 oz concentrate. Then you can mix it in a spray bottle at home, and you can use it in different strengths for different tasks.OR, if you're like me, buying the concentrate and not the spray means you can dilute it in a dish and dip the rag in -- no spraying means no inhaling. Since it bugs me I wouldn't want it in the air around my pets or baby.
