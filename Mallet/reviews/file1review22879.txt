review/text: I bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet, which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz. It does a reasonable job cleaning, transforming my carpet from "Does she ever vacuum?" to "Oh, she must have vacuumed yesterday". It doesn't get all the fuzz and crumbs, but it does what I'd expect from a sweeper. It is also much lighter than my vacuum, so I'm much more likely to use it.My three-year-old daughter enjoys using it too. She insists on sweeping her own room (I won't complain).The main thing I've learned is that, because the handle slides together, it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head. This means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle, the sweeper will probably fall off, so pick it up near the sweeper. (It stays together fine when actually sweeping.)
