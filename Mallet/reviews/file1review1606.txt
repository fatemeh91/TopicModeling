review/text: MY husband regularly gets little warts on his hands and they drive him nuts. He has used the freeze stuff gone to the doctor and usually ends up taking a razor blade to his hand and cutting as much as he can which is NOT healthy. I looked at the reviews for different products and let me tell you this looked the best, because it it! Within one week of use he was able to shave most the wart off, not butcher his skin like he used too. Being the stick form it is was much easier to handle and apply then those liquid ones. He is a mechanic and needs his hands all day and this never interfered with his work.I do however think they need to change the shape or at least the label because it looks just like chap-stick. Yes people should look before they put something on and thank goodness I did but he put it right next to the chap-stick and I cant tell you how close I came to putting it on when in a rush. Im thinking households with children need to very careful this is put out of reach but maybe Im just an idiot. Could you imagine how bad your lips would burn though?
