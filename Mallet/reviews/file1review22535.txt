review/text: I was looking for a pad that I could use to put my baby on without a diaper to "air" her bottom out as she is prone to diaper rashes no matter how frequently I change her diaper. Zinc oxide, yeast creams, ect do not get rid of them completely. The only thing that works is oxygen! The pediatrician says it is because she has very sensitive skin. I was hoping for an absorbent pad, but this is far from that. It is a thin paper sheet with a plastic liner. If you are looking for something to put down to change a diaper, it does do a good job of protecting your surface from a drops/smears that come with the standard diaper change (and protecting your baby ect) but they are NOT absorbent in the way I was hoping. I did actually satify my need with a pad from a pet supply store!!! (In case you were wondering). Anyways, she does great with it under her during tummy time. Now, I use these peewee pads when we are out and about I need to change her.
