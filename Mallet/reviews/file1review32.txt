review/text: Zand Throat Spray has been a life saver for me.I'm a Cancer survivor and I'm still pretty beat up. A few years ago, during treatment, I collapsed from Anaphylactic Shock. That permanently damaged my Epiglottis, the flap that covers (protects) your windpipe when you swallow food or liquids. I then began aspirating foods into my Lungs. As a result, I had 16 bouts with Terminal Pneumonia. I'm a fighter, so I survived, but only by the Grace of God.So now I experience a strong biting feeling in my deep throat. It causes me to cough uncontrollably. But, with a couple of sprays of this product it ceases. What a gift!I don't know how I could live without it.TaosGuy
