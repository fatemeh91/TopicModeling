review/text: This kit creates a perfect base for a small survival kit. It already has most everything you would need- especially if you have a first-aid kit in a separate pack- then this will cover most of your needs. Although it's up to you on how much you want to carry- but if you buy this one- you'll be very pleased with it. It's great!
