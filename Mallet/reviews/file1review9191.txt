review/text: Since I was interested in sorting out my own medication for a month I purchased four of the Apex Medicine chests. I found them to be sizable, I take a lot of big meds, and relatively sturdy if you use some care.The best part was the price. In order to find anything comparable in a store, you would have to spend at least $20.
