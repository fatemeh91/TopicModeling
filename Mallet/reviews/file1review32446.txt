review/text: Before I purchased this item, I was looking for reviews that mentioned using this cooler with a City Mini Double stroller (to see if it would be compatible with ours):Some people have described having the cooler (full of items) attached to the stroller and being able to fold the stroller without problems... some reviews said it doesn't attach to double strollers....so I wasn't sure what to expect by some of the confusing/conflicting reviews I had read, but decided to try it out for myself.It does attach to our stroller (City Mini Double) and we can fold stroller with cooler attached, BUT the cooler has to be empty, since where it attaches (the most secure place on this stroller is the second cross bar) it has to be able to collapse the cooler, to be able to fold the stroller flat.This is not a big problem, but it means that I have to remember to empty the cooler first before I can fold/load it into the car (just a little hassle) or if we are taking the stroller for a Disney trip (for example), and bringing things to go in this cooler, I have to store them someplace else during our car trip there (i.e. separate cooler). You may think why not just take this cooler off then instead of using two coolers, but taking this one off/on is more of a hassle, and I wouldn't want to fool with it in a parking lot. I really didn't want to get that lengthy, but I wanted to describe actual use for anyone that has this stroller (so they could picture how it would actually be). All-in-all, (little hassels and all) I am so glad we got it, because this looks sleek, gives us a little more space for storage on our stroller, and is a way to keep drinks from getting hot in the summer (especially on long days out where drinks would be hot in an hour otherwise).Other notes about the cooler:Description says it can hold a 6 pack of 12oz cans, this is true (but without ANY extra space for an ice pack, etc)- which means it will hold less if you want to put an ice pack (so this is pretty small).Best feature I LOVE about this cooler, is that it attaches low on the stroller (for two reasons):It is out of the way, not in the way of my feet when walking, but also not taking up space in the under basket (allowing more cargo there) AND most importantly since it is low, it will not make the stroller tippy.For those that have a single stroller, I would imagine this would attach to the lowest bar on the stroller, allowing you to fold it full (and be out of the way)- which would make this cooler even better. Hope this helps anyone else that has a double stroller and is confused by the conflicting reviews.
