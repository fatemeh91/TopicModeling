review/text: I was looking at both this model and the different sonicare models of toothbrushes. I purchased this item because it has a roatary method (spins) while the Sonicare shifts from side to side.Also with these models there are different interchangable mouthpeices you can use. For example polish and floss brush.I love this toothbrush....it feels like going to a dentist office cleaning after every brush.
