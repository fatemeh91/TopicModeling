review/text: I buy Balance Bar Nutrition Energy Bars on a regular basis so I decided to buy them online. They arrived in less than 6 days. The order was placed Jan-17-2011, I received the Balance bars today, Jan-21-2011, the expiration date is Jan-20-2011 - yesterday. I am NOT eating these. Unacceptable. I have read earlier reviews stating problems with the expiration dates. Maybe the reviews are worth taking into consideration.
