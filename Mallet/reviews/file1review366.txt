review/text: I purchased this product expecting it to be fun but I am highly disappointed... Ive had jackrabbits in the past this one was nothing at all close to the quality of others Ive owned I really wish I never purchased this one now.. First there is the STRONG unpleasant odor that it has itself very chemically and gross! I washed it with 2 different soaps prior to use and it still made my hands and other parts smell like it! That killed me and my husbands kink for the night. Secondly the levels on the motors that make the metal beads run around arent all that different from first to 3rd its barely noticeable when change it. I basically tossed money down the drain because I cant get over the stink of the thing to use it again and I am pretty sure I wont be buying products from this company again out of fear the rest are like this! I've never had a product I was so disappointed in seriously and I've tried a lot. I certainly wouldnt recommend this product to friends or on the several forums I'm on that we talk about such things. Sure you cant return a product once its used but someone shouldnt sell a product that isnt good in the first place. I'm sure they all knew about the smell. I am sure there are testers they use... Well lesson learned I guess. I do hope this is helpful at least for further designs in the future so others dont have to have this experience.
