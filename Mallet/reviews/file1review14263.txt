review/text: I've been using this device for almost three months and my shower still looks clean. Don't understand why some folks are having a hard time with it. As for covering the entire shower area, mine is about 73 inches. There's a small bench area that continues where the tub ends, and it does cover that area. Not alot mind you, but a bit of it does spray on there. Plus my shower curtain liner still looks spotless.As for the expense for buying the refills. I go through two of them in three weeks, but there are always coupons in your local Sunday paper. That's how I have purchased mine. So far so good the product has worked for me.
