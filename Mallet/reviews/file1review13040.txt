review/text: I use this on my back (and occasionally around my neck) when I am sitting in my recliner. It instantly warms and relaxes stressed, achy muscles. I also use it to pre-warm my bed in the winter. It needs to stay in my microwave longer than the suggested time, but maybe that's just my microwave. I love this product.
