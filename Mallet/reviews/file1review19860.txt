review/text: I have a boy and I love this toilet seat. It's very easy to clean. No weird corners or gaps to clean. The guard works for my boy (sometimes he didn't want to hold it down and the guard can still catch his urine). One of the best feature is their black rim, which can secure a seat (no shaking or moving seat) very well. Some of my friends told me their toilet seat swift when their toddler using the toilet, which can scare them. I highly recommand this product!
