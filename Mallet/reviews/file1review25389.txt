review/text: I have had one of these for 15 years and it finally died on me this summer. I have tried others and like this one the best. It is compact and travels well in a small toilet kit in my carry-on flight bag. I never leave home without it, ha. Does what it is supposed to, although a small flashlight helps assist trimming inside your nose. Takes one AA battery and gets good life out of the battery, which I remove when traveling so it doesn't accidentally get switched on, which has occasionally happened. Great price from Amazon, I ordered a pair to have a backup, so shipping was free.
