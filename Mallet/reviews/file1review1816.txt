review/text: This stuff works. I've been using this along with a brush to clean the infected area underneath my toenails, and I've seen drastic improvement in just a couple of weeks. Had I know it would be this affected I would have taken a before/after picture to show the results. Of course I wouldn't post them on the internet unless there was a high demand for it. Either way, take my word-- it works.
