review/text: If you enjoy taking a bath in the morning or early afternoon, this product will work well to refresh and awaken you for your day or evening. The Tangerine/Grapefruit scent is subtle and you may want to add in a few orange slices for effect. This product foams very slightly and the bubbles are not like a bubble bath and disappear fairly quickly.Main Ingredients: Baking Soda, Sea Salt, Sweet Orange Oil, Grapefruit Oil, Jojoba Oil.The skin-softening properties of this product are immediately apparent. This product can be used for children or adults. Not recommended for whirlpool tubs, because of the foaming nature of the powder.~The Rebecca Review
