review/text: Before I purchased this product, I had owned a Sonicare Elite 7800 toothbrush that I absolutely loved. I know it sounds stupid that I went with a different toothbrush after having one that was perfect, but I have to say that I was very impressed with my new toothbrush. They say it can do 40,000 brush strokes per minute. This was faster than my previous toothbrush, and I didn't really know if that meant anything in the grand scheme of things. What really impressed me was when after 3 months of use, I went in for a dental cleaning and my dental hygienist was shocked to see that I had no plaque or tartar built up on my teeth. This was unlike any previous visit there. Now don't assume that I was just some slob who started brushing when I got this new toothbrush. I brush 3 or more times daily and floss twice daily. I rinse every time I brush. I am very particular about the care of my teeth.I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who is looking for a more intense cleaning when they brush their teeth. It is the Ferrari of electric toothbrushes. It has 4 useful and cool settings. It has many available brush heads for all of your oral hygiene needs. It is great. That is all I can say. I plan on having it forever, or until the battery refuses to charge anymore.If you have something against Oral-B, then I would recommend this toothbrush instead, which is great as well.PHILIPS SONICARE PROFESSIONAL ELITE 7800
