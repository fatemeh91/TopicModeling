review/text: Save your money! This product isn't all that its cracked up to be - even thought we'd really like it to be! I'd say that it must help if you have irregular cycles, but if you have regular cycles, like I do, it may not be a good product for you. When I took it last month I didn't even ovulate at all - before I took it I did like clockwork, and then after I took it, I didn't ovulate that month......coincidence!?!?!!?
