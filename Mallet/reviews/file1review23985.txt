review/text: I purchased this item over others because it used 2 AA batteries vs. AAA that most others used. I am disappointed to find that the description is incorrect. It actually requires 2 AAA batteries. I have a lot of AA batteries on hand all the time for my other electronics, but seldom keep AAA. Hopefully it won't eat through batteries. Time will tell...
