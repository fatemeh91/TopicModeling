review/text: I was able to get it down, finally mixing with coffee. It tasted like the water must taste in the back of an air conditioner. Indescribable, half-organic, half chemical, reminded me of the smell on the Jersey Turnpike around the refineries and garbage dumps. Worse. It did give energy which might have been the famous arterial dilation effect. A friend of mine, a nurse with strong stomach, finally returned what I loaned her to try, saying it just non-consumable. I switched to Swanson's Arginine-AKG lemon-flavored powder, which I can easily drink.
