review/text: I really had a bad sinus infection and needed relief. This product looked appealing since I own their "shoulder ice pack" and love it. The sinus mask fits confortably and conforms to your face nicely. It is puncture proof and easily adjustable. My only complaint is that it only last about 15 minutes. I feel this is due to the fact that it is not as "thick" as say their back or shoulder products. It makes bedtime and after work so much more relaxing. If you need a cheap form of relief from either headaches or sinus troubles by all means pick one up.
