review/text: I have been fighting with my weight my entire life. Ok not fighting, the weight was fighting, I was curled up taking a beating :) Due to a naturally low metabolism it has not been easy for me to lose weight. I do not eat a lot of sweets or junk food but still have not been able to lose weight. I began taking the Zantrex this Monday, June 25. By this Thursday, June 28 I had already lost 4 pounds! I have been exercising daily, drinking lots of water and watching what I eat. At first I took the recommended dosage of 2 pills. It made me jittery, but gave me loads of energy. As a mother of 2 who works full time and attends school I definitely needed it. I cut my dosage down to one pill, twice daily, which gave me enough energy to handle my household without the crack junkie side effects. It has been definitely worth it for me. I'm sorry for all the other people who had horrible experiences. I hope you find something that works!!! Good Luck.
