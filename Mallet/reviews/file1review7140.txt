review/text: I was tired of shaving with a regular razor. I searched online for good, sturdy and affordable electric razors and I found the Wahl 7367-500. What a great choice: this rechargeable unit comes with 3 different foil heads for different degrees of closeness, a built-in trimmer and a separate personal trimmer that comes in very handy for annoying nose hair. And the price is just great: a fraction of what other more famous brands cost.Let's "face" it: the Wahl shaves very close, not as close as a regular blade of course, but no electric razor does anyway. However, if you don't want to "rip" your skin off, use the Wahl: it is much easier, safer, more comfortable, less messy and more time-saver than using even the most "cutting edge" 3, 4 or 5-blade disposable razors. It does save money AND the environment!I would definitely recommend this unit.
