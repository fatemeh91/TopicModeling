review/text: I learned about this from the gym I went to. It seems to dissolve better than other brands I've tried. Which makes it good to mix in my morning cereal (1/2 scoop) for some extra protein. They also suggested for shakes, using 1 scoop and adding 1/4 cup of egg whites (pasturized) to increase protein with minimizing the calories. I blend it in a blender for a great smoothie. I recommend the vanilla because it can be mixed with different flavors for variety. My favorite morning smoothie is adding some sugar free chocolate syrup and a teaspoon (or more) of instant coffee and blending with ice for an iced mocha.The single serving flavor packets (for water) work great too. The breakfast orange is also good, it tastes like a creamsicle. Adding fruit also makes for great variety.
