review/text: These vitamins are great ! they're organic, easy to digest and have great reviews everywhere. However, I can't figure out how to swallow these without them getting stuck or coughing like crazy. I have no problems taking large vitamins but only if they're gel or vcaps. These are average sized multivitamin pills but solid and rock hard. Just something to consider if you're used to gel or vcap pills.
