review/text: My cat has, for several years suffered from UTI problems - even the antibiotics given by the vet only helped a little bit - and the problems always came back.I had my doubts about this stuff (originally got at nativeremedies) but figured, what the heck.. Tried a little in moist cat food, but my baby won't eat moist cat food for some reason - only dry.. then a light bulb went off, I bought some Catmilk from the grocery store, mixed in the granules with the milk, and my sweetie drank it all down, even though the granules did not dissolve completely - she'd lick it up with the milk.Well, I finally finished a whole bottle in about 2 weeks, of twice a day for the first few days, then once a day until it was gone. My cat has finally been using the litter box again, she's much happier, and doesn't go pee on piles of paper or in boxes or on laundry anymore. This stuff has made me a 100% believer, and I'm ordering more at the moment- just to have it on hand and offer regular feedings every couple days just to maintain her health ..This stuff has finally done what 3 different vets with antibiotics prescriptions could not do! It is worth every penny, and then some! I highly recommend it to anyone with a cat that has *confirmed* UTI problems and infections . (Please do have your cat checked by a vet first - there are other diseases that can cause similar symptoms, not just UTI infections!)
