review/text: I have tried a couple of different Conair clippers prior to this purchase. They worked well for a while, but struggled with thick hair and lost their charge quickly. This Wahl Clipper does well with thick hair. It is, however, quite heavy and a bit big for a medium sized female to hold. Since it works well on thick hair and hair doesn't get caught in it like with Conair, my kids like it a lot. Overall, because of the more powerful motor and the ability to not to get hair "caught" in it, I give it 5 stars.
