review/text: I have two issues with this product:1) Uncomfortable - poor design has extra velcro (not used to hold the collar on you) poking out and scratching at your throat.2) Doesn't absorb the cold very well - a can of Coca Cola in the refrigerator for 20 minutes is way colder than this pack is after sitting overnight in a chest 'deep freeze' freezer.A cold wash rag wrapped around your neck and covered with a towel would be just about as effective, more comfortable, and more convenient. I suppose this would be useful to someone who is extremely sensitive to cold packs and doesn't mind red scratch marks on their neck.
