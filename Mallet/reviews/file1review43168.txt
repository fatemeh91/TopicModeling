review/text: I bought this product a few years ago from Target, and I am so glad I don't have 8 bottles around! The smell is gross to me, and really lingers (all that hot steam), and after a while started to give me a headache. So I used it less and less, but then my shower was harder to clean. Yes, even spraying it every 3 days, and sparsely, helped with soap scum. But, my dog! that smell :-( For some reason I thought Method was specific to Target, and that this product was the only - not so! Duh. I found an Arm & Hammer version at Safeway - much better smell (kinda sweet and candy-like, and not great) and also works. I think there was another brand on the shelf which I will smell/try when I run out of my A&H. I DO like other Method products!
