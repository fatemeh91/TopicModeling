review/text: Given the price of this shaver, I expected a little more than I got.Braun promises a much closer, smoother and more efficient shave as a result of the new foil with a "revolutionary new pattern" resulting in "20 different hair capturing opportunities compared to just 1 from a regular foil," and the "oscillating movement" of the shaver head. In reality, you get a pretty good shave, but no better than the older Braun I replaced (which didn't have these new features). It also doesn't live up to its advertising of capturing more, if not all, hairs on the neck. I still find myself finishing off these hairs with a razor.Although the shaver glides smoothly over my face and neck after it has been through a cleaning cycle, it is not so smooth with the next shave. For a really smooth shave, I have found that I must use the cleaner after every shave, which is not always practical (especially when I'm out of town).The cleaner works well. Just pop the shaver in the cleaner and it goes to work. I suppose it is worth the few extra bucks each month to purchase the replacement cleaning fluid. The "Smart Logic" battery system is also nice, so you don't have to worry about when you do and don't recharge the battery. As for the battery life, you will definitely want to recharge it well before 50 minutes or 2 to 3 weeks of cordless shaving (according to Braun's claim). However, the battery life is sufficient and a cord is included for travel, etc.Overall, a good shaver with an effective cleaning system. At this price, however, you may want to consider purchasing a less expensive model and clean the shaver yourself. You'll get just as good a shave.
