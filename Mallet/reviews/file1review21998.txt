review/text: I swear by this for kids under 3. I've used it with both my kids and if you start it at the first sign of a cold and use it religiously (per the package instructions) I believe it will ward off or at least reduce the length and intensity of a cold. My kids love them and ask for them often. They're a little pricey for the quantity, but worth it in my opinion.
