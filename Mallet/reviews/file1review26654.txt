review/text: Love the product, but, out of the two I purchased, one holds air and the other doesn't. Put it under water to see where the leak was. One of the seams was leaking quite allot of air. tried to seal it with rubber cement, but it was no use. Finally threw it away. But the one that holds air, I love. I would like to buy another one, but wonder what percentage leak.
