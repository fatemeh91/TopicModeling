review/text: I recommend it because I am trying to lose weight (and succeeding). I've lost 20 lbs this month, but that's incorporating eating healthier (higher protein diet and organic food) and excersize. I drink one shake in the morning (I just mix it with 8 oz of skim milk), and one after weight training. It works for weight loss because it does not contain all of the fat, calories, and carbohydrates that other protein powders contain, e.g., Muscle Milk. Don't get me wrong Muscle Milk is good for those trying to bulk up, and pack on the muscle. This protein powder simply gives me the protein that I need to build/maintain muscle compostion which subsequently burns my body fat.
