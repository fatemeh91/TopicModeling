review/text: This is a great little seat that prevents little bottoms from ending up in the toilet. My son loves his, I will probably get another one for upstairs so I don't have to keep bringing it up and down with him. It pops in and out so easily that I just put it on when he is ready to go and store it next to the toilet when he isn't- can can put it on himself. It also holds still when in use, it can't fall off the toilet with a kid sitting on it.
