review/text: I use this soap after I workout. Either cardio/weights or bjj/grappling. I have tried multiple different Tea Tree oil based soaps, Bath and Body Tea Tree Oil Gel, Defense Soap and Gel,SuperBodyCare. This soap is fairly soluble and watery. It comes out fast and I need to use a decent amount each time. Likened to the consitancy of dish dish soap. I use 2-3 doses of 2x2inches on to my Salux Nylon Towel(loofa towel). In contrast the Bath and Body uses about half the amount and lathers much more. The Defense soap bar lathers a lot as well, but it goes down fairly fast imo, I'd use the gel over the bar if going with Defense. Overall I like this soap, the primary drawbacks are it is watery, and of the TeaTreeoil based soaps that I have used, it's the only one that actually has a menthol like feel on my package, not particularly painful, but it does give it a slight burn. I am not aware of it's therapeutic effects on active fungal breakouts, I use it more as a preventative measure. Rinsing, then lathering up, letting the soap sit on me for roughly a minute then rinsing it off. If I do no-gi I may opt to lather up twice. There is a residual medicinal smell. If I plan on going out then I use a normal shower gel or soap bar.
