review/text: This item came exactly as shown and has been very useful. It is a little bigger than I imagined, but it holds a lot of pills! I keep my medications and all my vitamins in it (up to 6 different pills per side-big ones like Omega-3 pills). It helps me make sure I take my vitamins every day :)
