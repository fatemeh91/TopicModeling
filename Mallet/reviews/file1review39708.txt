review/text: My husband is very picky about shave gels, primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin. My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack, even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping. He is not happy with this product. He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products, namely, Gillette Fusion, which he prefers. Also, insofar as use on his sensitive skin, the gel is only so-so. The fragrance is okay with him. However, what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide. Now we have about four cans left, which he will grudgingly use, unless I can find him a deal on Fusion. He's encouraging me to find one...soon.
