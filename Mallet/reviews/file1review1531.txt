review/text: Suggested by our family Doc. To my surprise I couldn't find this at my local Walgreens... they had never heard of it! My 6 year old daughter complained of the smell of the burning sensation from the liquid stuff. This has very little odor, stays in place and can be applied like lip balm, with a cotton swab, or with your finger. Took care of a tough foot wart for our 6 year old.
