review/text: I originally had this trimmer many years ago and replaced it with a Norelco when the battery went out on me, that was a mistake. If you have a beard this is the trimmer to get, it always cuts even and mine is still on the first battery charge which was 5 weeks ago and that's with 3 uses per week! If you're looking for a solid, dependable trimmer look no further, you just found it!UPDATE - Do not get the trimmer wet or rinse the blades with water, this will slowly remove the lubrication on the blades causing more friction and the battery to drain more quickly. Also, without lubrication the blades will pull at your facial hair and cut unevenly. Although the manufacturer states the blades never need oiling, they will if they get wet.
