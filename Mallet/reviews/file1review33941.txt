review/text: My preferred painkiller. Aspirin and ibuprofen make my stomach hurt, so I like to take this instead. It's not super effective against pain and headaches, but it staves it off for a few hours. The acetaminophen sold by this website is fine; I ordered it online because I didn't have time to go out and it wasn't contaminated or anything.
