review/text: I was tired of razor burn, shaving everyday, and still having stubbly legs! I start going to the spa to get waxed...well that didn't fit my budget for very long. I started waxing at home, which was a long, messy process. On a search of something else to get rid of hair, I came across this product on Amazon and bought it. This is my first epilator and now I wonder why I've taken so long to get one! I agree with one of the other reviews that it's important to get waxed a few times before you use the epilator, especially if you have course hair. (It gets you use to the sensation and damages the bulb which prevents the hair from growing as fast and thick.) Epilating and waxing are UNCOMFORTABLE (however the more you do it the less discomfort you will have), there's no way around that, but you can handle it! Especially when the results are to be hair free for a few weeks! Follow the instructions when using the epilator (start epilating at the ankle, the most senitive part, and work your way up.). It still takes awhile to remove all the hair but it's much more convenient than waxing (and cheaper in the long run). I highly recommend this product. The epilator comes with a shaver and a cute carrying case so it's easy to take with you when you travel! I will NEVER shave again!
