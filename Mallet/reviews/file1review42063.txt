review/text: I spent a fair amount of time researching mouthwashes before I purchased this. I was looking for one that not only freshened breath but kept it fresh and one that promoted good oral health - this fit the bill, at least according to the reviews that I read. They weren't wrong. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Fresh Essence Plus Mouthwash. The taste is a bit different than what I had become accustomed to, but it's not bad. It leaves behind a minty citrus aftertaste, and the best part? That minty citrus taste is still present for at least 3 hours after I swish. I'm also a fan of the fact that this is an all-natural product and does not contain ingredients that are harmful or toxic to our bodies.
