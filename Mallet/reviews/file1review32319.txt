review/text: I had septoplasty and turbinator reduction, and these ice packs molded around my nose comfortably. I also was able to fold them in half to place one half on one side of my nose and the other half over my cheek/eye area. They also sat comfortably on my forehead between my eyes, and the cloth side was comfortable directly against my skin. They "chilled" quickly too, and by having 5 of them, I could rotate through them easily. I HIGHLY recommend them!!! They helped numb the pain and reduce the swelling.
