review/text: I bought this item for my husband, he had an old Norelco that worked great but was not charging anymore. His main complaint with the Braun is that it will not shave his neck, but it does fine with his face. I did read other reviews that had similar complaints, and I wish I had listened and bought something different. I hope this is helpful.
