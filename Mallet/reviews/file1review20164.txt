review/text: With so many phytoestrogens and xenoestrogens in our enviroment, its probably best that most adult women take a product like this. It is good for removing excess estrogen from the body. I like this brand because the pills are small and easy to swallow. For me there isn't a noticeable difference in when I take it and when I dont but I will continue to take this long term because I TRULY BELIEVE we need products like this for breast cancer prevention. Think about it, breast cancer is killing women every year and estrogen is linked to breast cancer.... however plastics are full of xenoestrogens yet we use more plastic now than ever before. Take care of yourself because the govt will not. Thats why they are just looking for &#34;money for breast cancer research and awareness&#34; instead of using their &#34;power&#34; for good and pushing for a safer environment and natural healthier products and real unprocessed freakin food.
