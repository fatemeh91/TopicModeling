review/text: I don't know how I made it so many years without a nose hair trimmer. I have nose nair in the classic levantine tradition and over the years I had to make do with scissors and tweezers to groom myself. Then one day my wife was watching "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" and they featured a nose hair trimmer that looked a lot like this Panasonic. I'd been skeptical about the practicality of electric nose hair trimmers, but I figured if the Fab Five recommended it, then maybe I should try it. I've had it over a year now and I've only had to change the battery once. The only negative I can see is that it doesn't look especially robust, so I imagine it will die someday, but at $15 who cares? When that happens I'll buy a new one just like the old one.
