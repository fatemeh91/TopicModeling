review/text: This sturdy brush is just the thing for preparing dishes for the dishwasher or (heaven forbid) washing dishes by hand. The grip is indeed good, as advertised and the bristles are stiff and easy to clear. You keep dish soap (Dawn is a perreniel favorite of mine) in the top and you can push the button to make it come out. Sometimes it leaks but not very much and not very often.This brush often seems to be in short supply at home stores, but I always buy the entire stock and give them as gifts. Several people have specifically mentioned that this little brush became an indispensible part of their kitchen.
