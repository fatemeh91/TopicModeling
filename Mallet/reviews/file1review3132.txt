review/text: Overall, I really like this product. Should be noted that the 100ct does NOT come in a box, but in a large bag. I suppose it's fine considering that the container really doesn't matter all that much. They are slightly tighter than other condoms, but not to the point where it feels like a problem. But for the particularly girthy guy, you might want to look elsewhere. My one major problem is that if I have one in my wallet for any more than a day or so, the wrapper somehow becomes unsealed. For those of us who prefer to have one for those "just in case" moments, this can be a problem. Otherwise, I was pleased.
