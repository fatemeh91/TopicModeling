review/text: Not much to say. They are easy to install, comfortable for the kids, and easy to remove when not in use. There is a wheel that can tighten the unit to the toilet seat if you have a dedicated kid bathroom. We don't. And without tightening the seats stay firmly in place. When not in use, you can place a hook on your wall and hang it.Strongly recommend. Had them for 2+ years and still going strong.
