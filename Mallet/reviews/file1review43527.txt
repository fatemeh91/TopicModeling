review/text: I've replaced my older Omron blood pressure monitor product with this HEM-711AC. I've taken it to both my doctors office and the hospital to check it's accuracy and it's been right on target at both places. The older one couldn't be re-calibrated and it's accuracy was questionable. I'm more than happy to have this new HEM-711AC.
