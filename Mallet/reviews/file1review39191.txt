review/text: I have used these clippers four times, and I'm very happy with them. They cut hair nice and easily to the desired length. There are a comb attachments ranging from #1 to #8. As far as I can tell the # is the number of 1/8's of an inch that your hair will be cut. I've used the #2 and #3, and both work great. The scissors included in this kit should not go near anyone's hair. They are cheap and flimsy, but I didn't buy the kit for the scissors. The instructional video is hilarious. The haircuts they show are pretty bad. I was a bit worried because I thought my hair would look like the some of the cuts in the video. Fortunately mine turned out looking great.
