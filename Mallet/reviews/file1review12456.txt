review/text: Having suffered for months with great pain - in the mornings especially; I did some research and found I had the symptoms of plantar fasciitis. One of the suggestions for treatment was a night brace. I found this one @ Amazon. There was definite improvement the first night. I was very happy to find it was comfortable and didn't cause any problems with my sleep, either. Great product, made well and really works.
