review/text: I think this seat is just great. My little boy will sit long enough to actually finish his business on this seat. The splash-guard actually works - I don't have to show him how to point anything downwards. I had a seat by Munchkin that was awful - urine would collect in it and leak even after washing it off, and there was no effective spray-guard. So I got this seat as a replacement. I'll admit, I was skeptical of the high-price, but it's worth every penny. My older child had grown out of other seats, but even she can fit on this seat as its design is roomier somehow. So you will get your money's worth. I can't say enough good things about this seat. You won't regret it!
