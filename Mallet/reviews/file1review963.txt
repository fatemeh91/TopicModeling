review/text: I love that these have no mint flavor. My dog needs these for his stomach problems but the mint flavored ones he doesn't like and then I have to wrestle him to take them. These hide in dog food and get eats them, none the wiser. Small enough too, that he just swallows them.I suspect they work well on humans too. :-)
