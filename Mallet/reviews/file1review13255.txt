review/text: I first bought one of these pads and returned for 3 more as I need to keep changing, washing, and drying them constantly. I'm using them for my 5 year-old son who is still learning to keep dry throughout the night and doesn't want to wear diapers anymore. They do absorb well so I haven't had to change the sheets since I got them. The only inconvenience is the pad is not long enough to tuck under the mattress and does NOT stay put (that's why the 4 stars). Fortunately, I discovered some 'sheet smoothers' at Bed, Bath & Beyond the other day --I looked for them here on Amazon to complete my review:Sheet Suspender keep all sheets smooth & tight on any bed!I put the elastic bands across the mattress, underneath it and above the base (box spring equivalent), so all I have to do is clip the pad on each side of the bed and problem solved. They now stay put, no wrinkling, no crumpling, they just work perfectly. Changing the pad is very easy, just unclip the soiled one and clip a clean one.The package does say that this product is not intended for 12 year-olds or younger, but with the pad securely fastened I cannot imagine why it would be unsafe for a 'big' kid.
