review/text: I have never been able to take any kind of multivitamin (even liquid form) without feeling sick, and I have no problem with these. When I found out I was pregnant taking a multivitamin was one of my prime concerns. Rainbow light was actually recomended to me by a friend (who takes them not being pregnant). I have taken them with or without food, and at different times of day with no problem. Don't be scared to take a chance on these!!
