review/text: It's not much to look at, but the trimmer does a great job of cutting ear and nose hairs very close without pulling. I've only used it for a short time but so far I'm happy, and it's far superior to other rotary clippers used in the past.Update after about 6 months of use: Not worth the trouble.It lost it's sharpness and the speed of the cutter often stops or is so slow that it pulls on your hair. Changed batteries multiple times, but it's not a battery problem. I will try to return it.
