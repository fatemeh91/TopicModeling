review/text: I love this bathtub, and my son does too. The inflatable sides and bottom give a lot of cushioning, and keep my kiddo from banging his head on the tub. He's now almost 2 and still won't take a bath without this tub. He likes to splash around in it, and it uses so much less water than filling the big tub. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it's not that durable. We're on our third one now - the first got a leak in the seam, the second got a rip in the valve -- but we've been using them since my son was about 8 months old, and the price is good, so all in all I'm still a big fan of this tub.
