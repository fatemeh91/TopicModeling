review/text: As a person who is sensitive to fragrances, I bought this dish detergent in the hopes that it would clean my dishes without giving me a headache from the perfumes. Not only does it clean fabulously, but there are no more headaches!Even better is that this company uses natural ingredients and does not test on animals. I feel good about the fact that when I buy this product, my money is going towards a company with a sense of social responsibility. Thanks for such a great product!
