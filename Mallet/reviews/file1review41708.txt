review/text: The first Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 died after about three months. It showed that the battery was fully charged, but the brush wouldn't turn on. Then, one night, in the middle of the night the brush just turned on by itself! There was also a lot of moisture that started building up inside the LCD window - althought I always dried the brush after using it. Since I bought it at Bed, Bath & Beyond they replaced it. The replacement brush died after just 1 month! It had all the same problems as the first one.Don't waste your money.
