review/text: This is supposedly an all-in-one product with the trimmer and a shaver. In reality, it doesn't work.First thing I noticed was that the guard comb is very flimsy. It has a simple selector that allows you to change the length of the comb.It doesn't work: you have to hold the selection with your finger, otherwise it slips. This is such a basic thing and would be so easy to design well... but it looks like nobody at Braun is paying attention.The most serious problem however is the trimmer: after only several weeks of use it became dull and was pulling my hair. This was so painful that the trimmer became completely useless. Like everything else in this product, the trimmer itself is very flimsy, and I see no way it can be sharpened or repaired. The shaver works... sort of. You do not get a good shave, and you have to work very hard at it.If you want a good shave don't buy this product. If you want a good trimmer don't buy this product. My experience was so bad that I intend to stay away from Braun products altogether.
