review/text: It nearly killed me to pay $20 for a broom but I was looking for something better than the rest so thought I'd gamble and try the Good Grips since I like their other products. It's kind of small which suits me because I'm smallish (5' - 4") and I do not have any vast expanses of hard floors to sweep. This one is easy to maneuver around chair legs, under tables, and into corners. It might be uncomfortably small and/or short for tall people or those who have very large areas to clean. I give it four stars because it's not all that extraordinary except in the looks department. Hopefully it will last forever and if it does then I'll know I did not waste my money.
