review/text: I've been taking Source of Life for only 2 weeks now and I love it. I started taking it because I have trouble swallowing pills (especially horse-pill multivitamins)and I was attracted to the ingredients. But I would recommend it to anyone because so far its the best I've ever tried. And the taste isn't so bad either.Update: I recently went to purchase another bottle of this product and the store was out of stock. The sales guy recommended Source of Life Red. It was not good at all. It had a taste of rancid wild berries with too much added sugar and it was way too thick. I also feel that it didn't give me that burst of energy I'm used to. Nature's Plus says I can get a refund, thank goodness. (I paid $35!) I'll be sure to stick with the original from now on.
