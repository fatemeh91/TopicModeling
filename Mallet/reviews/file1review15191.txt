review/text: I really didn't care for the product. It was very dry in my mouth. Not a whole lot of flavor, and the filling had a powdery feeling to it. The chocolate on the outside was good but again, not too much flavor. It needed to be sweeter, and the raspberry flavoring was weak. Tasted like I was eating an old candy bar, and a stale one at that. I had to keep checking it to see if it was old and out of date. I actually gagged on it a couple times while eating it. I did eat several of them (nine). The wrapper looks too formal, not appealing to the eye. It made me feel like I was eating a health bar and not a fun item! I thought the carbs were a bit too high also. It did give me a full feeling when I finished with it. Didn't fulfill the need for something sweet, though. If I'm going to eat chocolate, I want to know I ate chocolate. I wouldn't recommend this to my family or friends. I'd rather recommend Slim Fast Bars for the vitamins and health aspects.
