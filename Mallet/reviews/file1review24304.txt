review/text: I have foot problems for many years and am very athletic. Bunions are par for the course. This walkfit has its good and bad. I can understand what some people are saying when they state, "they hurt".Pros: it is hard plastic and won't give in after prolonged use, meaning continual arch support, unlike foam counterparts that don't support after extended walking or activities. I find them ok only for minimal walking or hiking activities, best for me in an ankle boot like a hiker with a soft foam pad over them.Cons: because it is hard plastic, I notice after several hours of walking(ie, being a tourist) they really hurt! It is like they are a fist pushing into your arch. I had to go buy some cheap foam arches at walgreens on one trip to replace the walk-fits, though the cheap foam arches gave no support(how can foam ever support an adult?). It helps to put a soft foot foam pad over them.Because they aren't really custom for the 4 arches in the foot, just that one long arch with the multiple sized inserts, its still a stock item, and its hit or miss whom they may help. its best to buy them from a retailer that takes returns if they don't work out for you, but they may. you don't know till you try.
