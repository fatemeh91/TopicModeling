review/text: First of all, I have been a big fan of these sweepers since I was a little kid. I love quiet tools that get the job done. This one is not a quality, built to last one from the past by any means. Yes, most of us idiots (using some other reviewers words) can figure out how to tape the handle together because yes, it does fall apart. If you're lucky, it won't hit you in the shin the first time you put it together and try it out. Just be careful when you lift it to empty the catch bins, it could bruise half your leg and ankle as it did for me. But in spite of this, it isn't JUST the awful handle pieces that fall apart, the rubber around the base and the entire handle pull away from the side of the base while you're using it. It makes quite a mess as it falls apart and opens on your rug. I for one and sick of worrying if I am going to have a bigger mess to clean up, or have to put it back together every time I use it . I'll be looking for something else. Maybe I got a dud but I can't believe that such a simple, time-tested product would be so poorly made. If I could find a vintage one that was clean, I'd buy that instead. At least the price was cheap. JMHO
