review/text: These score an A with me for eco-friendliness, but a C for effectiveness. They tend to kind of leak--as in they get saturated and then my bra gets wet and then my shirt gets wet. It would be nice if they had some sort of more waterproof fabric on the outside to prevent that from happening. That being said, I'm not sure if there is a better fabric option.
