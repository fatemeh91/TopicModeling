review/text: I just returned from 2 weeks in London and took this small Neti pot with me, used it everyday. It was just terrific, no rough edges or bad smell as I read in another review. It was only $6 and a good deal. Maybe all of them aren't as smooth and nice as mine. I really like it alot and will take it on my next trip.
