review/text: I started taking this supplement on Tuesday. At first everything was great, then as the week progressed and I started taking the pills more my acid reflux began to act up. If you suffer from acid reflux, do not take it or ask your doctor before using the product. Trust me, it best to be safe and not take it. I been spitting up acid and dealing with brain fog when I started using this product.
