review/text: I cant say that my forgetfullness has improved, Im still absent-minded and have some difficulty focusing but I must say, I've been taking only two pills every morning and my urge to lay down for a nap at 2pm is completly gone. I forgot to take it one day and slept for 3 hours on the couch which was a usual occurance before. I was hoping it would help me be less forgetful and keep my mind from racing, but I will keep taking it anyways because Im getting a lot more done everyday.
