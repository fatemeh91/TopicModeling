review/text: I have to say I am a sceptic with herbal cures but saw a short article in AARP so thought I would try it. I have been trying to use diet to lower my cholestrol so I could avoid medications but after a year of that and the cholestene my cholestrol was lower than it had been in 7 years, even my doctor was impressed. I am only able to take 2-3 a day since more gave me stomach problems like high fiber would.overall cholsestrol down 21 pts
