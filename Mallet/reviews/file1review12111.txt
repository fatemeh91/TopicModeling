review/text: I bought this vitamin YESTERDAY and I already feel like a new woman!! I was suffering from the all the pregnancy symptoms and I am limited in the vitamins I can take due to my fish allergies. I stumbled across this brand at Target and I am supplementing with Expecta Lipil plant-based DHA! Before this I was taking a regular multivitamin but it was crappy.Pro's-Within a 30 minutes of taking my stomach started settling and continued to get better throughout the day evening lessening my morning sickness the next morning!-No more uneasy "hangover" stomach feeling that lasts all day-I'm eating less because I don't feel have the "only thing that comforts my stomach is eating more" feeling-I feel better after I eat as well. This vitamin is supposed to help with digestion-I have ENERGY, no more sleeping through the day and I can actually wake up in the morning!!-Headache pain going away. I suffer from headaches and generally take a low-dose antidepressant daily to manage pain, but I stopped when I found out I was pregnant. However, the magnesium and B-vitamins are coming to my rescue!!-I haven't experienced any after taste like some women have reportedCon's (that aren't really cons)-Big pill, HOWEVER it goes down smooth-Neon vitamin pee, but it went away quickly after I started drinking more water-My stool was darkened and a tad bit harder, but I'm not constipated. I'm hoping this won't become a problem
