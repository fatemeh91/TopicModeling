review/text: I'm nursing and I was out of my usual vitamins and I wanted something better, so I ordered these. So far they are fine. I've had them for about a week now. They might be difficult to swallow if you were pregnant and fighting a gag reflex, though. They don't go down that easily since there is no coating to them. They are rough and big. But for me they are fine. I would buy these again.
