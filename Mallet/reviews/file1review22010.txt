review/text: I'm taking flaxseed oil for it's tremendous health benefits. I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe brand over any other because of it's quality and price. The Vitamin Shoppe brand is manufactured by Barlean's. Therefore, it's high quality because it's Barleans but it's cost effective. Basically the same as Barleans just a different package. Anyone who knows about Flaxseed oil will know that the highest quality flaxseed oil is Organic, cold pressed, highest lignan by Barleans. So if you are on a budget and still want the top quality then this brand is for you. Also, I recommend the liquid over the pills because of potency. You get a lot more bang for you buck with the liquid versus the pill. If you don't believe me just compare the labels and you will see! Also, please note that the liquid must be kept refrigerated in this dark bottle because of light and heat effects on the potentcy quality of this product. Personally I just buy from my local Vitamin Shoppe in store but if you don't have one near you order online.
