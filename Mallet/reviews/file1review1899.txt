review/text: Too bad CVS doesn't put this product on their shelves as Savon Drugs once did.I found this soap when Savon Drugs was still around and I gave it a try after reading that it is enriched with "Tea Tree Oil" and is excellent for other body parts as well. Pedifix is right and I cannot agree more with them when they say that it cleans, refreshes, washes away bacteria, and deodorizes the body (especially the feet).I usually wash my face especially near the nose area because this product somehow relieves my sinus problem. I love it when it makes that squeaky sound when I wash it away with water because it means that it's clean. Funga Soap is also great for underarm cleansing as well.***I have extremely sensitive skin and this product is safe for people like moi.
