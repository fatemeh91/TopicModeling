review/text: This is a great trimmer. Didn't know what to get so I read some of the reviews for the different trimmers on Amazon. Was looking for something to replace an old, cheap trimmer I had that had broken. This one is not cheap at all. Seems very sturdy and nice in the hand. Looks and feels like it will last longer that the previous one I had. I've had this for awhile now and have had no problems. It gets the job done. I recommend it.
