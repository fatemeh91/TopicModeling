review/text: Finish Powerball tablets do a wonderful job at cleaning dishes - unlike some of the other tablets or gelpacks out there, they do the job and dissolve completely, leaving the dishes clean and without any spots or residue. For their price, they're a wonderful bargain and the best cleaner. The orange scent is an added bonus, a bit of citrus while the wash cycle is running.
