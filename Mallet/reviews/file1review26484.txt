review/text: Our shower and bathroom sink drains were emptying s-l-o-w-l-y (I was standing in ankle deep water by the time I was done my shower -- BLECH!). We had used the standard drain cleaners before but they would take more than one application, and I really didn't like using such strong chemicals. So this time my husband shopped and he came home with Plumb-Away. I was leery because of the price, but it worked immediately and now we have clear drains! The $10 box is good for 8 uses, so it's WORTH it. We'll probably use it monthly to keep the drains clear. Yay!
