review/text: Purchasing a 5-pack of razors for my Gill...name brand razor costs over 10$. This costs almost half and gives me 10 razors.The best part of these is that I can shave a large swath of my face without taking the razor away to unclog it like I frequently had to do with my *name brand that starts with a G* razor. Those three little blade, while sharp, got clogged up all the time.This is better.
