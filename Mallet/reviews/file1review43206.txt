review/text: About 3 years ago, I did a major bath remodel with a huge ceramic tile and glass block shower (my dream bathroom), and I did not want my shower to ever show soap scum or mildew, so I tried this product, (was using other method products and loved them) and I have never used anything else since. It is great...now, its not going to remove soap scum/mildew that has been building for awhile and is layered up...you are going to have to scrub that and use some elbow grease, but once your shower is clean, this is THE product to use...especially if you did not enjoy the scrubbing and elbow grease part. It will last a long time, (I wish amazon offered the big refill bottle, less plastic waste), and I pray that method never discontinues this product. Its fast, smells great, and is a great value, if used as directed. Oh, I forgot to mention, I owned a professional home cleaning service, and the Method products work better than any of the commercial products I used during the years that I owned this business and cleaned about 20 houses a day.
