review/text: This brush is not going to do all your work for you. You still have to work it into all the crevices you can find, but the vibrations help loosen the stuff that ought not to be there, and they stimulate the gums somewhat. Dentists say you should change your brush after several months. Some of the bristles change color from blue to white when it's time to make the switch.
