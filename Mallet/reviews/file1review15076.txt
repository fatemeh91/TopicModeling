review/text: I am 84 years old and was beginning to have floaters and the world looked foggy. I ordered the original Can C eye drops and used them for about a year and everything cleared up. Recently I switched to Brite eyes and notice a slight irritation when I use them in the morning. However I read clearly without glasses now so I think the product is working. I think the brite eye brand has additional ingredients besides the carnosine. I prefer CanC.
