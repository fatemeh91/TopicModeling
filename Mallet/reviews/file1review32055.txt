review/text: These pens are amazing! I am constantly dropping food on expensive work shirts and ties. A co-worker always had a Tide pen that worked miracles. I finally bought some for myself off of amazon. The only downside is that the liquid in the pen stinks to high heaven... But, it gets out the stains! So I can't complain. Good price on Amazon too!
