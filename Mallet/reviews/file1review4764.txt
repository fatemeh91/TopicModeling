review/text: I have been feeling pretty bloated and had/have immense belly fat, and I read an article about how those who have hypothyroid problems would benefit from taking on amino acids. Have only been doing it for about a month and I must say I have been seeing a change in the belly fat (before it never budged no matter WHAT I did) and my energy level has improved.
