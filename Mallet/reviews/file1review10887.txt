review/text: Based on what others wrote, I ordered one of these. Unfortunately, the medium is so small that it must be for a child or very skinny person who does not have any inflammation.The strap does indeed appear to be well made but the product descriptions do not allow for proper selection of sizes. I assumed that football players would be "large" but maybe these are made for use by children?
