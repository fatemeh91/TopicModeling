review/text: I have used this product for 15 years since our hardwood floors were refinished and the floor guys recommended it. I use it about every other week and especially before entertaining. I use a dust mop type mop and discard the cover after using. (I bought it at Big Lots and the replacements are $3) It is worth every penny and you will be amazed at how great your floors look!
