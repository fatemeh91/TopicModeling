review/text: The Wahl 79524 26-Piece Deluxe Hair Clipper Kit comes with many attachments, a feature that played an important role in my decision to buy this product. The Wahl reputation for quality also influenced my decision. After using the product, I have realized that my expectations have been met - a great purchase. The clippers work really well, and all of the included attachments are a nice bonus. I like to keep my hair longer, so having the 1" attachment has been great.
