review/text: I received the gloves in excellent condition, they fit perfectly, measured as instructed. The best part is they work. I put them on when my fingers are feeling sore and within minutes there is relief. Now if there was a way to get them off easily it would be perfect hahaha. I also use them when I ride my bike, have been having problems with pain in my hands from the handle bars and the gloves are helping. If you don't have a pair get them, it's worth the investment, a very little investment I may add.
