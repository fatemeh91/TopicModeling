review/text: I can really mess up my feet by going barefoot in the summer. So I scrub them down and put lotion on them and add cotton socks and hope for the best. Some products deliver and my feet are nice and soft again within a couple of days. This product, however, is too gentle and that means wearing socks to bed more often in the summer. Yuck. However, it smells nice.Not only is it slow, it is too expensive - you can get a nice foot cream from Avon for a tenth the priceFoot Works By Avon Therapeutic Cracked Heel Relief Cream. Or you can use VaselineVaseline Skin Protectant, Original 13 oz (368 g), which is a miracle drug, right up there with Aspirin. Vaseline will fix my feet in two nights while Dr. Scholl's takes a week.
