review/text: This set of clippers is great. First of all let me say that I am a black man who cuts his hair every two weeks and keeps it very short.My wife and I team up to cut my hair and it comes out fine. The clippers look very attractive and feel very sturdy in my hands. However, they are a little on the heavy side for my wife.We have not had a problem with hair getting pulled or any uneven spots. The only complaint that I have (and this may be more an issue of my hair than the clippers) is that it leaves my edges a little bit higher than the rest of my hair - we have to cut my edges at a lower setting in order for everything to be level.The DVDs that come with the set are pretty lame, but can provide a few minutes of laughter for the family! This kit comes with everything that you could need, a brush to clear loose hairs, an apron, oil, scissors, clips, a few different combs, and a lot of guards for different length cuts.I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to maintain their hair and save money!
