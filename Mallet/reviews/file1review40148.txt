review/text: Great product for the price. Shipped fast. The blocks are strong the mat is sticky and the strap is perfect (even has that sort of weave and heather color that "goes" with yoga). The poster isn't even worth thinking about, but who does yoga from a poster? The bag is cheezy but easy to get your mat in and out of and has room for your blocks and strap. Great product.
