review/text: I purchased this epilator a few weeks ago. I used it the day I got it. Yes, it was a little uncomfortable to begin with, but it is very much worth the discomfort. I have had to use it a couple of time, because I found that I missed a few spots, and its great. I also used it on my arm pits, and I have never felt so good about wearing a sleeveless shirt as I do now. It is as clear as ever. I absoulty love this product, and would highly recommend it.
