review/text: This product is perfect for anyone allergic to shellfish. It says on the back of the bottle that it contains "no shellfish". I did notice a difference in 5 days. The pain in my hips and feet seemed to subside and I'm not in as much pain when I get out of bed in the morning. I'm 36 and have worked on concrete floors for 15 years. For some reason I'm having a hard time finding this particular supplement in stores now, which is a shame because everyone can't take the other products for joint relief that seem to be so readily available. Thanks Amazon.
