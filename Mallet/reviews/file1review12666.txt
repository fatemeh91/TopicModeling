review/text: This mixes really easily with cold water or juice.The flavor is interesting, but not unpleasant. Sort of a light milky taste with a splash of citrus. The flavor is very light and easily covered up. My very picky 2 year old isn't a fan of the flavor of it in water, but a splash of juice makes it acceptable to her.
