review/text: For any product to actually make a difference in my physical well-being, I most certainly feel I owe a review. The actual ingredients would be good for anyone, but particularly helpful for one with low energy problems and difficulty eating all the fruit and vegetable servings recommended in our Food Pyramid (which I DO believe in). Also I am super caffeine sensitive and was relieved that the small amount of it in the green tea component didn't phase me in the least, i.e. no shakes. In total I simply have more energy that feels organic and am also calm because I feel better!
