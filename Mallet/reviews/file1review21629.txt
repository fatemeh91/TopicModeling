review/text: The Snug Tub was one of the best items we've bought for our baby. He is now sitting up, and too big for the infant bath tub. But, he is also too small for our large adult tub. He would constantly jump around in our tub and bump his head. It was very difficult to control &amp; bathe him at the same time. The Snug Tub has helped us tremendously. We are now able to bathe our baby without fear of him hitting his head. The suction cup makes it very stable &amp; the built-in drain makes clean up very easy. I definitely recommend this tub!
