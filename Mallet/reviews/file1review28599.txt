review/text: ON Whey Gold Standard has been recommended by everybody I've read. I've been buying it from Amazon for about a year now. Rocky Road > Double Chocolate > Cookies n' CreamThe only complaint is the scoop usually comes buried somewhere in the middle, but it's a problem with all the other brands. I just reuse the one from previous batch.
