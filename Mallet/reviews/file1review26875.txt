review/text: I've used this product for years. A little cold water from my Britta, a blender and 30 seconds and I'm getting a quick, balanced and healthy meal. Its now part of my every day regimen.I'm surprised that others that I've recommended this product to for a part of an 'Earthquake Emergency Kit' have also picked it up as part of their daily diet.Not chalky or chemical tasting it goes down as smooth as chocolate milk.
