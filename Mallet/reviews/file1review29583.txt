review/text: I purchased the Excel Dri-Sleeper for my son who is almost 8 years old. The bed wetting was so severe, that I had to put him in two pull-ups at night. This was becoming very costly, so I decided to take a leap of faith and try the alarm. Within 3 weeks of using this product, my son sleeps through the night without wetting the bed, and does not require a pull-up OR the use of the alarm anymore. We were consistant and followed the instructions, and were amazed with the results. My son is very proud to go to sleep in underwear at night, and to wake up dry in the morning. I highly recommend this product, it is worth every cent!!! When I think of the money I will be saving on pull-ups, and the relief of not having to wash blankets every day - I do not regret for a moment buying the Dri-Sleeper alarm, and wish I had known about this solution years ago.
