review/text: I bought this bubble bath for my four-year-old son. Because it is natural you have to agitate the water to make a lot of bubbles. My son uses a wire whisk to do this and has a blast doing it. Also, it comes with a bubble wand so I blow bubbles into the bath and my son loves it! They smell fantastic! I love this product.
