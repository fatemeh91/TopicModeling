review/text: Vanilla ice cream taste really good. I use a blender bottle with a ball whisk so it mixes things really easy. Before that blender bottle I was just using an aquafina water bottle with a wide mouth. That did the job as well. I get no clumps and I make no funny faces when drinking it like other protein powders have done.
