review/text: Good, clear sound. Seems to be well made. The limited lifetime warranty is amusing--the tubing, the earpieces, the diaphram are all not included. What's left? But it does the job and my previous stethoscope, admittedly considerably less expensive, lasted more than 15 years of light duty, so I can expect at least the same from this one.
