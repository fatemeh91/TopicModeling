review/text: These Latex gloves are the best out there. I have tried many different gloves as an auto technician, but find that these are the only gloves I will buy or wear anymore. They fit very well and are more durable and flexible than other gloves and also give a better feel to work with. I re-use these often more than once a pair and have seen people say that they are hard to turn from inside out. Just push the biggest part into the glove and blow into the cuff and you're ready to go again. Absolutely the best you can buy!
