review/text: I am so happy with this mask! It is incredibly soft and conforms to my face as soon as I put it on. I never used a sleep mask before, but I just moved into a loft apartment where the rooftop windows in the bedroom let the sun peek in as soon as it rises, and the blinds only do so much. I can now sleep in peace knowing that I won't get awoken any earlier than I already have to get up!My only concern is the placement of the straps on my head. I have been playing around with where they lay for the past few nights, and it seems like a learning process to find the right spot (above the ears? over the ears? under a ponytail?). Once I figure it out I am sure it will be even better than it already is! :o)
