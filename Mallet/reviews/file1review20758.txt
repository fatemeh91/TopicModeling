review/text: This shaver cleans very easily, looks nice and keeps your sink clean. However, it just doesn't cut close enough for me, particularly on the throat area. I have never found an electric razor that even got anywhere near as close as a blade and this is no exception. I could get it pretty damn close on my face by repeatedly jamming the razor against my face, but it would take a long time to do this. As far as the hair on my throat, there was no way at all to cut that anywhere near as close as I would have wanted. This might be the best of the few electric shavers that I tried, but still disappointing.
