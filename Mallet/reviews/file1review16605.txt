review/text: I got this lighter as a x-mas present for myself and just for the heck of it. It works great except that the flintlock keeps sticking and after about two week the flint broke off. I guess that's why they sell extras. Anyway i got it at wal-mart for about the same price but if i had seen it on Amazon, i would have jumped on it.
