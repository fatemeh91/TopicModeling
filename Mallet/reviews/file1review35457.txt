review/text: Looking after my grandchilren in Hawaii in an area with VERY hard water, I thought the dishwasher was broken, it did such a poor job. Went on line read about Dishwasher Magic. It is amazing. It's as though we have a new dishwasher, which is what I thought we needed before trying Dishwasher Magic.
