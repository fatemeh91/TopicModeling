review/text: A classic AS at an incredibly reasonable price. No complaints here. Smells great for hours and attracts women like a magnet. It's a great aroma out of the bottle but gets even better once it's on your face, and I personally believe that's the alluring magic of this stuff when it settles onto a guy's face. I use it every day after shaving. Also use Lectric Shave "Fresh" gel before shaving. These products go great together. Lectric Shave pre-electric gel gives the closest electric shave you can get -- and I mean once your face is used to an electric shaver, the Lectric Shave gel gets it as close as a blade shave, maybe even closer and definitely faster with no skin rash or irritation. My daily regimen starts with Lectric Shave gel, then a shave with the best of the electrics at a great price: the Braun foil (I have the 5885), then Aqua Velva. Nothing better or more soothing to the skin than AV regardless of price and I've tried them all.
