review/text: I was looking for a product similar to the dry disposable wipes that were available for use in the hospital when I delivered my son; those were firm but VERY soft, and you had to wet them yourself with water. This product is very simiar to that (just a tad smaller than what we had in the hospital). I like the size of these though, as they're smaller in size than what we had in the hospital; the hospital's size seemed wasteful. My only complaint is that there are only 24 of these to a box, and I don't see that a larger size is offered. So for them to market these for use with infants (as shown on the box, besides its name), it's incredulous to only offer 24 in a box. (For instance, my infant son goes through sometimes 12 diapers a day!) Thus, this is an expensive product for what it is.
