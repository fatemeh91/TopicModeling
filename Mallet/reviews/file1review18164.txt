review/text: This sleep mask is the best I have encountered, and I had tried 7 different brands before I found the Bucky 40 Blinks. It has the bubbled out eyes, which are a must for me. It keeps my eyelashes from touching the mask, which is very important, especially during REM sleep when your eyes dance about in your head and your eyelashes rub against other flat lying sleep masks. For my face, it blocks out all light. Only 1 other mask gave me this kind of coverage. I realize everyones face is different. I have chubby cheeks and a wide nose, and it seals up all the gaps.I did experience the problem with the back piece of fabric separating from the padding after about 6 months of use. Fearing it was out of warranty, I contacted bucky customer support through their website. A really helpful customer service rep named Cynthia got right back to me via email, told me that they had improved the adhesive used to attach the fabrics, and would send me a new mask free of charge. She also asked if I used any lotions or makeup with the mask so they could do more research on their end and make further improvements down the road. The new replacement mask is now on it's way via fedex. You just don't see this kind of customer service these days, and I wanted to acknowledge that here in a public forum.I will report back after a few weeks with the new mask, but overall I am very pleased with both the product and the company's customer service. This is now the only sleep mask for me.
