review/text: I've been using disposable nursing bra pads but they were uncomfortable and lumpy so I tried these cotton ones instead. I REALLY liked them and they were certainly much more comfortable than the disposables. They do leak though so I only use these around the house and while sleeping. So..comfort is a 5 star for sure. But, better stick with the super soaker uppers during the day.
