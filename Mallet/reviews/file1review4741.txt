review/text: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ! I GOT THE PRODUCT AND IT WAS A MESS! FIRST, THE WAY IT LOOK WAS VERY OLD AND THE LABEL WAS FALLING APART! SECOND THE EXPIRATION DATE WAS SCRATCH OFF ON THE SIDE AND UNDER THE PRODUCT IN THE BOTTOM IT WAS WIPED OFF! IT WAS SO SUSPICIOUS BUT, UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE EXPIRATION DATE I AUTOMATICALLY JUST OPEN A LITTLE AT THE TOP TO CHECK IF IT WAS REALLY COOKIES AND CREAM! IT WAS BUT, I DO NOT TRUST IT AT ALL WHY WAS IT WIPED OFF AND SCRATCH OFF? SOMETHING FISHY OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING! NEVER GOING TO BUY FROM THE SELLER AGAIN! IF I COULD RETURN THIS ITEM IT WILL BE WONDER!
