review/text: Received my order on time; no problem with delivery. I do wish, though, that for all health products, the label info would be printed online, including ingredients and warnings. This was my first time ordering this product (to help with the absorption of iron), and had I known that there was a warning for people who've had kidney stones, I wouldn't have ordered it. Kind of a hassle to return it and not sure they would take it, since I opened it.
