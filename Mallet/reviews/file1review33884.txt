review/text: I am going to start nursing school this summer and I needed a good quality stethoscope, but didn't want to pay the money for a Littmann. After reading the other reviews for this one I decided to go with it. I'm glad I did! It is very good quality and the sound is crystal clear. Be sure to read to instructions first though, I made that mistake! I haven't used it in a real situation yet, but I am very happy with my purchase!
