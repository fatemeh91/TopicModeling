review/text: I can't say how this would work for everyone, but this definitely works for us! I try to keep this on hand, particularly in cold and flu season. Anytime one of us starts to feel the least little bit of symptoms, I give them a dose, followed up before bed time with another dose. If we catch it soon enough, that seems to take care of it for us without having to take any more. For those times when we catch it too late, I think this stuff does work to minimize the symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness. My children love the taste and find the tiny containers fun. They say it is the best part of getting sick. There are no side affects, and I have recommmended it many times to our friends. This particular box is a very good deal!
