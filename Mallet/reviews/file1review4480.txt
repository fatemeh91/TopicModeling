review/text: My husband has a thick beard and sensitive skin. He says of all the razors he's tried, these give him the best shave. However, for a military family on a tight budget, the blades are too expensive to replace as often as necessary. He's lucky to get two uses out of each blade. So.... great razor, but not quite good enough to justify the cost.
