review/text: I bought this as a replacement for my Jason 25000U Vit E cream, and was very pleasantly surprised. The smell can be strong at first, but it fades quickly and I find it very fresh, reminiscent of cucumbers. The cream is full bodied, but soaks into my skin well rather than staying on the surface as a greasy coating like so many other creams do. I've only been using it a few days, but my skin doesn't feel tight or dry anymore and my fine lines are starting to plump in again. Great product!
