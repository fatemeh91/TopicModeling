review/text: I loved this until the plastic pieces started breaking off. The plastic screw caps on the top broke off after about a year of light use (2-3x a week for 15 mins). When the screw caps broke off, the whole plate lifted and vibrated noisily and exposed the electronics underneath. It seemed too dangerous to use after that and had to be discarded. Needless to say I am disappointed with the quality.
