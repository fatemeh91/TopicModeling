review/text: This razor is great for men AND women. It provides a close shave and you can use it several times on your legs or face before it gets dull. Compared to the pricier razors, I think this one works just as well; there's no need to buy a more expensive one. In fact, I've found that the store brand knock-offs of this razor work just as well.
