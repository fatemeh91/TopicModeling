review/text: I've been taking this product for a number of years. In the past I've taken the tablet version. This is first my experience with the capsule. I don't have a whole lot of technical info to spill out expect to say that with a balanced diet, eating natural/organic foods, exercise, and taking a number of homeopathic supplements along with this Wellness Formula, I can count on one hand the amount of times I've gotten sick in the last 5 years.Additionally, Amazon is the place to get this product. The price is usually half as much as and/or the quantity is twice as much. I got the largest bottle at 240 tablets which ran slightly over twenty bucks but at a whole foods type place, the bottle would be more than twice as much, maybe close to fifty bucks. So get this product, exercise, avoid artificial junk in your foods, and you should be well on your way to mainting optimum health!
