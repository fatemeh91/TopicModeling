review/text: It didn't work for me. I wanted to, I expected it to, but it just didn't. Before I first used this product, I stayed away from using aluminum deodorant for almost one month. I applied this to myunderarm, it gave off a not so good odor. It made me sweat, and sweat mixed with this product is hell. But still I decided to give it one more chance. I used this for more almost 2 months, noting really happened. I guess this is one of the products that is not meant for me. After all this, I have never used any anti-perspirant/deodorant at all. I just sometimes rub alcohol or Purell on my underarms when I know I started to sweat. That kinda worked for me, and Im sticking to it.
