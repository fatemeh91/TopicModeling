review/text: after years of using different products & nothing would work until now, this Handy manum cream worked like a miracle. I bought this cream for my dad, who has been working in construction for over 20 yrs & never have I seen his hands in such great condition., his hands usually looked cracked & would feel like sand paper so rough & ordinary but after a small amount of this cream applied in his hands surely made a difference. If you have very dry/cracked skin I truly recommend this product.
