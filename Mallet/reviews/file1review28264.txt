review/text: I've started weight training lately and noticed I've been lacking in protein intake. I don't really like milk and I didn't want to quit eating my oats for breakfast so I decided to throw it in my oatmeal (and I also add crushed Shredded Wheat to help thicken up the texture and for extra fiber)! I eat my oatmeal with water and I've gotta say it taste awesome :) It also tastes like hot cocoa if you shake it up with hot water. Highly recommend this product--it taste awesome and is worth every cent :)
