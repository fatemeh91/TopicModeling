review/text: Had serious mouse problem in kitchen & basement for months. Couldn't get rid of them. Reluctantly bought this product but hopeful it would really work.Placed in hallway in the basement. Directions state it may not be effective through walls so opened all doors in basement. Haven't heard or seen a mouse since. No spiders either. Myself, husband, son's, can't hear anything, and dogs are unaffected. However, my son's girlfriend can hear it and drives her crazy when she goes downstairs. That's the only drawback. I just unplug it when she is here.
