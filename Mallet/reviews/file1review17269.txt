review/text: Overall I'm very happy with this trimmer. The blades stayed sharp for the 2 years I've had it and it was very comfortable to use. The only con is the battery lost it's charge after about 2 years of use. It cannot even operate for more than a few minutes at this point. I got 2 years out of it and the price is cheap for a trimmer so that's why I gave it 4 stars.
