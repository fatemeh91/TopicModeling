review/text: I wear a size 8.5B with a medium low arch and have purchased professionally made orthotics for 20 years for arch support. These walkfit insoles are terribly uncomfortable. The interchangeable arch (low, med, high) are too far forward. I can't imagine anyone having an arch close to the ball of the foot. Forget trying to get your money back from the manufacture for it is too much of a hassle.
