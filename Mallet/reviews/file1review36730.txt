review/text: I bought this Vit C chewable as I cannot swallow pillsIt has a great taste and it is so easy to just let them melt in your mouthThe price is very good for the quantity and comes in a different variety of flavorsI especially like it as it does not have a lot of unnecessary additivesThe only thing I am suggesting is the sugar , dextrose , fructose ??? you have enough sugar from the fruit extract , I don't think we need more addedOtherwise good value .
