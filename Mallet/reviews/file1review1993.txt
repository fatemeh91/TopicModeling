review/text: These bibs are the greatest. I used to wash so many bibs andall were getting stained. I use these for Breakfast, lunch & dinner. I save the cloth bibs for drool which is a constant thing. Now that baby is eating pieces of food the pocket catches the food. These are great for going out to eat too. YOu don't have to put a dirty bib back in your bag.
