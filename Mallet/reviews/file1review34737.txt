review/text: This natural herbal deodorant is the best I've tried among all of the algae, tea-tree, and herbal underarm deodorants. I speak as someone who is intensely allergic to the alumnimum oxide substance that most deodorants use; it gives me a raging rash after about 2 day's use.Aubrey's by contrast has no irritation, and the strong initial pine scent fades within minutes; so no one will think you smell like a pine tree. Kudos also because it does not stain clothing. Only drawback is that it is not also an antiperspirant. (I didn't downgrade the review because of this, since it's clearly marked as a *deodorant*.)Therefore if you have a meeting or interview where you positively cannot show that you are sweating, I'll have to refer you back to the aluminum, and take your chances with a rash!
