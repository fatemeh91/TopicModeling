review/text: I bought this last year for non professional use and wonder why we never had a massage on a professional table like this one before. The table heats up quickly, is built with solid construction and is very comfortable. The portable carrying case, that came with it, makes moving the table very easy and is very durable. This table is really nice quality all around. I purchased it last year on Amazon for less that the current advertised price ( I think it was $320). I'm not sure why it costs more this year, but it may be worth the cost buying it here as the shipping was free and fast too.
