review/text: Exactly what you need if you're looking for protein powder. Tastes better than regular chocolate shakes if you make a shake out of it; peanut butter, a scoop of this, milk and bananas and it tastes 100x than a high sugar milkshake. I haven't tried any other flavor other than the double chocolate so I don't have much to compare to, but it does taste just fine in regular water too. Dissolved just fine in water as well. 70 servings for 40 dollars, can't go wrong with that! I've been buying them every month now, have two shakes a day. Works out fantastic!
