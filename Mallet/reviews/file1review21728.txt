review/text: My 16 month old loves taking baths in this tub. It has eased her transition from the infant tub. It's very easy to use and clean.My only issue is that it doesn't fit all that well in my small bathtub, but I can still kind of jam it in without risk of damaging it.I love that I can fill it up and not waste water.
