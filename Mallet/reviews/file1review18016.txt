review/text: I have the other Bucky eye mask that comes with earplugs and is made of a velour type material and I love it! I recommend it to everyone I know! Because of that, I thought this one would also be great for the warmer months. It was great for the first month until it started falling apart. The liner between your eyes and the foam started coming unglued gradually until it was almost completely unglued. Today I went and bought some spray adhesive to try to get a couple more months out of the mask but it is hard to spray the adhesive because the liner is sewn at two points so you have to try to get the spray between the two layers. It isn't worth the trouble. Next time it falls apart, it will go in the garbage. I do not recommend this item and would appreciate any recommendations for similar lightweight sleep masks that are more durable.
