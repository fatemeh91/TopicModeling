review/text: A friend gave oscillo to me when in the midst of winter I started to develop a cold, just when I needed it the least. And in contrast to my &quot;better&quot; knowledge ( I am a scientist and critical by nature...)I chose the easy way and just took it. 3 ampullae were enough to make me feel good enough to complete some important experiments in my lab with minor problems only. Meanwhile most of my colleagues were gone home or sent home and stayed in bed. A similar story happened at 2 more flu seasons to me and, as I can only confirm, always to my own surprise, since usually my immune system is not the strongest, either.It is hard to comprehend how oscillo works (that's why I only gave 4 stars) and I decided not to ask anymore. Somehow it seems to help the organism to heal by itself. The lack of scientific explanation, specifically the diluiton issue is a major problem with all homeopathic medicines. However medical doctors start more and more to offer them to patients, just because they see them work. They are no wonder drugs, of course. Not every one works with everybody, just as not every conventional medicine works with everybody, either.In my case oscillo works with me and that's why I will take it again.
