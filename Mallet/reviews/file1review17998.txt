review/text: With this item my GF finally gave me head, and she actually salivated more like I intended. This lube did the job flawlessly with the exception that it burned her vaginally. She has sensitive skin so the only use now is oral. The tastes are off at first, but as it mixes with your saliva it becomes better. It should be a three star in my case, but I know that if my GF wasn't sensitive it would be 4. Not disappointed with my purchase, but I still remain undecided as to whether or not to buy this product again. Will explore other natural lubes before buying again.
