review/text: This is an awesome shaver! I'm new to the true "wet shaving" process, and am hooked. I've been spending tons on the latest multi blade refills for years, roughly 2-3 bucks a refill!!! You'll need to commit to some time.... my first shave took me almost 10 minutes and I had several nics(this is more about my inexperience, and less about the shaver/blade!) The shaver has a nice balance and is easy to handle. I highly recommend it. Get a good badger hair shave brush and soap for the total experience! After shave is a must, and a good moisturizer afterwords makes you feel like you just left the barber shop. You can keep your Gilette Mach 24 vibrating, moisturizing, battery operated, turbo charged, multi-colored, shaver with replacement blades that cost more than a happy hour beer! I'm going old school... and this is a great shaver to do it with! Wait til the first time your lady friend feels the new shave and comments on your smoothness..... you'll be hooked too!
