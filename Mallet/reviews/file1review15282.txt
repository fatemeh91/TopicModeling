review/text: I had tried a bunch of different flavors of different brands. These are among the best tasting tasting energy bars out there. I also compared the nutrition facts of many. Again, these are among the best. I highly recommend them. I use them as a snack in between meals. I try my best to stick with eating every 3 hours to keep my metabolism working at full speed throughout the day. These have a low enough calorie count to work for that purpose. I don't use them as a meal replacement.They arrived in a very timely manner. The only flavor that tops this one is the s'mores by balance bars as well.
