review/text: Rarely am I this against a beauty product. The problem with this isn't that it didn't work, but it made all of the skin on my underarms crack. A friend and I both decided to give this deodorant a try as we thought that a 48 hour deodorant must offer quite a lot of protection. But after about a week of using it I realized that this massive gash was going across the middle of my arm pit which was really painful and looked just awful! I was really shocked and assumed it must have been my bra or something. But then I found that my friend who had also bought the deodorant had the same thing happening on her underarms. I understand that this was my personal reaction to Mitchum and therefore this review does not stand for everyone, I just think that the fact it happened to both me and my friend means that it must be a relatively common complaint.
