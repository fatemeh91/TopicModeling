review/text: I picked this up to use as a cooling foot soak, and when I read on the bottle that it can be used as a body wash I tried it.After spending nearly 35 years struggling with a skin rash that did not respond to dermatologists' treatments, I found this product began to heal my rash the first time! I was so excited that I continued using it on the areas with the rash and it compeletely went away. When I ran out, I didn't get a new bottle right away, and the rash reappeared! I immediately purchased another bottle, and the rash went away as it had the first time.Based on my experience and reading those of other reviewers, I have to say that this is truly the most versatile product I have ever used!
