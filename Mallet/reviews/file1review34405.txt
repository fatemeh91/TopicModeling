review/text: First off, I use this item differently than other reviewers--this is my new favorite for all-around use as a lubricant because I can use it without fear of disintegrating polystyrene and polycarbonate. Great on Rubik's Cubes, and when applied on a Q-tip (or transferred to an engineer's lubricant-applying pen), is a lot more accurate than a spray. One of the best lubes for plastic parts. Doesn't attract gunk like oil-based lubes. Never gets sticky is right--it's a bit hard to wash off your hands (no more than two washings with soap will get rid of all the lube).Major con though, is the bottle design. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to prevent the side of the bottle from getting lubed up. I'll keep the bottle upright all the time except when dispensing, and the sides of the bottle still are slick. Once, when moving, the bottle tipped over, and spilled EVERYWHERE, leaving a terrible slick. BTW, this stuff is AMAZINGLY dangerous when spilled. The bottle design makes the bottle leak around the screw part of the bottle, and the top is also very leak prone. I'd find a way to relocate the product after purchasing it. Not sure if there's any silicone-safe soap-style dispensers though. Leave recommendations in the comments, if you wish.
