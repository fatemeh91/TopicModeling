review/text: I got mixed results with this product. It works well if you apply it constantly (5+ times a day)...(by "works" I mean, eliminate a cold sore or an outbreak). BUT if you use it a lot, it drys the crap out of your skin. That really sucked, and looked as bad, or worse then the cold sore I blocked. I'd consider this product, but I don't think it's the best.
