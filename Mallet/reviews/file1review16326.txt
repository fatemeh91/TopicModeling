review/text: I usually use either Finish Quantum tabs or Ecover tablets. I tried these, worrying about the scent... who wants orange-smelling dishes? I really don't want my dishes to smell nor do I want my dishwasher to act like an air freshener in the kitchen. Thankfully the mild "orange Tang" scent doesn't escape from the machine and doesn't scent the dishes... which makes me ask - why any scent at all?On to performance... excellent. Tackled dried on food (scraped not rinsed) well. Most detergents do a good job of that now.Finally, the wrapper... Finish Quantum tabs have a wrapper that dissolves in the wash... so no taking the wrapper off. I much prefer that system! But I think these are much less expensive than the Quantum tabs and these do an excellent job.Hope this helps!
