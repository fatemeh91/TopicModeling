review/text: This sleep mask is more comfortable than another I've been using, even though the other is molded also. The Bucky seems not to fray along the edges as much, and the cutout for the nose allows the pressure of the elastic to be supported by the eye sockets and keep the mask from slipping around. Seems to be a good product.
