review/text: This cream is good. I usually don't use creams, but I have been bicycling a lot lately and have really sore wrists and elbows. I take epsom salt baths and they help a little. This pain relief cream works pretty well. I had aching elbows and wrists and put some on and now I am pretty much back to normal. It does burn though when it's working, so if you have really sensetive skin, I would search for something else. I have sensetive skin, but I can tolerate it good enough.
