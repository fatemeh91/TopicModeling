review/text: I am a true believer in RESCUE REMEDY! It is most dramatic in very high stress situations and emergencies, but is also helpful before a test or when driving under stressful conditions. VERY good for post traumatic stress in humans and animals.I usually use the liquid in the bottle, but the spray is more convenient on the go. I also use the individual Bach Flower Remedies for specific negative emotions and states of mind.
