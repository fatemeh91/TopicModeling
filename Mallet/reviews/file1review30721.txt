review/text: Got the Merkur 178, a badger brush and Proraso shave cream and I am not looking back.I exclusively used cartridge shavers for years and the Merkur shaving experience is a REVELATION.Good bye cartridges, forever!I think younger men have to read a few articles on " how to shave" then take the Merkur in hand with confidence. Sadly, too few dads and grand dads have taught us how to shave properly so discovering this type of shaving is unnecessarily scary but don't fear , just enjoy and be giddy with the results.Now I actually look forward to shaving , thats a first for me.
