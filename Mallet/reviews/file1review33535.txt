review/text: I had a Waterpik many years ago and it was a very good product. After many years of service it died. When I went shopping to replace it I decided to save a few bucks and buy a cheaper competitor. BIG MISTAKE ! The competitor did not hold enough water to adequately flush out the deposits without having to refill it nor did it have the power the Waterpik's have. It got returned and I got the WP-65 and am happy again. You would be surprised by the amount of debris that is hiding at your gum line that brushing (even power brushing) can't remove. You also gain the benefit of having your gums massaged by the pulsating action. Your dental hygene is not complete until you have finished up with the WaterPik...
