review/text: I really, really wanted this to work great, since I am both a klutz who spills stuff on herself and a mom. So far I've used it on:1. Tomato sauce - works perfectly if you catch it right away, so-so after the stain has started to set (5-10 minutes)2. Chocolate icing - lightened the stain, but was still clearly there.3. Baby spit-up - totally gone, but that's an easy one.4. Soda - worked perfectly5. Red food coloring - smaller dots totally gone, larger dot got smeared and became a nice big light pink spot, instead of a dark red medium spot :) but food coloring's always badI'm pretty happy with this, it works very well as long as you get to the stain immediately (meaning you notice it when you spill it!) and I will keep one in my purse and one in the diaper bag.
