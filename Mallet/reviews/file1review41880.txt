review/text: the Oral-B Triumph 9400 toothbrush actually gets my teeth cleaner than either the wal-mart special it replaced or the Oral-B I had for about 6 years. I'm guessing that the little yellow cup in the middle of the brush is responsible for the difference, but whatever it is, my mouth feels remarkably clean, my teeth are whiter and my dental hygienist is impressed with my home care. The earlier negative reviews struck me as written by folks who hadn't read the directions. You simply tab through the different cycles until you have the one you want--I like the power polisher--THEN install the brush head, add toothpaste, insert in mouth and push the on button.....and aw-a-a-a-y we go. The charge doesn't last me two weeks, but then I like to brush at least 4 minutes twice daily. The timer and the battery indicator are both worthwhile. It is pricey, but then how many sets of teeth will you have in your life.
