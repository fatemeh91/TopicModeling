review/text: At first I wasn't sure about the whole patch thing but now i'm glad i did. i did notice that the patch works better on my upper arms / shoulder. I don't smell funky anymore & I didn't get bronchitis this winter. I used the patch longer than recomended. But I made sure my doctor was aware. The long run it's cheaper than cigs, your lungs are much happier & people won't smell you before walking into a room
