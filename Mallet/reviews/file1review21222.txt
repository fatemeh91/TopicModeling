review/text: I had been using the Oral B battery toothbrush for a year. It is my 40th birthday and I wanted something to treat myself so I bought this tooth brush. It is the same as the Oral B S-320 but without the massage feature, which is not necassary at all and it was only $79.99 which is the best price for a rechargable toothbrush. I have not had my teeth cleaned in two years (oops) and thought of doing so, but it costs $80 so I decided to try this tooth brush as see if it felt like going to get my teeth cleaned. I really believe it feels just as good as getting my teeth cleaned! It is quite strong and you must get used to the strong vibration inside your mouth, but it is very effective. My teeth felt smooth as glass and I really enjoyed using it. I now feel so invested in my teeth and keeping my mouth healthy that I will go get my teeth cleaned. This tooth brush will clean your teeth much better then the battery powered Oral B tooth brushes and so much better then a hand held tooth brush. I love it and and so happy I bought it and I feel I got a good deal on this model for $79.99. You will not be disappointed.
