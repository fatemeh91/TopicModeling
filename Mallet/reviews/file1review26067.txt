review/text: When we first got home from the hospital with our new born baby girl, I started using pampers sensitive wipes. Eventhough they are free of scent and some chemicals , my baby got a rash within 2 days. The pediatrician said most likely it was due to the wipes. I read about using paper towels, but was hesitant about it too. My neighbor recommended the Curity Sponges which turned out to be perfect. She had been using them with her baby for over a year avoiding rashes altogether. Just use some water and they are ready to use. I find they have the perfect thickness, softness and size, and best of all they are natural cotton pads.They are much more expensive than a box of wipes- any brand available- but to me, at least for the first 6 months when baby skin is so delicate, it's worth to spend the 8 cents per wipe it costs. I first order a pack of 100 to try them and then jumped up to the box of 300. Last time I bought the pack of 2000 ct to save in shipping. The only thing though, because it ships from a third party it could take a little over a week to get them. So while you wait, cut up some Bounty paper towels and use with water.
