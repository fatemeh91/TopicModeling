review/text: GLUCERNA MEAL BARS for PEOPLE with DIABETES: CHOCOLATE CHUNKA great pick-me-up snack for a hungry diabetic. I control my weight and do not indulge in off-diet treats. These bars help me both physically and mentally by providing a tasty ALLOWED indulgence.I try never to be without them!Buying them through Amazon is both economical and a snap!
