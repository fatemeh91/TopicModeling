review/text: This is a great product for anyone working out, whether you're bulking or not. I myself just maintain my weight so I only use half a serving after my workout but it just lasts longer that way. The high quality protein and carbs digest quickly to make sure you get all of the nutrients immediately after your workout when your muscles are most receptive. This does have a good amount of carbs so it should be taken as a postworkout since the carbs are from maltodextrin and will cause an insulin spike, only beneficial postworkout. It will give great results. I've been taking it for almost a year now, and have used it through both bulking and cutting cycles. It works great for both.
