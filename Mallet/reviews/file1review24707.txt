review/text: Bought this to try and fight the summer drought and two things really stand out. First, this sprinkler is heavier than others, so it doesn't move under the water pressure or if there is a breeze. Second, it is of a higher quality construction overall, and the nozzles fire the water farther than other oscillating sprinklers I've purchased. Same hose, same house, same water pressure, better results with this sprinkler.
