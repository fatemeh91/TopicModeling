review/text: I must say I was a doubter at first, but decided to try it and after a couple of uses I am extremely happy with the purchase. I only wish I had it at least 10 years earlier as I am 49!! I have struggled my entire life with almost extreme premature ejaculation and didn't know how much to use when I first tried this product(I had to find it first as it got hidden in my closet) but soon found out you need to give it at least a couple minutes to work properly. You will actually feel a warm feeling especially if you have on underwear. 10 minutes is even more ideal and I would recommend at least 4 sprays and make sure you get it applied all over, you get like 5 boxes with your order so hopefully it will last a while, but if you are a doubter like I was don't be as this stuff is the real deal and would recommend highly to anybody who has struggled with this problem their entire adult life. My wife is extremely happy with this product as well.
