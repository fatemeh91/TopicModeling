review/text: I began a workout program, including weight training, about 3 years ago (at age 62!) and reached a plateau as to what I could accomplish. I then tried L-Arginine and it has allowed me to go further and produce better results. Stronger pumping with more weight and higher reps. I highly recommend it to anyone. As for the taste, that has been known to be a problem for most people, including myself. What I have done, now every day for over a year, is to mix it with lemonade powder, or berry-pomegranate juice powder, half and half with pure orange juice. Since then, no problem with taste! I take it every morning on an empty stomach. Good luck with your workouts and enjoy!
