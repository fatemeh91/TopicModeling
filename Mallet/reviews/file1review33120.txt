review/text: Been taking this for several years now, and the number and severity of colds has greatly diminished. The trick is to get started at the first sign of symptoms, or even sooner if you know you've been exposed by a snotty nosed person. I find that I don't need to take the amount prescribed, cutting back to a couple of capsules every few hours seems to do the trick for me. Worth their weight in gold!
