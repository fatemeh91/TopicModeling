review/text: Optimum Nutrition makes a great Whet product. I started with the chocolate. Excellent flavor and mixes very well in blender bottle with milk. No bubbles. I then tried cookies n cream flavor and I can honestly say I hold my nose when drinking it. I'm horrified I still have 4lbs of it to go through as I won't waste it. Not only does it taste rancid it doesn't mix well in blender bottle with milk. Leaves a large layer of bubbles. So just get the chocolate.
