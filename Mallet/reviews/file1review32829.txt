review/text: Having a daily Slimfast shake in addition to small meals and NO snacking has helped me lose 16 lb in 45 days. My shake consists of the powder, sweet n low to taste, cinnamon and a taste of instant coffee. I add 16 oz of skim milk and two handfuls of ice. Mix to a smoothie and you'll have a rib filling 32 oz shake for under 300 calories. Don't forget to exercise daily!
