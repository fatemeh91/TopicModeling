review/text: I don't know why sectioned food containers are so hard to find, but they are. The rubberized lid containers of other branks shrink in the dishwasher and then don't fit. These are the thickness of the disposable food containers but they serve their purpose of separating breakfast. lunch and dinner items you don't want mixed together.
