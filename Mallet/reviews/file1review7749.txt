review/text: And I did so not because there's anything wrong with the one I bought a month ago but because I want a back-up, just in case. That's how much I like this brush. Before, I was using this brand's palm brush to scrape and clean dishes and pans. But I much prefer this handled brush. Great product that I hope is never discontinued.ETA: I just happened to have read a comment to one of the other reviews in which the person mentioned that one can put this brush in the microwave for a minute to sanitize it. I used to sanitize sponges that way, so I thought I'd give it a try, even though I wondered about the plastic handle on this brush. As I did with sponges, I made sure the brush was wet and put it for one minute.After ten seconds, I saw smoke and smelled a burnt smell. I turned it off and removed the brush. So I do NOT recommend sanitizing the brush in the microwave. I will continue to run a dishwasher cycle to clean the brush and sponges.
