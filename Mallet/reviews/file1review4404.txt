review/text: I think just about anyone that gets around to trying the Gillette fusion finds it the best they have ever used. I got mine as a Christmas Present 2 years ago. It took me just over 4 months to use the three cartridges that came with it. There is no downside. It was both the best shave, as well as the most economical one I had ever experienced. I admit that I was a little taken back by the cost when I finally ventured out in the spring to buy some replacements. Around here they either lock them away in some little Fort Knox in the store, or even enclose them in security boxes that sound an alarm if you try to open it or run out the door. I can only imagine that too many men, (and some women too) have considered larceny over cheaper blades if they can't afford the fusions. The fusion cartridges may be a little steep, but the truth is 8 of them in a pack can easily get your average Joe through an entire year of shaving. Here on Amazon, I got 8 refills for $20 and free shipping! That's not only a good $5.00 cheaper than the best place here, but that's not including the savings on the sales tax. Believe me when I tell you that I spent over an hour one night searching for replacement blades online and finally settled on Amazon as unbeatable. Nobody even came close with the free shipping. If you're not already a Gillette fusion shaver, become one. If you are, buy the cartridges here. Amazon not only has the best price for them but it is actually easier and more convenient to buy here. You will never be tempted to resort to larceny....
