review/text: I have trouble getting enough fiber in my diet and have been using this for a few weeks. I put it into "Cream of Wheat", cottage cheese, oatmeal, and yogurt mostly. As another reviewer stated, the bottle does last a long time. I wish the individual packets were a better price as I find this hard to take with me. When I know I will be out all day I try to put it into my breakfast and then add some to my water I take on the road. It dissolves very easily and stays dissolved too. There is absolutely no taste or change in texture to any of the foods I add it to.
