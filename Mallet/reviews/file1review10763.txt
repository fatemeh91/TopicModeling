review/text: I bought these for my 80 year old parents. Each were taking several medications 3 and 4 times a day. It was becoming a nightmare for them to dose the medications correctly. The compartments are deep enough to hold several pills and each day container is easily stored in a purse or pocket if they are out for the day. I do wish, though, that we could have bought different colors for Mom and Dad. As it is, we had to mark each tray and container so they could tell which set belonged to Mom and which to Dad.
