review/text: What a toothbrush! Honestly, it really is awesome! It feels like a dentist visit every morning and night, and sometimes in between :) The strength of this brush is just amazing. It is a strong, forceful (but not harsh) clean. I love the option of the 2 minute timer. It also has a "professional timer" which is also a 2 minute timer, but pulsates every 30 seconds to change quadrants of your mouth, to endure that you get the best possible clean.It comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, so you have nothing to lose! You won't believe the feeling and the look of your teeth after only a few days of using this brush!I love the Flossing head brushes! They are great!
