review/text: I was interested in pegging so I bought this for the wife to use on me because I wanted her to have some stimulation too. After our first use, I can honestly say that it was the perfect toy for us! She did not last long and it is not too big or too small for either of us. I read reviews saying that it tends to slip out of the vagina so I also bought the Bare as You Dare Harness for it just in case. I would buy this again in a heartbeat!
