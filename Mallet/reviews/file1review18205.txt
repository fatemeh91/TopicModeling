review/text: The Masks are fine and are a little sturdier built than the typical retail store ones but with the added price. They block light well and are great for back sleepers. Since they are bulkier, I find side sleeping pushes the mask into my face.This part is update after much use of the product: These do fall apart fairly quickly. They are sturdier build in some ways, like in the elastic but the mask is glued together in layers and the material layers come apart too quickly. Think of the liner inside a car that falls down. I bought 2... If you use any moisture at all to wipe away a grime, it is worse. I still give it 3 stars because it does indeed block light well, but for the cost, I thought they'd last longer than they did. I switched to a knock off after these that last just as long for half the cost.
