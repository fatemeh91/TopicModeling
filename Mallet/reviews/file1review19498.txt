review/text: I LOVE this toilet seat. My daughter had been trained on her little baby bjorn potty that sits on the floor and at first she had no interest in this. I think it made her nervous to be up high (she is only 17m). But one day she refused to go on her little pink potty. She kept climbing up onto the toilet. So I put this seat on, she went, and she's been using it ever since! It is VERY easy to use. It doesn't slide around and all and takes about 2 seconds to put on and take off. We have an elongated toilet so I know it fits the non-standard size. I haven't taken it out with me yet but that's the next step. Very happy with this purchase!
