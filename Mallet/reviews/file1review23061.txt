review/text: Many people have said that their handle comes apart. I have not had this problem. In the directions, it says to join the pieces together and then sort of bang it straight down on a hard surface to make sure the pieces fit tightly together. That is what I did, and have not had any problems. This little vacuum works great on my hardwood and vinyl floors and low pile rugs. It doesn't work as well on carpet. But I got it because I don't have any carpet and have mostly hardwood floors and small rugs and I wanted something lightweight, quiet, and something that wouldn't try to "suck up" the rugs like my regular vacuum. Also, this doesn't scare my two cats to death. They don't really like it, but they use to literally climb up the inside of the chimney to hide when the vacuum came on. Now, that doesn't happen. I also like it because I can vacuum the green carpet on the front porch and don't need to try to find an outlet in the house to use the vacuum on the porch. I've had back problems all my life and I like not having to lug out the regular vacuum very often anymore.
