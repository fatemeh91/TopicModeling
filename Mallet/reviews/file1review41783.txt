review/text: The 9400 PC power toothbrush has exceptional power to clean teeth and even polish them as compared to the Sonicare. Also the Sonicare battery failed after 18 month of use (would not hold a charge). The PC 9400 battery has held charge well with two people using daily for one week. We are well pleased with the performance and value.
