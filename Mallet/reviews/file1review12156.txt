review/text: I've been blessed with 3 pregnancies so far and for all three of them I had trouble keeping my generic prenatal down. I managed with the first two pregnancies by sheer determination. When I started to lose my current prenatal at the same time every night of around the 30-40 minute mark after ingested (unless I happened to be in a dead sleep and even then if I woke in the middle of the night hours later I still felt nauseated) I finally threw in the towel and said enough is enough. After a ton of research I decided on Rainbow Light and wow was I surprised! The first time I took it was the ultimate test for me. I was already feeling nauseated before I took the prenatal, I was sick, and I knew my track record of losing my old prenatal so I can't say I was optimistic for this one under those conditions. I was flabbergasted when not only did my prenatal stay DOWN but I actually felt BETTER after taking it! Not only have I never vomited this prenatal I have never even felt a HINT of nausea after taking it. It is the ONLY prenatal I will ever use!!! I just wish I had found it sooner!Clean, no extra junk, filled with good things including spirulina, I just can't say enough!!!To those complaining about the size, yes they are big but they aren't significantly bigger than my old over the counter brand at my local store. Take them with a good gulp a water and you should be fine. I haven't had any trouble swallowing them. I mean really, we swallow food bigger than those pills all the time and don't complain.Bottom line- LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THEM! I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone needing a prenatal.
