review/text: I have trouble with constipation on a daily/weekly basis. After many visits to the doctor, I decided that medications for long term use were not for me. I do not believe there are enough restrictions and guidelines for medications so I chose to try a natural way of approaching this natural bodily process. After many different trials from enemas, suppositories, fiber supplements and chewables, I finally found this amazing tea.It taste sweet, a bit spicey but not hot, and quite good. I use one packet of sugar substitute to sweeten it. I steep and drink it hot in the colder months, and drink it room temperature in the summer. I drink this tea EVERY morning and have for 2 years. It works DAILY to relieve (pun intended) my constipation. It is also caffiene free.The directions say to drink a cup before bed time and it generally produces a movement within 7-8 hours. My advice from personal experience is to drink it in the morning. It works very well for me and after two nights of waking up with the deer in the headlights look shuffling to the bathroom, I decided mid-day relief works better for me :)
