review/text: I am a back sleeper and a side sleeper and this is great for both positions. So light. Does the job perfectly! Very comfortable and the strap in the back is not bothersome while sleeping on my back (I can feel it but hardly notice it.)I've used this every night for about 5 months. Highly recommend this mask!
