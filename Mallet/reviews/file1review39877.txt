review/text: This is hands down my favorite protein powder. I always mix it with milk and I never use a blender. It tastes great and is not full of sugar and calories. According to the ingredients, it contains stevia (which is why I tried it in the first place.) I used to buy it at Trader Joe's, but moved away and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I have only tried the vanilla so far. Highly recommended.
