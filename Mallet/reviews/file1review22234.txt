review/text: I love these Ziploc containers. I use them for my daughter's lunch she is in kindergarten and they are great for bento meals. I use them for my lunches as well. The only reason I ended up buying these were because the Easy Lunch Boxes system were out of stock and I needed another alternative and I am very happy I chose these(nothing against easylunchboxes). They are leak proof they fit into different size lunch boxes they are the same size as the easy lunch box system. I love the price I paid $2.00 for them at Target. I do not put the lids in the dishwasher only the container bottom portion just because of other reviews I read. My 5 year old does not have any problem at all opening the lids and silicone cupcake/food dividers fit perfectly in these containers. I have had parents ask me if these were the Easy Lunch Box system when I tell them they are Ziploc and cost $2.00 for two they always look surprised. I'm a mom who loves to bento and I highly recommend these to everyone.
