review/text: I have made a return to the gym and picked up body building again after a 10 year absence. I took my time and after 2 years back into it, my strength has come back but I have had serious shoulder joint pain. My chiropractor suggested this product and I have been taking 2 - 3 tablets a day along with 3,000 mg of fish oil and the pain is still there. The best relief I can get is from over the counter "naproxen sodium" which is dirt cheap. I'm not saying this product won't do miracles; it just didn't do any for me.
