review/text: These are great for my climbing trips. Perfect size and they fit in my first aid kit nicely. Didn't have any issues with delivery. On time. As expected.A note for the business owner distributing these. HIRE A WRITER! Your marketing material was painful to read. (Wouldn't stop me from purchasing from you again because the product speaks for itself and had nothing to do with your service. Service was spot on.)
