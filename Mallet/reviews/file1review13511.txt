review/text: I'd been trying to find a non chemical laden deodorant for a couple years, all the tom's irritated my skin, the mineral deodorants did too. I tried this one because of the good reviews. It works great, no B.O. even after working all day outside in 90 degrees. I don't like the way it goes on, it doesn't go on as smooth as I'd like, but other than that it's great.
