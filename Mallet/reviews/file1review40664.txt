review/text: I was looking for a low carb meal bar with a good protien content to supplement my diet and workout routine. I like the Balance Carb Well bars but they only have 17g of protien. These bars have 60 more calories but have 25g of protien and only three net carbs! They are comprable in prince & nutritional quality and they taste great. For my money the Myoplex product is the better value.
