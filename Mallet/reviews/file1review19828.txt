review/text: hi,after reading over 200 strongly positive reviews on amazon, i brought this last month for my 2 yr old. she wanted to sit on it right away! she sits there pretty comfortably..singing, wiggling..but the potty seat doesn't budge. Soooo easy to clean. this is my first potty ring and am so glad i made the right decision :-). my advise: GO FOR IT!!!!
