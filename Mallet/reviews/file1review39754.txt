review/text: It is a great idea but could use some tweaking. The legs are non-adjustable and are a little too high for use in bed, creating poor working ergonomics. Yes, you have the option to ship it back and have them saw the legs down to your desired height- but who wants to do that!? The legs also fold in easily and do not secure outward, creating instability on a mattress. Also, If you want to do homework on it, there is no way you can fit a book and a notebook on its surface. Not really worth the 80 bucks you pay after S&H.
