review/text: Having worn custom orthotics, I was interested in trying the Spenco orthotic because it had a rigid base and was adjustable. The instructions for adjustment were very sparse, stating to place them in boiling water for 2 minutes and to then adjust as desired. This did not work for me, as I would have hoped that the plastic base would have been more malleable, and it was difficult to hold in position while waiting for it to cool. Customer service said to place it in a shallow pan of boiling water, turn the heat off and wait for 2 minutes and then adjust. This did not work for me either. Finally, I placed the orthotic in my bench vise to hold it in the adjustment that I wanted and used a heat gun to heat the plastic bottom of the orthotic. After leaving it in the vise for a few minutes to cool, it held the shape the I desired and they are very satisfactory to me.I love the WARRANTY--one year UNCONDITIONAL warranty--if they do not help you or you are dissatisfied, return them to the manufacturer for a full refund--now that is confidence in their product!The orthotics seem of good quality and their adjustability is a big selling point for me, though it is a little bit of a hassle to do the adjustment. If there is another brand that is adjustable, I would like to know it. I am considering buying a couple of more of these orthotics to have for each pair of shoes.
