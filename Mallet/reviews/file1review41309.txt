review/text: We got this when we first had our congoleum floor put in the kitchen and dining room--the store gave it to us.When I ran out I was so sad...vinegar and water was good but no replacement for this.No buildup, nothing like the mop-n-glow junk. This just cleans and puts a finish on it that makes it look brand new (ours has a mat finish, not glossy).I was estatic to come across this on Amazon. It seems expensive but you only use a little each time and it is really worth it.
