review/text: This product has been an absolute lifesaver...I have never seen such a thin sheet of paper absorb so much of EVERYTHING! My daughter frequently chooses to pee as soon as her diaper is off, and these pads have saved me again and again from having to wash her changing pad cover. I use them under her when she naps in places other than her crib. Can't say enough great things about this product!
