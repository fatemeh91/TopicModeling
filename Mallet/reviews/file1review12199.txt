review/text: Like a previous reviewer, I would like to take these vitamins even if I am not pregnant or trying to have a baby.When I decided I wanted to take prenatal vitamins, I was hoping my doctor would suggest one for me. She did not, nor did she provide a list of what the basic minimum requirements were for a prenatal vitamin. After a few web searches, I found a list of essentials on WebMD.com - the vitamins and minerals that should be included in a prenatal vitamin at the bare minimum level. I was surprised to find that many prenatal vitamins did not have all the necessary ingredients in the quantities suggested as "minimum." What is the point then? A friend suggested I get a prescription and that it might be the only way to find a vitamin with all the bases covered. I finally found this vitamin which met or exceeded all of the nutrients I had on my list in the recommended quantities. I was delighted. The price was great. I have never had any issues with morning sickness.Less important are the points that my hair has become incredibly shiny and managable, healthier than I can ever remember it being (I wear it very long). My nails too are growing more quickly and feel stronger.In summary I highly recommend this vitamin because 1). it meets all the basic requirements that a prenatal vitamin should meet, which apparently is uncommon unless you going the prescription route, 2). it is affordable, and 3). I have not experienced any adverse side effects.
