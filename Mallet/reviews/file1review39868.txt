review/text: The gopher grabber is extremely useful to my ailing back. My only complaint is that they don't hold up AT ALL. I have been through 4 in the past 9 months and that is under normal household use. It's not like I even used them everyday. The same thing happened with all of them. One of the suction cups came off, the screw went flying, and the inside hole was stripped out, leaving me with a useless piece of junk.
