review/text: This lip balm is, hands down, the best that I've found. For some reason, all of our local Seattle grocery stores are temporarily out of stock so I had to find it online because I simply don't have anything that compares. It leaves lips feeling moisturized for a long time and it's not sticky or slick. it's perfect...really.
