review/text: When i ordered this as a moustache trimmer. I was hoping it would be sleek enough to maneuver around my moustache, but it turned out to be quite bulky. I like the option to change sizes(up to 9), which is very convenient, you also have a comb that moves with your face contour unlike the fixed combs seen on other models. Overall a decent buy for its price, if you are using it for your beard, but not worth it if you intend to use it only for your moustache...UPDATE---7months later--Pros: Very good battery Life,lesser noise compared to other competitors,Cuts evenlySizes to choose fromBlades work fine, even with very little maintaineanceCons: There is very little maneuverability for shaping the edges of a goatee or a moustache, the blade is just too big. The hair falls down, so you would need to clean up after you are done.Conclusion: this will trim your beard and Moustache evenly, but cant be used for shaping the edges because of its size, the size is both its advantage and disadvantage.
