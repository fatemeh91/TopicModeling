review/text: I like the idea behind this tub--the size, the inflatable sides and bottom to cushion baby, the suction cup to attach it to the adult tub and the generous drain are all good features. However, the bottom is so slippery that after one try, I was afraid to use it again! Even though I never take my eyes, nor hands for that matter, off of my son while in the tub, he still slipped all over in this one. You are supposed to be able to lay them back to wash their hair, but he just slipped right down into the bottom of the tub. Unless you find a way to make it slip-proof, even for babies that sit up well, I would not recommend this product!Our Snug Tub seems to have a slow leak which is also annoying.
