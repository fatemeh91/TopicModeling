review/text: Not to be gross, but I have thick, dark black underarm hair, and this epilator really helps! I thought it hurt like hell when I used it the first time, but I've since learned that if you do it right after you get out of the shower, it hurts a LOT less. It has really thinned out my hair, and some of it hasn't even grown back at all in over a week. It's pretty amazing. I haven't used it on my legs yet, but that's next! Definitely worth the money.
