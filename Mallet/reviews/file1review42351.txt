review/text: Like so many others, we discovered this in the hospital and looked to purchase it on Amazon. Amazon is GREAT, it is my first place to look for products! Aloe Vesta is a great product for my husband who is very ill and has difficulty getting into the shower. It makes his skin feel so soft and clean and it is so fresh smelling. The first hospital he was in did not use Aloe Vesta but we did learn about a great mouth moisterizer there (Toothette). I wish I had known about Aloe Vesta when I took care of my grandmother.
