review/text: I've been shelling out money every couple of months now for this product and have seen no improvement whatsoever. I think this, like so many other supplements we take, are a hoax. I have been taking this for over 6 months now and my joints seem worse than before I started taking it. I have had knee xrays and have been told by 2 doctors my bones are fine. There is no arthritis or anything else going on in my joints. Needless to say, this has been another waste of my money.I have also researched glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM supplements on the internet. Studies by major universities and labs either find that there are worthless and do nothing for you or the results are inconclusive. Bottom line is, I found no research that states these supplements actually work.
