review/text: I take 20,000+ pictures per year, so I go through a lot of batteries. I bought a "longer lasting" knock off as a second battery for my C8080 in 2004. It was slightly higher capacity but failed after &lt;2 years. After that I bought a second Olympus BLM-01, and haven't regretted it. On the C-8080 I consistently got 400+ pictures per charge while using the LCD, and 650+ using the viewfinder only. I now have an E-510, and on my first outing I started with my now 4 year old 40,000+ shot BLM-01 from the C-8080. I took over 1000 photos before needing a battery change, including several sessions where the camera was on for several hours (the e-510 has good power save settings). This is a long lasting, very reliable battery and I'm glad Olympus is still using it.
