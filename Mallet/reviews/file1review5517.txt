review/text: I had used a rescue mask in CPR training on a few occasions and felt like it would be a good idea to keep one in the car. This came in a very sturdy case which is important when stuffed in my emergency back pack. More importantly is that the quality of the mask itself is much higher than the one used in class. When practicing, it is much easier to achieve a good seal. Also, it comes with a set of gloves and cleaning swipe which is all you need for the first time you use it.Overall, I would recommend this product to friends.
