review/text: I guess I am not alone in my great dissatisfaction with the charging capabilities, or lack thereof, with this unit. What is Remington thinking, really? Of what use is a product that seems capable of many good years of service, yet in about a year, can no longer be used without first charging it up every day or two. That it can't be used while plugged in, unless it's already charged, compounds the frustration & annoyance! No matter how long it's charged, even overnight, it will not hold a charge for more than a day, two at the most. And when it's dead, even plugging it in does no good. I doubt Ill ever buy another Remington product again, for even the shaver works well, which this one does, if it can't be used when needed, what's the point?
