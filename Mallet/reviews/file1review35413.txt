review/text: This dishwasher cleanser is okay. It helps to remove some of the residue that builds up in a dishwasher because of lime and other minerals in the water. It was the first product I used to remove the build up in my dishwasher. It didn't completely clean the inside of the dishwasher. I used Lemi Shine, another product, after this product and the Lemi Shine finished the dishwasher cleaning job.
