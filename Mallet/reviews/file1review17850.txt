review/text: In our house, this formula is just the best. It is the closest formula to breast milk, both in appearance, smell and apparently, taste. Not to mention all the nutrients it contains as well. Enfamil was first with the lipil added in formula to mimmick breast milk. I use this to supplement nursing and have had absolutely no problems doing so whatsoever. The baby takes it just as easily and since it's more easily digested, I don't have spitups or any diarrhea, you name it. I buy this stuff by the ton it seems and couldn't be more pleased. I use those Avent bottles and the Gerber shake up bottles (aka, the milkshake bottles in our house!) and they're just great. This formula dissolves extremely easily and you don't have to worry about it gucking up in the nipple.So, if your nursing and looking for a supplement, or even if you're not, try Enfamil first. You'll appreciate the no formula/chemical odor too. It just smells like milk! Thanks so much for a great product!
