review/text: I tried this product a while ago (with my usual diet/exercise - nothing extra). While it did work - I lost 2 lbs in one week (only want to lose 10lbs) it gave me a really nervous/jittery feeling. I stopped taking it after one week because of this. I'm not a big caffeine person, so this is probably why. It did give me extra energy for my workouts, and I never had any problems sleeping (I also made sure not to take it near bed time). I still have the rest and am considering trying it again for a week or two to see how it goes. The amount of pills you have to take was kind of annoying, especially since I have problems swallowing pills sometimes, but it really is a small thing to put up with for the results.It really does seem like a great product, but I guess it depends on how many potential side effects you can deal with.
