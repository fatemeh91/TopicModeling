review/text: I'm a big fan of soyjoy as an at-work snack. They're a little smaller than most energy bars, with only 130 calories each. While the "value" for the money may be less, I find that this bar is a better size than some of the larger alternatives.Of the flavors I have tried I would rank them in order as:1) strawberry2) apple3) berry4) mango coconut
