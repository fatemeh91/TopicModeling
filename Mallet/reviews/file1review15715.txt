review/text: This is my 3rd Cross Tech 3. I carry it with me 90% of the time. If I could stop loosing them I would still be on my first one. The 3-in-1 is great: black pen, red pen, and pencil. There is also an eraser on the end. I have small hand writing so the fine point on the pens is perfect for me. I really like the satin black finish also. Many people comment on this pen and want one for themselves.
