review/text: I got taken, like another reviewer at about the same time period. When I saw it, the item clearly stated it was a 2-pack for $7.00 and the per-tablet price was listed as $0.18 (i.e., $7.00 for 40 tablets). I compared every similar item on Amazon for the lowest unit price. My order even states "2x Electrasol PowerBall Tabs Plus Jet Dry ..." Sold by: Amazon.com, LLC. I ordered two 2-packs for $14.00 but received 2 packages with 20 in each package, and NOT two 2-packs with 80 total tablets. When I wrote, Amazon said "I'm so sorry the information about Electrasol PowerBall Tabs Plus Jet Dry - 20 Tabs was misleading when you placed your order." and then gave me an option to return it. Although its a hassle I will send it back. Many people would just keep the item (paying double the price) because the dollar amount is small. But for me, its the principle of the thing. The item itself is high quality. But I am downrating it because Amazon's listing and handling of this incident was not. I always try to order from Amazon rather than the Amazon marketplace whenever possible. I'm going to shop elsewhere now.
