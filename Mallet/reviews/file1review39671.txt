review/text: I find these floss picks so much easier to use than the regular rolls of floss. The pick lets me floss with one hand without having to shove my hand in my mouth. It's like brushing really. I wish the handle was just a tad longer, that would really make it perfect like a brush.For the reviewers complaining that it breaks, of course it breaks over time, it's floss! This is inherent in the material used for floss regardless of what type of floss it is. I usually get one to two weeks of use from one pick easily.
