review/text: I'm 35 and a vegetarian my entire life. Hence a lot of soy protein over the years. Not to get too personal but after 30 my monthly cycle started changing, for the worse. Recently I was pretty sure I had a cyst (have had them before so I knew the symptoms) but refused to go to the dr. I'm extremely weary of western medicine unless absolutely critical. So I always research alternative, natural ways to deal with things and this came up for cysts and other female issues.I had been in severe pain with cramping for about a week, tender to the touch. Within 2 days of taking 2 of these, 2x a day the pain was gone and the spotting stopped. I was two weeks away from m next period and figured I wouldn't notice a difference in that short amount of time but I did!! It was the easiest period I had had in YEARS!!!I am a believer in this and it can't hurt even if it doesn't fix your issue. It helped me more then I could have possibly imagined it would have and in such a short time!! I now only take it once a day but if I ever feel the need again, I can double up for a little while.This stuff is amazing. I wish every woman would at least try this before you agree to possibly unnessary surgery.
