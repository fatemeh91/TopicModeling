review/text: I used this cream for external hemorrhoids and it works much better than the traditional American creams. It provides immediate relief and a cooling sensation. It has the smell of Camphor, which some people complained about. But I personally like it. I used it along with other typical home remedies (fiber diet, hot water tub etc) and it helped. Btw I also found lidocaine (local anesthetic) useful (which doctors typically do not prescribe).
