review/text: I had been mostly using Noxema and various other skin cleansers previous to trying the Special Cleansing Gel. I was recommended this product during a facial and decided to give it a try. It works quite well! Sometimes, it can feel a little drying, so remember to have some face-friendly moisturizer handy. Dermalogica has many excellent choices in that area, too. After finishing my first (smaller) bottle, I took the plunge and bought this larger bottle so it can refill both the 8.4oz and travel-sized bottle when needed. Well worth a try!
