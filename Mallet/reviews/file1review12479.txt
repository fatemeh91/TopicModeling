review/text: I am very pleased with the product thus far. I bought for constipation problems and find it to be effective. I have had constipation problems for 50 years; this is the first product that my constitution does not adapt to, i.e. Doesn't seem to be habit forming. I highly recommend Oxy-Powder.Fred McClure
