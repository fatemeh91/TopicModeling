review/text: Well... I expected miracles from the product, which I guess is unreasonable. I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it. I will give some advice though. The first use hurts INCREDIBLY!!! That being said, subsequent uses are far less painful. I was prepared from the reviews of others that the Epilator does not remove every hair the way shaving does. I cannot stress this enough. You need to go over the surface multiple times. Also, this skin irritation isn't so bad as long as you keep up with the exfoliating. I would like to say I have retired my razor all together, but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up. All in all, the epilator is a good product, once you get the hang of using it. You do need to allow extra time, but I feel you gain that time back with less shaving in the shower. I've only been using it for a month or so. So far, I feel it was a worthwhile investment.
