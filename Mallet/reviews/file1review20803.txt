review/text: I have extremely sensitive skin and constantly break out from shaving. The Braun 8585 Activator gives me a very close shave while not irritating my skin. It's amazing how close it actually gets. Some selling points:- It's a heavy and well built piece of machinery that has lasted well over a year and is still trucking along (still on the same blades too).- The cover is easily removed for fast cleaning and the head pivots or can be locked into place.- The trimmer is a nice feature, but can be a bit difficult to see where you're trimming because it doesn't come too far off the shaver (watch those sideburns!).- The cleaning system charges and cleans at the same time. I found that I only need to clean/charge it once a week and it holds the charge all week long. The little light on the shaver tells you when the charge is low. The cleaning cartridges are a bit pricey but last for a pretty long time and are well worth the money; I'm still trying to concoct a homemade solution to refill them myself...any suggestions?- The cord that comes with the cleaning/charging hub disconnects and can be simply plugged into the bottom of the shaver for travel.Tip: Remove the head and brush out the blades before plugging it in to be cleaned. It just keeps the cleaning solution cleaner for longer.All and all, this is an EXCELLENT shaver and a great investment. Put away those lousy razors and get yourself one of these!
