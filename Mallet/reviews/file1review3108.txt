review/text: Needed condoms for larger sized penises, these are good for anything from average to slightly above, I don't think I'd use these for anything too huge though. I've asked guys how they like these since I started using them, and men seem to love these. Men usually say condoms suck in general so for them to be excited about this condom is definitely a sign that these are a good brand!Have had a couple break due to near lack of lubrication, though I hesitated on whether to give these four or five stars because some lubrications give me discomfort anyway, so better to introduce non-agitating lubricants. Very cute color, they don't smell bad or taste bad. Overall I'd give these 4.5/5, once again not for too small but not huge, average to a little bigger is perfect for these condoms.
