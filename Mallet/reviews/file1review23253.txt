review/text: Was pleasantly surprised on how well this worked even on plush carpet. Picks up well and is perfect for spot sweeping My socks shed cotton a lot and this picks that right off a deep plush carpet.---The below is for fun---I don't know how this thing works It seems to have some sort of focused gravity field. It must be alien technology. I think it is powered from static electricity cause it works best if I move it back and forth a few times. Cannot promise safety for small children and pets. You never know what gravitonic alien technology might do to them!
