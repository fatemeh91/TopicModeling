review/text: After decades of use with my old Merkur razor, I checked to see if this razor is still being made. Imagine my surprise when I found it on this site! I bought the same, identical replacement razor, which should tell you how much I believe in this razor. I expect to get the same decades of use. It's built solid (it's all metal construction gives it more weight than those plastic disposable razors I take with me on trips), still has that great easy surface grip handle, and with the Mekur blade is a joy to use. I always get clean shaves without any nicks (what would you expect after years of practice?).
