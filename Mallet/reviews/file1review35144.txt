review/text: I really loved these stockings. Not as high of pressure as my Jobst, but more than plain TEDs. They make my legs feel great and I know I have some protection from DVT. Price was good and shipping was fast. I also love that they are closed toe, as all my TEDs but one are open and the one closed toe cost $35. They wash well and just feel plain great. I have to wear compression hose all the time, so these will be it. Great product! I will certainly be buying more.
