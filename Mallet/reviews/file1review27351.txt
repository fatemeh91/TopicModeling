review/text: Optimum Nutrition's Extreme Milk Chocolate is a very tasty product! I have tried their French Vanilla Creme, Vanilla Ice Cream, Cookies and Cream, and Double Rich Chocolate and my wife and I both agree on the Milk Chocolate being the best of the bunch there.Both of the vanilla flavors tasted pretty similar to one another and were pretty good and easy to mix other "things" in. What will turn either of them into AWESOME is to take a scoop of whey, about a cup of ice, half a cup of low-fat vanilla yogurt, one cup of frozen strawberries, and one cup of skim milk (need a big glass!). Blend that together for a shake that tastes sinfully good! We have used other fruit, but if you like strawberries, you can't go wrong there.Another option with either of the vanillas is to mix just like above, but leave the fruit out, bump the milk up to one and a half cups, and put in about one quarter teaspoon of nutmeg. It takes a little imagination, but it will have an eggnog flavor that is pretty darn good.Both of the chocolates are pretty similar tasting too, but the milk chocolate is our preference. My "normal" shake there again is about one cup of ice, half a cup of low-fat vanilla yogurt, one and a half cups of milk, one scoop of whey, and I like it sweeter, so I add in 8 drops of toffee flavored Stevia (also sold here on Amazon). Love it! Every now and then if I am needing more calories for the day, I will make that same shake but add in 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. Ok, so Reeses still does it better, but you'll appreciate this recipe if you are a fan of peanut butter cups! Instead of peanut butter, try a scoop of instant coffee for a mocha.The Cookies and Cream flavor kinda missed the mark in my book. It has a twang to it that I just don't like. Chocolate and vanilla are way more versatile in my opinion and let me make them into whatever I want them to be, so I'm going to stick with them!
