review/text: This product smells very pleasant (I remember the smell being horrible a few years ago) and it really works. It gets rid of even the toughest hair, and a little closer than shaving with a new blade. (I'd say it gives you about a four-hour ""head start"" over shaving.) The negatives are that you can get a wicked rash. I do NOT have sensitive skin, and three days later I still have some of the rash - eek! I'd think that sun would exacerbate this, so be careful and test first!
