review/text: Can this sweeper replace my broom? I'm sorry to say, but NO. It was the reason I bought it in the first place, to replace my broom and use in between vacuuming.things it can't do:does not get into cornersdoes not get right next to the wallnot as quiet as my broom. (loud and squeaky enough to wake up my baby)not as thorough as a broom.so after I'm done with this thing......I still need to go over again with a broom!things it's good for:spills in the middle of a room that has low pile carpet, such as berber. That's the only thing my broom can't do well, but that's what a vacuum is for.
