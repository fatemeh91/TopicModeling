review/text: I used this 2 or 3 times daily to overcome Chronic Fatigue (with a healthy diet). I take a scoop a day now, and I keep a scoop in an 8-oz jar when I go shopping in case I get too tired I can just add a few ounces of water and down it. Within 10 or 15 minutes my energy is back. It is pre-digested meaning that I can take it on an empty stomach and it gets to my blood stream quickly. This is a major factor for most Americans who have poor digestion. No, it doesn't taste great, but I just put it in about 4 ozs of water, shake well, and down it. I don't notice the taste anymore. This is the only super food that has worked for me. (Make sure your "shaker" has a tight cap! Hold it over the sink just to be safe when you shake this up.) S.J. in Texas
