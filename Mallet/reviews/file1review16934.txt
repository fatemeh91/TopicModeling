review/text: The first week using this product it wasn't great, but as the directions say-it will take a week or so for your facial hair to adjust to it. After that I have had no complaints. I must have used it 40 times before having to recharge it the first time.This razor is greatly improved from the older model that I used. This is a great deal!
