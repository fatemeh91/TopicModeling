review/text: As of 2007, after 2 years of testing, I now prefer the large Medi-Chest. Nothing has broken on any of the 5 units and the removable daily case is great for making day trips or going out hunting, fishing canoing, or golfing.These have met the test! They still snap shut tightly and no compartments have lost their tops due to stress fatigue from opening and closing them.Just as importantly, I can carry my plethora of cardiac, kidney, prostate and arthritis medications in one daily container when I go golfing, fishing, hunting or canoeing. If a compartment does just happen to open, it sure beats trying to pick up a week's worth of meds from the golf course and put them back in the right compartments!
