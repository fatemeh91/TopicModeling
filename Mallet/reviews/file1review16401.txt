review/text: I've used this stuff several times now, and it really seemed to knock the symptoms down pretty rapidly. It may be "snake oil" and the placebo effect; but I'm pretty skeptical, and it has appeared to help me bypass the worst of the illness and get better quickly...One of the previous reviewers knocks it, saying it is so dilute it couldn't work, and that it's just "duck liver and heart." Actually, the "goo" he talks about is probably full of bacteria, and according to one reference I found, the dose provides enough bacteria to somehow be beneficial.There are also two double blind studies (though financed by the mfr) that show significant improvement over a placebo.
