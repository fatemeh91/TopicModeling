review/text: I went from soy 95 chocolate from GNC to this. Bleh. There's a wicked diet soda kind of taste. Nutrisweetish. BLEH! It came recommended by a guy from work who liked it and to him by a personal trainer who also liked it. It's got a bunch of stuff in it and whether it's good for you or not...who knows. I used different doses and different liquids (water and milk) to adjust the flavor. The guy at work uses chocolate milk.I went back to gnc soy 95 and sold the rest to the guy at work.
