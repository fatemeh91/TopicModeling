review/text: If you are new to epilation, you will find it painful in the beginning. I had experienced the same when I bought it. I never wanted to try it again after the first attempt. But, the second time, I tried it and it was not that worse and I was able to epilate my legs. I think anyone will get used to the pain gradually and you might never notice the pain one day! It's really worth since you dont have to try all those razors in the bath tub every other day. I can't say my skin is perfect smooth with epilation, but it's a LOT better when compared to shaving. I give it 4 stars!!
