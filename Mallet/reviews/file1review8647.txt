review/text: It seems silly to review a scrub brush, but this is just an excellent tool. I've used it to scrub my shower and it takes grime and mildew right out from the tile crevices and I've scrubbed a few other things with it. So far, it has done everything I've asked of it, working with little effort compared to other things I've used to scrub, and it still looks almost new. I&#34;m getting ready to order two more for our home.
