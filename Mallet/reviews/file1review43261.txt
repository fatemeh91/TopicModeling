review/text: I have trouble with my lower back. I just gave birth to a 10 pound baby. First I bought one of those belly bands, and that worked until about 6 months. I was crying every day and rewind pain killers and muscle relaxers to go to work on my feet. My doctor suggested this and my chiropractor seconded it. I bought it and it was a huge relief for me. I hate how it looks, I hate the material, but I would've worn anything to take the pain away.
