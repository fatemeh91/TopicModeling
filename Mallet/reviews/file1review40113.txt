review/text: I bought this kit essentially on whim and it does a decent job.Pros:Great beginners kit! Especially if you are unsure if yoga is for you this will not break the bank.The blocks work well and are decent quality.The strap is super strappy and does strap things, like be a strap.Cons:The bag is cheep, there is no denying that (it reminds me of a cheep Halloween costume as far as quality goes).The mat is slippery for me and after reading tips for making a mat stickier they all suggest prolonged use, however, I have already begun the wear the mat down and I still slip off!Since I find myself doing yoga so often now I'm going to get a mat of higher quality but would still recommend this product to those who are just starting.
