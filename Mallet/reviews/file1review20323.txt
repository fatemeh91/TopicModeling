review/text: As a person who needs to wear a knee brace on an everyday- all day basis, I found one important fault with this brace. The back of the brace has some sort of mesh material that is abrasive on the back of the leg right at the bending position and makes it uncomfortable to wear. When you first put the brace on, it feels good. After wearing it for about an hour, you feel the mesh cutting in to the back of the knee and it hurts. I then have to place a tissue inside the brace to block the mesh from the back of the leg and that is not an easy thing to do. Also the top of the brace tends to fold over.I actually like the way the rest of the brace is structured and hope that eventually the mesh softens enough for everyday wear. I think that the description should state that the mesh exists and maybe even why they chose to add it to the product.
