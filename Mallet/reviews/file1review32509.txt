review/text: Very sturdy and attractive design. Heat option works fine and takes about 10 minutes to warm up. Extra cushioning in mattress makes the table very comfortable. The 30 inch salon size is the way to go. The only suggestion is to include more detailed instructions for the initial setup. It took a while to figure out where everything went. Once completed, the table is easy to setup and take down. We couldn't be happier with this purchase.
