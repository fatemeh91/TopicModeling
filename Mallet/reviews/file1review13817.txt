review/text: I love my Happy Wrap! I have neck arthritis from years of computer work. I heat the wrap for about 2 minutes in the microwave, BUT I advise to remove the scent pack before warming (to save it from burning). It stays warm for about an hour. Also to note is that it is a moist type of heat when warmed up - the best kind of heat for sore muscles. Enjoy!
