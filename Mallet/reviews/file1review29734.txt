review/text: These pads don't do the job at all. They barely absorb any milk. I even washed them several times thinking that maybe it would soften up the fabric and increase their absorbency. Milk seems to run off the pad and into my nursing bra getting me wet and leaving the pad dry. I would be satisfied if there were any sign that the pad was actually soaking up any milk, but there's not. Don't waste your money.
