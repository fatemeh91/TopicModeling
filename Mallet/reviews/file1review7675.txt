review/text: I found this product in my Mom's apartment after she was sent to hospice. The cigarette smoke was so stale and strong it made me nauseaus. You could even smell stale smoke in the hallway by her door, t was THAT strong of an odor. She was a 3-4 pack a dayer and never opened windows. A few spritzes and the next day when I went back, no smell. The true test was when I had to sell her car. The car smelled awful (smoke again) a few sprays, kept the windows up and smell was GONE. A week later when showing the car, still no smell! Anyone can cover it up with fabreeze or the like, this gets rid of it. Truely amazing and one product I won't be without from now on!
