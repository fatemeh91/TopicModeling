review/text: This is a great product! Bought one about 11 years ago to use in my part time job of driving a truck. Wore it out and bought a second one last month. I've forgotten it a time or two and had to drive without it and it makes a huge difference. Even if you don't have back problems as I do, the principle behind the design of this cushion simply makes sense. Don't know why car seats aren't made this way from the factory!
