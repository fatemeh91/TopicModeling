review/text: I bought this elbow brace after it was recommended by a friend, who is a Pyhsical Therapist. It was pricey but well worth the expense. It is very comfortable to wear and provides support and padding. I was able to sleep with it on and finally I did not wake up during the night because of pain. Lateral Epicondylitis is very slow to heal and this brace made it easier to do the PT exercises without increased pain.
