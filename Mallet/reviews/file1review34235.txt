review/text: Please understand that the only reason I am giving a 1 star rating here is to draw attention to my review. I have had a history with hemorrhoids and anal fissure for about 30 years. I have tried Preparation H and Anusol in the past as a temporary relief. When I found this product on Amazon, I jumped and ordered both the cream and the suppositories. I used the cream as a lubricant to insert the suppository. After trying the product, I was very pleased and ordered 10 sup boxes that I used whenever I had a "flare up". I still have 4 unopened boxes. But few months ago, I developed an abscess or infection in the "fissure area" that eventually translated into a fistula. I am not claiming here that the Mayinglong product is for sure the cause of the infection. However, having lived for thirty years with the fissure and hemorrhoid and then developing a fistula after I started using this product makes one wonder if it has something to do with it. Again, if I were to write this review within a couple of weeks after receiving and using the product, I would have given it a 5 star rating. Now, with this questionable side effect, I am no longer sure and this is food for thought. i just hope I am the only case with this side effect, and therefore I will have the tendency to not incriminate the product.
