review/text: True, the included instructions are a bit hard to understand, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to use. It might be a little easier for men because the sites to measure are easy to get to (chest, tummy, leg). I found the FatTrack to be pretty consistent and the MyoTape is really easy to use. If you want to get just one..I too would suggest the myotape..you can use www.mybodycomp.com to calculate your body fat. Something I just found out was that this item is reimbursable from most insurance medical saving accounts.
