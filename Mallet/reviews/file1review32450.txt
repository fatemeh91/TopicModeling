review/text: I have a City Mini Double and I have to say that it does not affect how flat the stroller folds! My husband loves it because we are always outside with the neighbors and he does not have to go back inside to get a cold drink. It will be great for when we go on trips too. We use this product every day and absolutely LOVE it!
