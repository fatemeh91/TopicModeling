review/text: i bought this product from walmart on my visit to miami & i am very satisfied. i bought 2 boxes of these & some boxes of the no-applicator o.b. tampons. i love to know that i am all stocked up on my monthly essentials. this product is actually a little cheaper @ walmart too.what was strange about the product is the way the string of the tampon is attached, it's seems to be kinda wrapped around the tampon close to the base, then it comes out of the base of the tampon. since i never used this product before, it looked really weird to me, but it works very efficiently.the applicator is very easy to use too, the easiest i have ever encountered. there's no discomfort @ all on insertion & the plastic applicator is a little softer than the regular ones, so it's really easy 2 push the tampon up & out. these are definitely not like the cardboard applicators which bend or lose shape & make it hard for you to push the tampon out or the other plastic applicators, which have you pushing endlessly to get the tampon up. i'm VERY impressed because it's only takes a couples seconds & the job is complete.i love these tampons & i will continue to support Kotex.
