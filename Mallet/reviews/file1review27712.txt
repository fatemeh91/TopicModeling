review/text: ON Whey protein is effective for those who want to build big muscle but it also helps in any sport as most sports rely on body muscle, and this product prevent protein deprivation in our body, and protein is the raw material that our body use to develop strong muscle, hence it improves our performance each time after workout. It contains BCAAs amino acids that eliminate fatigue in our body muscle after heavy workout. Price is good. I have tried strawberry flavor before, so when I first try vanilla flavor, it is not as good. I still prefer strawberry flavor. The reason that I choose vanilla is because I guess vanilla flavors don't have artificial coloring whereas strawberries are. Since I'm taking it very regularly I tend to be cautious.
