review/text: I bought this specifically for cold therapy, and it does not stay cool for the 15-20 minutes I need. The gel seems to absorb the body heat emitted from one's body very well (better than a bag o'peas), so if you can put this on and not emit body heat, you're good.It is designed to absorb heat (which is why it works for heat therapy) as well as cold, but when the two are encountered by the gel, heat wins out. The collar likely works fine hot, though I have not used it for that purpose.It's designed well to cover the cervical spine area.Right now, I've got a frozen peas on the area and that does a far better job at staying cold for the 15-20 min. I need. I don't regret buying it - if I ever need heat therapy, this is a good buy. But for cold therapy, a bag o'peas, though cumbersome, stays cold longer.
