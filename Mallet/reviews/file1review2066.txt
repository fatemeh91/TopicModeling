review/text: Unlike its biggest competitor, the FootSmart bunion regulator that looks similar, but is white and blue, this only adjusts in one place. Other than that this is a far superior item. The plastic is thicker and more study. The other dug into my foot with the edge. I can only wear these for a few hours, I put it on fairly tight, but it makes a huge difference in my foot pain the next day and for a couple of days after if I forget to put it on the next night or two.
