review/text: Just like any other Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush, it is easy and enjoyable to use. I bought the 8400 because I needed the travel charger, which is indeed small and convenient when traveling with the brush. The "special" brushing modes are not very useful to me, and I guess most people would simply use the regular brushing mode (which seems similar to the one in the cheaper models). The digital screen does not make a big difference as it doesn't give you an indication of how much time you have left.
