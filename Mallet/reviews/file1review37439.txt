review/text: After spending some time in Europe recently, I learned just how much the French love their epilators, and do not put up with the pain of shaving every day! There are a lot more models available in France, but based upon all my research, this one seemed to be the closest to those available overseas.I've used it on my legs a few times, and with each use I feel it more infrequently. I tried it once on my pits, but immediately stopped b/c it hurt too much (though my French friend says that it really does become painless with time) and just don't have the courage to try it on my bikini, so I can't comment on how this works in that area. A negative of this is that you have to plug this in, so you can't use it anywhere, but at the same time I wouldn't want to use an epilator with batteries (that could slow down midyank - owww!). A general comment: Keep in mind epilating will most likely hurt a lot more if you haven't ever waxed (I've been waxing my legs the last 8 months). Also be mindful of ingrowns, so be sure to exfoliate well if you're prone to them. Overall, a great product - I save much time in the shower and at the salon!
