review/text: I purchased this as a stocking stuffer this year for my husband. He has very long eyelashes and traditional sleep masks get irritating, not to mention that they feel a bit stuffy. This product is perfect. Very well made, durable and comfortable. There is enough room for you to actually open your eyes with the mask on. I suppose that is the whole reason they call it 40 blinks. There is an adjustable strap that is Velcro so be mindful that you don't get it stuck in your hair. I would imagine that it would be slightly uncomfortable for people who sleep on their backs, as the Velcro may be irritating to your head. This should be no issue for side or stomach sleepers. Very nice product.
