review/text: Purell hand sanitizer is better than all of the other products out there. The aloe product makes it easier on the hands while providing the sanitizing. It smells great. Other products that many of the drugstore chains are producing are inferior in my opinion to this Purell product. It is worth finding on the shelf and buying. However, some drugstore chains have removed Purell so that you have to buy their brand. Not as good.
