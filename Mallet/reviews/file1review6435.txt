review/text: After 10 years of considering back pain to be a constant in my life, a chiropractor virtually ended my back pain using trigger point therapy. I hadn't realized how much life I was giving up due to back pain until the pain was gone. Unfortunately, when my back pain came back years later, I found that my new chiropractor did not practice trigger point therapy and the methods he did practice brought only partial relief. It was at this point that I started looking for another answer. The Body Back Buddy Classic has been that answer. Now whenever I get tense, painful knots in my back, I am able to message them out myself with the Body Back Buddy Classic. I find this device to save me much time, money and pain.
