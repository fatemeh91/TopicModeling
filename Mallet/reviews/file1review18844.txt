review/text: I was not very happy with mineral rich in terms of it made me lighter than what I am and I am a fair complected person.In addition I didn't really feel the enger that it was suppose to give. I stoped taking it because I didn't seel any hair growth.I believe Honesty love was telling the truth about this product and it worked for her and those who may wear their hair natural.to be honest i didn't see much results.
