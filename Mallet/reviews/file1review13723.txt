review/text: I have been using this product for the last 5 or 6 years. A bone density test had shown a slight bone loss and my doctor advised taking calcium supplements. The owner of a health food store advised me to try Country Life Bone Density Factors. My next bone density test about 18 months later showed that I no longer had any bone loss. At that time, my doctor advised me to continue taking Bone Density Factors. I have now moved to a different state and wasn't sure where I could purchase this product. I was thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon.Com and at a lower price!!
