review/text: I try to order supplements smaller companies not yet bought out by larger conglomerates. I cant always to this, but I figured with so may multis out there, I could. I love that this is a whole food vitamin as well, and so far so good, No adverse reactions. The dose is 3 pills, and they are horse pills for sure, so if you have an issue with taking pills, you might want to try something else. I dont always take three a day since I take other supplements, and because of that, these are a great value.
