review/text: I started this product on July 12th, 3 days after my AF went away. I had cycles that were lasting between 33 and 47 days. I couldn't even begin to pinpoint my OV day. I noticed changes 2 days after taking these pills. I checked my saliva every day and for the first time I was able to tell when my fertile week was and was able to tell which day I ovulated. Which was 7 days after I started taking the FertilAid (I thought I OV later in my cycle, so I was way off). My cycle was 37 days last time and this cycle was 29. That is a big wonderful difference. My hubby and I just didn't get to "it" on time this month but I'm confident that this will work for us in the next couple of months. I'm just super excited to have a "regular" cycle! I just bought the FertilAid CM to take with the FertilAid and hopefully that will help. Good luck to everyone and Baby Dust!
