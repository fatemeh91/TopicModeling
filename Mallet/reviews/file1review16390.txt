review/text: I would rank them with negative stars if I could!!!I purchased this item from Allegro Enterprises Inc. and when it didn't arrive for several weeks, I purchased something else. Then, when it finally showed up, I tried to return it unopened but they refused! There doesn't appear to be one place on the website that indicates that they don't except returns. Their own staff members couldn't find the location where they state that this isn't returnable. I wouldn't buy anything from a company that appears to be so shoddy in its business practices!!!
