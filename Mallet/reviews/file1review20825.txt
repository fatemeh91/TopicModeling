review/text: Let me start off by saying that Braun makes the best electric shavers I've used. I've stuck with them for more than 15 years. When the battery on my 5614 stopped holding a charge I decided to upgrade to the 8585. It is much better than the 5614 for getting tough areas along the sides of the neck and base of the jaw. In fact, there is really no comparison between the 5000 series and the 8000 series. The 8585 blows everything else away... it really is worth the extra money. Don't be cheap, upgrade. You won't regret it.The new micro screen's shape really does pick-up more hair in less strokes. Combined with the side-to-side vibration that really does cut down on razor burn. While it's not quite as good as an old fashioned blade it's much better than any electric I've ever used. The only difference between the 8595 and this one is the battery indicator display. It shows the power status and tells you when it needs cleaning. I just don't think it's worth the extra money for that. They share the same micro screen, cutter, and other features.Couple hints for maximum performance: The clean and charge refills are very expensive. If you only use that feature once a week you can maintain high performance with much less cost. In between, simply remove the micro screen and blow the hairs off the blades each time. Just takes a second. If you gently drop the micro screen an inch or two onto a hard surface like the sink it will jar loose any hairs stuck therein. You shouldn't need to recharge the battery more than once a week anyway.
