review/text: It does seem like a very good and quick protein source, though. It was said in a review that this tastes better than smoothie king's gladiator. Just wanted to add that it doesn't, in my opinion. This one has a considerable chemical (maybe sweetener) taste to it that SKs doesn't have. SK is like 45 bucks, though.
