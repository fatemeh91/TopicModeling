review/text: I've been taking trim spa x32 for a couple of months now and have had GREAT results!!!! I've lost 25 pound without excercise. I'm sure doing some excercise would speed up the weight loss even more. I take 5 pills a day still drink a can or 2 of soda and do not feel any hyper problems as I have with other weight loss pills. No problems sleeping at night and I'm not jittery during the day. The pills help you feel fuller faster and less hungry throughout the day. I did notice that if I ate too much at one sitting I would get a stomach ache. So I started taking smaller portions and waiting 5 minutes before taking second helpings (usually I wasn't hungry after a few minutes) The weight started dropping off!! After 2 kids I've lost 3 pants sizes! I love my new look!!!!
