review/text: I grew a small barnicle on my forearm and it annoyed me during yoga class. I priced other wart removers (pricey) and also thought about going to the derm but didn't want to take the time or spend the money. I happened to see the reviews for this little stick and liked the priced. I am shocked by how well this worked. It's like a chap stick with acid in it. I applied it whenever I thought about it in the morning (not even daily) and it gently melted off the wart, layer by layer, until it was all gone. No pain, no burning. And it only took a couple of weeks. I even skipped the band-aid that they manufacturer recommends. Nice and neat and CHEAP! I love it when a product does what it's supposed to do.
