review/text: Both my girlfriend and I liked this product. It was sensitive enough for my needs -- some aren't. My girlfriend liked it because the lubrication wasn't as goopy as some are. We both still prefer non-latex condoms because they are less irritating to both of us. However, if we were short on polyurethane condoms, these would be our next choice.
