review/text: I needed to buy a stethoscope for my nursing class and chose this one so that I would know it's MINE. Everyone else in my class had the typical looking stethoscope. It's definitely a conversation starter and grabs people's attention. The only thing about it is that the heart is a bit LARGER than it appears in the picture. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this product!
