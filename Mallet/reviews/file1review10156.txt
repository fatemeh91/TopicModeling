review/text: Met Rx is an interesting powdered drink designed to build muscle but I bought it as a dietary supplement for being too under weight. The nutritional label is as follows : 2 scoops = 200 Calories, total fat 0.5, cholesterol 10 mg, total carbs 3 grams, sugars 2 grams, protein 46 grams , ( yes thats 46 grams not a typo ) calcium 85 grams, phosphorus 592 mg, magnesium 48mg, sodium 140 mg, potassium 190.The drink does boost your energy and I don't see any caffiene listed as an ingredient so it must be a combination of enzymes that activate your electrolites. It actually kept me awake at night so I only drink this once a week. The vanilla flavor is NOT as great as the chocolate variety. This stuff can be mixed in a blender ball with purified water. Makes a great breakfast drink. I MUST mention this is a 2 lb container dry measurement and it is VERY EXPENSIVE. ( I paid upwards to $50 per container for the chocolate variety in the past ) I think I can do better in price with similar energy drinks.
