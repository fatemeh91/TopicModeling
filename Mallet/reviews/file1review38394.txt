review/text: So, six months later I decided I should update my review. I haven't used this in about 5 months and I would no longer recommend it. First of all, I started getting ingrown hairs that were an extreme annoyance and didn't look attractive. I also decided that the pain of using this wasn't worth it as it never got better, even after multiple uses. Most importantly, every time I used this product I would also have to shave the areas that the epilator missed. Shaving just became a bigger deal than just using a razor in the shower. Don't waist your money... you may love it at first but after time it won't be worth the money.Here was my original review 6 months ago:I love this product! Prior to buying the Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator I was either shaving every day or walking around like a Wooley Mammoth. :O) I have thicker hair on my lower legs and very fine hair on my knees and upper legs. I tried this product a week ago and my hair is still gone! I'm amazed. For the people who are worried that it will hurt, you'll be fine. Trust me, the little annoyance is worth it. Due to the different types of hair I have, I went over my legs at both speeds to get all hairs. The first time I epilated it took about an hour. I have recommended this to all of my friends.
