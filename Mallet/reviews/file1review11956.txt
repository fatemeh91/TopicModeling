review/text: These are the best prenatal vitamins I have purchased. To have a once a day vitamin with all of the normal essential doses for a prenatal PLUS probiotics is fantastic! Since taking these vitamins I noticed more energy and more regularity. Definitely recommend. The only down side is the VERY thin coating, so swallow them fast!
