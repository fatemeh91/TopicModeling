review/text: Switched from Fortiflora to this, thinking it'd be better as it said it had more probiotic cultures, but all it did was make my cats incredibly uncomfortable and made them have a lot of trouble 'going.' I followed the directions exactly, but I won't ever use this product again. Their bm's were improving to normal on Fortiflora and it's a shame because this ProBios is so much less expensive, but both of them were meowing loudly, returning to the litter box over and over without being able to eliminate, and laying around with no energy following consuming this stuff. Oh well. Back to Fortiflora it is.
