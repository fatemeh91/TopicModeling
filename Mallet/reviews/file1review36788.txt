review/text: This device will not make you happy if your need it to overcome a limitation. Frankly, to get the sock on with this thing, you need to be able to get the device onto your foot--if you can do this, you'd not need the device at all. The same limitations that keep you from putting on a sock will frustrate you with this device. You will break a sweat trying to get your toes in far enough as you wiggle your foot and the device. It is not the answer. In fact, it is the wrong item to buy for someone struggling to get dreessed. Then should you get your foot in it, you have to muscle it up your foot. The sock will not gently glide up onto your shoe. I would think this a great Aprils Fools Day toy at best, but at worst it is not something even worth trying.
