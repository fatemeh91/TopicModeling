review/text: Hands down the best flavor is double chocolate but the ice cream vanilla flavor is more flexible. It's very quick and easy to make a vanilla smoothie just pop 2 scoops into the blender with non fat milk add some blueberry's (or your favorite fruit) a couple of ice cubes and that's it. Another tasty way to drink the vanilla is to mix it with sunny delight. I keep both the double chocolate and ice cream vanilla in the house at all times.
