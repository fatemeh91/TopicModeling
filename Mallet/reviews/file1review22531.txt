review/text: These pads do NOT absorb pee! My baby girl likes to pee when her diaper has just been taken off inbetween me taking the dirty diaper away and putting the new one under her. If she pees on this pad, it runs all over the place, including on her and onto the cotton changing pad that I am trying to protect (defeating the purpose of my buying these pads). The Huggies brand has only 8 in a package, but they are MUCH larger and they absorb pee. Do not waste your money on PeeWee pads!
