review/text: I bought this to replace an older Remington Titanium because its batteries would no longer take a charge. Its ashame you can't swap out the re-chargeable battery. But then again I would not have bought a new one if I could have replaced the battery.This new one works just as well as the old one, no better really. But one advantage the old one had was that it vacuumed the cut hair and collected it in a drawer-like container at the bottom of the handle. Very little mess or hair on the area where you are using it. This new one just drops the hair in the sink for post cut clean up.But I am very happy with how it trims my beard and how it feels comfortable in my hand. Seems pretty sturdy like it will hold up for a while.... until the rechargeable battery will no longer take a charge. Then time again for a new one that will hopefully devolve into having a hair catcher again!
