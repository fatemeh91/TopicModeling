review/text: Tweezers aren't the most expensive products you can buy, so for $14.99 I kind of expect a quality product that gets the job done.Unlike standard tweezers these tweezers are pretty long and have a man sized large grip which may or may not be to your liking. The tip on the one I recieved had one square sided tip and the other was pointed.The tweezers themselves did the job as advertised, unfortunately after using them for the first time I placed them on the counter, washed my face and in the process of grabbing my towel knocked them to the floor. When I went to pick them up the tips were bent 90 degrees.Now I wouldn't expect a glass to get dropped from counter height to the floor and survive, but considering the size/weight of these tweezers I kind of expected that they would have made it out unscathed. They are supposed to be made of Stainless Steel yet the tips bent like Aluminum? I can't say I'm very impressed with the products quality.I also can't imagine how a product like this would stand up long term. If a small floor collision can bend the tips that much, common use of the tweezers for ingrown hairs or splinters would cause similar damage over an extended period of time.That said the product manufacturer seems to offer a pretty good gaurentee: "We replace Damaged/dropped tools for one half the purchase price, we repair bent tips for $5.00 per tool. No shipping/handling charges." But you have to wait 4 weeks for the product to get returned.I can't help but feel as though the gaurentee is simply the company offering to fix a defect they know about at a premium, after the product has sold if anyone "happens to encounter it".At a lower price point these would be something good to stock up on and throw away when the tips got bent. For $14.99 they had better last a while, dispite the occasional drop.
