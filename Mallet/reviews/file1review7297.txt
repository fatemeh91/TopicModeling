review/text: I had been looking to buy a good foot spa for sometime now but was very skeptical about spending a 'lot' of money. After reading the reviews on this one, I decided to go ahead and get this.I have had it for 2 weeks now and have used it ever single day!! It is everything &lt;and more>, what I had envisoned it would be. Heats the water up very well and gives your foot the much needed pampering after a long tiring day!I highly recommend this product!!!
