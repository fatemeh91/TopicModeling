review/text: These bra inserts are very stiff and tend toslip out of place on your shoulder----they arerather heavy/bulky and more uncomfortable thanhaving a bra strap dig into you! I have sincefound lightweight ones that stay in place allday and were $1.99 a pair--(commonlyfound in the lingerie sections of most dept.stores).
