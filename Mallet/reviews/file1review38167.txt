review/text: I found the Always Ultra superior to most other maxi pad brands. They're easy to apply and more importantly, they stay in place, which makes them comfortable to wear. The pad -- though very thin -- was super absorbent and the wings prevented any mishaps. I also found the compact, individually-wrapped pads are good to carry in my purse, fanny pack, or gym bag without falling apart. Terrific product. I'll definitely keep a supply on hand for my two teenage daughters and myself.
