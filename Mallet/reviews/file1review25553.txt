review/text: I tried manual clippers in the past but found they had sharp edges and were too big for my smallish nostrils anyway. Instead, I used cuticle scissors for nose and ear trims. When I stumbled over the battery operated Panasonic ER411 I decided to give it a try. That was last month. I've used it twice so far and it's terrific. The cutting head is smaller than I expected and fits comfortably in nostrils and ears. And with no sharp edges exposed it's easy and pleasant to use. Great tool.
