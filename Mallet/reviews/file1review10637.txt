review/text: The Dispenser Ph Test Strips tested my Saliva at 6.4 PH and the same 6.4 for my Urine, and also tested 6.4 for Deer Park bottled water, my NC tap (deep well) water, and the tap water at my 2nd residence in KY. I also purchased pHion Diagnostic pH Test Strips which measured my Saliva PH as 7.5, Deer Park bottled water 6.0, and my NC tap water 7.0. I believe the pHion strips are much more accurate than the Ph Test Strips Dispenser.
