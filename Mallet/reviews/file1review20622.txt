review/text: Replacement blades don't really seem to help that much on other electric razors I have used. But, the Braun instructions say to replace the foil and cutter every 18 months. When I finally replaced mine (22 months) it was amazing how much better the razor worked. It was really like getting a new razor. It runs much smoother and slip along my aging skin like silk again. If you have one of these Braun razors and find it is not a smooth and comfortable as it once was, the Foil and Cutter refill may do the trick for you.
