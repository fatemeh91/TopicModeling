review/text: I prefer to deal with allergy problems without using drugs.Heat works best, for me.I bought 3 heat-delivering products at the same time.This worked great the first 3 or 4 times.Then, the 4th or 5th time I tried it, part of the edge came unsewed.I think it'll work again if I hand-sew it shut, butI'm afraid to use it til then.How long do we think it'll be til I get around to that? This decade or next?
