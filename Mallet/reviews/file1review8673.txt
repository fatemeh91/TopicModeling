review/text: Back when I was a pre-teen in the 1960s, before the emphasis on health, regular market brand toothpaste was chemically too strong for the interior tissues of my mouth. Regular market brand toothpaste lifted a thin layer of skin inside my mouth. This was visible whenever I talked. To avoid embarrassment, I carried a tissue around all day removing the excess skin from my mouth's interior. Companies began to add more chemicals to their toothpaste which caused me extreme skin irritation both inside and outside of my mouth. As an adult I started a search for a herbal, gentle, and natural toothpaste and tried many brands that failed me. I finally tried Auromere.Auromere was the absolute solution to my problem and I have been using it for many years. Auromere is a healthy alternative to regular toothpaste, gentle on the mouth, pleasant tasting, and a delight to use. I have had fewer cavities since using Auromere. If you are sensitive to the market brands of toothpaste, or just want good tasting toothpaste, then Auromere is probably the ideal product for your teeth. Thank you Auromere.
