review/text: I have been very impressed with this Epilator thus far, I can say that it takes some practice though. My hair is very fine, but there is a lot of it and it grows very fast! I have used the Braun on my legs, underarms and bikini area successfully, however I am still working on getting it all in one try - so far it's taken several evenings to get all the hairs, but I think with continued use it will be easier. I'm still getting used to the product. Going slow is definitely the key! I also found exfoliating helped on my legs. The pain was very minimal on my legs, everywhere else - just grit your teeth and bear it the first few times and then you're good to go...
