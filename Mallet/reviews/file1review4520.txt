review/text: I have been using an electric razor for many years and have gotten extreemly poor result for some time now. I finally switched to a manual razor.PG's Gilette sent me both the Fusion and the Mach 3 free, so I tried them both. I think P&G;'s Gilette is trying to confuse me. I like the Mach 3 better than the fusion becasue:1) smaller head makes it easier to get into those small places, true the fusion does have the one rear blade for this prupose but the head was so large that I was not able to get the blade into those hard places. The Mach 3 was able to get the whole head into most of the small places which certainly beats getting just the one blade in there.2) While the Fusion's handle was well balanced so was the Mach 3's handle and the Mach 3 had better gripping surface then the Fusion did.3) Lower price on the Mach 3, IMHO, means that the Mach does not need to beat the Fusion just get close to it. In my test the Mach 3 did better than the Fusion.In terms of the question that I posed in my title, as with everything else in life which is better for you depends on what type of beard you have. Do you have a heavy beard and have to shave multiple times a day(like Tip O'Niel) or are you a teen, then the Fusion is probably the best thing for you. Do you have a moderate beard? The the Mach 3 is probably more what you need. Or if you have a light one that does not grow very fast, like mine, then the Sensor or the Sensor Excell is more of what you need. I think that I am going to go for the Mach 3.I stuck with the electric razors for years thinking that the manual razors would nick and irritate my face. The may have been true thirty years ago but not now. Electric razors don't give you anywhere near as close a shave as a manual does.As for shaving gell goes, save your dollars and buy the Barbasoll brand. Costs less and is much better than the Gillete Fusion gells.
