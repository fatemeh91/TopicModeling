review/text: I bought this to help the healing process of a rotator cuff tear. Since I don't sit down much, I wear it when I go to bed.. it's nice that it is timed to turn off after 20 minutes. The pad is comfortable, the heat just right. Now my wife and I fight over it... so I'll have to get another one.
