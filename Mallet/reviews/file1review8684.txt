review/text: I have an older Oxo broom in the same style as the new one I just purchased. The bristles on my original broom are a bit more rigid which I like better. The new broom's bristles are very flexible and a bit "springy" which causes whatever is being swept to scatter out ahead of the broom. The new broom is still better than others on the market today, so I will keep it while I continue looking for one with the old style bristles.
