review/text: I took this tablets for 2 months exactly. Didn't see any difference in my nails, but they always were strong and fast growing. Didn't have any problems with the skin, so again did not notice anything new. But my hair, oh well.. I have long hair, and after pregnancy 2 years ago it wasn't growing at all almost and i'm trying to grow back my natural color. After this tablets my hair grew twice as fast as before if not more! I'm very happy with that and i'm buying more now! Wow, that is impressive!
