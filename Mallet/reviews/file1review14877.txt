review/text: I have used Met-Rx before and I like it alot. It has a lot of protein. I got the vanilla and have also tried the chocolate. My only gripe is this company has "NO CUSTOMER SERVICE" and is un-responsive to email queries about their products from their website. So In my opinion, if they do not care about their customers, then I don't buy their product again. I would recommed not buying this product, if you need assistance with it. If not, then go right a head.
