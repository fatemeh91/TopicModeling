review/text: I bought this for my wife and it is so awesome!! If you are pregnant, especially like pretty far along pregnant, you need to get this thing because it is great! It really provides a lot of support to your lower back and holds your belly up really well and gives you a lot of relief. My wife hardly ever takes hers off haha! Anyway I really recommend it
