review/text: I love this product, it works so well. It can even be applied when you're already a little sweaty and will neutralize odors immediately. I first found this item at Target, but they stopped carrying it. I was going to buy it thru amazon, but the shipping prices are WAY out of line, more for shipping than the items. I ended up going directly to one of the sellers websites, and paid only $6 to ship 10 of these. I can't say who the seller was, but check into that before purchasing here....
