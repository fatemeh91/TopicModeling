review/text: I've tried several types of cloth diapers and these flats with a Thirsties Duo wrap cover are my favorite. I fold them in an "Origami fold" (there are videos on youtube) and they fit my son perfectly. It was actually a happy accident that I received these: I had registered for prefolds and my cousin bought me a package of flats by mistake. Since the prefolds were much too large for my 7lb 12oz baby, I decided to try these and they fit great! Much less bulky. Now at almost 5 months old we are still using them. At night my son is wetting more these days so I use an additional doubler (a gDiaper cotton insert) which works great, or I could use 2 diapers. I prefer these to other options b/c they wash clean and dry quickly whether in the dryer or hanging out on the washline. They don't get stained too bad and any stains that do occur either wash out in the 2nd wash or are removed completely by drying them in the sun. Plus these are the most economical cloth diapering option. Some of the negative comments are from folks who don't understand/appreciate flats or birdseye fabric. The fabric starts out as a large, thin piece of fabric. After you wash them they shrink down to the usable size and become puckered. That's what is supposed to happen - it's the nature of this type of fabric.
