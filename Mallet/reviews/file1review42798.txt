review/text: I was looking at an article in Science Daily today about nitrous-oxide-producing gut bacteria. [...]Interesting because I'd heard about nitrous oxide pills for humans so I decided to google this bug. After researching further I found how beneficial it was in fighting pathogens during the second world war to fight dysentery before antibiotics were even available. Sadly the widespread use of antibiotics caused us to almost forget about it. [...]We'd taken MegaFlora for years but it did not have it. Thanks Garden of Life!
