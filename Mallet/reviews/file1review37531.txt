review/text: I've had 3 masks before this one, the last one a Ciccia Bella which I thought was pretty good. I was going to replace that one, but bought the Escape instead because I liked all the details given on the Dream Essentials website. I sleep on my side tending to rub my face on the pillow to settle, and the mask doesn't shift. It feels very comfortable on my head, not too hot or bulky (unlike a fleece one I had!! what was the mfr. thinking?)and my sleep is definitely deeper. Agree with the other reviewer that what you can't see in the photo is an indentation for your eyes, so that you never feel any pressure on your eyes from the mask. The only issue I had was a headache the first morning after I wore it which I think may be due to the fabric sizing used; I recommend washing before use.
