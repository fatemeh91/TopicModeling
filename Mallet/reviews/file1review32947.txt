review/text: I already have to take so many pills so was glad to find a good liquid source of glucosamine/chondroitin. It seems to work as well as the previous product I was taking. The taste alone is sickeningly sweet, but I've found if you add about a cup or more of tonic water it actually tastes like a good drink!
