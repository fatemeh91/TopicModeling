review/text: I bought this for quick clean-up jobs. I have two big poodles and although they don't shed, bits of their white fluff tend to drift to certain areas of the living room and they do track in some dirt. This sweeper picks it up off of hardwood floors and rugs. It is so much easier to use then a broom and dustpan. I have not had trouble with the handle--I read in the instructions to push the handle parts together hard. I did so by tapping them together on the brick patio until they "clicked". Once in awhile,I still get the vacuum and mop out for serious cleaning, but this item is just the ticket for in between times.
