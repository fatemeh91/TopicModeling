review/text: For the price, this chair is a very good deal. There are high-end massagers out there, but they cost almost ten times as much. The shiatsu motion is superior to the vibration models. The chair itself is a very comfortable recliner, so you can still use it as a recliner even after the mechanics breaks down.On the down side, I wish the massage can go an extra half feet both lower and higher. I am 5'8", and only the middle part of my back can be massaged.
