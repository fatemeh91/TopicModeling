review/text: Although it costs more and I don't think most people would need the extra features on it, the oral-b triumph is a dandy brush. I like the angled head, the three speeds, and the charge life display. Storage base looks nice by the sink and is quite functional. Easy to separate the charger from the base to take with you for traveling. Floss brush head works well and feels good on the teeth.
