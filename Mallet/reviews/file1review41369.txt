review/text: I have very narrow, low-volume feet and these insoles make my shoes fit more snugly. I also have the full size version of Superfeet insoles, but find they take up too much space in my street shoes, so I use the full ones for a deeper pair of winter shoes. I have three pairs of these 3/4 size for my everyday shoes and I highly recommend them.
