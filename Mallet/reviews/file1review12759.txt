review/text: I have used the "SAM Splint" (the original) for over 20 years now. They are a great product. This is a very close copy of that original. Looks like it will work as well.What is best about these splints is they are completely mold-able, they can be cut with a good pair of scissors and made to fit almost any application. From fingers to legs and everything in between!
