review/text: After years of avoiding trying DIMpro or DIMplus to reduce my fibroids and estrogen dominance, I've finally tried this (2 months) and LOVE it.When I take it my estrogens normalize, which helps normalize my mood, removes nipple discoloration, and reduces PMS symptoms (less swelling, less bloating, less breast tenderness).NOTE: The packaging says 1 pill per day for women, but up to 2 for men. Since I'm estrogen dominant, on high estrogen days I've taken up to 2 pills. I'm not sure the recommended dosage is accurate for those of us trying to reduce estrogen dominance.I'm going to keep using it and see if I can reverse my estrogen dominance with it completely.
