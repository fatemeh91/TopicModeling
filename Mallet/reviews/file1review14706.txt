review/text: Very poor instructions, and then when I tried to find more information on the internet I found conflicting information. The instructions say to start with the small end, but on a transcript from "Oprah" it says to start with the big end. Not very practical either, you're supposed to do Kegels many times a day and you can't exactly use this when you're sitting at a stoplight or at your desk. Not worth buying.
