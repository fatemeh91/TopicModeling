review/text: This is value for money, people, it definitely is. There are few things you need to know though.The DVD is not all that instructional...frankly, it told me no more than I knew already from common sense or paying attention during hair cuts.The cape is made of wet paper bags. It would not support a feather.The trimmer itself is great in performance, but I had to realign the teeth myself - it is not top of the range stuff, so beware ...also, it is packed with the metal scissors so it will definitely be scratched when u get it.Over all, it is perfect for me, since I am not all that picky about quality as long as stuff is cheap enough and I got tired of paying a lot for haricuts anyway. This item will pay for itself in two months. If you're ok with the cons, go for it!
