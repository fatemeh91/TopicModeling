review/text: You know, its not often I can say something is fantastic and I'm more than pleased. I've had Brauns & Philips only because they're made in Europe (for obvious reasons). I prefer German or Japanese products due to their consistent quality and performance.This razor is phenomenal! It shaves right down to the skin and gets all those pesky off-side ones, too, within a couple passes.You truly get what you pay for many times (not always though) and this razor I got what I paid for. I was considering a Remington Titanium before but something about the concentration on the "titanium" threw me off. Then the reviews on it too.This shazer is made in Germany. Not by slave labour workers in some no-name factory, i.e. German quality & precision. It cleans itself perfectly and is self-maintaining.Incidentally, my last Braun lasted for 10 years and was made in Germany. What does that tell you? How many cars last that long without any problems? My 16+ nephew is now using it, maybe it'll last another 10 years. Buy Braun or Philips, but this one is by far the best I've had. Very pleased.
