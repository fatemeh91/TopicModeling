review/text: I ordered this kit but received an incomplete set. Needless to say, I was very disappointed and let the seller know my displeasure. The seller promptly apologized and immediately shipped out a replacement kit. The product is what I needed, and the customer service was exemplary. I docked one star for the inconvenience of having to wait for the replacement kit, but otherwise, I am a happy camper.
