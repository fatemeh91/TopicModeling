review/text: Too much tea had made my teeth look less than sparkling so I decided to try this a month before my wedding. It made my teeth look bright and white, but not like fake white and so I had real nice pearly whites for my wedding. They're really easy to apply and take off, although the gel on the strips can whiten the tips of your fingers if you don't wash it off immediately. Even so, this whitening effect on your fingers will go away. What else? It did hurt my gums a little bit a few times but not so much that I was in agony or anything. My husband tried it later and for him, it hurt his gums and teeth and his first strip was his last. But the directions do say that it is not for people with weak teeth and gums and not to use it right after brushing. Anyway, the verdict for this for me is that it's a really good alternative to whitening your teeth for an expensive cost at the dentist because it works well and is affordable. Bravo for Crest!
