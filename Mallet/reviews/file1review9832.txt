review/text: The tweezers are perfectly aligned. The tips are intentionally not needle sharp - you can tell the needle tips were ground flat after the alignment process. This is not at all a problem, because the tips still easily get under the skin to get ingrown hairs out.It is fairly difficult to get a good grip on hair with these, but that's not what these are really for! These are best used to get stuff that is under the skin to a point where a wider tipped tweezer can grab the thing and get it out. See, they are great at getting just under the skin and working items out from under the skin so they are poking out of the skin far enough so they can then be grabbed using a tweezer made for easy grabbing and pulling. I use a slanted tip tweezerman tweezer to easily grab stuff once it's poking out enough after using these; the process works well.Don't buy these expecting them to fill all your tweezing needs, and you won't be disappointed. These fill a specific role very well, but are not as good at other tasks like easy grabbing and plucking.
