review/text: I was really impressed with the reviews I had read and decided to give it a try. Note: I'm a first time user so I read the instructions very carefully. Unfortunately, after using it for the first time (and it hurts....really hurts...makes me wonder if it might be worth just going to have it all waxed off instead), the thing broke down...pretty much stopped working. very disappointing.
