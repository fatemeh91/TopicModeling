review/text: Hoo yeah, it really takes the hair off, but if you wanna go with this bad boy, you have to ask yourself, "Is my hair issue bad enough to warrant putting myself on fire?" For me, the answer was yes. I have thick, coarse, black hair and skin as pale as death. After I shave you can see my 6-minutes-after-i-shave-shadow, and that has always burned my biscuits. So, instead of selling myself on a street corner in order to raise the money to afford laser hair removal treatments, I bought this, and boy-howdy does it hurt! The brochure that comes with it says you might feel a tingling sensation. Seriously? It's plucking out multiple hairs at a time from areas that we do not normally pluck. It feels closer to being flayed alive than a "tingle." The good news, though, is that the hair grows back at different rates, so if you use it often, like once a week, it won't hurt nearly as much as it did the first time you used it. Don't kid yourself, though; it's always gonna suck. But hey, I've never been smoother!
