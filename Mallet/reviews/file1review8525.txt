review/text: It would have been helpful to know the diameter of the end of this brush, as it does not fit into narrow-mouthed bottles (as a previous buyer noted - I should have listened!) However, it is a great quality tool, and works great for washing pots, because you don't have to turn your hand as much, so it's easier on the wrist.
