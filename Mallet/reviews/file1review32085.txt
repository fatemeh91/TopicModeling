review/text: Really! Almost everything! I say almost because I'm sure there are stains it wont lift that I haven't encountered yet. So far its worked on rust, blood, catchup and a moderately new (a half hour or so) wine stain.The only problem is they run out fast, so get a pack of more than one. I like to carry it in my purse. Its a lifesaver!
