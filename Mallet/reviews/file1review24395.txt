review/text: For some reason, this product had the opposite effect on me. I didn't get any feelings of relaxation or sleepiness. It did not provide any pain relief. The worst thing was that I tossed and turned all night, feeling like I drank a bunch of coffee. I tried it for several nights just to make sure it was this herb and not something I ate. The same thing happened every night.
