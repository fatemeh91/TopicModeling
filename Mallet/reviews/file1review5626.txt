review/text: Considering the fact that I recently hand-massaged horse manure into my herb-garden bed, I can't be that much of a germ fanatic, but, one fresh thing I basically must have for general sanity is a freshly cleaned toilet, and that means a little dash of Seventh Generation cleaner in the bowl and a wipe down of the seat with Mrs. Meyer's spray sometimes as often as twice daily. Hence I am on good terms with my toilet brush. I am on better terms with my new one made by Umbra, a home design company founded in 1979 by boyhood friends Paul Rowan and Les Mandelbaum, whose main US headquarters is based in Buffalo, New York, with another large facility in Toronto, and additional offices around the world presently employing a fairly whopping 650 people. In Latin, the word "umbra" means shade,(or more precisely, the darkest part of a shadow) reflecting the designing duo's take-off debut product, a printed window shade then unlike anything on the ready-made market in the dark days of mostly ugly home accessories in the "affordable" price range. Umbra basically created excitement in the plastic tissue cover and waste-basket categories, no small feat if you ask me. Anyway, the Vapor toilet brush has a super-shiny finish of clear glaze or laminate over the brilliant acid green base and looks very cool; plus the top fits snugly, no crass engineering or slovenly manufacturing bugaboo here. Given the frequent use mine sees, I might prefer air holes in the lid, since by default I am leaving the two pieces "open" so as to allow the brush to air dry. That said, among the best $10 purchases I have ever made.
