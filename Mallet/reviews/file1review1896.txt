review/text: I couldn't get rid of my tinea versicolor for three years after I got it on vacation in Malaysia. I tried topical creams prescribed by the doctor, Sporanox pills also prescribed by the doctor, and Lamisil OTC spray. I finally came across this soap and decided since I've tried almost everything else, why not. The first time using it I could feel the tingle on my body parts that was covered with tinea versicolor. The smell of the soap will take a little getting used to but once you get over that it really is refreshing. A couple of weeks later and almost the end of the bottle, my tinea versicolor is gone. Just remember that you need to tan so that the spots that were formerly tinea versicolor can blend in with the rest of your skin. Definitely buying this product again just to make sure the tinea versicolor doesn't come back. Glad this product exists.
