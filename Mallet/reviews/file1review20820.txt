review/text: I brought this shaver as a gift for my father. His old one was well...old. It didn't shave closely and he looked kinda unshaven even when he did. We just thought that was normal, but after he started using this shaver boy did he look different. His cheeks were softer too. My mom was happy too, so I've said all that to say, he seemed really pleased with this one.The cleaner is a great part of it too. Just don't go yanking the thing around, it doesn't work the way you would think it does. Think of the cleaner like a dishwasher, you wouldn't open the dishwasher while it was on so don't take the shaver out of the cleaner while it's cleaning.One last thing: The cleaner is loud. So if you want to scare someone silly don't tell them about it and watch them jump out of their skin.
