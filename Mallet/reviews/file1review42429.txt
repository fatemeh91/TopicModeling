review/text: I started using this on May 1st. The first week it worked almost as well asNature's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus, 100 Capsules (Pack of 4)but after the first week, I noticed that both my dogs' stool became a bit softer than usual. Another two or three days later, my Doberman started to have stool like "cow pies" so I switched her back toNature's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus, 100 Capsules (Pack of 4)and in a day, her stool went back to being "normal" again. Then my other dog started to have diarrhea (she has EPI AND IBS) and I had to give her antibiotics ANDNature's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus, 100 Capsules (Pack of 4). Once both of their stools went back to "normal" for a week and a half, I tried this product again (since I've got five pounds of it) and this time in a day, they both had "cow pie" kind of stools. Now I'm "abandoning" this product altogether and getting more ofNature's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus, 100 Capsules (Pack of 4).End of story.
