review/text: This pad works great for my purpose, although I don't use these pads for what they were designed to do. I use these pads as drop cloths when I'm doing any work inside that house that requires a bucket of water. Examples are washing windows or walls. I set the pads on the floor and put the bucket on the pad. The pad handily absorbs any spilled liquids much better than a thin canvas drop cloth.
