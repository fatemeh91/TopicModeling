review/text: I really like this oil for my hair. It says you can take it as a supplement but I didn't do that. I only use it for nourishing my hair when it's dry. It has a great sheen. I know it's natural coconut oil, but I sort of do not like the smell. But I still like using it every two or three days. To use it, I poured it into a smaller jar and keep that on the vanity for regular use, because it returns to a solid form. I leave the larger jar it came in sitting in the window, to keep it in liquid form. But I guess you could just scoop it out when needed. Very good oil!
