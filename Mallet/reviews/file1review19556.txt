review/text: A friend gave me one when my daughter was 9 months old and we've been using that since then. The curvature of the ring cover fits both the toilet and baby's bottom really well. It does not move on the toilet as some other designs do. It's easy to clean. I also have a cover with cartoon characters on it but my daughter would keep moving off it and trying to see the characters so it's really distracting. The Bjorn one does what it's supposed to do and does it well. Now my daughter is 2 years old and started potty training a few weeks ago. I like the Bjorn so much that i bought another one for our 2nd bathroom also.
