review/text: I purchased this item from Amazon.com on October 30, 2004.Let's see, today is August 26, 2010. I suppose by now it's about time that I leave a review for it, huh?I originally started cutting my own hair when I learned to ride a motorcycle. Having a longer haircut did not work out so well with a helmet, so I began cutting it short. I use the #3 razor all around, then I touch up with the #2 in various places (mostly on the lower sides/back).I've been doing this every couple weeks for years, cleaning the razor after every use, and oiling it on occasion. And to be quite frank, I oil/lubricate the blades much less often than the manufacturer recommends. But still six years later, the razor is working perfectly fine, does not overheat, and has in the meantime saved me a ton of money.If you're hesitating on this item, don't bother. Just buy it. And review it in 2016. Have fun.
