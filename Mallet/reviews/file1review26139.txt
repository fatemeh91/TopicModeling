review/text: Pros - the smell is very nice (grapefruit)Cons - the price, a bit grainy consistency (it's mostly honey), hard to carry aroundOverall, I'm a bit dissapointed, this product doesn't do wonders to cracked lips like I read in other reviews, it's just "okay", but for this price it's definitely not worth it. I switched to the blue "Labello" lip balm (which is btw called "Nivea" in Europe), my all time favorite.
