review/text: 10 lbs of protein might be a bit of overkill, but if you are planning on working out, especially weight lifting, this stuff can go quick. The rocky road flavor is good, not too much different than a chocolate, and the powder blends very well, even with just water, which is the way I use it most of the time. All in all it is a great product.
