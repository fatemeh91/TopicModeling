review/text: My son's occupational therapist recommended this as a stocking stuffer for him since he had enjoyed using it in OT. It's not cheap, but it never dries out, so it is long lasting. It's relaxing to play with (for me, too), and fairly easy to clean up--the only thing it was impossible to remove it from was a rubber bracelet my son was wearing. It seemed to bond with it permanently.
