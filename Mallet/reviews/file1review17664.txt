review/text: One simple reason why you dont want this pos is the plug to charge it gets put in on the bottom of the base!!! How the heck do you expect us to charge this while its standing up like every other shaver in creation!! i dont want my razor laying on its side like its a beached whale!!! How lame is that!!!! Why didnt they show that on the picture!! I wish I hadnt ripped the box I never expected this plug to go on the bottom, and why dont they make the one with the vacuum catcher on the bottom. This gets hair all over the place. Why discontinue a great product and make this pos. Also the top plastic trimmer adjuster piece is closed in the a cage, I have never seen that before, its weird. The only other razor that sits on the side is called the man groomer but you only use that for body hair once in a blue moon. To have a razor you use weekly sitting on its side is ridiculous. Buy something else or make sure your plug doesnt go on the bottom of anything else you buy.
