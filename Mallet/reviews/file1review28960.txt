review/text: I've tried a few other brands, and the day I had my first scoop of Gold standard, I just knew that this is the best. Even before tasting it, just the texture of the whey is wayy better than a few other brands and is almost certainly the best I've known. It tastes good too. I started off with 2 lb strawberry, loved it. Got a 5 lb strawberry and then this 10 lb double rich chocolate, which is great too.
