review/text: The best smelling glade plug-in is tropical mist. Tracking down the aerosol was nearly impossible and took many years. Once you buy this tr+sh, you'll know why.One. it smells nothing like the plug-in, though branded identically.Two. It has an overpowering chemical undertone, and barely any scent at all.The mixture was clearly discontinued by Glade after they realized they couldn't get it right and that this can of stink held no appeal for anyone.
