review/text: I bought DIM Plus on the advice of a friend about a year ago. And I've kept buying it ever since. I had begun to have mild anxiety attacks that appeared to be directly related to my cycle. When I told my friend about this, she revealed to me that her gyno recommended these to her for that very same condition and that it had made a big difference. Thus I decided to try Dim Plus and began to take them religiously. Soon all my anxious I'm-going-to-freak-out symptoms went away. After 10 months I got lazy and stopped taking them. Lo and behold about 6 weeks later I began to have these anxious "spells" again. I immediately started taking DIM-Plus again and I haven't had any episodes since. This stuff really works for me!
