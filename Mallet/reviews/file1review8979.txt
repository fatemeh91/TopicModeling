review/text: It works okay. Provides a little boost of energy in the morning and may slowly be affecting my digestive track. I haven't been full blown sick since I started taking it. I did get a little sick but then I got over it. Overall I'd recommend the product but at almost $60 for a two month supply I'd say only buy it if you're serious about taking using it.
