review/text: I took one vial and felt great. I felt like I'd never want to use any medication again. Then I had another and didn't feel any different.Ginkgo on its own improves circulation and is a mild stimulant, but combined with eleuthero (aka siberian ginseng) and rhodiola, it can create a significant feeling of relaxation and concentration.I suppose it works for some people (like the previous reviewer's roommate) and doesn't for others. But, based on my experience, I can say that it works best if used sparingly and if it is taken on an empty stomach.Once I started taking it while I ate and doing it every day, I stopped feeling any effects. But if I avoid it for a long time and then take it on an empty stomach, I feel awesome again.In any case, it's a good supplement and at under $10 a box, it's a good deal.
