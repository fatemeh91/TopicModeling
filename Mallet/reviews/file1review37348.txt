review/text: I'm really happy with my purchase. I hate shaving because it gives me a rash, waxing my legs myself is really messy, and getting my legs waxed was so expensive, I could only afford it occasionally. With the pain softening head, this epilator wasn't NEARLY as painful as waxing. The only downside is that it makes a bit of a mess, but next time I'll make sure to use it in an empty bathtub so I won't get hair all over the floor. Either way, it's not nearly as messy as waxing myself and so much easier. It does leave a bit of stubble and break off some of the hairs, but for the convenience and the money saved, I'm quite willing to put up with it. I love this epilator. The greatest invention ever. I'm so glad I decided to try it out.
