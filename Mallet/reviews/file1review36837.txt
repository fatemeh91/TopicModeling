review/text: I've just came back from spine surgery and found myself with many restrictions.Because I was not being allowed to bend for sometime, I have to ask for family help when I needed to put my socks on.I felt so happy when I could put them on! It is amazing how simple tasks can become a trouble. Thank you, whoever invented it!
