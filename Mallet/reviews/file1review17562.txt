review/text: I like this trimmer better than my previous one because with this one all I have to do is rotate a dial to select the length of hair to be cut. With my old one, I had to change the covers to do that. To get the right length with the new one, I started with the highest setting and worked my way down.The trimmer could be a bit smaller, but it looks well built. If it is like the Remington shavers I've had, it should last a long time.
