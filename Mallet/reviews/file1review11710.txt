review/text: This was a lot easier for us to buy the bigger pack online, instead of going to the store so much because they only come in six pack. My son is an extremely picky eater and this product has helped to fill in the gaps and helped in calorie intake. He loves the vanilla flavor, and the added fiber helps as well.
