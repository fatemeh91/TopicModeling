review/text: Let me first state that I have no criticism of the product itself; however, I would recommend to anyone trying ox bile for the first time to try the 125mg capsule first (also sold by Nutricology on Amazon).I started taking the 500mg after reading that it helped with bloating post gall bladder removal. It did do that, but was just too potent for me, even with merely one capsule a day with dinner.I was concerned there was some sort of reaction with the digestive enzymes and probiotic I also take daily, which I have had great success with and never any problems, but everything I read said each person much figure out the right combination of these products in order to receive the benefits of them.I had also read so much about the benefits of ox bile post gall bladder removal that I ordered the 125mg capsules. I now take one capsule twice a day, with meals, sometimes a third with my morning meal if I have more than my usual oatmeal or hard boiled egg, and my body is tolerating it just fine.After only a few weeks I have already seen some of the positive results I had hoped to see.UPDATE - 8/23/12I wanted to provide an update as to my experience with ox bile 125mg and 500mg. I previously indicated my most problematic issue post-gallbladder removal has been severe and constant bloating. Now, I have it almost completely under control, in large part due to the ox bile.I think for those of us without a gallbladder the most important things to consider when using an ox bile supplement it to take it whenever you eat ANYTHING [along with digestive enzymes], and DOSAGE, and everyone is different. Now that I seem to have it under control I have lost @ 4-5 pounds [most of which was water weight], which being 5'1" is a lot, and even if I do get some bloating [as I still do miscalculate the dose I need] it is minimal and I am able to get rid of it without having to take a water pill, as I used to have to do.After experimenting with dosages I have found the following works for me:2 - 125mg tabs [250 mg total] with most meals at the beginning or shortly into the meal1 - 125mg tab with a light meal or snack.1 - 500 mg tab with high fat meals [almost exclusively at dinner] or if I am drinking anything with alcohol.If I have a few glasses of wine or a couple beers, I will take an additional 250 mgs with any additional beverage [along with digestive enzymes]As a side note, my mom, who is 82, takes 1 500 mg a day [still has her gallbladder] and has lost 12 pounds, doing nothing different.So, get both doses and experiment with the dosing based upon what you eat. The results are worth it!I still have occasional stomach discomfort if I take too much, but its a small price to pay to get rid of the bloating.
