review/text: This is, as it claims to be, a novelty item. After the first use, the metallic finish was visibly chipping off. Although the vibrator worked fine, there is not a wide range of possibilities. It also requires 2 size "N" batteries (included) which I have no idea where to buy from after these run out. I wish I had read the fine print!
