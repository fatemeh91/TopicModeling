review/text: I have used my mask every night for 2 1/2 years and the only sign of wear is the strap has stretched out a little, though it still has quite a bit of adjustment remaining. Except for a little space around the nose, which is pretty easily adjusted, absolutely no light gets through. I'm a side sleeper so I haven't notice the thickness issue with the headband that other report.
