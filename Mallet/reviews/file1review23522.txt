review/text: Tummy Fiber is one of the few dietary fibers that actually works for my constipation -- and that also does *not* create gas and bloating (due to fermenting) in my lower intestines. It may not be cheap, but it took me two months of testing other brands and fiber types (since my normal brand, Citrucel, was taken off the market), to find this particular combination of efficacy and lack of side effects (gas). The taste is somewhat bland, so I like to add a few packets of Crystal Light lemonade drink powder to perk up the taste. Another positive aspect of Tummy Fiber is that it is non-viscous, so it doesn't feel like you're swallowing a glassful of liquid goo!
