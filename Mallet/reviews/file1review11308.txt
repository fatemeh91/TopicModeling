review/text: I am looking at the description of the item and at the picture. The description says "180 capsules". The product label in the picture shows "90 capsules". The Solaray web-site shows only one packaging option for "Yeast-cleanse" and it is 90 capsules.Isn't that confusing? If it is indeed 90, I could buy it cheaper at a local Vitamin Shoppe.
