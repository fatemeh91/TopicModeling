review/text: This is just as good as the name brand splints, the only difference is there are no directions printed on them. Other than that the colors are similar and it's use is exactly the same. I was able to fold it up and stuff in in my medical bag. To save money you could buy 1 of the name brand splints with the directions printed on them and buy one of these and you'd be set. For the price I can't complain, as long as you know how to use these splints. ( in "V" or "T" shapes ) Comes rolled up but maybe folded up ( as I did ) to store.
