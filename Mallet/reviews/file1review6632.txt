review/text: Here is my story: I suffered from excruciating migraines all my life. I visited physical therapists, chiropractors as well as regular doctors. I saw all the good reviews for this product. I knew from what I was told by doctors that daily massage would be very helpful to relieve the pain I was experiencing. Well, I could not afford that kind of care. So in desperation, I ordered this product. Right away, I was able to massage away a 'real killer' by using this cane at the back of my neck and on the shoulder blades. Please consider purchasing this item if you suffer from migraines. It's a medication-free way to find relief.
