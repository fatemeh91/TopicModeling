review/text: I have Hypothyroidism and was so excited to get this after doing tons of research. I have come up with sad results, I first started to take 2caps at bedtime and 1cap in the morning. I was quickly stricken with horrible migraine headaches for the entire 3 days I took that amount. So, I cut them back to once a day at bedtime with no headaches, and no change in energy or temperature. I will continue to take them until they are all gone and see if there are any other changes.I wish you all good luck with this product.The shipper was great and it was in great condition.
