review/text: I bought this set last year to cut my boyfriend's hair. After three cuts I was a pro. I now cut my boyfriend's hair on a regular basis. I also cut my brother's hair and my friend's hair. They are both repeat customers. I only reccommend this for short men's hair or children's hair. It is very safe and easy to use and saves $$$.
