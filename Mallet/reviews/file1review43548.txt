review/text: This product came highly recommended from a friend who used it and had accurate results when checked against the readings in a doctor's office. Not so for me. The systolic readings were 20-30 points high, even after careful reading the instructions, going over it with tech support a couple of times, and crosschecking a few times. The other readings were reasonable, dystolic were 5-6 pts high, and pulse rate maybe 3-5 beats/minute high vs the doctors office readings at the same time. I returned one unit and got another one. Same story, very high against dr measurements. Returned the 2nd one. Too bad it is so inaccurate for me. It is a easy to use unit, good instructions, helpful tech support, and good ergonomics. It also measured 20pts high against the drug store meter, but I didn't trust that as much.
