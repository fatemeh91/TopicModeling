review/text: I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant, you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind.
