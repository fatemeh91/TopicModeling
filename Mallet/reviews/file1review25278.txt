review/text: VERY disappointing. This product worked one time, and after that, after doing as the hotspot website instructed to re-use them by microwaving in water for one minute increments, they looked like clear liquid again, but after sitting for a bit, they turned hard as a rock and are not useable anymore. I wasted my money on these. Too bad they don't work.
