review/text: I have finally found what I have been looking for. A pair of arthritis gloves, that are not bulky or have wires or batteries in them. These gloves fit firmly around my fingers and keep them from swelling. They are comfortable enough to wear all day. And they get warm and stay warm, I assume using my own body heat. I wear them at night to keep from waking up with huge fingers and they are not any problem to sleep with. I would recommend these to anyone that has arthritis and especially has problems in the finger area. That has been my main area of concern. They can also be worn during the day and so far have not hindered me in any way. Finally, a good product for arthritics.
