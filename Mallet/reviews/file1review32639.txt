review/text: After reading so many articles about the Acai Berry...I went looking for a powder form to add to my strawberry/blueberry antioxidant smoothie. After finding this at The Vitamin Shoppe (a store I've come to trust)...I bought two containers. They're both empty, and I'm waiting on my next order. You do have to like a strong berry taste to enjoy this powder (I DO)...and it really adds the perfect PUNCH to a smoothie (along with tons of good antioxidants for your body)!
