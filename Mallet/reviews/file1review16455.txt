review/text: Don't know what's in this product, and maybe it's the honeysuckle, I don't know, but this product produces a red rash ring around my armpits. I am allergic to the lemongrass brand of Tom of Maine's as well.I've used various brands of Tom of Maine's for a long time, and -- now, I'm developing allergies? This is ridiculous but true. I have had no trouble with the calendula scent so I'll probably stop trying out new scents.
