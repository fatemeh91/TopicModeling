review/text: disclaimer: I do not work for Schick. In fact, I'm a graduate student, and even on my graduate student budget, I pay for these razors. I give the disclaimer because I often an suspicious of rave reviews, which this is. I usually view shaving as ordeal, something I skip when possible. With these razors, I shave every time I'm in the shower. When I heard about them from a friend, I thought they were frivolous. I bought some for a trip that I didn't want to take shaving gel on, since they're smaller and lighter than taking shaving lotion separately. Now I'm hooked. Incidentally, I normally haul shaving gel around with me because my legs rebel against being shaved with soap. They have no objection to the Intuition razor's &quot;Skin Condition Solid&quot; (the ring of stuff around the razor that feels like a soap with a lot of lotion in it, which I'll call soapy stuff). I get a nice shave with the soapy stuff. The cons: A very minor complaint is that the soapy stuff doesn't wear evenly, and the front wears down before the back. Also, I never used to cut myself with the Gillette Mach-3 that I used, but I've cut myself a few times with this one. I imagine that will pass as I get used to it. Overall, I can't recommend these razors highly enough.
