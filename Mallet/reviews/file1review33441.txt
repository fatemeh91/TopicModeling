review/text: Having spent some time in Germany and being familiar with Merkur products, I was very much disappointed with the quality of this razor. Not only did it have a flaw in the handle, the weight is definitely too light. It's more like a womens razor than a mens. Both in size and weight it is too small. I had one for years that finally gave out and expected a similar product. Surely someone makes a decent twin-trac razor. Returned to Sesto Senso and refunded without problem. Amazon.com informed me they would step up if need be.
