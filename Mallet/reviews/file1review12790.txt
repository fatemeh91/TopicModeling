review/text: Yes, I'm a guy and I found these compression pantyhose were perfect for treating my leg vein problems.My doctor recommended 20mmHg to 30mmHg compression stockings to help prevent additional blood clots in my lower leg slightly varicose veins (which up until my recent episode have not given me any problems). Doctor said calf/knee high socks would be good, but full length are best. Since I had some slight pain in my inner thigh superficial vein I decided to choose the full length.Previously with the hospital issued thigh high stockings I found some discomfort and skin irritation due to the stay-up band--These were Jobst brand, but the plain "hospital" white, blue stitched open toe with a rather narrow elastic band with silicone on top.When these new Jobst pantyhose arrived I was eager to try them. They are a bit difficult to put on compared to individual stockings, but I stick my foot in, then unroll/pull the pantihose up to just above my knee and leave there as I switch to the other foot and repeat. I do this lying on the bed on my back with feet up. After I have both sides above the knee, I stand up and pull the remaining up high on the thigh so the crotch is high up as it should be.With these pantyhose there are no tight, uncomfortable cut-off points that knee and thigh high stockings have, just a smooth transition from the waist to the leg compression region. They may slip down a bit during the day (especially if you did not pull up high enough when first putting on), but it's not that bad and easy to fix when you make a visit to the restroom anyway throughout the day.Bottom line, you will find these comfortable for everyday wear, or as relief between wearing the thigh highs which may cause irritation after a couple days.
