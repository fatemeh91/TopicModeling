review/text: We have three of these BackJack Back Support chairs and have had them for a few years. They are great, especially for folks like me who naturally like to sit on the floor to read the paper (the floor is biggest table in the house after all) or watch television. The chair supports your entire back sitting almost straight up at about a 110 degrees when the short end is parallel to the floor and the tall end is up. However you can flip it so that the long side is at about a 40 degree angle to the floor and recline against it with your head elevated. Either way, your seat area or back are cushioned by the padded foam seat which is also covered in durable, washable soft canvas.
