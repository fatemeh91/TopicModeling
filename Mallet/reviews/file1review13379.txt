review/text: I ended up purchasing several of these. We are using a set for my invalid father, and it has been such a wonderful puchase! We had been using three or more store-bought pads at a time, and we have to clean Dad, mop floors, change sheets and pads around 3 times per night. This waterproof sheet/pad holds more and pulls the moisture down away from the top. Also, since we are using this, Dad is less restless. It's much easier to change out - one piece rather than three or four. It also protects the sheets, so we don't have to change the bed every single time. Everyone has calmed down and is receiving more rest!I have one that I use specifically for my cats. They are now cuddling down on this instead of the comforter on the bed or sofa cushions. This protects the sofa or bed from cat hair, as well as protecting it from one cat who sometimes "leaks" during a deep sleep. A "lifesaver" there as well.Holds up VERY well in washing and drying. I would highly recommend this product to those with incontinence problems of any kind. It was well worth the money.
