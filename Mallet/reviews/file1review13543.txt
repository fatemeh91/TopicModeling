review/text: Very good heel cushioning, and feels great in my high arch , but I still have some ball/front of foot discomfort/burning after a couple of miles, so I am not sure how much it changes your stance or posture to a more posterior muscle balance. They are great in my sneakers but the depth of the heel cushion does not fit in any of my dress shoes for work; so good for sneakers, hiking boots, heavier day to day shoes. Overall a good insole, don't know that I have found the perfect one though. Do feel a workout in my butt and back of legs, but that could be the workouts and not necessarily the insoles. Have only had them 3 weeks, so will evaluate more as time passes and they have more miles put on them; haven't asked my boyfriend about any cellulite changes - cuz he is only allowed one answer anyway :)
