review/text: I have been using Fertilaid for 2,5 months to regulate my anovulatory cycle and I've started to see that it really works. Here is my story: I used to have a period every month before starting birth control pills for contraception. 6 months after I got off the bcp, I started to have weird periods (no period for 4 months, then a non-stop period, used provera, then no period again). Obviously I was not ovulating. My ob/gn suggested bcp again and told me to come again when ready to get pregnant by Clomid. She thinks I have pcos, although I don't have many of its symptoms except no ovulation, high LH/FSH ratio, and multiple cycsts in the ovaries. Anyway, instead of doing that I wanted to try these pills and during the second bottle I noticed I am having fertile cervical mucus, breast tenderness which were not there before, my constantly high LH started to behave well, and finally last month I had a period of my own! This month also I am experiencing the same signs. If you are planning to use this product, just be patient and use it for at least 2-3 months. Hopefully you will see the results soon! Good luck!
