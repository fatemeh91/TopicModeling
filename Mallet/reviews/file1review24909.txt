review/text: My cycles were crazy after going off the birth control last April and kept getting longer. I was having 50 day cycles finally. I started the pills (2 a day instead of the recommended 3) at the beginning of December after my last cycle and got my period at the beginning of January. I had a 35 day cycle! I am very impressed already, especially since I only took 2 pills a day. I'll keep going and hopefully my cycles will be back to normal even without it.*********** EDIT************I ended up getting pregnant 4 months later... :)
