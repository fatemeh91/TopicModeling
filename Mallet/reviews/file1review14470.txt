review/text: You remove the inner packet, toss it in the microwave, then put it back into the booties. When the inner packets come out of the microwave, they're hot and moist and can be a little tricky to put back inside the booties. These smell like lavender and clove, which may be offensive to some, but I dont mind it.The booties are comfy and they do keep your feet warm. I just wish they had warming packets on the sides and top as well as the bottom. The bottoms of my feet get toasty, but the top parts sometimes stay cool. I wish the heat were all around, but for the price, these work.
