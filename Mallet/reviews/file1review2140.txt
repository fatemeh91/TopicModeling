review/text: I looked at all the online stores as well as locally for this. It is fantastic for removing stains. I had several badly stained coffee cups which now look like new. I've seen several posts about using other things to remove stains but Dip-it works faster and requires no effort on my part other than boiling some water to dissolve it. I was even able to make several frying pans shine again. What sold me though was an old coffee carafe that I was ready to toss out as the stains inside of it had been there for a long while and nothing would remove them. I found an old box of dip-it under my sink and decided to give it one last effort. WOW-- All stains gone in minutes and the carafe looks like the day I bought it.
