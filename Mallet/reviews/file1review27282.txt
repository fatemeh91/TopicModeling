review/text: Like the title says, it's the best whey protein supplement for the price and Amazon has it for the best price. Any other store is going to charge you around $15-$20 while Amazon will deliver it to your door for free. It mixes up easily (I use cold water and a spoon), and it tastes surprisingly well; easy to get down just in water. Now if you really want it to taste good then try it out in a blender with fruits and maybe some OJ, milk (almond milk is awesome), etc...But hands down I've been using this for years and it's the best. Don't fall for the hype of over priced junk. Protein is all you need to gain muscle and you can gain it just fine without this product. But this product is great for post workout and can do what regular food can't in that short hour after your workout when you body is begging for protein. And it's just the best way to get those extra grams of protein in, in between meals.Consider their Casein protein for bedtime protein too as it digests slowly throughout the night.This is the best guys, I speak from many years bodybuilding experience. Just look at the reviews for yourself and decide.
