review/text: I ordered this maternity belt after much research. I was pregnant with my second child and was an avid walker. The bigger I got, the more my lower back and lower abdomen ached. This belt was great. It completely relieved my aches while walking so I started wearing it to do household chores. I highly recommend this maternity belt, just make sure to always wear a layer under it to keep from chaffing.
