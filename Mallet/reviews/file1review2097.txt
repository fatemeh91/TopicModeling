review/text: VERY NICE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY. HOWEVER, IT GETS IN THE WAY OF THE WHEEL WHEN YOU TRY TO ROLL AROUND. I JUST FLIP IT AROUND TEMPORARILY AND PUT IT BETWEEN ME AND THE SEAT. THEN YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS FALING OUT. BE MUCH NICER IF POUCH CLOSED WITH VELCRO STRAP OR ZIPPER.I would buy it again as it is a bargin at $15 for 2 pouches.
