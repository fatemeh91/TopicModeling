review/text: I found the same thing as the other reviewer. I only bought two: Black (x-heavy) and Blue (heavy). My thinking was that I'm a big guy so I might need the x-heavy one, but I wanted to make sure that I got one that worked (for tennis elbow) so I also got the next one down on the force scale, the heavy one. I was surprised to find that the Blue bar that was supposed to be easier was harder to bend than the Black bar. Both bars are too stiff to be used for tennis elbow. Having wasted my money on a product that didn't come close to working I'll try once last time with the Thera-Band product (hoping that I pick the right one).
