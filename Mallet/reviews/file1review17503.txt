review/text: I thought this will be another low quality trimmer in this range. But I bought it because I read some nice reviews. I really like this trimmer. It does everything that trimmer needs to. The best thing is it is rechargeable and a good battery which lasts for long time. Last time I had a trimmer whose battery couldn't last for 1 trim even. I highly recommend this product in mid 10s range.
