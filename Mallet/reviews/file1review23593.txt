review/text: This fruit peel does work pretty good and doesn't have a burning sensation...at least on me. It was easy to use and did make my skin look brighter/better the next day. The only negative was the amount they give you for the price you pay :( It's a very small amount. I've purchased pumpkin peels, etc. and the products were about the same performance wise, but greater in quantity.
