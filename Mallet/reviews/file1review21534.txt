review/text: I had been looking for these replacement heads for a couple years, being very frugal with the few I had left. I don't know why it took me so long to think to check on Amazon, but I'm glad I did. I thought I was going to have to get a new toothbrush for a lack of replacement heads. I really don't think there is any difference between these and the ones I bought at a store. I am very happy with them. They fit my toothbrush perfectly.
