review/text: This vibe gets the job done fast. It's pretty big but all you need is some good lube. I like the fact that it's hard the ones that I have that aren't as hard don't get the job done as well. The only thing I don't like about it is that is has a plastic/rubber smell but after a while it's not so bad. Over all my favorite rabbit so far.
