review/text: This stuff is utterly useless as dishwashing detergent. I suspect that we would have better results if we used nothing at all than with this brand. It leaves a nasty cloudy film on the dishes...especially the glasses...that can not only be seen, but also felt. The glasses actually come out looking much worse than when they went in! It doesn't even come off easily when washed by hand afterward. We used if for a while and thought something was wrong with the dishwasher until we tried another brand. Tried it again when we ran out of our preferred brand the other day. We live in a part of the world where water is naturally soft, so we don't even have hard water to blame it on. Definitely not using this again. Wish I could find some other use for it...we have 3 bottles of the stuff left and I hate to just throw it out...but we will definitely never use it again for "cleaning" our dishes.
