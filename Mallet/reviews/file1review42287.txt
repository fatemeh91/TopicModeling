review/text: I ordered Source of Life because I wanted to try a liquid instead of having to deal with so many bottles of different vitmains and minerals.I dont' have to swallow so many pills...just one cap full of the liquid!This is simple and it tastes great. I don't have anything negative to say about this product except that it does advertise to be a 32 0z. bottle. My bottle is a 30 oz. size. But compared to other places this is the best price for the Source of Life. I can tell a difference in energy level. It is a good product.
