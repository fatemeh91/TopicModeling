review/text: I am full time college student and have been using this product on and off for a couple years. I find it extremely helpful when studying new concepts that for some reason have a hard time "sticking". I use it while studying for tests to help improve my ability to focus and concentrate on the material... and actually retain and recall it while taking the test! I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with this product although I might mention that a few of my friends who have taken this have had jittery reactions to it. Come to find out they both have a blood type of "O". I am "A+" with no side effects. Don't know if it's a related occurrence but just something I noticed. I would highly recommend this product but make sure it is complimentary with other medications you are currently prescribed.
