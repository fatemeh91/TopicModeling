review/text: These vitamins are great - usually prenatal vitamins make me feel queasy if I don't take them with food but these are gentle enough that I can take it a few hours after a meal and still feel fine. Only having to take one vitamin a day is also a huge perk. I found these vitamins in my second trimester but I wish I had had these during the first trimester when I felt so sick! I'll definitely stick with these vitamins for the rest of this pregnancy and any future ones.
