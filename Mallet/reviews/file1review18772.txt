review/text: The hardest part of using this was figuring out where to put it as I lost the owners manual to my clippers. I found a link online with instructions that I used and the grease worked as expected. This tube is very large compared to the one that came with the clippers and will probably last for the rest of my life or the rest of the life of the clippers which ever is first.
