review/text: I usually hate protein shakes, protein bars, meal replacement bars, etc. You name it, I think they pretty much all taste disgusting.Well I can't say that anymore. Optimum Nutrition Gold in French Vanilla Creme tastes GREAT, especially when you use milk instead of water (I'm trying to gain weight, so I can get away with that).It tastes good enough to be a shake on its own, which means I'm more likely to actually stick with it through out my weight training. Could the rest of Optimum Nutrition's supplements possibly taste this good?
