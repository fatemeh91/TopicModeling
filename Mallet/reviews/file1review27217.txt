review/text: Here are my ratings for the flavors that I've tried so far.Extreme Milk Chocolate: 5/5 starsFrench Vanilla: 4/5 starsDouble Rich Chocolate: 4/5 starsVanilla Ice Cream: 4/5 starsCookies N' Cream: 3/5 starsChocolate Mint: 0/5 starsI'm a chocoholic, and Extreme Milk Chocolate is by far my favorite; I love the taste. Coming in 2nd place is Double Rich Chocolate, Vanilla Ice Cream, and French Vanilla; they are all very good. Cookies N' Cream comes in 3rd place because the "cream" flavor can be a bit too strong; I find it helps when you mix it half and half with one of the other flavors. And Chocolate Mint is last because it has an absolutely horrid bitter aftertaste; avoid it at all costs.If you are looking for an inexpensive source of protein to meet your daily requirements that tastes good, then I highly recommend this product.
