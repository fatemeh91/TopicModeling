review/text: It's great, and I love the coloring. It would probably have been a better choice if I had ordered a larger based cane, but I've learned over time that a tall walking 'stick' (cut from my crepe myrtle bush/tree) provides the best support for me. I have one at the front door and one at the back...I seem to function OK inside the house.One important tip about the quad cane....try different settings as to height. A pro did it for me and it was a great help when she adjusted it to a little higher setting.ktOf course, once again, Amazon's quick service was great.
