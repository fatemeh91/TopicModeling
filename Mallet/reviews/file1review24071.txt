review/text: I bought this onsale thinking I'd give it a try since the dual power Spray n Wash is no longer available (ughh!!). This stuff did not work very well at all. I have to agree with the other review which stated that the product is somewhat blobby.. it does not penetrate the fabric and/or stain. It is just to thick of a mixture. It seems to work *slightly* better if the fabric is already wet. You will still experience "runoff" though - as in the product will just run off of the fabric instead of soaking into it. I will not buy this again and I do not recommend it at all. You would have much better luck just pre treating with your regular detergent, or letting the article soak in a water/detergent mixture for awhile before washing in the machine. I feel this SPray n Wash is a waste of money.On a sidenote, I REALLY wish they would bring back the dual action - the bottle that had dual chambers of clear and pink liquid - now that one really DID work on any stain you could think of, marvelously!
