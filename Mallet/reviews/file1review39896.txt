review/text: Good quality product that is easily adjustable to fit different sized people. However, it will only go to a 5' 10" person so if you're 6' or taller, look for something else. These are lightweight, easy to store, and durable. For my weight, they have plenty of stability. The rubber feet are firmly attatched and provide a good non-slip connection to just about any surface. If you're under 6 feet tall, these are excellent. The price, however, is a little steep by the time you pay shipping (doubles the cost)!
