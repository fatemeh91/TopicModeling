review/text: Optimum has continued to make the best proteins on the market today. I have never been dissatisfied with their proteins ever. This particular product is great, been using it for a good while now. The taste is great not bad at all. I have defineatly seen gains using whey protein along with hard work in the gym. Also helps with the recovery process tremendously as well. Optimum totally gets two thumbs up from me, hands down by far the best out there.
