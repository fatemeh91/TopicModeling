review/text: I "had" planter fasciaitis so bad I couldn't even walk in the morning when I got out of bed. My feet would get tired and sore all the time. After purchasing these my life changed! YOU MUST follow the directions on how to use them at first.....GET THROUGH the break in time....it is sooooo worth it. I haven't had any foot pain in well over a year! I now have 5 pairs of walk fits for all of my shoes and boots.....I couldn't live without them. The nice thing is that every pair of shoes you put on will feel the same because of the walk fits. Try them......you will NOT be sorry!
