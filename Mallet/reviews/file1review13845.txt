review/text: Wow! What an excellent massage pad ... that lasted less than one month. I then bought a second one, because this is one plush, wonderful pad, with everything you could dream of a massage pad being. Definitely the best pad I have ever bought, and I have been using these pads everyday, usually for hours at a time for chronic pain, usually Homedics, and they always lasted for months. I never even returned them even though they were still under warranty because I used them so much, that it wouldn't be honest to do so. The second one of these I bought, one of the motors quit working after one day! For this price - one month? That's just terribly awful!
