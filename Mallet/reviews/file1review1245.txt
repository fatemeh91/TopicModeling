review/text: i absolutely ADORE this product. I am very finicky about beauty products and have bought numerous hair removers- my eyebrows have been through hell and back! i have gotten them professionally waxed, threaded and plucked...and i've tried at least 6 different products at home. None of them worked as quickly or as efficiently as these. And of course, now they are nowhere to be found. I had to buy those stupid hair remover mitts just because i saw "Bonus! free instant eyebrow shapers!" hahaI will definitely be ordering more from amazon now that i know they are here!ps- to everyone who said they are just like scotch tape- you either have really, really thick hair.....or you are not doing it right. directions come in a box for a reason. :-P
