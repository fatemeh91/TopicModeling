review/text: Received Sea to Shinning Sea and am very disappointed. The first disc the sounds vary greatly. First it loud, then very soft so that you are constantly changing the volume. The quality of the sound is poor. I should have sent it back, but I didn't want to take the time, therefore that is my fault. I would be very very hesitant of buy anything else from Reader's Digest Music.Cynthia Towslee
