review/text: I like it. But it does have a few flaws. The smell. It smells like rubber but has a nice sent to it also. The smell sticks around my bedroom for a while too but it smells like a air freshner lol. the 2ed thing is, and this is just my opinion, its a little to flexable. I would like it to be stiffer but on the other had it moves right to my special spot and thats hard to find. Other then that I like it
