review/text: These offer at least as much protection as the disposables and are more comfortable and less &quot;crunchy&quot; (ie they don't make noise like I found the thick disposables did!). They wash and dry well too. My favorite pads, which I would rate 5 star-plus, are called &quot;MilkDiapers&quot; nursing pads. Most of the pad is thin, soft cotton/flannel...and then it has an 8-layer thicker section to absorb where you need it most. Even though they're soft to begin with, they get softer and softer after each washing. I used them for over 2 years and they were still in good enough shape to pass along to friends! They also saved me from having to double up on other thin washable pads which made me look even more odd-shaped than I was already feeling. Here's a tip... after leaking in one of the pads, I often gave that pad to my baby to sleep with, or sent her to daycare with it. My &quot;smell&quot; would comfort her when I couldn't. Best wishes for a happy, enjoyable breastfeeding experience for you and your child!
