review/text: After having doubts about the potency and effectiveness of these eye drops, I switched to Can-C after 14 days. It seems as though, after doing this, I started to notice more change as far as visual performance. But I did an experiment yesterday, that startled me. I decided to alternate between Can-C and Brite Eyes III. After 4-5 drops that day I developed severe redness and irritation, which I had never experienced with either drops before to that degree. This leads to believe that the chemistry between the two drops is somehow incompatible or different. I would also say, from my experience, that the Brite Eyes III drops cause MORE irritation than Can-C.Update March 17 2011: I no longer believe there is any significant difference between Brite Eyes III and Can-C. Even though neither is working for my cataract, I will be using Brite Eyes III in the future because it's less expensive.
