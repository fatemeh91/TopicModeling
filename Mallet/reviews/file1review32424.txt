review/text: I've found this brace to be most comfortable if I remove the metal splints, even for night time use. It keeps the wrist supported and warm and allows a bit of flexibility. The velcro is losing a bit of staying power after being in use for 2 weeks. I've found a brace with a thumb splint to be more useful than this one for my particular kind of tendonitis.
