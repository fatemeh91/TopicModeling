review/text: My son just pulls off the splash guard and wont stay on the chair. I hate the way the seat comes off and it doesn't slip back in well. My son just wants to take it apart all the time anyway and tries to sit on it without the seat. The high five thing doesn't really help and he just bumps it with is leg anyway. My son just likes the fact that it's elmo but he doesn't sit on it.
