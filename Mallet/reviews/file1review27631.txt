review/text: It tastes and works great for a good price.I recommend the chocolate its great with skim milk and peanut butter.I drink two 150 gram protein shakes a day and include a whole chicken baked at a local grocery store with seasonings only each day. While taking this for two weeks now I see an improvement already compared to my regular whey.
