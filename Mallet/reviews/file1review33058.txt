review/text: This product has always been recommended for people that want to increase or support their immune response. It has a wonderful blend of vitamins and herbs. I reecommend to take half with breakfast and half before going to bed. It is a great product and Source Naturals is an excellent company.Just be mindful of the vitamin A that you get from this product, do not over supplement Vitamin A for your needs.
