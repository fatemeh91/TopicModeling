review/text: If for no other reason, I can recommend this product due to the fact that unlike Windex, Clorox, and other countertop spray cleaners, this doesn't eat the flesh off of my fingers and continuously have my skin peeling off for days. This product is safe to come in contact with your bare skin!Also, this has a very pleasant smell that makes me think of an opened window near an herb garden.Get those horrible, flesh-eating chemicals out of your kitchen and bathrooms and use this healthy household spray cleaner, instead.
