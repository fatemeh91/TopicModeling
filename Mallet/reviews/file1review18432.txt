review/text: I WAS VERY SCEPTICAL ON PURCHASING THIS DEVICE BEING THE PRICE WAS LOW.AFTER RECEIVING IT, I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT. IT IS SO CONVIENIENT AND ACCURATE IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON WHEN TO BLOW. I NEVER WANT TO DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE BECAUSE I NEED MY LICENSE FOR WORK AND TRAVELING.EVERYONE THAT HAS USED IT SAID THEY ARE GOING TO GET ONE ALSO.I THINK IT IS AN EXCELLENT UNIT FOR WHAT I USE IT FOR, ESPECIALLY THE PRICE! HOW DO THEY KEEP IT THAT LOW? THAT'S ALRIGHT BY ME.NORM
