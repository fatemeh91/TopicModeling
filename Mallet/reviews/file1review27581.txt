review/text: Dont buy Strawberry Banana unless you like a very artificial taste. It does not taste like either fruit at all. I hate it and am mixing other stuff with it just to get through the terrible taste. I rather drink peptobismal stomach ache medication.ON Creamy Vanilla Casein powder is really good though. It blends so well with a few spoon spins and its even better with less water. I eat it like pudding before bed.
