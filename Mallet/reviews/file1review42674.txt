review/text: I placed the new batteries in my digital camera and before the afternoon was over, it was showing low battery on my camera. I charged the 4 of them and hoping for better performance now. Had used Sony 2500 mAh AA Rechargeable Nimh Batteries, 4-pack previously and had better battery power in my camera for them. They recharged well for almost 18 mo.
