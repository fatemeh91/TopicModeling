review/text: The first time I saw one of these was at my dentist's office several years ago. At that time I didn't think much of it. Just another gimmick to take our money. I thought that brushing my tongue with my toothbrush was good enough. But one day I took one of these home, since they were giving away free samples. It sat at home in my medicine cabinet for several more months. Then on a boring Sunday morning, I decided to take it out and see what it actually was. I scraped my tongue with it and a bunch of disgusting gook came off. I was horrified. And impressed. I realized that a toothbrush is not enough to get rid of all the stuff on my tongue. Since then, I've been using these regularly. My mouth feels much cleaner. My tongue looks much, much better.It's basically just a serrated piece of plastic. There are two sides. The soft side was ineffective to me. The normal side seems to be able to scrape much better. I highly recommend this to everyone for a cleaner, better smelling, and better looking mouth.
