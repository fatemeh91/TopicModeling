review/text: I purchased this product specifically for my new vehicle which I use to tote my dogs around. They shed all over the carpet lining in the back and I was hoping I would get results from this machine as it had an attachment designed for the sole purpose of picking up dog hair. The motor was powerful, I will admit that, but I didn't actually see it do anything with all that power! The suction was very poor and was even less effective when using the hose. I felt like I was getting somewhere with the pet hair attachment for a while but it didn't take very long for the spinning plastic bristles to stop working. So after using it for about 15 minutes, and with very little in the chamber (as it hardly picked up anything except some pebbles!), I thought I would see it the filter needed to be cleaned and it didn't. I also tried to clean out the dog hair attachment to little avail. It still doesn't work.I did not have high expectations in the first place and this product still didn't meet me even half way at that! If you plan on suctioning up cheerio's or rice - by all means get this $40 item. Heck I'll give you mine. I went back to using duct tape and haven't looked back.
