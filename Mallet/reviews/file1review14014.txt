review/text: I followed the directions to the T but they would NOT melt! (it says to "use hot water about the same as hot coffee". Nothing!)So after 3 tries of increasing the hot water I finally BOILED water and dipped it in the hot water using a pair of pliers as not to burn myself.Then quickly tried to fit it to my teeth following the directions. A minute later. Not impressed. The plastic is just too thick.Luckily yesterday I found my PROFESSIONAL trays my dentist made that I had thought I'd lost which are so thin and fit perfectly you barely know you are wearing them. Nope. I would NOT recommend the DIY trays. Sorry.
