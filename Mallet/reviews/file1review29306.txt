review/text: I use an oversized mug to drink from everyday. Regular straws are not long enough, and my stores do not stock any longer straws. These are the perfect length and the flexible portion is also longer than most flexible straws. This allows me to have my mug on the tub's edge and bend the straw to my mouth. Talk about lazy days! The straws are cute colors too.The straws are boxed in 24 straw packages which is great. It allows me to store the surplus in my garage without fearing them getting dirty.
