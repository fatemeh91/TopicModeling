review/text: ugh. when i bought this it was around $30.00, and 4 ounces ain't much when you are taking it three times a day. i am really not a believer in any sort of "holistic medicine". i draw the line at lavender oil during a massage smelling nice and that somehow helps you to relax, so needless to say i was not convinced this was going to help increase my supply, but out of desperation tried it anyway. i took it 3 times a day, waited to have anything to drink 20 mins before and 20 mins after until the entire bottle was gone. the only effect it had on me was making me smell like i had just spent three hours stocking shelves at an indian grocery store. i have learned so much more about lactation now. what actually works is more nursing, nursing as much as possible, tying you and baby to the couch and offering the nipple all day long. pumping after feeding helped a little, but increasing my nursing helped more. eventually, i finally had to start ordering domperidone online from canada, which is an actual legit medication and that did increase my supply. apparently it works for some of you, but i'd like to see some actual scientific studies on this stuff. mama's, give yourself time to build your supply, nurse, nurse, nurse. co-sleep and night nurse, don't bottle feed when in public- be brave and just do it, nurse! if all else fails domperidone has been proven scientifically to produce more milk. annnnd don't get me started on those stupid "lactation cookies" recipes that keep floating around. you have enough work with a newborn, keep it simple and keep the baby at the breast.
