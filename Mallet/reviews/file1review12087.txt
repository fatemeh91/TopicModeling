review/text: My sensitive stomach loved this. I tried the Deva prenatal because it has more folic acid but it just made my morning sickness worse. I recommended this to my friend and she loves it too. I didn't even bother finishing Deva. I ordered another gigantic bottle of this instead. It's no bigger than other pills. No smaller as well. I love it as much as one can like a vitamin.
