review/text: LAVILLIN IS CRAP!! I never got to try the "old formula" everyone is talking about, but I can tell about a deodorant cream that is probably the same as the "old formula".Go TO: [...].The first time I tried this stuff it lasted a week!! I'm young, extremely active, and I sweat ALOT. The first time I tried LAVILLIN it lasted 1 day. And every time after that. If you want more bang for your buck go to iherb.com
