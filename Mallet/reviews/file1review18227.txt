review/text: Nature's Way Pepogest Peppermint Oil has been a life saver for me. I have been to several different doctors in the last few years for my GERD (bad indigestion) and eroded esophagus. They prescribed numerous expensive prescriptions that did not work well enough. The first two days I took the Pepogest, I kept belching peppermint, which was good tasting. After the first few days, I didn't even belch it up.Thanks to the Pepogest I am now eating foods I have not been able to eat in years. Thank you Amazon for having Pepogest on your site and delivering it quickly.
