review/text: This is the very best product for window cleaning - fragrance-free, chemical-free, non-streaking, non-polluting - and works great! It can be used for general cleaning as well; the vinegar acts as an antibacterial, so all you paranoid germ freaks can clean without using those toxic germicides and keep your home environment safe. Thank you, Earth Friendly Products!
