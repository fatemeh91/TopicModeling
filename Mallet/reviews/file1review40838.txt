review/text: I've used these razors for years. They don't nick me and I don't have to mess with (or buy) shaving creams/lotions. On a whim, I thought I would see if amazon.com carried them and, sure enough! The price of $6.60 that I paid was way better than the current grocery store price of around $10, and the shipping cost me nothing. I bought two packs of three and saved $5-$6. If they keep these prices, it will be the only place I get them from now on! I love these razors and don't plan on changing brands, so why not save the cash? Incredible deal since I am buying razors all year round!
