review/text: This product works very well whenever "Mother Nature" tells me that I need a little extra help "staying regular." I take two tablets at bedtime with just about any beverage (although I didn't ever mix this with alcohol) and I get the desired effect.It does the job well for me; but read the product directions carefully to make sure that Senna Plus is safe for you to take. As always, if you have any questions, ask your doctor or a pharmacist who knows you and what other drugs you may be taking before using this.I highly recommend this product.
