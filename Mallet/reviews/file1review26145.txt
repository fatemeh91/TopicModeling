review/text: I was definitely shocked by the texture at first, it is grainy and thick - not what I was expecting, especially based on the photo. But I've been using it for a week now and I really love it as an overnight lip treatment especially. I wake up with smooth, plump lips. The smell is good also and I like that it is natural.
