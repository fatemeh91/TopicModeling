review/text: I bought these when I ran out of my other brand of B-12. This B-12 is in the form on cyno cobalamin, which is not easily utilized by the body. The better form is methyl cobalamin. They are sub lingual, which is good and the taste is ok. If they work for you great, but I'll stick with the other form.
