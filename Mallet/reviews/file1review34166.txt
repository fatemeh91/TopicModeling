review/text: First, I recommend eating lots of fruits and vegetables as the best way I've found to avoid hemorrhoids. I had not been eating as many of these for quite awhile, as I was relying too much on a green drink product for health benefits of fruits and vegies. I was using an over-the-counter product for my &#34;outsie&#34; hemorrhoid (I've had very few hemorrhoid flareups but never one protruding before; the over-the-counter product was not working, or, at least, it was taking a long time if it was going to work). This Mayinglong Musk product completely got rid of the &#34;outsie&#34; within a very few days, and I only used the tiniest bit of one tube--so I have enough to last a lifetime, I think! (I bought the three-tube special.) I don't care about the smell--it's a little weird but not offensive to me, and you can't smell it with your clothes on. Now, I'm making sure I eat those fruits and vegies every day--they recommend at least six or seven servings/day.
