review/text: I have owned a Braun 8585 series electric shaver since 2007. It is the BEST shaver I have ever owned. I have been using replacement Blades from Braun and from Amazon every year since I purchased this shaver.I purchased replacement blades this year, as I always do, once a year. I was sent 5 series blades. At first I thought it was a mistake, but they fit my shaver.I have now been using these blades for less than 4 months and they are DULL, DULL, DULL. They do NOT shave like blades I've received in the past and it is becoming a TORTURE DEVICE.I now have to spend 20+ minutes every morning shaving to get the desired results and my skin is left red and tender every day. The blades pull my beard and it is painful.I don't know if the quality of the blades has been compromised, but I have to tell you, I have to replace these blades in less than 6 months of use and THAT is NOT right.I would be hesitant to order these blades. They do not last long.
