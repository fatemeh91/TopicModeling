review/text: I have a special diet (I have celiacs and I'm also a vegetarian) and it's very hard to find a vegetarian vitamin that is also gluten free. All the vitamins at health food stores say you must take at least 6-8 a day! I could barely get 2 a day down because of my morning sickness, so I was worried that I wasn't even getting enough nutrients. This vitamin works the same as its "6 a day" relative that you can find in natural grocers, however, it's just taking one a day. I found it to be very gentle on my stomach (it didn't make the morning sickness worse) - and it tended to give me more energy and calm my stomach, especially if I took it early in the day, like during a mid-morning snack.The tablets aren't that small, but they also weren't too big, and I didn't have a hard time swallowing them (most of the time). I also really like that there aren't a bunch of weird additives, and questionable ingredients, like a lot of vitamins do.All in all, I really love this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone, especially if they have dietary sensitivities like I do. It is a little pricier than non-natural brands, but it's quality greatly outweighs the price.
