review/text: The problem with this caliper lies not in the product itself but in how hard it is to take consistent measurements. I don't doubt the caliper's accuracy, but I've tried measuring myself over and over and the values I get vary by as much as 15 mm. The instruction manual that it brings is far too basic and does not give a clear understanding of how to take measurements. I believe there are manuals for sale that are supposed to help you get consistent values, but I don't own one myself. Without such a manual, I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere. Also, the product description states that you can take measurements yourself, but unless you have four arms, it is impossible to do without someone to help you.The Myotape, on the other hand, is very easy to use and will give you accurate measurements every time. It is the only reason I rated this product with 2 stars instead of only one. You are better off buying the measuring tape by itself.
