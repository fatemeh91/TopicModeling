review/text: My eye doctor recommended this vitamin althouigh only half the daily recommended dose on the package. This was unusual, because he has never recommended any product for eyes that is not a prescription. I think it is helping but users should be sure not to &#34;OD&#34; on supplements--users should compare contents and dosage levels of all vitamins being taken.
