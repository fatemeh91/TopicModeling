review/text: I like the taste of these protein shakes and love them esp. either before or after a workout. It has helped keep the weight I lost working out, off! I enjoy the "lite" versions of these, or if I can't find them at a cheap price, I will take a regular packet and divide it in half and put a splash of skim milk or lite soymilk in it! Yum!
