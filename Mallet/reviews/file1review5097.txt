review/text: I went looking for a protein powder as a supplement to my cycling workouts. Almost all the products out there have sucralose or other artificial sweeteners etc. (why would you want to eat those?) - This one doesn't. The ingredients on my container say Cane Juice. I have seen other reviewers say it contains Strevia but I don't see that listed as an ingredient, so ??? This product tastes great. The container says to put it in a blender with ice. I do this, with a frozen banana, ice and some rice milk and blend for perhaps 90 seconds. What comes out is an amazingly thick, rich "shake" - highly recommended.
