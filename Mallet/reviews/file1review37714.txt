review/text: I've been having misadventures in the wild and woolly world of waxing, lately. The other day, I went to a salon and had my crotch deforested, and then I biked home. Here's a word of advice: if you ever bike to a bikini waxing, make sure you are not wearing a miniskirt. When I got on my bike to come back, I was fine, but then I stood up on the pedals to go a bit faster, and, well, I guess there was a teensy bit of wax left on my unmentionables, because there was a ripping sensation as I stood up. My bike seat waxed my groin! Yeowch!When I got home, I put some aloe gel on my poor, aching skin, and it felt much better.The next day, I got the ludicrous idea of waxing my own armpits. I had a cold wax kit left over from my last misadventure, so I figured I'd give it a try. It didn't work very well, and after about half an hour, I gave up and started using tweezers. I got most of the right armpit done, and it's still swollen, red, and awfully tender. My left armpit still looks like a deciduous underbrush. My pit was so sore, I didn't go to karate last night. Just the thought of chambering punches made me wince. Do not buy a Nair cold wax kit. It is a waste of money and time, and it hurts a lot, too. Pay the little bit extra and go to a salon. The fondue pot wax works much better, and the pain isn't as severe.Nonetheless, I will admit the accompanying wipes do a lot to soothe the skin immediately after the wax attack.
