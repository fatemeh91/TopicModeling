review/text: I have tried many protien powders and this is by FAR the best tasting yet. I have the double rich chocolate and the vanilla ice cream flavors. The vanilla isnt that great though. The chocolate on the other hand.....by far the best. I use half a cup of water and half of milk, half cup of ice, and blend it for about 5 minutes to make it really thick. I found the longer you blend it and the thicker it gets the longer you will feel full. Its also really good if you add a banana too. It taste more like a dessert than a protien shake. Its delicious and I highly recommend it!!
