review/text: I bought this product after seeing it on a talk show and reading the rave reviews. I really wanted something to cleanse my intestines after being pregnant. While pregnant, I was constantly constipated and never really watched what I ate...from burgers and fries, to chocolate and cookies and l loved all things fried. Regardless, my twin boys are healthy and came out at 5lbs each. Anyway, I've been using this product for about 1.5 months and its working, I think. The directions say to use a heaping scoop full each day, which I did for the first month and I was going to the bathroom once or twice a day, then I stared going 3x a day. My butt hurt from all that going, so I reduced it to a level scoop which sent me to the bathroom the same amount of times, sometimes even 4x a day. So, I reduced it to 1/2 a scoop, which seems to be working better for me...going twice sometimesAs for the taste, yes, it tastes horrible. I took it with OJ (8oz & 1 heaping scoop) oh man it does taste like the bottom of a pond...not like I tasted the bottom of one before. But what seemed to work best is 8ozs of a berry juice ( try Juicy Juice) and a 1/2 scoop ...it masks the taste better. I must say...it's amazing how much waste is in my body. I really feel the difference, I'm never bloated or constipated by darn I fart a lot...
