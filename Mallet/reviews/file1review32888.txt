review/text: I've had more luck with this product than with any other. I'm kind of surprised at the taste complaints - I almost find it to be a bit more minty than sweet, and I do not prefer really sweet teas.It works better than any pill I've ever tried. It's effective without being violent. It's not a product I use a lot but knowing it's there in the cupboard for a sure fire solution any time it's needed is a "relief."
