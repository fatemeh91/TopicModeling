review/text: Due to a blood clotting disorder I needed to find an early pregnancy test. After using EPT, First Response, and Clearblue Easy (all which claim you can test 5 days early) and getting negative results, I decided to use this particular test the same day and I got a positive with this test! My dr. confirmed my results that same day! I have recommended this test to all my friends
