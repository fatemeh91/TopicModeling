review/text: I have a box full of 40 year old negatives and had hoped the lumiloupe would magnify them enough to identify the people but it didn't help. When the lumiloupe is over the negative there's not enough light coming thru. If I had a light box it might work but I have a limited budget and was trying to find something inexpensive that would work. The lumiloupe does work as a magnifier for other things like stamps, reading the tiny writing on the back of some products but didn't work for my negatives.
