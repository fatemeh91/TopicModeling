review/text: I temporarily needed a sheet protector for our king sized bed after my husband returned home from a hospital stay. The Priva Ultra Plus worked perfectly. I ordered two so I could launder one and keep one on the bed at all times. It laundered very nicely, was soft enough to be comfortable and large enough to cover the entire side of the bed.
