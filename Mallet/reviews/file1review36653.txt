review/text: Good things do come in multiples of 3. We have been using Irish Spring Soap Bars for years. I must admit that I was enticed to buy my first bar by those alluring television commercials. I bought a bar and I was amazingly pleased. I loved the scent and also the way this soap really removed dirt. It also has staying power for reducing body odors for extended periods of time. I truly feel clean and refreshed after each use of this product. Another important feature about this product is the fact that the manufactures have not attempted to improve the product. Instead, they have maintained the integrity of their product without significantly tampering with it. They have offered alternatives scents but have still kept the original available and untouched. If you have a good thing going, why change it. This is a staple bathroom product in our household. My whole family loves Irish Spring Deodorant Bath Bars. This 3 pack of 4.5 ounce bars is an economical and wise choice.
