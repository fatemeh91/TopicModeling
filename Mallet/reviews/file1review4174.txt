review/text: I am not sure these blades that get sold in Amazon (or Walmart and Safeway for that matter) are authentic. Or they are a inferior quality. I have found the same blades at Kroger to be great or ones that come packaged with a promotional body wash etc (those are likely authentic). I am not sure what the deal is, but there is something fishy!
