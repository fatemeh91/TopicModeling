review/text: My doctor recommended that I get more protein and said whey would be the best 'whey' to get it.So I tried a cheap brand of the chocolate flavored kind and found that all the artificial sweeteners were making me irritable and edgy. So I thought I'd try the 100% whey without all the extra added junk.I was afraid how it would taste, but it's not too bad, and best of all I don't get grouchy!!I mix a scoop (one serving) it in a glass of whole milk.I love chocolate so I tried added a bit of unsweetened cocoa powder. The cocoa powder can be hard to mix, but after a little bit of work, it taste good, too.More information: The 1.2 lb container makes about 19 servings and gives you 50% of your daily need of protein.
