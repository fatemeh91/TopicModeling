review/text: My daughter brought me a sample from the health food store...I tried it, it worked, then I bought a bottle. The first few times the impact of taking it was pretty strong...it relaxed me, put me to sleep...and in the middle of the night I awoke again to find I could hardly open my eyes! It still works, but it won't if I eat chocolate or sweets before bedtime. On occasion, it doesn't work no matter how many I take...but then again my mind can get pretty busy and at those times, it has little impact on my sleep. So, there are times when it helps...and times when it doesn't...but I'm still happy I have this product...it worked better than warm milk, melatonin, herbal teas (sleepy time and camomile)...and sleeping pills which I tried once...I would suggest you try it and find out for yourself how it helps your body to relax and sleep...
