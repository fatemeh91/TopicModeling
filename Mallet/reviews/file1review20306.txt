review/text: I would give these a 5, but I know this product is made as a diaper and I have never used them as such. But someone recommended them to me as burp cloths, and they're all we use! Fancy, pretty burp cloths aren't nearly as absorbent or quick-drying, and I don't feel bad about using them to wipe up whatever mess needs to be wiped up because they're just utilitarian cloths! They wash out pretty well, too. I hang-dry them, and they're still going strong after 3 months.
