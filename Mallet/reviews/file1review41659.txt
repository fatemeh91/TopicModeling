review/text: This is an excellent product, in my opinion. Here are some of my notes:1. I have used my Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush for about a year without any problems.2. The toothbrush digitally indicates when it needs charging.3. The charge is relatively long-lasting. (I have noticed that my battery indicator will blink when it is low and will continue to blink once plugged in although it is charging at this point).4. The base station has a small footprint, with a place to store the toothbrush heads.5. The portable charger takes up little space, and is especially useful for travel.6. The toothbrush indicates a smiley face at the end of your two-minute clean.7. It will also show a toothbrush head when it is time to change to a new head.8. The toothbrush promotes two-minute cleans, 30 seconds for each quarter of the mouth. The toothbrush pulses and indicates a change when it's time to switch position in the mouth.I have no problems at my dentist visits, and I know that I am doing a great job with this toothbrush. I now use this toothbrush with the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet for an exceptional clean.
