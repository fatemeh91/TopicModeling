review/text: I've read that cutting a time-release tablet destroys the time-release properties, but these pills when split work even when split.I received my bottle yesterday and tested it out by cutting the tablet into quarters. Went to bed at 10pm and woke up before 6am. Perfect. Before I was taking a non-TR and a 6-hour TR melatonin pill. With thenon-TR, just the regular immediate release pills, I'd wake up 3 hours later, having to take another dose for another 3 hrs of sleep. The6-hour TRwas just too short a duration -- in bed at 10pm, wake by 4am. The 8-hour is perfect.Just a warning, the pills tend to crumble when split.
