review/text: I love the fact that it helps with many kinds of screws, which is something that was hard for me to find in any store, they usually sell the phillip screw driver type, but this one you can use it on any kind of glasses and screws, including the nut type, and it is small enough to carry with me in my purse. It comes with a magnifying glass and extra screws.
