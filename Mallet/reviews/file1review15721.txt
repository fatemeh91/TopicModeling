review/text: This Pen/Pencil is fairly amazing; not perfect, but close. Having three writing options, without weighing down your shirt pocket is great. I don't carry a purse, but imagine it would be a great benefit to have just one "pen" in your purse.... just reach in and grab it, knowing it's going to do whatever you need it to do.The black and red pens are both fine point, but flow very smoothly, unlike many fine-points. The pencil works flawlessly so far. It is designed so that you don't have to take time to fully retract the lead before you retract the pencil tip. I would prefer a wider/larger eraser, but the slim contour sacrifices the diameter to increase looks. The eraser may not last quite as long, but it works well. The twist-on eraser cap is slightly harder to get off than slide-on designs, but should be a little more secure (harder for it to inadvertently fall off).The twist action to switch between writing instruments is fairly smooth, although not quite as precise as I had anticipated. It requires a little care to ensure the selected pen/pencil is in the correct position, but it seems to be easier after familiarization. My biggest disappointment was the shipping time (11 days), but that was my fault; I've made the same mistake before, thinking the free shipping would not take as long as it did. Unless you really don't want it quickly, pay a few dollars more and don't accept the free shipping. Even with the shipping fee, Amazon's price is better than anywhere else I found. I'm very satisfied with the multi-function pen, and may consider getting some for gifts.
