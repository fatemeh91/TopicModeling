review/text: I've been using this supplement for about 3 months and I have noticed fine hair coming in on the sides and in the back where my hair has thinned. It has the B vitamins that are necessary to grow hair. I would recommend it for a start. It is not going to have your hair growing down your back over night. Since it is winter now and my hair is in a resting state, the spring will give more visable results. I will come back then and write another review. They have changed from a capsule to a large pill which takes some swallowing but it's not bad.
