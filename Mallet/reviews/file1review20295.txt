review/text: I bought these with the sole intent of using them as burp cloths, since many other reviews have suggested this use. When I opened the package I was shocked at how thin the material is. I can actually see clearly through them! They also don't retain their shape at all after one washing.I wasn't upset at first because I knew I was not planning on using them as diapers. However, I folded the "diaper" in half to use as a burp cloth and the spit up leaked right through! Are you kidding me?I am irritated enough to have wasted money on not-so-great burp cloths... but I think it is terrible that Gerber uses the word diaper on the label. There is NO WAY these could be used as a diaper! The material is like cheesecloth!
