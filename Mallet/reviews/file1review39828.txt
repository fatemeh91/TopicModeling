review/text: The grabber only lasted a couple of weeks. I only used it for papers or other small objects on the floor. For heavier things I use my lawn dust pan with a handle on it. First the rubber tip fell off. Then a few days later I picked it up and the screw had fallen off. This is the second one I have bought. Next time I will buy another brand.It seems like the screws strip and the rubber tip and the screw falls out.
