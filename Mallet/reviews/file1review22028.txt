review/text: This is the best product I've tried. And I've tried plenty since I was a kid. Palmer's lip butter is better than petrolium jelly, burt's bees, chap stick, etc. It's even better than the organic Badger balm.Most lip balms or moisturizers just coat the lips and feel very heavy and sticky and they don't stop the chapping or peeling. Palmer's lip butter feels very light on the skin and has a nice subtle scent. It really stops the chapping.
