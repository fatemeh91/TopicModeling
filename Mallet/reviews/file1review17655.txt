review/text: I had never used a Remington product before so I was a bit skeptical and with a beard trimmer one has to be. You don't want something that's going to rip your hair out, made that mistake already. The Remington MB-200 worked flawlessly. It has a good weight to it, has plenty of length settings and the battery life is great. I have used it probably half a dozen times and it is still going strong... as is my beard. I couldn't be happier. I would highly recommend this product to anyone in the market. You won't be disappointed.
