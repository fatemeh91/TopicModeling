review/text: The shape of this shaver is the same as all of the other gillettes ergonomically. The blades that are close together keep me from accidentally cutting my face or head. Yep, I shave bald so my razors are very important to me. I, also like the single blade that allows me to sculpt my goatee. The blades do give me a close shave. So if it tugs the hair, you should probably use a better shaving cream.Now the things I wish were better about the razor:The blades have a lubricating strip on them that works wonderfully at first and, after one or two shaves, the strip turns white and loses its lubrication. For the price, its not like you're going to throw it away after one shave. The other factor is that the price of the replacement blades borders on rediculous. This is supposed to be inexpensive hygiene tool like a toothbrush or under arm deodorant. These blades cost more than both of them combined. Doesn't make sense to buy the blades when it is just as expensive to let my barber do it for me. The razor itself is decently priced. I would love this product if blades were cheaper.
