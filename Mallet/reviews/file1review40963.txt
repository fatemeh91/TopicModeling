review/text: After watching a TV review made by the local CBS news I decided to give it a try. I lost 15 pounds in 1 1/2 month. It controls my appetite so of course I started eating less, in smaller portions. I also did moderate exercise (walking every other day). Bottomline, it helps if you need to loose 10-20 pounds like me. Only down, it leaves redness in the area you applied it, but in my case it goes away after I apply a new patch in a different area.
