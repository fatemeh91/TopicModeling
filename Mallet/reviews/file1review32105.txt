review/text: I often am a messy eater, who enjoys anything from Tacos from Taco Bell, to Meatball subs from Subway sandwich shops. But, when I have a bad stain on my shirts, I just use my Tide To Go stain remover. I like this a whole lot because this is a very convient and easy way to reduce and possible eliminate the stains you get on your clothing wherever you are. It is easy to use, and it is very affordable. Although there haven't been many convient ways to eliminate stains on the go, as there is with hand sanitizers, I definitely recommend this easy way to clean your image a whole lot.Price: BConvience: B 1/2+Overall: B
