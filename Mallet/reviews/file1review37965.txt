review/text: These plates are sturdy, but I hate the way they stick together. Okay, they don't actually "stick" together, but the way that they lay together when stacked makes it hard to pick up an individual plate. I use these plates for light snacks, pet food, and such, and then wash and reuse them. So far, they've held up great.
