review/text: I bought the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey, Double Rich Chocolate, 5.15-Pound Tub and found the value of this product very good compared to many other retailers. I used this product for about a month (3x daily), using it to supplement my regular diet and workouts throughout the week. I have gained 3-4 Ibs. in that time period. I was expecting better results with this product. Here is my disclaimer however, I weight trained (6x/week) during the entire course of taking this product but did not incorporate any cardio workouts to supplement my weight training. This may have had an impact on weight gained (cardio work is an important aspect of weight training due to the loss of fat that occurs from it). I was hoping to add more healthy weight than just 3-4 Ibs. But please take into consideration your body type, everyone is unique and each person must evaluate his/her make-up when it comes to weight training, cardio work, and weight gain/loss.
