review/text: I get great appetite suppression and energy even during the week before my period starts with this diet supplement.I don't like to let my body get too used to a diet pill because then it seems like it doesn't work as well after I've taken it for about a month or so, so I switch every week. One week on NV and the next on "Fahrenheit for Women", then back to NV and so on. I get good results doing this. I notice the NV does make my hair and fingernails grow faster.I highly recommend NV. The only drawback is I can't take it very late in the afternoon because it can affect how well I sleep but other than that it's GREAT!***Addendum*** October 8, 2012Please note that when I did this review back in 2008 I was talking about the original formulation of NV which they have since discontinued. I've not tried the new formulation but I have a friend who has and also there are reviews here on Amazon that say the new formulation is not working for them and I've not wanted to waste my money on something that doesn't work.Now I use Zantrex-3 Power Crystals. I like them almost as much as the original NV. You can find them here:Zoller Labs Zantrex-3 Power Packets, Zesty Orange, 30 PacketsNote that I cannot take the regular Zantrex-3 capsules because one capsule is just too large a dose for my system and made me feel pretty wired. I don't get that with the power crystals because they come in little stick packets that you add to water (much like Crystal Lite) so I can ingest as much or little as I feel is necessary. I get pretty good appetite suppression with these but I still miss the Original NV and wish they'd bring it back.PLEASE NOTE: I AM IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH EITHER THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS PRODUCT OR ANYONE WHO SELLS IT HERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE INTERNET.
