review/text: This product is what will help keep you beautiful. Get used to people saying, &#34;My you certainly don't look your age.&#34;It feels very smooth on your skin, keeps wrinkles at bay and it has an SPF of 20. What more can a girl ask for? Oh, and did I mention being able to get Retinol at such a good price? How could anyone NOT try it?
