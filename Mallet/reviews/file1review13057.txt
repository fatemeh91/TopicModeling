review/text: This ice pack works wonders! I've tried many types of ice packs and this one stays put and you can keep going with them on. Stays cold for around 20 minutes before you might want to put it next to the skin. After that it is good for another 5 minutes maybe. I have Fibromyalgia and alternate cold and heat on really bad days. This one works well, except it really does not wrap around the neck as shown in the picture. You can, but I found it uncomfortable. You have to store it carefully! Lay it as flat as you can and in the same way it came. I put mine in 2 ziplock bags to prevent any freezer smells and then I put that in Tupperware. Be very careful with the Velcro!! It will stick to the spandex type material and fray it. I've been very careful with mine and it still has pulls all over it. Check out all the other products, they have everything for every muscle group! The cranial cap I had to return.......it was too heavy for my head and with the Fibro, trying to hold it up made my neck muscles kill!! This is worth the money as long as you intend on taking good care of it. Customer service for these guys is great also!
