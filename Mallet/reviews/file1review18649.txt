review/text: I purchased this product because I was looking for a natrual treatment for digestive issues.Saw a piece on TV that this product was beneficial for treatment of Crohn's disease and IBD both of which run in the family.Have been taking for a few weeks. So far there hasn't been any relief. I admit that I usually forget to take all 3 doses per day.The product has has not worked for me. I am not really surprised becaus to date I haven't found anything that helps.
