review/text: This is by far is the best that money can buy. I mixed frozen papaya and frozen strawberries and then throw in a banana and bang. I have my morning breakfast in my togo large plastic tupperware. I really love the stuff. I wish I could get a deal for bragging about it. Because I will be a lifetime buyer.
