review/text: I enjoy the product with water, but it lacks variablility. I used to use costco brand vanilla and decided to try this brand since it was so popular.My mistake. It taste like hot chocolate. I can't mix the stuff with anything because of the odd taste. I would rather have a plain chocolate. My old stuff I used blueberries, strawberries, veggies, and it tasted good. This stuff taste bad with fresh fruit and vegies.Side note my girlfriend loves it.
