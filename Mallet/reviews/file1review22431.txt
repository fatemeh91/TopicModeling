review/text: I was having breakthrough attacks of ulcerative colitis despite being on TNF inhibitors that nothing seemed to quel when I read an article about the beneficial effects of the curumin in turmeric. I took 2 pills a day and my attack abated within days. I've since shared this with an associate that was also having breakthrough activity while on azathioprine and his attack was also diminished. I've also shared my experience with a colleague of mine who's a GI physician. He's tried it on 3 ulcerative colitis patients that were pretty severe. All 3 were helped fairly quickly by the treatment. Be careful if you use turmeric to not get the kind that is mixed with piperazine. Piperazine is an irritant that is used to increase absorption. Ulcerative colitis patients don't need either the extra irritation or the absorption, which would limit targeting of the herb to the colon.
