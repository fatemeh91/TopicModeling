review/text: The Flex-A-Pleasure vibrator is an interesting little toy. It consists of an egg-shaped vibrator at the end of a roughly 5-inch long flexible wand, with the controller being at the other end of the wand. The vibrator is controlled with a variable speed switch, and is powered by 2 N-batteries, which are included. (N-batteries look like stubby little AAs, and might be a little harder to find than their big brothers.)The Flex-A-Pleasure is surprisingly quiet, and works excellently as an "outie" or an "innie" vibrator. The flexibility of the shaft allows you to shape the toy to your needs, though there are limits to how much you can flex it. And finally, a big plus is that it is also waterproof, which means that it can be used in the shower or bath. As for me, I think that it is a fun and interesting toy - perhaps not one you would want to use all of the time, but definitely one to use as a "vive la difference."(Review of Flex-A-Pleasure)
