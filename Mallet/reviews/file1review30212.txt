review/text: After a couple of months, I'm still pleased with this product. I bought it to deal with cat hair and stray litter cleanup. This unit is very powerful, works great on the floors around the litter box- still takes several passes to pick up cat hair from couch and chairs, but it does get the job down better the other similar units I have purchased and discarded.
