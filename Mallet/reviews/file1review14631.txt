review/text: If you are looking for a great xylitol powder, then this is it! I purchased this for myself and a friend who wanted to try using this product in baking for their friends without using sugar. It has a cool mint flavor and it turns up in the baking which is fine if you want that flavor. I use a tiny amount in my tea, but I prefer stevia instead. My friend thought it was great for baking and said it performed great!
