review/text: I am truly fanatic about ORegaSpray and oil of Oregano in general. I only buy the North American Herb and Spice brand, because it is the strongest. I use it for everything. It's highly antiseptic. Read the book by Dr. Cass Ingram, "The Cure is in the Cupboard," for the hundreds of ways you can use these products. It's one of the best kept secrets, and I'd almost like to keep it that way to make sure I always have a supply. I clean my fresh fruits and vegetables with it. You can use the oil or spray. I just spray and rinse. I spray my countertop and sink with it. It preserves my leafy green vegetables for up to 3 weeks after I clean them. It's fantastic for sore throats. At the first sign -just open wide and spray 2-3 spurts on the back of the throat. Even if I've been around or near someone with a cold, etc. I spray my throat for safekeeping. THe capsules are excellent for infections, colds, etc. I'll stop...did I say I was fanatic. It cleans the air in rooms, kills mold.....'nuf said? I make sure my grown kids keep a supply in their homes every winter.OBTW: If it's really good for you, don't expect it to taste like candy.
