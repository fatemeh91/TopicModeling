review/text: This soap is great. I love this soap. It feels good against a body, I'll tell you that. And I'll also tell you that it's gentle. The kind of gentle that says: "I know you have saddle-rash from that horse yesterday, but I can smooth that out." Whatta soap. You can't find that kind of quality in stores.No, soap is best when bought online, and with the least amount of human contact possible. So don't go to the stores, you shut-ins, place an order for a bar of these babies, and shudder at the thought of meeting a stranger...
