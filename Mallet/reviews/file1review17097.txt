review/text: I love this trimmer. The trim guard is at the right levels, easy to adjust and provides a solid cut. The grip is great and it's easy to clean. The only unfortunate side is that there is no charging stand but I manage. Perfect for guys with medium to thick beards who want a keep a nice trim and shape. Great for it's value.
