review/text: This wax didn't melt very well, even when following the directions, which made it very difficult (and even painful) to spread on the areas to be waxed. I tried to wax my bikini area and found it virtually impossible to pull the strip in the opposite direction of growth, since the hair grows in many different directions. Consequently, the hair was painfully pulled -- but not pulled out. I even experienced some bleeding. They provided plenty of cloth and the wax would presumably last through several waxings. Also, it washes off with warm water, as advertised, and there are good directions in the package, and I didn't experience extended discomfort after pulling off the cloth. However, I wouldn't recommend this product, because it's difficult and painful to use.
