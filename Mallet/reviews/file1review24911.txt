review/text: I have always had regular periods and wanted to be pregnant so bad that I disregarded the warnings about excess bleeding that may occur. Well, during the 3 months that I took them, I didn't become pregnant, my periods were still regular and my hair grew really, really long, Lol! I also seemed to have so much extra energy while taking them. In month 4 (my 1st month being off the pills) my period lasted for 2 weeks. It finally stopped for 2 days and I came back on for another week and a half. For the next 6 months, I bled extremely heavy for at least 25 days off and on every month. I went months without sex because my periods were so irregular now and never completely stopped. I was miserable (actually depressed) and just wanted it to stop. I was going through a 24 ct package of pads and a 36 ct box of tampons every couple of weeks. My doctor couldn't find anything wrong and even said that maybe I was just going through early menopause. That was a year ago and all is well now and periods are regular again but I will never forget the 6 months of hell I went through.
