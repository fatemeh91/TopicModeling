review/text: This seems to be a problem with just about all vendors of these Spenco inserts.The websites, including Amazon, list size by women's and men's shoe size.But Spenco does not print that info on the Arch supports, instead they have a numbering system which correlates to shoe size. Many doctors prescribe these by the Spenco Number, 0, 1, 2, etc., not by shoe size. So, when you try to order, you are not sure you are ordering the correct Spenco number that your doctor wants you to use. In my wife's case, the Doc want's her to use a #1, which is supposedly for women's shoe size 5/6, even though her shoes are 9/10! See the problem? The vendors for these products should show both the Spenco numbers as well as shoe size info to avoid confusion and facilitate ordering the correct one. I had to go the Spenco website and navigate to a pdf file to find a chart to tell me what I needed to know, a frustrating exercise made necessary by lack of info at the Amazon site.
