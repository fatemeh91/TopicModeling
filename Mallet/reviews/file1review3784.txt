review/text: I've been taking Mag O7 for the past year and hope I never have to live without it - at least until my system normalizes (which it hasn't in the past 16 years). Just two caps a day and my system evacuates normally and I feel great. MUCH better than miralax - which makes me feel bloated and doesn't work well.
