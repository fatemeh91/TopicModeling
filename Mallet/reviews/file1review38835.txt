review/text: This product does what it claims to do. My brushing was more productive, leaving my teeth feeling much cleaner than normal. Usually after brushing, I can still see white plaque near my gumline. But when I used Plax first, the visible plaque was gone. I would suggest using Plax as part of anyone's brushing routine. And the mint flavor was not too strong, like some flavors are. I liked it!
