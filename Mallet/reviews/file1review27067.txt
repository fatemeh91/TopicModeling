review/text: By far the best whey protein on the market!Pro's: Cheap, lots of protien, goes down easy, mixes well, over 5 g's BCAA's, 4 g's glutamineCons: NoneI will continue to buy this as long as I keep hitting the weights.Combine with creatine by ON and a blender bottle and you will have great success.
