review/text: I'm a little bit of a masochist when it comes to massages, and this lets me use all the pressure I need. I get knotted up from working out and sitting at my desk all day, which is a pretty lethal combination. I've used lacrosse balls, which aren't a terrible option, but this is so much better! I can really dig into the spots that bother me, and it's certainly easier than trying to get a buddy to find the exact right spot (and then to use enough pressure). I use it when I'm working, watching tv or using my stair stepper (multi-tasking!).I can't recommend this highly enough. It looks a little crazy, but after a little trial and error, you'll figure out what works best for you. And best of all: no more begging for back rubs!
