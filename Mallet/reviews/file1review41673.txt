review/text: I had been using an inexpensive battery powered toothbrush for several years but recently read an article about the Oral-b Triumph and how much better it cleaned teeth. After reading I decided to try the more expensive brush and ordered the Oral-B brush from Amazon. I feel that the new toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth. After the two minute recommended cleaning time my teeth and gums feel like they do after I've visited the the dentist. I've been using the brush for several months now and I believe my teeth are now being cleaned more thoroughly and effectively than they were before.
