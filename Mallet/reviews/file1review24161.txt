review/text: I love my Accumassage and Body Back Buddy. I have severe neck tension and headaches and the Accumassager works wonderfully on those muscles close to the cranium and down the neck. My Dad was a Chiropractor and no other DC has the gift my Dad had with neck adjustments. Both these tools are fantastic at working on my trigger points and especially the hard to reach rhomboids and shoulders. Great value and quality. Dad may be no longer with us but I am going to start calling these "My Dads."
