review/text: My Mom gave me some 3/4 superfeet insoles a few years back and they were awesome. These were not even close to being the same thing. What I received was longer, thinner and less supportive than the 3/4 superfeet I'd known and loved. These were also more narrow. I don't have a narrow foot but it's not crazy wide. My heels come over the edge in these. Tried wearing them for a day and the didn't help at all. In the end they were no better than the cheapo inserts from the grocery store.
