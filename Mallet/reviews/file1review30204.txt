review/text: I bought this item because I was getting tired of the handmedown, give it to someone else because I can't use it anymore vacuum cleaners, be they upright or hand held.This product REALLY does it's job! and with a cat and a child in the home, it's just amazing.It is a bit on the heavy side for a petite person who has to clean on their hands and knees, but the overall sleek design and various uses makes that just a minor glitch.I love this product.
