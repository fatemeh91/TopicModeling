review/text: Since there is no size mentioned on the details page, I didn't know what to expect. Just the face of the Boo-boo soother is only 6 inches across(This is not including the hands and feet). The heating pad itself is about 4 1/2 inches across and is extremely hard to put back in the pouch if frozen, because the heating pad must be folded to put back in. (I just don't take mine out, unless it's being washed.) All in All, it sure is cute!
