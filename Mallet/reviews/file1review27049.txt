review/text: I bought the double chocolate flavor. I would mix it into 3/4 glass of water and then add 1/4 milk and the flavor was really good. Almost tasted like chocolate milk. Several people commented that it doesn't dissolve well. I found that it took about 20 seconds of stirring to completely dissolve the powder. Results? I can't really comment on that area. I am new to weight lifting, so it is all gains for me.
