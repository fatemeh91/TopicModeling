review/text: I bought this product two times, from two different vendors on Amazon (Vitamin Shoppe and House of Nutrition), both times hoping to get the Kelp in the photo. Both times I received Kelp with Folic Acid. This is a different product from Solaray and different from what is displayed above.Also, the fine print on the bottle is not shown in the description, but should be. It states:"This product contains naturally occurring constituents, one or more of which is listed by the State of California as a carcinogen and reproductive toxicant." While the listed website doesn't state what the toxicant is, it is likely that it is because kelp is often contaminated (growing near the coasts, where pollution is greatest). Mercury is a possible culprit.
