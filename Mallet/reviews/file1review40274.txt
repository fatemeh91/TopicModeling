review/text: Don't buy anything branded Telemergency! I bought a telemergency 700 for my mother, who is nearly 80 years old. Seems well made, appears to function correctly, although the owner's manual could be improved a LOT.The problem is, NO RESPONSE to my concerns. My mother damaged the pendant with water. It no longer functions. There is no information about ordering a replacement pendant on their web site. I emailed them THREE times and never even got so much as a form letter response. Not a thing!Absolutely zero customer support. Not even a rude, "can't help you"
