review/text: I was unsure at first if it was going to work or not but after a day I did notice a difference.It completely takes away all odor. I had to use half the bottle at first but start taking regular dosage after a couple days. I was alet and it cleared up the skin on my face! I recommend this product to anybody. Its worth the buy. Better than deodarant, mouthwash, and soap....they need to advertise this more. Im definitely a regular buyer...noticed a big difference when I stopped taking it.
