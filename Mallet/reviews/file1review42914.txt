review/text: Great cleaner!!! And smells wonderful! So far I have used this to clean my stainless steel kitchen sink and fiberglass shower.Let's start with the kitchen sink - Fabulous!! We have well water and always struggling with iron and hard water spots. This clearer got rid of it all - without bleach or harsh chemicals. And the smell - heavenly! I find myself cleaning just so I can enjoy the scent. I also feel better using a biodegradable, non-toxic product.Now the shower. Same issues, plus soap scum. Again - great job. This product does not scratch. I used it on all my shiny chrome fixtures - no scratches. Did I mention the great smell...? LOVE IT
