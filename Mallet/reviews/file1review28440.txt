review/text: My husband and I have been using this brand for three years - primarily by adding it to our morning shakes. It is a little on the sweet side but it makes a nice additive to plain yogurt. Also, since I've been pregnant I've been adding to my non-fat milk and cereal to help regulate those hormone-related blood sugar spikes.
