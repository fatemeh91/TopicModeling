review/text: I'm a weight watcher and I absolutely love these bars. They taste great and they help with keeping me on track. I have one on the way home from work and they help to keep me from attacking the cupboards while cooking supper. They are only 100 calories and 1 pt. I buy them in bulk and that way I have one when I need to fill the "sweet tooth" craving. I'm a vanilla and caramel person and these taste great! They have the right amount of protein, fiber, and fat to balance the cravings.
