review/text: I picked out this tool because it had a the most knobs of any other tool that I found. I think it works great. Admittedly I don't use all the knobs but it gives me all the options I need for my own issues. The only problem I have with it is all the knobs have a crease down the middle of them, which can be a little uncomfortable if you press down hard on bare skin. This seems like an obvious thing the manufacture should have addressed. I took a file and smoothed all the heads down and it's much more comfortable. This tool works great for me but admittedly a cheaper tool with less knobs would probably do just as well.
