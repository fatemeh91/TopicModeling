review/text: We got this desk for use with an easy chair. The fit and finish was smooth and assembled neatly. We applied some nice Minwax stain and semi-gloss finish to complete itThis is clearly intended as a desk as it has an adjustable easel surface (Plainly shown in the image).We also modified the leg height to better fit its use with the chair but that was a minor operation for us to do with our tools.I am quite pleased with the product.
