review/text: Looked around and this was the best overall deal (with S&H;) on cherry concentrate. It tastes great. Has various uses, but I add it to my diet, caffeine-free cola to make it slightly less diet and much more appetizing. I used up the 1st bottle quickly and I'm now ordering 2 more.The bottle I got had a slight crack in the cap so I'm deducting 1 star.
