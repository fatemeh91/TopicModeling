review/text: I bought this, but because I was unsure of whether or not it would be good, I also took along my iron. I must say that I didn't use the iron once. It actually worked. Of course, when I say "worked" I mean it was very good for being on vacation. I wouldn't consider it working if I were at home. (my standards would be higher) But then again, that's not what it's for: it's to give you time while you travel to actually enjoy your trip.
