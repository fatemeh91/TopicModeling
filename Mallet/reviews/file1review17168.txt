review/text: 8 months after I bought the trimmer, it will barely hold a charge long enough to trim my beard. When half way through, you can actually hear the blades slow down. Plus this trimmer won't work when plugged in, so it's the rechargeable battery or nothing. Soon it will be in the trash. A big waste of money.
