review/text: This 4 ounce bottle of lubricating oil will go a very long way. I use about 4 or 5 drops per use of my clippers. At that rate, this will last for years.This type of lubricating oil is needed to coat the blades of hair clippers. Otherwise, the blades rust quickly and can be relatively expensive to replace. A little prevention saves a lot of trouble.The way to apply this product is to place 4 or 5 drops on the clipper blades after use. Then wipe or swab the blade and put the clippers away until their next use.
