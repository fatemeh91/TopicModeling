review/text: As a general rule protein shakes really do not taste good and this is no exception. I really expected a much better shake after reading the reviews about how good this shake was. I ordered the double rich chocolate and it had no flavor and was incredibly watery. No better or worse than any other shake on the market I just had higher expectations after reading some of the other reviews.
