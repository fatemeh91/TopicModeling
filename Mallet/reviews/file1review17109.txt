review/text: My bathroom doesn't have an outlet, but the local stores stopped carrying decent, inexpensive cordless beard trimmers, so I went with this one. The value for the price is excellent and so far it's held the charge well.My only (minor) issues are that the curved shape can be awkward when doing a pass against the grain. And It doesn't seem to cut well if only the front edge is flush against the face - the back edge of the guard needs to touch also.
