review/text: I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money.
