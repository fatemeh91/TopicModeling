review/text: I've owned a triple blade rotary Phillips shaver and a Panasonic linear shaver and I reckon the Wahl performs better. It moves over skin and facial contours more effectively and handles the variation of neck hair and stubble with better consistency than either of those. The Wahl is also a much kinder shaver. The Panasonic in particular required careful operation to avoid skin burn. The deal overall is better because of the inclusion of extra foils and a nasal hair trimmer. It scores much higher than the Panasonic for me just in that it comes with a cord option. The rechargeability packed up on my Panasonic (replacing the batteries didn't help) and that was the end of it.The only gripe I have with the Wahl is that the price appears to reflect the quality of manufacture. It feels light, insubstantial and plastic. The other two were solid, weighty and durable. Although the Panasonic and Phillips didn't shave as well, they each lasted a long time (10 years and 15 respectively). That's why this Wahl is only the 3rd shaver I've owned. However, it's less than a 3rd of the price of either of the other two. The Wahl is probably better value overall then, but if I could have that design with the solidity of the Panasonic I would've been happy to pay more.
