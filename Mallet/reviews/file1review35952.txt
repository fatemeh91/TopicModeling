review/text: I've used various Braun electric toothbrushes through the 80's and 90's, and have since bought, used and upgraded through 3 generations of Sonicares. I tried this product seriously not expecting it to be much of anything, but I am completely amazed and impressed. A sonicare gives you that 'just cleaned' feeling right after you use it. This brush gives you that same feeling for the next day or so. It's 6 am as I write this, I haven't brushed since last night, and my teeth and gums still feel slickery like they've just been thoroughly brushed. My breath has no odor even 13 hours after brushing. My previously beloved sonicare is currently resting in my box of donations to take to Salvation Army. Call me cold and heartless, but I found a much better brush.
