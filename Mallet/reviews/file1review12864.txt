review/text: I bought this as a gift for my mum, who works on a computer day and night and is getting on in age. She has arthritis in her elbow as well. She can just heat this up in our microwave for 30 seconds and it's nice heat for those two areas. She really likes it and says that it soothes her eyes and her elbow. I really like this product as it's flexible and versatile. It holds heat pretty well and hasn't broken or torn yet. She's had this product for 3 months now.I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a bit of warmth in a non-traditional area or on the eyes. The mask is flexible with a soft Velcro strap, which allows for securing the mask around different body parts.Good luck!
