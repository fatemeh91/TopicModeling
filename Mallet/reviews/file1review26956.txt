review/text: If your experience with protein powders involves endless mixing, a layer of powdery foam on top, a chalky taste, and an overall grossness that you must overtime develop a taste for -- then this is the product for you. Welcome to the 21st century. Put one scoop of this double chocolate power in water, mix it up, and boom - it is smooth, fully mixed, and tastes delicious, like chocolate milk. You can also mix it with milk, or ice cubed in a blender, blend with fruit or peanut butter, whatever... but the dealmaker is that it tastes absolutely perfect on it's own in water. You'll like it the first time you try it. I did, and I'm the pickiest eater/drinking on the planet.
