review/text: This is a great deal for batteries for all those toys your kids got for Christmas that seem like they each take 20 batteries each!I know that my kids got a Step 2 kitchen for Christmas and it takes 14 AA batteries!This package of 50 batteries is exactly what we needed and they really last. I haven't had to change any batteries yet, which is a miracle in this household!
