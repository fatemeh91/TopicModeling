review/text: Good god, people can write an epistle on the damn fragrance lol. I've raised a few kids and I don't smell a dirty diaper. If some of you do, why the heck are you still using it, not liking it and going on and on? The fragrance isn't a Plumeria tree but there isn't a shower spray that smells amazing, lol. It does the job. We have an extra long all-glass shower, gets sprayed daily. Tried them all (the discontinued daily scrubbing bubble spray-&-leave on worked the best).This one gets the job done. I spray it on well, just a minute before shutting off and getting out . No streaks. Not a spring flower garden, but ok.
