review/text: This pill container is the only one we found large enough to hold all Grandma's pills. It has divided compartments for A.M. and P.M. and a separate compartment for each day of the week which sit neatly and conveniently on a tray. If we go out on a Monday, for example, she simply puts Monday's container in her purse so she has all the pills she needs for that day with her.
