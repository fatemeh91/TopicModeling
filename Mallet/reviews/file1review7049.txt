review/text: Originally I read the other reviews and was optimistic about purchasing this Wahl shaver. I have a pair of wahl clippers for my head and they work great. Not that this shaver doesn't work... it does. Not as well as some panasonic or other makes, but it does work.It's extremely loud.Now let me explain by what I mean by loud. It's like a lawnmower. Earth shattering - who needs an alarm clock? Just turn this bad boy on and you'll wake the neighbors. Get my point?Poor quality materials.This is just a joke really. Made in china junk. Poor plastic and the cover doesn't even stay on over the blades.Shave is just okay.Used another panasonic model and it cut all the whiskers this wahl left behind.Awkward to hold.Very bulky and awkward in the hand. Makes it more difficult to shave, especially since it's a foil. Much too wide! This thing is almost 3 inches wide. Might be good if you're a giant but not on my face.
