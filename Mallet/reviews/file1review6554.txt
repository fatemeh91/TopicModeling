review/text: My massage therapist recommended this tool as an acupressure device I could use on myself. I bought one soon after and it has really helped me get to the knots I develop around my upper back and shoulder blades. I was so impressed with it I convinced my boss to get one for our office and now I hear people singing its praises all the time.
