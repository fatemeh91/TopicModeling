review/text: They are hard to put on initially because of the high pressure 30-40mmHg. But they are well-made and did the job beautifully. They prevented my feet from swelling up in my later weeks of pregnancy. They were recommended to me by a dermatologist. Highly recommend these if you are not getting surgery for varicose veins. Also great for prevention if you are constantly on your feet.
