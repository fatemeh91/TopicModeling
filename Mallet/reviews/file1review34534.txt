review/text: This piece of medieval torture equipment was rated fairly highly, and had some bells and whistles that intrigued me. I had been using a ReliOn Two-channel BP cuff, but it finally gave up the ghost, so I decided to try this monstrosity. This instrument goes at least 30 mm above the last detected heartbeat, with standard stops at 176, 206, and 236 mm. So, after a stressful day, if one's BP has risen to, say, 165 mm, the machine will inflate to 206 mm, or maybe even, just to be sure, to 236 mm. My particular cuff deflates at a rate of approximately 1 - 2 mm per second, so the extra pressure requires at least an extra 15 seconds of loss of circulation to the hand, with accompanying discomfort. On these occasions the total time of blood restriction is (236 mm- 75 mm/ 2mm/sec = 40 sec.(or more)) Since it is now recommended that one take 3 readings to average them out, this means a total of well over two minutes without blood flow, and with accompanying discomfort. On one occasion the thing went to 236, and returned a reading of 128/68. That's a lot of unnecessary loss of circulation.I have since replaced this piece of @#@$%^ with another ReliOn, which also gives me dual channel, irregular heartbeat and averaging, without the discomfort, and with much better accuracy and consistency. Admittedly, it also goes 30 mm above the last detected pulse, but it deflates at the rate of around 6 mm per second, so there's no discomfort at all.
