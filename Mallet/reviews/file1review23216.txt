review/text: Contrary to similar sweepers I owned before this one, it works better on non-carpeted areas than on carpets. The wheels are leveled and allow for easy sweeping on cement, tile, hardwood. It gets a little hard to push forth and back on top of carpets/rugs. It does collect a lot of hair and dust from the carpet, but is uncomfortable to use. Easy to empty. Should come with a brush to help remove hair that gets entangled around the brush, like all sweepers of this kind. It needs to be emptied often, what is okay for this kind of sweeper.
