review/text: This is no doubt an excellent kit and I won't rehash what everyone else has said. But why the fishing gear??? Fishing gear in an emergency kit always makes me laugh. Your first priority is protection from hypothermia/exposure either by clothing, shelter or fire. Second is rescue, being found, extraction, etc. I don't think you'll do much fishing while trying to keep warm at night, and while extracting yourself or being found the next day, as is what happens in most all emergency survival situations. Fishing gear belongs in an extended stay kit or on a planned fishing trip. I know we all think about crash landing in a remote part of the world and needing to eat something after a few weeks so we better have a fish hook just in case we are near a great fishing lake and the fish are biting... not likely. I'll take a compass over a fish hook any day! Make a fish trap instead - fish swim in and they can't swim out. While the trap does its work you can prepare firewood or signal for help. Most people couldn't catch a fish with the best pole and gear anyway, never mind just a hook and some line. PLEASE Help Me Spread The Message... Shelter and Rescue first! The life you save may be your own. Okay, I've done my part. Good luck!
