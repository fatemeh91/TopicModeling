review/text: This is very good for just a whey protein mix. It is low in fat and carbs, so there is no way it's going to taste like Muscle Milk or anything, but this is lightyears ahead of other low carb, low fat whey mixes I've had. It mixed VERY well, and it actually tastes pretty good, downright tasty when mixed in milk! It even includes a healthy dose of glutamine, aminos, and other complexes. And with Subscribe and Save and Super Saver shipping, I really couldn't be happier! I've heard good things about the vanilla flavor too, I'll have to give that a shot next...
