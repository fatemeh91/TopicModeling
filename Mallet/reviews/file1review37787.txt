review/text: If so, then you will want to take this as well.I have been on statins of various types for over 10 years. As time has passed, I began to suffer from fatigue, stiffness and muscle pains.A recent blood test showwed that my CPK levels were slightly elevated, but not so much so that I should be alarmed. I began to research C-Q10 in regards to statins on the web and discovered a lot of information describing how statins reduce natural levels of C-Q10 in the body which leads to all of the above problems. If it is not addressed it will eventually damage the heart.Suprisingly, I found that Mercke had actaully been awarded 2 pattents on statins with C-Q10 included in the medication specificall becuase of the known problems with statins. Why they have never manufactured this combinations is a puzzle, but I have concluded on my own that it is to keep that "bad news" about statuns under wraps; who knows???Here's what happens. All cells have mitocondria to provide the cells and muscles with energy. Statins zap the process that happens in the mitocondria by inhibiting the production of C-Q10 on the body. Without C-Q10, the mitocondria can not do their job efficiently and then the muscles begin to suffer because of this. Your heart is nothing more than 1 big muscle and it will suffer along with eveything else.Within 24 hours of taking C-Q10 my symptoms had virtually diappeared. After 2 weeks I fell 10 years younger as all of my strength and agility has returned.Great stuff! Do your homework on statins and then decide for yourself if this is right for you. Personally, I will not go 1 more day without taking this. i am at 150 mg per day and that seems to be just right.
