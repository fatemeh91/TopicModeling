review/text: These are the best tweezers I have ever owned. They grasp the tiniest of hairs. Just make sure that you position the slant head correctly over the hair and you will never miss. If the angle of the head is slightly off, the hair might slip out of the tweezers' grasp or cut the hair. I am very happy with this product.
