review/text: I bought this specifically for vacuuming my carpeted stairs since my upright vacuum is just too cumbersome to do so. The cord is just long enough, and it does a good job of cleaning the carpet. The beater bar attachment even leaves "grooming" marks like a real vacuum cleaner would. I have only used it one time so far, so I will come back and downgrade my review if I have any problems in the future. For now it is five stars and it already exceeded my expectations for such a low-priced system.
