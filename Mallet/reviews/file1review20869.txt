review/text: Razors will get you the closest shave available. But they constantly cut and make my face break out. . .plus the cost of replacing the blades is up there. About a year ago I tried a triple-foil shaver, which hurt my face more than razors do. So I returned that on the quality guarantee and purchsed a Braun 7526. This was the best electric shaver I'd ever used. It cut close and fast, and everytime I cleaned it, it was like starting with a brand new unit. I recently upgraded to the new 8585 - mainly to try the new foil design. This one is even better than the previous!Some of the differences are:* Feels lighter* With the new foil design, it glides over my face and requires far fewer passes to get the job done* The charger/cleaner base is half the size of the previous* Comes with a handy hard case - instead of the leather/material of the 7526I highly recommend this shaver!!!
