review/text: First off, I think the reviews on this page are confusing. It seems to me there is a mix of people who bought the container of oil and those that bought the pills.I bought the pills and am enjoying them very much. I read news reports on how coconut oil may help with Alzheimers, diabetes and diet so I thought I'd try them since I have issues with all of these in my family line. I feel more mentally focused and alert since I've started taking them a week or so ago. I definitely plan to continue to take the pills.They are large as many people have noted (see my photo uploaded with the quarter), but they are not any bigger than any other large vitamin. The pills, like other vitamins, do have a slight smell if you stick your nose in the bottle. But they have no taste, no after taste and no gross burps later.The bottle calls for 3 pills 3x a day. 9 seems pretty excessive for vitamins. I'm taking 6 right now, 3 with my coffee in the morning and 3 with dinner since I usually only have 1 or 2 meals a day.I would note that taking these has loosened some things up, you know -- down there. It's not an emergency bathroom thing but you probably will be flowing pretty freely when you do go. I'm assuming my body will eventually adjust and become more regular but it's not really bother if it doesn't.
