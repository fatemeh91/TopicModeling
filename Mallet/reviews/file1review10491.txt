review/text: I got my Sonicare toothbrush about 4 years ago. At first, it felt weird using it - getting used to the vibrations and all. Now, I will never use anything else. The clean feeling is great. You just feel the total, deep down clean after you use this. The replacement heads can be pricey, but you can score some really good deals if you keep an eye out. It is very worth the price in my opinion and would definitely recommend it to anyone who can afford it. I plan on buying my 14 yr old son a Sonicare for Christmas this year. He has been asking me for one and I think it is a great investment on a very practical and useful gift.
