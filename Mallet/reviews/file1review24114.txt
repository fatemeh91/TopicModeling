review/text: The soap worked better than I exected it to. My acne has been reduced by atleast 75%. Other reviews and my doctor warned me of how drying the soap was but I didn't find it to be too bad. I used a non-acne facial moisturizer after each wash and have been fine. The only complaint I have about the soap is the smell. I wish it had a nicer scent. When first taken out of the package it smells fine but once wet you can really smell the sulfur. I don't care for the smell of sulfur. I would recommend this product to friends and have.
