review/text: First the good: The shape of the razor fits very comfortably in the hand, I get a nice close shave with the regular shaver, and the charge stays forever. Those are the good things. The big downside is the trimmer. It appears to be nothing more than a serrated piece of metal that uses the vibration of the razor when the power is turned on to trim the small hairs on your face. The problem is, it doesn't work. I keep thinking I'm doing something wrong because I get no benefit from it at all. I'll admit I haven't used the beard trimming attachment yet.Overall, though, a pretty good product.
