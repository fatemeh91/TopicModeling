review/text: I am a full figured girl who found out she was having twins, and my doctor recomended this type of band specifically. When I came on here to look I was a bit worried about getting it since there are a few negative reviews about the feel of the support bands and how they look under clothes.While I will admit there are a couple of issues with low or wide cut necklines since the chest straps are a bit in the way, a simple pin eliminates the issue and takes less than a minute. I have started wearing a tank top underneath the straps just in case it starts to get uncomfortable, but it is more of a precaution than a need.That being said - I LOVE the support! I was only just starting to get a bit of pressure and this band elinimates it. Also makes me stand a bit straighter so my back - I'm assuming - will hurt less later on, added bonus is it accentuates my belly so nobody has that curious, 'are you expecting', look on their face anymore :)
