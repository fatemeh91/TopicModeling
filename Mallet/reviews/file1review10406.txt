review/text: I'm sooo happy I found this tea on Amazon.com. The price for 60 bags is unbelievable at best. I have always purchased this tea with 30 tea bags for 8.99 from a local merchant in my neighborhood. In an attempt save more of my hard earned money, I began checking prices of my favorite things elsewhere and low and behold I found my tea on Amazon.com. I now get 30 more bags (a total of 60) for about 3.00 more. I have a good mind to stand outside of his store and advise the patrons to check Amazon for any products he sells. I've already found several at much cheaper prices on Amazon. Hell, he probably orders from Amazon and re-sales the product. THANK YOU AMAZON!
