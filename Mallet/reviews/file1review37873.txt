review/text: These do not dissolve quickly at all! I have to put warm water in a teaspoon and drop 3 pellets in there, wait for 10 or 15 minutes and even then they wont be dissolved. I wont buy these again. They seemed to help him but with a crying baby who wants to wait that long! I like the hylands colic tablets, even for tummy pains and teething these work better.
