review/text: If you're taking chemo with Oxil platinum this is the cream you want to keep your hands and feet from cracking and hurting!It does tend to "dry out" slightly after about 4 hours and I've found wearing light cotton gloves keeps it moist and working great.Don't believe the 4 to 6 week delivery scare...got my 16 oz jar in under 3 business days!
