review/text: This is the best shave I've ever had, with no razor burn or drag I orginally bought it for traveling so I wouldn't have to take shaving cream, but loved it so much I threw out my Venus. I agree that it doesn't lather up well after several shaves, but when I'm at home it can be used with shaving cream or gel like a regular razor and I still get smooth shave.
