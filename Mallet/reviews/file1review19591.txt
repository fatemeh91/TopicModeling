review/text: We purchased this product for our 3.5 year old sone, who finally graduated from the potty to the big people toilet. I'm extremely happy that we purchased this product. This seat was our second try, the first seat we purchased had to go back to the store due to the fact that the splash guard instead of preventing the pee to go all over the place, was actually catapulting it across the room when my little boy wasn't aiming. When he was, due to the spash guard being too small and our son sitting too high on that seat, we ended up having pee running down the front of the toilet. After a week of the potty adventures while I looked at different options available on line and at the stores I gave this seat a try. I was not disappointed in the least. The splash guard works great, it's not huge and younger boys might have difficulty aiming, but I believe it's the best option available for those of us who have boys. It's extremely easy to use, we have been able to take it with us when we visit friends and family and we have not come across a toilet that this seet would not fit on. It's very easy to clean. The plastic is very smooth, so there are no issues with scratching. The only gripe I do have is that sometimes my son complains that his bum get's tired of sitting on the hard surface. But on the other hand, it'll ensure that he will not sit indefinitely on the toilet reading his books :)
