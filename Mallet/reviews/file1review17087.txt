review/text: I have had this trimmer for over a year now. My main use is to trim my mustache (where I use it without the cutting-length comb), however I also use it occasionally to shape and trim my beard (using the comb). It works well and the battery lasts quite a long time between charges -- I think I have charged it twice since I received it. The power switch and length dial work well, and it has a nice range of length settings available. The only negative comment I would make is that it is louder than previous trimmers I have owned which may bother some folks, but that has not been a problem for me.
