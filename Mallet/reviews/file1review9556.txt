review/text: This is one of the smaller metrx bars but it actually still has 32g of protein, and little sugar. However, it still tastes sweet thanks to the large amounts of sugar alcohols in the bar. Those sensitive to these should beware. I'm not but still noticed a bit of an "effect" several hours after eating them. It does however have approx. 100 calories less than the big 100 protein bars and just about as much in the way of protein and vitamins, which is excellent.
