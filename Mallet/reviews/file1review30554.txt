review/text: I first found this deodorant at Target years ago and decided to try it since it seemed to be a healthier product (no aluminum, for example) and was remarkably inexpensive to boot (about $2.00 back then). I decided to use it in combination with Crystal Deodorant, the 100 percent mineral salt deodorant (about $5.00 for the roll-up version that lasts about a year) to see if I could stay odor-free for long, active periods using both daily. I start with a base of the Crystal Deodorant and add Herbal Clear Aloe Fresh over that. I had been using Tom's Deodorant, to the tune of about $5.00 each, each stick only lasting a relatively short time, prior to this combination. I was surprised to find that the combination of Herbal Clear Aloe Fresh with an initial base of Crystal Deodorant not only kept me odor-free all day, but also didn't stain my white T-shirts or leave a white residue on my armpits. I have very hairy armpits and am an active man living in an area that can reach over 100 degrees in summer, so I've always had a bit of an uphill battle to stay odor-free on especially active summer days. I can report that is no longer true--I was very happy to find this combination of healthier products and terrific low prices. Target has since discontinued Herbal Clear, so I am buying it elsewhere. I found other retailers through Herbal Clear's parent company website.
