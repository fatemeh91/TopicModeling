review/text: They do not last too long. I have death batteries after several (4-5) charges. This product is always the first to lose the power. I have other rechargeable brands that last days longer. I don't know if I got a bad batch of these batteries or not. As it is I would never purchase this brand of rechargeable batteries again.
