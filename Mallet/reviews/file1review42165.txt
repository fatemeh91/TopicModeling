review/text: We started using these diapers this week and we love them. My husband likes the snaps whereas I like the snaps and velcro ones equally. We are so excited because when our first baby was born we wanted to use cloth diapers and never found ones we liked, so we resigned ourselves to using disposables. These absorb well, they fit well, and we haven't used any disposable diapers this week. My older daughter (4 yr old)loves picking out which diaper (color and design) we will put on the baby/toddler (14 months old) and we will definitely be using these exclusively with our next baby from birth onwards. Thank you for such a fantastic product!
