review/text: When I purchased my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor, I only had the Merkur blade it came with, a box of10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edgeblades and a box of Merkur blades. I used the original Merkur blade for a week and then switched to the Feather blades and used them until I finished that box. I was very pleased with the performance after a week for these blades. Then I went back to start using my box of Merkur blades and a new blade serious felt WORSE than a week old Feather blade. More tugging and effort required leaving more irritaion. I just cannot recommend these in comparison to the Feather brand. If I get different brands to compare to, I will update my review.
