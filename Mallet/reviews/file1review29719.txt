review/text: I bought these pads because I was hoping to save money and because I like the brand Avent. I have no complaints about any of their other products, but these pads could've been made better. First of all, at night they do not stay in place. I've woken up many times and have had to change my bra and clothes because they were soaking wet. Second, when they do stay in place, they don't absorb much. I can use them in the daytime when I don't leak much, but at night when there's long stretches where my daughter doesn't eat, they become filled and leak. And lastly, they do stick to my nipples, so I have to be careful when I remove them. I do like the convience of them, though, and they came with their own little laundry bag so they don't get lost in the washer or dryer, very helpful. If your a heavy leaker, I would recommend getting a different brand.
