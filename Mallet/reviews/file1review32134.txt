review/text: The ceramic bowl is a unique piece of pottery - I was surprised. Unfortunately, a piece of it chipped in the mail. The sender immediately refunded me and I didn't have to pay charges to send it back.This is the best example I know of professional business that wants my business and offers quality goods.
