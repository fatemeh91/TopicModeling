review/text: After they switched to bottles and hiked up the prices I bought a can of the powder SF. I love it so much. I have a magic bullet and so I add 3 or 4 ice cubes and crush/mix it all together and it is the best breakfast ever. It does tend to seperate quickly so I don't make it until I am ready to drink it. Sometimes I will put in a Coffee To GO cup and it works great.This obviously wouldn't work at lunch in an office, but you could always prepare it in the morning and put it in a spill proof cup/lid. Keep it in the fridge and shake it up really good before you drink it. Never hurts to just try it.I think it is about $6-7 for a 12.83 oz can at Walmart. This makes 14 shakes.Me and my husband drink it for breakfast. We go thru about 1 gallon of skim milk every 5 days, not really sure. I'll assume that I spend $4 on milk a week. So that is $10-11 a week for 14 shakes.It seems to be better priced at Walmart than I just saw on Amizon, but mabey my math is wrong.It took my husband about 4 weeks before he would try my version of the shakes, he was still using the bottles (that sounds weird). He loved it too. He admitted he was wrong and mine was better and learned how to make them himself the next day.
