review/text: This Test Drive made a returning customer out of me! This deodorant/antiperspirant is the best I've tried in a long time. I think it's because this isn't a deodorant OR and antiperspirant, but both. It was great at sweat and odor protection, and left NO yucky white residue, as the stick states. Also, when I did find myself getting hot and sweaty, like at the gym, the only thing I smelled was the ""powder fresh"" scent of the deodorant.
