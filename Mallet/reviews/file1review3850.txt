review/text: I was kinda hesitant in purchasing a teeth whitening product at frist, but there was a coupon in the newspaper for a good couple dollars off and thought I should try it. This thing works! Whiter teeth in a couple of days!! The only bad part is that if you have sensitive teeth, the product will make your teeth feel really sensitive when using it. I love how does not take up a long time sitting with the stripe in your mouth.
