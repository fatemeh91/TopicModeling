review/text: This is my first epilator in years, and I love it! My legs and underarms are smooth and the shaver feature keeps my bikini area just the way I like it. I spent years waxing before this so I have baby fine regrowth. I am saving money and time. The Optima is powerful, easy to clean, and easy to use.
