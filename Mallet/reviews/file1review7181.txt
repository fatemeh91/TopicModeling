review/text: I have been trying to buy the best spa since November. The first one got cold while I was getting comfortable. That one was returned fast. The next one I ordered had good reviews and after two months, they notified me that it was no longer available and cancelled the order. When I read some of the reviews, I was disappointed that they said not to use bath salts in this foot bath. That is no problem! The water jets are great and the water stays warm even after you have turned the heat off - what a wonderful way to relax - the jets are strong and you can remove the rollers if you wish. I like that the pumice stone can be used on my heals and then removed to use by hand on problem places. It is well worth the price - I give it five stars - it deserves it!
