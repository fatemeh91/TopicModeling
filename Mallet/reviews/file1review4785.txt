review/text: I've been taking this product twice a day for years, as it pushed my ulcerative colitis into 90% remission and my symptoms have never been as bad since.I should point out that the individual packets seem stronger and more potent than the bulk supply. One tablespoon of the bulk should equal one packet, but I'm not quite finding this to be the case. Hence only 4 stars.
