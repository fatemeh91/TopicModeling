review/text: This was the best purchase!! These work great and have saved our changing pad from being stained!!! They are just like the paper they put under your chin at the dentist office - and they work great!!! We use each one a few times - unless it gets dirty on the first use - then just toss it. Great to have in the diaper bag as well - don't feel so bad using the changers in the bathroom with these!!!
