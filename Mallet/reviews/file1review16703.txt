review/text: I have several Zippo lighters, and it is nice to get one that is a little less ostentatious. Not that I don't like my flashier lighters, but this is a simple yet beautiful design that I enjoy thoroughly. Also this lighter is difficult to visibly scratch. I have had other Zippos in the past that have been scratched (one with a matte finish and one with a more elaborate design), but this one can be transported even haphazardly and will not be visibly damaged. Apart from appearances, it is a Zippo, and works as well as one should.
