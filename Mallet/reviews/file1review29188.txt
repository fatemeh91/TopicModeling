review/text: My Oral B CrossAction was good for a while... and then it seems that manufacturing of the brush head went down in quality. The brush head started coming loose and move up and down as the brush was spinning. This pinched and hurt my lips.Sure, it is inexpensive, and it probably is a good product for the price... but in that case, I would opt for the Oral B D-4 toothbrush.
