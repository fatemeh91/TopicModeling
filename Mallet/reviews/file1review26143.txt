review/text: I've been searching awhile for a lip balm that is not only effective, but that has staying power so that you're not constantly reapplying it. Nuxe Honey Lip Balm is the most effective lip balm that I've found to date. I love this product! The consistency is pleasantly thick and not waxy. I've never liked the waxy feel that some of the stick-shaped lip balms impart. Nuxe Honey Lip Balm is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.
