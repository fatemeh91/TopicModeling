review/text: My legs are very very sensitive. I used to get out of the shower after shaving my legs and be itching my legs for hours after. It was terrible how bad the itching was and i could never go out right after shaving because i would be too busy scratching. This lotion is MIRACLE IN A BOTTLE! i tried everythinggg possible to stop my legs from itching after shaving all different kinds of lotions , i even asked a dermotoligist and followed her suggestions nothing worked. When i tried this I was amazedddd how great it worked for me i do not itch at all!! after i shave now. They stopped selling this at the stores near me =( I cant find it any where, so every few months im on here buying my stock of bikini zone after shave lotion! I hope they never stop selling this stuff idk what i would do without it
