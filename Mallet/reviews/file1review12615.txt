review/text: I tried this product after trying everything natural (prunes, fiber supplements, apple juice mixtures, etc) and I just have problems in this area. I really hate to take any sort of medicines and I was hoping that this product could be a safe alternative. I hope that this product is safe to take. I do plan on using it only when necessary. You have to keep increasing your daily dosage until this product works. It took 8 pills (approx 4 days)to work. When it did work, it seemed to work well. The best thing is that there was no cramping or discomfort at all. Make sure you have good access to a restroom while waiting for it to work. It wasn't an "all day" restroom event. I just had to stay near a restroom for about 1/2 hr once it began to work. I would definitely buy the product again unless a doctor advises otherwise. It is a bit pricey though.
