review/text: I have a very, very old poodle in declining health. He has had diarrhea almost continually for the last 18 months or so. The only effective treatment has been a probiotic supplement added to his food, which has significantly reduced the frequency of diarrhea. For about a year I bought Purina Fortiflora from the vet at a cost of around $40 a month. After I lost my job I did some investigation online to see if I could find a less expensive alternative. I looked at several products of varying credibility and settled on Probios dispersible powder. It seemed to have a better reputation and scientific credentials than others I found. It also cost less than half of what I was paying for Fortiflora. And it contains four different species of bacteria as opposed to just one species in Fortiflora. The number of species didn't matter to me so much as the fact that some online references said that the one species chosen for Fortiflora (Enterococcus faecium) may not be the safest choice. Probios uses E. faecium too, but also three Lactobacillus species. Anyway, the bottom line is that Probios works even better than Fortiflora. I've switched over completely from Fortiflora to Probios, and Buddy now has loose stools only once or twice a month, and actual diarrhea less than once a month. Also Probios comes in a jar with a measuring spoon, which is a lot easier to deal with than the fussy little individual packets of Fortiflora.
