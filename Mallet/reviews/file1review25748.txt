review/text: Owned this for about 6 weeks. When brand new, it was quiet and fantastic, really did the job nicely as opposed to my old method of trying to use a fingernail clipper or jam the corner of a beard trimmer in my nose. Problem is, as someone else reviewed, it may not work properly for very long. I only used it about ten times, and the next time I turned it on, it was louder than normal due to rattling like something broke or got off-center, I don't know. Good thing it was only 14 bucks...makes it somewhat disposable I guess.
