review/text: I've tried this and other earth friendly dishwasher products here in Nevada. Sadly the water here is pretty bad and I think that is a big reason behind the lack of performance in these products. To anyone looking for a dishwasher detergent that works I say tread carefully as it'll probably take you a few tries to find one that works and given the price of these products it's an expensive game. It's worth it when you find it though!
