review/text: Neutrogena Norwegian Formula goes on silky smooth. It's lightly fragrant and not too thick or too watery. It's more of a gel than a cream. After only three days, it improved my dry skin. I've even suggested that my boss try some on his hands, as he has very dry, cracked skin on his fingers. I've used Dr. Scholl's foot cream, as well, but like this one considerably more. As the literature says, it lasts 17 hours or so. I highly recommend it!
