review/text: My wife replaced a much older Thermophore Moist Heating Pad with this new version and she likes it better than the older one that wore out after more than 20 years - it is larger than the older version and the pad and cover are more substantion - this is our second one in over 20 years and we are very pleased with it. The seller did everything in a speedy way.
