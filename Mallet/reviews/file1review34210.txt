review/text: I should begin by saying I had never had problems with hemorrhoids before, so I don't have a litany of things I had tried over a long period of time. I called my doctor's office and they recommended a doughnut cushion, Preparation-H sitz baths and plenty of fiber and liquids. I tried all that and experienced little relief.I saw good reviews for this cream and ordered some for next day delivery. IMMEDIATE relief. It was very cooling and soothing, very much like putting an ice cube on the area as other reviewers have noted. After using the cream for 4 days, my hemorrhoids were gone. I don't know if this cream helped them go away, or whether all of my doctor's prescibed actions finally took hold, but if I find myself in the unpleasant position of needing hemorrhoid assistance again, this cream will be the first thing I use.
