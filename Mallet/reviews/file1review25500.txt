review/text: I've had this item for quite some time and keep giving it shot after shot after shot. This does a good job of cleaning out nose hairs, however it cuts the inside of my nose at the same time, leaving me with a blood crusted inside which takes weeks to heal! It also gets really hot when in use, which makes it even less comfortable!
