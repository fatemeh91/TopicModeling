review/text: Bought these because they were listed for the lowest price out of the sites I had browsed. Well, now I know why. Each one was missing half of the chocolate coating on the bar. That just doesn't cut it for me. If I pay for a product, I expect to receive the whole product. Won't be buying these from here again.
