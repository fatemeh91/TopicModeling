review/text: I bought this based on all of the fantastic reviews. I have to wonder, did you all use this yourselves on your own nose? I can't review this against any other pure nose hair trimmer, this is the first one that I have used. I dread putting it up my nose. I found it to be painful and irritating, and I bled when I tried to get too close. Maybe all of the other nose hair trimmers are worse. A friend of mine had a manual nose hair trimmer that he wound up his nose, and it stuck, he had to pull it out. This isn't THAT bad. But I do have a Norelco electric shaver that has a beard trimmer attachment that does just as good a job as this without any pain or making me want to sneeze or whatever. I have not tried it on my ears, maybe it would be good for that, but I don't need that. I'll bet most people would like the electric shavers with the beard attachment better than this!!!
