review/text: I have never owned a toy in my life. However my boyfriend likes to have oral sex and unfortunately fingers and tongue just doesn't keep me satisfied so I have to cut down on his time to get mine. I finally just told him that I would do that more for him if we got this for me. I ordered the clear rabbit because it was the cheapest of the colors and super saver shipping, I didn't see a reason to pay more for color it was function that was important to me. It was supposed to be here on the 10th of Jan and it was here on the 6th. I received it in a regular amazon box and it was in a white plastic bag inside. I opened it and it did have a smell (I washed it once and now it's gone) I think it was just a new toy smell. My boyfriend was in total control of it and we ended up using the ears anally which worked good and then after he was done I had him just use it on me to see what it could really do. OMG! I was done in under a minute. He tried all the different settings I think and it was heaven. But afterwards I just wanted a piece of him :) It was not much bigger than he is so size was not an issue. The rabbit hit me just right. I don't feel it was too hard and the rabbit ears were perfect for me. Like other reviewers have said, "everyone's anatomy is different" The vibration was awesome though I really don't need the highest setting yet and the rotation was perfect. I like that it can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise depending on how you want it to hit. All in all it was a perfect purchase and I plan on using it a lot more, can't wait to try out the waterproof feature. I bought this one because it had the most reviews and the best reviews. I am not disappointed.
