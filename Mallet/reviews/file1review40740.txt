review/text: I mainly use this on my kids. When my daughter was a baby she had dry skin and rashes.. I used to use a different baby lotion but the rashes wouldn't go away. Her pediatrician recommended Aveeno so we tried it and her rashes went away (and pretty quickly too); I've been using Aveeno on her ever since. I love the way this stress relief smells... It's a bit flowery so if you don't like that scent don't get this. But I use this on my two girls and myself so it saves me from buying different lotions.Amazon price comparable to Walmart and Target.. not too much differenceBOTTOM LINE: I love it and recemmend it
