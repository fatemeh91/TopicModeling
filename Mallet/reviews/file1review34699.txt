review/text: This product relieves stress related urinary urgency, muscle spasms of back and legs from long distance driving, completely got rid of my leg cramps, and lightens my mood. I take two Magnesium Orotate in the Morning, and three Calcium mixed Magnesium Orotate at night for good restful sleep. I am 62 years old, work full time and commute approximately three hours per day. Both products are great.
