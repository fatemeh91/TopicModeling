review/text: I used to drink muscle milk after working out and myoplex shakes. I am a vegetarian so other than eggs and peanuts I dont get much protein otherwise.After reading a consumer report article on both Muscle Milk and EAS Myoplex containing way more Heavy Metals than allowable by the FDA (Arsenic, Cadmium, and Lead) I returned my remaining Muscle Milks and Myoplex to Costco for a full refund. (Costco has since discontinued selling Muscle Milk).According to Consumer Reports Solgar Whey to go has the least amount of heavy metals (virtually undetectable amounts) which appeals to me. (not a huge fan of lead in my drinks)I got the 32 vanilla bean from amazon and it tastes way better than the Myoplex chalk anyway so im stoked. Win, Win.
