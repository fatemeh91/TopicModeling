review/text: ok, i have seen alot of low rating reviews on almost every zippo, complaining about things like: ohhh it has scratches on it, or , there's no fluid in it, or , it runs out of fluid even if you dont use it, if you actually researched what you bought, you would know its actually ok, seeing as this zippo has a scratched pattern, its not "scratched" its the finish, they dont ship with fluid because its illegal, and they evaporate because they've been made the same way since the 1930s, and they're not airtight.my rant is overyour welcome
