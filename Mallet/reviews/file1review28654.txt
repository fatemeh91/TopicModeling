review/text: Since there are already hundreds of reviews for this product, let me just compare it to the product that I used just before:BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder, Vanilla Ice Cream, 5.04 Poundvs Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Strawberry Banana -- 2 lbsTaste:Syntha-6 is by far the best tasting protien shake I have ever had. I only mixed it with filtered water and it was always creamy and delicious. Optimum is more normal in that it is watery taste that would only be close to Syntha-6 if it was mixed with milk.Fillingness (I think I made that word up):Syntha-6 was a great breakfast and post workout drink because it kept me satiated until lunch. I'm a morning workout type, who is usually in to much of a rush to make more than a shake and grab an apple. So far I would have to say I don't get quite the same satisfaction from Optimum. I suspect it has to do with the next catagory.Nutrition:Both products have about the same amount of Protein, but where Optimum excels is that it only has 3 grams of Carbs and 120 Cals vs Syntha-6 has 13 grams of Carbs vs 200 Cals. I believe the carb and calorie count is why it is also more filling.I have tried many different Protein shakes and have never had one taste as good as Syntha-6, but for my nutritional needs right now, I'll stick with Optimum. When I'm ready to bulk up again I'll switch back to Syntha-6.
