review/text: I use these for my pets... I have 5 of these that I use (some in wash, some in use). They survive repeated washing, bleaching, for years on end. One or more are in the washer constantly. I highly recommend this size and these pads for Pets as well as human. They do the job. The protective barrier just keeps on working like the energizer bunny.Oh for the backing, it is the same exact backing using in hospitals. I order it by the yard from Canada and it is unbelievable. It withstands high dryer heat and never fails to protect my surfaces (unless they back up and miss a bit.) This backing is used in the diaper industry as well. It is in institutional grade barrier product used in diaper covers, change pads, underbed pads, laundry and pail lining to name a few. I love it better than the poly vinyl laminate fabric which to me does not work as well. And I might add, it is not a low cost item
