review/text: I wanted to start taking supplements to help thicken my hair-it's really bad!-and strengthen my nails. For me, this product works. It isn't like magic where the next morning my hair was akin to Rapunzel and my nails were beginning to curl they were so long. It has taken time to get there, and I am much happier waiting for the good results than speedily trying to slap a bandaid on my issues. It's just like losing weight: the faster you lose it, the easier it is for you to gain it back and the slower you take, the less likely you will gain it back. Is it perfect? No, but my nails begin to bend and chip when I stop taking it and my hair falls out much, much more. I am glad the FDA doesn't control yet another thing in my life. Just because the FDA approves something doesn't make it good for you.Also, I am vegetarian. When you have "dietary issues" it is sooooo much harder to find something you CAN take. Thank you, Country Life, for making a product that works and is affordable.
