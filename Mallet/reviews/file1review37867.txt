review/text: Now that OTC teething medication is basically off limits for certain age groups, I have found it hard to help my youngest deal with her teething pain. This is a life saver. You do have to dissolve the pellets in water and then spread on gums which I'm not an absolute fan of. My daughter tends to bite when I attempt to rub her gums so it takes a little extra effort for this product to work. But it does work.
