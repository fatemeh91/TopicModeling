review/text: This salve is incredible. I have used it on many different scrapes, cuts and burns (including sunburn). It seems to aid the body in healing itself more quickly than something like Neosporin. I had a really awful looking burn on my arm from an accident with a grill, and just a few weeks later, the area is barely visible. I don't think there will even be a scar. I highly recommend this salve for a variety of skin-related issues.
