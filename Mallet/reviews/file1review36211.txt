review/text: This product has a nice look. I mean who knew clippers could look stylish? The motor works fine, but I see no apprecaible difference than other Wahl adjustable clipper designs.The BIG detractor is the heat generated by these clippers. Because the body is metallic, it holds a great amount of heat. I have 5 boys, and by the time I got to my 3rd son's hair...I was hot potatoeing the clippers from right hand to left hand.I am surprised professionals say they like these...maybe they have built up a super hero like calous on their hands and are no longer affected like us mere mortals!Bottom line. While the metal looks great, I'd advise you get the plastic ones.
