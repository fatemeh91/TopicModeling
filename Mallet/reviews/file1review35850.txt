review/text: It's taken a long time to get my "perfect shave". While I have always enjoyed shaving, my poor face didn't share the same enthusiasm. Often after shaving my face was red, irritated, and was painful to the touch. After doing a lot of research I started steaming my face before I shaved and I invested in many expensive products. I used a (real) badger brush, expensive shave oil, tons of different razors, shave creams, and aftershaves. I researched proper shaving technique. I talked to barbers. None of it helped. Thinking myself doomed, I grew a beard. After a few months (and itching nonstop) it was time for a shave. Having thrown out my previous aftershaves I picked this up at Walgreens. In combination with the rest of my routine I can say with 100% confidence Nivea's Extra soothing is the miracle I've been looking for all these years. FINALLY I can shave and not look like something out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre afterwards. The price is right, and my face feels great. It helps to close pores with cold water BEFORE application. This product may not be for everyone, as we all have different beards and skin types. If you've tried a lot of other products with zero results try Nivea Sensitive Balm. It might me what you've been looking for!
