review/text: I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about 4 years when the battery died. Loved it. Looked around to replace it with another sonic toothbrush and chose the Braun S-200. This change took a little getting used to: the sonicare had straight bristles, the braun slightly angled bristles. Things I like about the S-200 over the sonicare: 1) timer doesn't shut off after 2 minutes is up (I always had to turn the sonicare back on to finish up), 2) the on/off button is easier to press, 3) easier clean up with the braun - the sonicare screw on top was forever getting a buildup of stuff on it
