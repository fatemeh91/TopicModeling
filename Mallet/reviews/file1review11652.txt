review/text: My son is 16 months old and he takes it without a problem. I put it in his yogurt after dinner and he dosent even notice its there. I love this stuff its a clear color, its not like other vitamins that have a dark color that usally stains their clothes. And also the smell is not strong at all give it a try I think it's worth it.
