review/text: When I had my braces put on, I decided to look for something other than the sonic toothbrushes I owned. Since it had separate rotating heads, I decided to try it.As other users mentioned, it does have durability issues; I, like a previous reviewer, have resigned myself to purchase a new one when it dies after the warranty expires. You must keep in mind this is not a $100 toothbrush; at the time of my review, they are under $20.On the plus side, it does clean between my teeth and brackets better than my Sonic Complete or Soniccare toothbrushes. To me, this is more important than any other factor.If you decide not to buy this and opt for a sonic toothbrush, I'd highly recommend the Oral-B Sonic Complete.
