review/text: I have been monitoring my pressure three and some times four times daily because of the ease in operating the Mark of Fitness monitor. Previously, I would skip the monitoring altogether because of the difficulty of manipulating the other devices I used. My wife even checks her pressure regularly now. Now I can provide my physician the history of my readings because of the memory features of the wristwatch style monitor. I think this monitor can make a difference to many who need to monitor their pressure regularly. The time and ease of use are outstanding!
