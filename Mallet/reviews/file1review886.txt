review/text: This stuff really helps improve your CM if you need a little help in that area. I'm on Clomid which unfortunately dries you out and I had heard of EPO on a forum I frequent. I took one pill with my mother meds after dinner and could already see an improvement by that night. The next day my CM was creamy, and without the EPO I would have been dry or sticky at best. By the third day I was borderline wet/creamy. I'm only on CD6 now and didn't ovulate until CD20 last cycle so I imagine by the time I need fertile CM it won't be an issue.
