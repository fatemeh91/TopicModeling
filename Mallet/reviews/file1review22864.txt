review/text: I was unable to find the hand push Bissell in any stores. Thank goodness for on-line shopping! I have used a Bissel for years. They are the best at a quick, quiet clean up...especially if you have animals (2 cats & a dog) that shed! I use it on top of my bedspread & on the furniture seats where my cats take their 23 of 24 hour naps. It works great & I have not died from any germs!One problem is getting the handle to stay together...McGyver (duct tape) to the rescue.
