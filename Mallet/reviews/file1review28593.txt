review/text: The product arrived in a timely manner. I drink the double chocolate variety. The price is great compared to buying the 2 pound tubs at Walmart or Jewel. The taste is decent. It doesn't taste like chocolate milk but it's not intolerable. I always use milk with this product and have never tried it in water. As an experienced lifter I'd say not to fret too much about your protein powder, it should be a minor detail in your plan, but, if you are going to buy some, this is probably the best quality for such a cheap price.
