review/text: I went to a message therapist recommended by my doctor to relieve the knots in my right shoulder and neck. She used Prossage as a part of her message and I could feel its deep heat penetration. As a result I purchased some for home and use it every time my neck begins to hurt. It works quite well and does not have much of an odor.
