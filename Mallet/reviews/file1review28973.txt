review/text: I purchased this shaver mainly for travel because of the ability to clean under running water, secondly for the need to trim sideburns and beards. Haven't washed it under water yet but it works great on trimming, fine tuning edges and general shaving. Cleaning with the supplied brush is easy enough and does a good job.It's a Braun what do you expect!
