review/text: I have been using Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard for the past year now. I always purchase it from a popular place by my house. The pricing on Amazon is so much better an with prime, product came really fast. This time I ordered the French Vanilla Creme, per other reviewers ratings but have yet to try it as I want to finish the prior one that I have opened. I previously purchased Tropical Punch. If you are not able to mix it with milk (Atkins so water only), it isn't the best choice; ok and doable but there are much better flavors out there. I hope the reviews of the French Vanilla Creme are correct; which I am sure they will be. Happy Shakes!
