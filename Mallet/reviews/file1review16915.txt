review/text: First of all, get the 8831xl, NOT this 8825xl which simply isn't worth spending over $100 on. That's the only reason I gave it just 4 stars instead of the perfect 5. The 8831xl gets 5/5 stars. You can always return any Norelco shaver within 2 months for a full refund, so get your hands on any Norelco Spectra shaver ASAP!After buying the 8825, I found the 8831 on eBay and I called Norelco and asked what this unlisted model was all about. They said it's a special model that they only sell to certain department stores, like Macy's, every now and then. Anyway, the 8825 has only 45 mins of shaving time while the 8831 has 70 mins. The 8831 package also includes a CAR CHARGER. And thirdly, the 8831 is pearly white, not blue like the 8825. Other than these three differences, THAT'S IT, no other differences whatsoever. Oh wait, there is just one more difference... the price! The 8825, which is Norelco's entry-level Spectra model, sells for over $100. The 8831 sells on Ebay for about $60 shipped. One of Norelco's top-of-the-line shavers for WAY under $100, are you kiddin?! Nope, it's an absolute steal. You might be wondering if I own both shavers now... nope! I bought this 8825 first but then returned it to Norelco within 60 days for a full refund and then bought the 8831 on Ebay brand new for about $60 shipped.The 8825 was my first electric shaver ever, and I really did need Norelco's recommended 3 weeks for my hair to get used to electric shaving. By the way, all of the Spectra models shave the same, as they don't differ with their blades. It's just that the higher models like 8890 and 8894 have fancy displays and bells and whistles, none of which make for a better shave than the 8825 or 8831. Anyway, I was using Mach 3 razors for the past few years. The Mach 3 was great for my face, but I rarely could ever get a close AND comfortable shave on my neck without irritating it and getting red bumps, and I could never comfortably shave every morning, it always had to be at least every 36 hours or every other day. But with my new Norelco Spectra, now I can shave every morning without ANY irritation and I can also comfortably shave my neck CLOSER than a blade now. Sixty bucks to feel like a million. I'd say that's not a bad deal. What do you think?
