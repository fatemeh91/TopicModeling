review/text: This provides all around great nutrition and tastes great, too! I had no appetite during my divorce and lost an unhealthy amount of weight. This is about the only thing that helped me to gain some weight back and stay healthy; therefore making it a lifesaver (literally). I am sure this would be beneficial to any person suffering a physical or mental condition that robs you of your appetite, enjoyment of food or ability to eat solid foods. Or any person that is looking for a great tasting, healthy snack.
