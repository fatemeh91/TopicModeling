review/text: I'd been giving my husband a generic store brand (and lesser known name brands)of Chondroitin Sulfate, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) for years then switched to Osteo Bi-Flex brand last year on the advice of physical therapists and doctors.I experimented to be sure it was working. I stopped giving it to my husband without his knowledge (I prepare all of his vitamins in one cup so he did not notice he was not taking it) and when I did this his knees and joints started to hurt again (like before I first gave them to him). Then I started giving them to him again and within a week or two he stopped complaining about the pain. The change was gradual but it was clear. I tested it this way to make sure any benefits were not "all in his head". When I told him about the experiment he was thankful I proved they worked (so we don't waste our money), and he agreed he should keep taking them. And even though Osteo Bi-Flex is a bit more expensive, he wants to spend the extra money because this brand has been recommended by professionals in the health care industry (my doctor and my physical therapist).The other brands seemed to work just as well (I tested them also, in the same way), but after hearing so many reports in the last year about the poor quality of ingredients in many brands of foods and vitamins/supplements we have decided to continue using Osteo Bi-Flex brand as long as the price does not go too high and as long as we can afford it. In my opinion the price of $22 to $25 (per 120 caplet bottle of the Advanced formula) is the most I want to pay. I have purchased from Amazon and elsewhere.CAUTION: I do not take Chondroitin Sulfate, Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM). Only my husband takes this product. I have allergies to sulfas and sulfates and when I take any form of this supplement it actually increases my pain, in my joints and in my muscles.
