review/text: I think most people have two uses for leather cleaners.One is for day to day use...your fancy leather luggage, backpack, wallet, iPad case or purse starts looking a little shabby, and you want something to make it look revitalized and almost new again. For this scenario, Apple Leather Cleaner works well, especially on darker leather products. It cleans, softens and generally helps your leather product look like new, and if you use it regularly, it gives your leather item a bit of protection so that it will be easier to clean next time. Only very minor complaint is that light colored leathers tend to come out looking very slightly darker, and leathers with a natural matte finish tend to take on a bit of a sheen. Otherwise, the results are generally great.The other use is for stain removal...you get (say) ballpoint pen on your favorite leather iPad case. Unfortunately, here the Apple cleaner doesn't work quite as well. With lots of elbow grease, you can sometimes work maybe 80% of these stains out, but the most common outcome will be a fainter stain, not a removed stain. If stain removal is important to you, then I might suggest a different type of product.
