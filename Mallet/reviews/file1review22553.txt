review/text: My daughter takes 20 of these a day to control her acne. It works amazingly well. She is much clearer than her dermatologist can get her, and she doesn't have to take all those harmful antibiotics. BTW, there are zero side effects with vitamin B5 that we can see. She tried NOW brand for a couple of months, in my effort to drive down the cost, but she broke out terribly. I don't know why, but Vitamin shoppe just has a higher quality vitamin.
