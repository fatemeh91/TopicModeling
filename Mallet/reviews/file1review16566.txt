review/text: This is an attractive and functional basic Zippo lighter. It has it's functions and is better at some things and not so good at others (like lighting cigars. The fluid can give you an awkward flavor blast), but when you need a lighter that just lights and looks good doing it, Zippo is your friend. Did I mention it's a Zippo? 'Nuff said.
