review/text: I was looking for a snack that I could eat between meals, that would offer some basic nutritional value, that didn't taste like sawdust, that was portable, and that wouldn't break the bank. Tiger's Milk bars more than fit the bill - they taste WAY better than sawdust! I've shared them with friends in my evening classes, and they have gone on to purchase their own!
