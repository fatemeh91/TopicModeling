review/text: This product heat up fast, gets hot and moist. No water needed. I am a Clinical Massage Therapy student and we use a different product for hydrotherapy, but it is quite expensive. This product does a great job for relatively little money. This is mobile and certainly something I will use when giving treatments at the client's home. The hotter the temperature, the better the results. Of course, you never want to have this so hot, you scorch your skin. One nice feature, is the hand control. It can be harzardous to fall asleep while using a thermophore, without this feature. This product's heat in controlled strictly by hand. If you release the control, the pad will eventually completely cool down. This particular brand cools down quickly, so if the heat is becoming uncomfortable, you are able to release the hand control to let it cool down slightly. You can cycle the temperature without having to remove the pad or put breaks into your treatment time. Please don't put your body weight on a thermophore. It is not a good idea and can be a hazard. The inner electrical parts are not designed to support body weight. This product is to be placed over areas of the body you want to affect with hot applications.
