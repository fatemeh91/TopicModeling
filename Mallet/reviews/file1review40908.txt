review/text: This razor is inexpensive, but it doesn't really cut it when it comes to shaving. My facial hair is not thick nor heavy, but this razor can't even do an adequate job. And, it is brutal. When I'm done shaving, which takes 5 or 10 minutes, my face feels like I have dry shaved it without any shaving cream. So, I would not recommend this razor for shaving. As a plus, the trimmer does work.
