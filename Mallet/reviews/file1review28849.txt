review/text: I've been drinking the double-rich chocolate regularly for about a year now. It is outstanding and not difficult to drink at all. I work out in the morning before I eat, and my after-exercise protein shake holds me over for about 2.5 - 4 hours.I blend a scoop of powder, 8 oz skim milk, and a half cup of berries until smooth. Then I start adding ice (maybe a cup or so) to the blender. This makes two huge glasses of great protein shake - I drink them both while keeping in mind that it's just a cup of milk, a half cup of berries and the powder. What fills two very large glasses is mostly ice and air.I've used all kinds of berries/cherries, and my favorites in order are: blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, blackberry. I make sure the berries are also frozen when they go into the blender - it keeps the shake thick.After I started on my first 5-lb jar, I thought I should get another flavor just so I didn't get sick of the DRChocolate. The French Vanilla wasn't nearly as good, I thought. Too sweet. I thought it would be good with melon or peaches or pineapple - things like that - and you couldn't taste the fruit hardly at all even though I was adding a cup of fruit to the cup of milk and scoop of powder. The melon/peach flavors just weren't strong enough to get past the heavy taste of the vanilla powder
