review/text: I liked these lollipos. They seemed to work and tasted pretty good. The drawback was that they contained sugar (bad for a ketogenic diet) and they burned the inside of my mouth (I'm guessing they have a lot of acid in them). Because I'm afraid they may damage my teeth due to what I'm guessing is a high acid content, I probably will not order them again which is a shame. They really seemed to help curb my appetite. :(
