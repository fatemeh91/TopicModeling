review/text: If this just stayed warm longer, it would be perfect.On the plus side: Perfect fit. The Velcro works perfectly and keeps it as tight or as loose as I want it. It has a nice heavy feel. Heavy enough to stay close to the skin for good therapy, but not too heavy to be uncomfortable. The neck is a difficult place to treat/fit. This does it very well. It's great to be free of electrical cords. I can move about freely. It fits snugly against the neck so I can wear a sweater over it without a problem. Being able to do hot and cold is a plus, although I have not used the cold yet.The only negative is the temperature control. It takes a bit of experimenting to find the right time, since each microwave is different. Then it cools off very quickly. Even if I heat to the point where I can barely stand the heat, it is almost cold in 15 minutes. This means I need to keep running back to the microwave.The TheraTherm shoulder pad is a better option for me. It is electric and has excellent temperature control. The cord is long enough to make it usable. I just wish its strap was as good as this one.
