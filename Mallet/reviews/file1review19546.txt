review/text: Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me. My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it. The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his "equipment" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too).
