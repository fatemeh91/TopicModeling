review/text: Like a said before, "Hello, it's a zippo!"What else need be said? It works well as can be, and the fuel for it is not very expensive. It would qualify as "inexpensive" I would say! I would recommend "Ronsonal" lighter fluid for this, and all Zippo lighters. There are many other Zippo models, but for as far as I can tell, they are all the same, in terms of there working, and dependability, all around, as a great lighter. Plus, hello, they are warenteed for life!
