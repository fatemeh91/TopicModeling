review/text: Here's my take on razors in general: not all men are the same. Some have thick fast-growing hair, some thin slow-growing, some medium thickness fast growing, etc. Everyone's different. Those who ridicule the increasing number of blades on razors are likely those who don't need much more than a Bic one-blade razor because it's what works for them.So far, these Fusion Power's are the best for me. My whiskers grow fast, thick, and need some seriously good razors. The old two-blade blades the Gillette makes got tossed out the second the Mach3's came out, and the Mach3's were equally tossed when the Fusion Power's arrived. The reason - the 2 blades hurt, I cut myself lots, and wore out in one or two uses. Mach3s lasted much longer, but still sometimes cut. These Power Fusions However, I must emphasize: *have yet to cut me*. I think the vibrate function is to thank for this, but I've yet to cut myself when the battery runs out either, so it may just be the blade.Here's what Gillette does not want you to know though: these things last a LONG time. You can use one blade for months with minimal degradation of the blade quality, as long as you use the vibrate function and cream. How do I know they don't want you to know this? Their ads lately have been targeted towards those reusing the product more than they'd like, and so there's a whole marketing bend they're on about checking your indicator strips to see if it's time to replace. My guess is they regret having created a blade that isn't as quickly disposable.That said, when I take into account that 4-pack might last me a year, an 8-pack at a high price is fine by me. No longer am I buying Mach3 razors every month, I'm barely buying one pack a year.
