review/text: I've been using top-of-the-line Remington MS5700 Titanium self cleaning razor, but its motor is very loud. I complained, they sent me a new one which is also very loud -- too loud for me!I then bought this Braun 8585 to try. Braun is superior to Remington in all respects except the important one, "close shave" -- Remington has much larger cutting blades so it shaves closer and faster, no matter what Braun claims.But the Remington is way too loud, it's rather heavy, and its pop-up trimmer doesn't cut well. Its self-cleaning base isn't as well designed as Braun's. It's rather messy pouring the bottle of alcohol into an opening in the Remington base, plus replacing a separate filter element. The cleaning doesn't clean either of Remington's "pop-up" cutters well.Braun's self-cleaning cartridge changeout is very simple, a very good design. So I can live with Braun, I'll simply take a little longer to shave. Braun's motor is very quite and the razor is easy to hold, and manipulate.I might vote for Remington if it weren't so damn noisy! I tried two of them, I can't believe Remington would produce such a product.
