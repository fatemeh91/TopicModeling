review/text: When ever the product is on the shelf at the local market - it flies of the shelf. I have a really hard time finding. I decided to try my luck and order it. I could be more pleased. I ordered two, and plan to order more - just because I can;t locate it locally. This product works. I was coughing uncontrollably - I took one good swallow of Father Johns and I promise the cough subsiding substantially, It didn't disappear but the frequency of it occurring was greatly minimize - I continue to take Father John and was able to sleep through the night with no coughing at all. For me, this is the answer - It really, really works.
