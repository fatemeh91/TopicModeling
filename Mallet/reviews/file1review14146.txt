review/text: My skin is quite sensitive. That's why I go to the trouble and expense of the Advantage/Cool Skin system. I used to use the lotion (HQ 170) because the package says it's for sensitive skin--and because I've never seen the gel in a store.Two months ago, however, I had to replace my shaver, and the new one came with samples of both gel and lotion. I found that the gel lubricates a little better, and the decreased friction seems to result in decreased irritation. A few days ago, I inadvertently replaced a gel cartridge with a lotion cartridge, and I felt the difference right away.I haven't found that my face really likes either the gel or the lotion, but shaving goes slightly quicker with the gel, which is a small added benefit.It's nice that Amazon "offers" this product itself: five packages is enough to get free Super Saver shipping.
