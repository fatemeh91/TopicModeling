review/text: When i ordered these, I thought it would come with 3 pieces in case you mess one up. Well It showed up (really fast shipping, it was here in 1/5 the time it was meant to take) with only two trays. I also ordered the 44% gel at the same time and it came too. So what i did was put a coffee mug full of distilled water in the microwave and boiled it. When it boils, turn the microwave off and leave it for a few seconds and dip your tray in. Start off with one second and slowly increase the amount of time you leave it in. You can always put it in again, but once you leave it in too long its pretty much over. I would suggest putting the tray in your mouth prior to forming it and trimming off the excess material to create a better seal. And you have to be tough because as soon as you pull it out of the water its best to bite and suck the air out right away and it hurts for a second.Once you do everything though they work great! very satisfied with the product, not pleased with the false information on the product page.
