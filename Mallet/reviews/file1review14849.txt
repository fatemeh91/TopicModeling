review/text: Really can't write too long of a review but I have to say this works as everyone here states. It is great as a meal replacement and makes it convenient for those days where you are running late and you can grab your shaker bottle and pouch. It has a great taste. I do recommend it with a shaker bottle as it can be quite difficult to mix by just stirring. So definitely take this one shaken, not stirred.
