review/text: MET-Rx definitely make the best protein powders I've tried so far -- and I've tried about a half-dozen brands and looked at the nutritional information for others that I ruled out due to their high caloric content. You can click on the link above to see the manufacturer's nutritional information label, but the key point is that almost all of the calories in this powder come from the whey protein. In other words this powder is very low fat and low carb yet it still tastes very good. I like both the vanilla and chocolate flavors and alternate between them so I'm not drinking the same thing post-workout every day.
