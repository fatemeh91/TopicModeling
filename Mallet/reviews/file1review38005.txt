review/text: Very few people writing reviews have had to use this. I am no different, but I can speak of the benefits of purchasing.I bought this for my mother for her 60th birthday. She has very high blood pressure and high cholesterol. There was always this worry hanging over our family. An anxiety that paralyzed all of us a little. We all worried that mom wouldn't see her grandchildren grow up. She worried too.Since I gave her this (granted, unusual) gift, I know with certainty that the anxiety level has gone down. We've all watched the video (including Dad) and we all just feel better about my mother's health - because we know that we're prepared to help her. She still takes her meds, watches her diet, etc ... but when she gets pessimistic about her heart, we've laughed and said "Mom, we're gonna zap you back so quickly ... you think we'll let &lt;my name> waste all that money?"It's just nice to have it. It's not morbid at all. We don't feel helpless anymore - and Mom knows that we know what to do if anything happens.Like everyone else, I hope it's never needed. But it was still worth the $$ for the peace of mind that we have. Mom enjoys life a little more, and we are happier.Life is better when you can live it without worrying all the time. This makes us all worry a little less.
