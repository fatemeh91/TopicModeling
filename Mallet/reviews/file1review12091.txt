review/text: Seems like a good vitamin - contains 800mg Folic Acid - but when I started taking it I started getting awful stomach aches a couple hours later.. and realized the vitamin could be causing them. Now I take the vitamin at night but still wake up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache.
