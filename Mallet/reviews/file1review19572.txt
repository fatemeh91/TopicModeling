review/text: Not impressed and am returning tomorrow. The little wings you have to dial out barely hold the seat in place. Maybe it works for older toilets or german toilets...but not mine. If the little wings came down more, then it would hook under the lip of the seat. But this will be returned. Got it at babies r us and I will just look for a permanent seat that won't fly off while my kid is getting on or off of it.
