review/text: Bravo. Worth it at twice the price. With this product they got it correct. Bag of blue goo, not so great. Bag of ice, won't work. Frozen peas good in a pinch, CVS frozen blue peas in a hard plastic package that cuts my neck?? - R U serious?.The Good:The Elasto-gel Cervical Collar is designed to fit your neck(c1 to c7 bliss).It is always flexible.Hot or cold.The cover transmits the cold or hot a few seconds after you start to use it(no cold shock).You can remove and wash the cover.It is still made in the USA.Lets just say my neck is a wreck. Without this Cervical Collar I would be in pain all the time. Now I'm in pain only some of the time. Thanks Vicodin. I had one of these. Now I have three. I keep one at work, one at home and the third rides with me between work and home.The Bad:The new one is smaller, the tiny girl in the picture makes it look big. (please make a man sized one)The Velcro on front is annoying. I cut it off.Always use, and never lose, the bag it came with. Ziploc makes it wet in the freezer and it will smell like old frozen stuff.Last if it went 4 to 6 inches further down the back. The long term issues I have cause the compensating pieces to cramp up.OBTW: None of the bad matters. The best is still the best. The Elasto-gel Cervical Collar is the best.
