review/text: I ordered this sweeper to pick up after my granddaughters withouthaving to take out the vacuum.What a mistake!This is so poorly made. The problem is that the handle does not stay on.When you push it the handle comes off in your hand. I tried everything to fix it with no luck.Would not recommend this.
