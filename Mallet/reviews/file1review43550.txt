review/text: The doctor said I should buy a home unit, and recommended this brand. My local stores had a limited selection and higher priced units then I needed, so I went online and found this one at Amazon. It will remember the last 60 readings, and average any taken in the last ten minutes. I do a three reading average and then write down the result to show my doctor, and that works out well. I don't have any negatives for the unit. It is basic but serves my needs well.
