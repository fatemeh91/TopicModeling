review/text: I bought this as a gift for my partner who has a medical fetish. She loves it! We get to learn more about human anatomy, and have a good time doing so.As far as the product, it seems to be good quality for it's price. The 'beak' is a bit crooked, but it doesn't hinder anything, though it was scary at first. For those curious, it widens two ways, of course the 'beak' spreads, and the diameter can be widened.For those getting this for sexual wellness and not sexual fun, this product can be paired with a good old hand mirror and a flashlight. It's a bit tricky to get it in by yourself, but it's definitely doable.
