review/text: Then you need to consider buying this. I made my social club buy 3 of these in the hope that we never have to use them. If you've got a small office or have a family member who has heart problems, you need to strongly consider getting this. Your chance of survival drops 10% per minute for a cardiac arrest. The AED is very simple to use. One of the studies that "sold" people on this is the fact that 2nd graders were shown this device and not given any instructions and were just 30 seconds slower than paramedics with CPD/AED training. This as indispensible as a first aid kit.Yet this is only part of the full lifesaving plan - if you're serious about getting this, then it's worth contacting the Red Cross for a CPR-D class. Talk with instructors and learn what else needs to be done as part of an overall comprehensive life-saving plan. If you've got an elderly family member living with you, or a history of cardiac arrests then the cost of this device is well worth it and buys precious time until emergency response arrives.My hope is that if you buy this, you never have to use it. But if you do, you're giving someone the best opportunity for survival.
