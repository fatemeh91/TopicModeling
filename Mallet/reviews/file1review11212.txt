review/text: I have had this thermometer for a while now, and I need to be burning up for it to read above 98 degrees. I just tested it against a mercury lab thermometer, and the lab thermometer read 98.6, but the vicks thermometer read 95.9. I have always thought it a little strange that it never showed me as normal unless I already felt I had a temperature. This thing is going in the garbage today...
