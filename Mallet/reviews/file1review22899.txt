review/text: I loved "helping" my grandma clean when I was little. My mom had one of these for years. I was looking forward to buying this and giving the same memories to my kid. Too bad every time my kid picks it up, he cries because he thinks he broke it. I'd rather try and dig out my grandma's old one, it's designed so much better and is more reliable than this one. It's not priced cheap but it's definitely built that way! The handle comes in 4 pieces. You push the pieces together and smack it against the floor and it's supposed to stick. It just falls apart! My husband took it out to the cement stairs and hit the handle pieces together himself and it still comes apart. I'm going to J.B. Weld the thing because I'm tired of picking up the sweeper and reassembling it each time before I have to use it. It's not a 'quick' clean if you have to rebuild your cleaning tool each time!Then, when I try to bend it (for sweeping under the coffee table, etc.) I have to put my foot on the base and push the handle down, because it doesn't swing easily on its own. It also still only works for heavy carpet areas. If you have thin carpets, linoleum or hard wood floors, don't buy this. Go for the natural sweeper, it has bigger brushes and will actually pick up a few of the kitchen crumbs and dirt.I contacted Bissell and asked for a single piece handle and to see if they would at least put the little ball bearings and cut out holes on the handle, so it would snap together and lock in place. Instead of answering my question or even better, sending a solid handle, they sent me a form letter to the effect of "we're sorry your sweeper has malfunctioned" and shipped out a natural sweeper. The handle still sucks, there was no response on how or if they are going to fix it, and I'm stuck with gluing together another product because of shoddy design factors. Fun.
