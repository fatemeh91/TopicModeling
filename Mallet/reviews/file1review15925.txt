review/text: I LOVE this maternity belt. Beginning in the fifth month of pregnancy, every time I walked even somewhat briskly or around a large facility (even just in the mall or Target), I experienced "runner's stitches" in my lower abdomen. I also had really bad backaches. As soon as I got this belt, I strapped it on and went shopping at Target and walked around for an hour without any problems, when previously I could hardly walk from the maternity section to the toy section without doubling over from the cramping. Now I can even go on half hour walks around the neighborhood or on the treadmill with no problem!The only down side to this product, which I'm sure is true of all belts like this, is that when I'm sitting down it's too snug so I have to loosen it and then tighten it again when I stand up to walk around. It's main purpose for me though is to help when walking around stores or for excercise, so that's not a major issue for me. Overall, this is a really great product.
