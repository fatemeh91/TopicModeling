review/text: I bought this to pick up fragile watch parts that can't be seen by eye. When I drop a small part I sweep the area with the bissell, check the contents and usually find my part. A normal vaccuum would destroy them. This is not for large areas or thorough cleaning. Otherwise I clean with a Dyson.
