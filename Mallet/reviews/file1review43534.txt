review/text: I bought it after seeing many good reviews @ Amazon, but this thing give me wierd readings, sometime they make sense, sometime dont, so i'm not sure how reliable and accurate this thing is when checking BP. I've tried calibrated it with other bp measuring equipment, and still it is not consistent. i'm still deciding if i should keep it or return back. if anyone knows any trick which needs to be done on this machine in order to make it human friendly, then let me know
