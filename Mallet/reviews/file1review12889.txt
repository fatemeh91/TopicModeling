review/text: This is the second Elasto-gel mask I've owned. The first lasted about three years, and normal wear and tear (and a teething puppy) took it's toll.The gel got floppy, and the band stretched out of shape. When I got the new one, though, I didn't imagine how much better the replacement would feel. The elastic/velcro band enables a snug fit, the gel is pliable enough and the fabric soft enough to conform nicely to your face. I use this for afternoon naps and to sleep in a bit on weekends...Blocks out every bit of light,and always helps facilitate a nice sound sleep. Just the coolness it has sitting on your nightstand is enough to sooth tired eyes. Next time, I won't wait quite as long to replace it. But considering it's used almost every day, a two year lifespan is fine with me.Also, the mask is made in USA and extremely well packaged.
