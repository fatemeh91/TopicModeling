review/text: I had several warts on my neck and chest for 2 years. This product removed most of them in 6 weeks. I used this product every day for 6 weeks. During the usage of this stuff, my skin around the warts turned to brown because of the acid but it recovered 2-3 days after the warts were removed. I have only 2 tough warts left which they have got dried and it is almost the time for them to get off my skin. I preferred to use the stuff with a pin instead of rubbing it to my whole skin. Also, I have 4/5 of the stuff left for the future!
