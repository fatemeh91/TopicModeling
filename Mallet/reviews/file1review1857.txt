review/text: I just received this soap today, and used it no more than 20 minutes ago. I have had a problem with insanely and painfully itchy feet for years now. With not the time or the money to visit a podiatrist, I finally decided to look into something like this. After my first use, my feet don't itch terribly from simply touching them, and I'm happy to know that it is working. The unaffected parts are extremely smooth besides. We'll see how they are in a week, but I'm pretty confident so far.
