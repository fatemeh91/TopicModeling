review/text: Good protein is hard to find. There are a lot of choices but I've heard good things about this brand before I even purchased it...and I'm glad I did.Price is great and the taste is better than most protein products I've tried. The Mint Chocolate tastes like a Thin Mint shake. Musclemilk tastes a little better but it's not a pure whey protein product like this is.Back to ON. It mixes really well so you won't get too many protein chunks floating in your shake.
