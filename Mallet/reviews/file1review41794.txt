review/text: Previously I used a basic Sonicare and liked it a lot. But the battery died and they wouldn't replace it. I read all the reviews here before buying this. In short, after 3 weeks of use- it works well.Positives-The charger is compact and multi-voltage-The toothbrush last just over a week w/o re-charge (2 full brushing/day)-It physically tells you to change to the next mouth area by a quick reverse on the bristles every 30 seconds.Negatives-Much louder than the Sonicare. Took some getting used to (it does have a slower quieter/softer setting but it's still loud)-The multiple brush head & handle holder is way bigger than it needs to be. Takes up a lot of room on the counter.-doesn't auto stop after 2 mins like the Sonicare. Just reverses to let you know and keeps going.
