review/text: I'm a veteran green drink user, often slurping them down for breakfast, and I'm notorious in my circle for adding things that also taste bad, like brewer's yeast, so as to drink all my foul-tasting supplements in one gulp. After reading reviews about how horrible this one was to drink, I was surprised to find it pleasantly ordinary. I mixed up a big cup of green drink with brewer's yeast on my very first try, and it wasn't the most horrible flavor I'd ever experienced. (The worst, incidentally, was when I mixed acai juice with my green drink/brewer's yeast mixture. I hate acai berry.) So my point is, don't assume that this drink will taste bad just because others find it foul. If you're used to the flavors of health foods, you may have had worse in the past. It only takes a few seconds to glug it down, and then you feel better all day. My body loves this stuff.
