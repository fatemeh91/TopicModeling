review/text: I originally bought this detergent because it was environmentally friendly (and still a good price!) but it ended up being a great product as well. my clothes smell fantastic, they are super soft (I use 7th gen fabric softener, too), and my allergies have left me alone since I started using it. I highly recommend this product!!
