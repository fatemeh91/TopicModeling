review/text: I have the Spenco women's arch supports for over 2 years now, and they're just as good as when I first got them. They offer true support and comfort at an amazingly low price. Believe me, I've had custom made orthotics as well as cheaper ones such as the ones made by Lynco, and these Spenco ones are my favorite. They easily can be molded to your specific foot shape. They also have a foam type padding on top that makes them comfy to wear and very durable. They're easy to clean as well. I highly recommend them!
