review/text: I bought this for my son who is currently potty training. He just turned two and is pretty big for his age, but this seat fits him perfectly. We have had no problems with urine spills, the guard at the front keeps it all in the toilet. He likes helping to put the potty on and take it off too by turning the dial that tightens and loosens the potty seat on the toilet. This is the only toilet seat we've tried, but it's working out great for us. I would definitely recommend it!
