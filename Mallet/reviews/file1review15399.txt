review/text: This is not Auric Blends incense. Don't be fooled. The order arrived 2 weeks after I ordered it (past the estimated delivery date), and as soon as I pulled the package out of the mail, I could smell the cheap incense that it was before even opening the envelope. This is a cheap, knock-off incense. Don't buy.
