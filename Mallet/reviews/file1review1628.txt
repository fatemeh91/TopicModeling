review/text: I think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work. My foot doctor recommended this to me and it's hard to find in local stores. It is stronger so watch you don't use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site. One tip my dr. gave me was to use a Q-Tip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart. That way you don't re-infect yourself! I would definately purchase this again.
