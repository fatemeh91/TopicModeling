review/text: The other reviews convinced me this product was what I was looking for - quick and easy cleanups in between major vacuuming. I unpacked it as soon as I got it and tried it out on the cracker crumbs on our hardwood floor left from lunch. What it would pick up was only the smallest of crumbs, and even some of those it just brushed around on the floor. I decided to return it immediately. Problem now is getting the handle unassembled to repack.
