review/text: I have been enjoying this tea for years now. After a long day of hiking or hard work it can really help to put the mind and body at ease. My apologies to anyone who has been pleasantly enjoying the placebo effect from this tea...For those interested in using Kava, you should know that the threshold dose for feeling any effects of from kava is about 150mg of kavalactones- keep in mind that this is considered a low dose. One bag of Yogi's Kava tea contains just over 20mg of active ingredients (kavalactones). At lower doses around these levels I have noticed slight mental relaxation and occassionally very vivid dreams. Doses of 300mg (which equates to about a full box of Yogi tea) and much higher are more effective for relief of anxiety and muscle soreness, and are more typical of the dosage in traditional use by Pacific Islanders.When I use this tea I always use between 10-16 TEABAGS PER CUP! This looks ridiculous while steeping, but makes sense considering Yogi only puts about 1/8 of a dose of Kava into their bags. Unsurprisingly, the suggested dose of 1-2 bags has been totally ineffective for me. When brewing the tea as strong as I do, I find that it is effective, delicious and requires no sweetener. Flavor can be improved (personal taste) by the addition of some milk or cream. It makes me laugh to read Yogi's instructions to add &#34;another&#34; teabag (for a total of less than 50mg kavalactones) after a stressful day. People, use at least half a box if you want to feel anything other than a placebo effect!Hopefully this is helpful to some of you folks!
