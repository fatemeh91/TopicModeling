review/text: The Remington MPT-2000 is an excellent device. It cuts hairs (if used by rotating the clipper inside the nasal passage). The cutting with rotation is most important. Pulling or jerking hair leads to possible infection. The infection would most likely be Step or the dreaded Staph ( the more common bacteria within the nose). The brass cutting device is important since it tends to retard or interfere with bacterial growth ( picked up when the cutting portion is within the nasal passage).I would use only one and the same one clipper for the nose so as not to cross contaminate the other areas where such a clipper might be used.The units are a little balky and need disassembling to clean. Be careful not to turn the switch to the motor "on" or you will have to realign the cutting portion with a linkage from the motor. The cutting head is disassembled easily by snapping a locking device back from the cutting head.
