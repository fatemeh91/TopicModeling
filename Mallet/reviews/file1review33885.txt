review/text: As with other ADC stethoscopes I have had, this one allows me to hear all that I need as an ER nurse. Not quite as good as my old cardiology one at distinguishing heart tones, but adequate for my current position. The bright pink color is also great for stopping it from growing legs as my others have if you know what I mean.
