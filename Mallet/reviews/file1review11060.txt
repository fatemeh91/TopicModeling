review/text: This Chlorofresh product was recommended to me in order to control my symptoms of IBS. It has surprisingly eliminated 90% of my symptoms and has given me my life back(I did not do much of anything for over a year due to my IBS). I started taking it in hopes that it would eliminate the odor of my gas and it did so very well. Even more impressive is the fact that it actually decreases the amount of gas that I have. I have gone from almost constant nonstop gas to practically none! As if this wasn't enough this product has also eliminated my body odors including underarm odor and bad breath, I don't even need deodorant really anymore! I have been taking 3-4 of these a day and I enjoy the fact they they are smaller doses so that I can spread them out more throughout my day. I even spoke to my Doctor to make sure that this product was safe to take and she informed me that it definitely is. I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from IBS or body odor problems!
