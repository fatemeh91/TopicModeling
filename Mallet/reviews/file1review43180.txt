review/text: I was eager to try this product because it is nontoxic and ecofriendly, but used it only once. My shower had been freshly cleaned, so I don't know whether it worked or not. I just know that the smell was so bad that I will not try it again. It left me feeling nauseous with a headache which is not how I want to feel fresh out of the shower.If you have even a slight sensitivy to smells, don't buy this product!
