review/text: I love magnets and wear them religiously and the reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because when you wear these little patches for me they were only good for about 1 time kinda like a bandaid you need to change and I didn't want the upkeep with that even though I liked that they were hidden. If they included a whole bunch of replacement patches then without a doubt they are worth it but until then I will have to stick to my magnetic jewelry especially seeing how I lost all my little magnets that came with this because I didn't order more stickers to hold them on and trying to use them more than 1or 2 times doesn't work! You will just have a sticker at the end of the day with no magnet if you work out or sweat alittle it just slides out.
