review/text: Great stuff! I've tried several OTC items for my knees and nothing has worked. My mom had me tried this product and WOW, I'm only 48, played sports all my life and had numerous knee, shoulder and elbow surgeries. Just one of those unlucky people with joint problems, no matter how active I am! So, give it a try! I hope it works as well for you as it does for me! It gets rid of the aches, pains and gives me my mobility back! What could be wrong with that! So, go for it!! JAS
