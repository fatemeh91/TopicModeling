review/text: I was miserable with hemmoroids. Had been using the over the counter stuff for months, which worked okay at first, but over time, it didn't help at all. I had burning, itching, swelling and felt like I was pooping out bits of broken glass. So after reading the other reviews, I decided to try this stuff. Couldn't wait to apply it when it came in the mail. I immediately felt a cooling sensation and to my amazement, my hemmoriods improved within 24 hours. Within 2 days, the pain and itching were completely gone! That was a month ago. Since then, I had one flare up and I applied this miracle cream right away and again, problem solved. Still looking into what causes hemmoriods, I don't believe it's from "straining", because I don't get constipated, but I do believe diet has something to do with it. I'm now eating more raw fruits and vegetables and taking a probiotic and enzymes. But when I do have flare ups, I know this stuff will take care of it. I will always keep this in my medicine cabinet.
