review/text: I am in love with this vacuum. It's crazy powerful and the roller attachment is perfect for the couches (I have an American Bulldog and a St. Bernard that run my house). The only problem, which I suppose could be a big one, is that the roller attachment came apart and I had to tape it closed. I'm not sure how it broke, but I tend to be rough with my stuff, so I could have dropped it or something. Once it was taped it worked good as new. I have no other complaints.
