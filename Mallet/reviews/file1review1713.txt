review/text: Ok, I had a bad case of big toenail fungus, about 90% coverage and my nail was falling off, picked this up after reading about tea tree oil, and I can happily say that my nail is now completely clean and healthy! thanks to this soap.I tell you a bit about my regimen, maybe it will help somebody, the first thing you will notice is, well basically nothing! for more than a month of use I could not tell if the product was working, in fact at times it seems that my fungus had gotten worst, nonetheless I kept using it; I would trim my bad nail as much as I could and I would wash my toe with the soap, when I shower, which generates plenty foam, sometimes at night before going to bed I would apply a few drops of the oil undiluted.I did this everyday for more than a month until empty, and I was really disappointment because I didn't see any improvement, I went ahead and cut the rest of the bad nail, which it seemed to fall off rather easily, and started to look into more expensive alternatives, but a couple of weeks later I noticed my nail starting to grow back, and this time it was clean! none of the discolored, thick stuff!I'm happy with this product, my nail is completely cured and as much as I hope never having to use it again, I would trust it 100%.
