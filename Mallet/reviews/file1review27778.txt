review/text: This is some great protein. I usually take three scoops plus 20 ounces of water and shake it up. It mixes very well with water and tastes great. Does not taste watered down at all. The protein has worked great for me so far. I work out around 4 to 5 times a week and this is perfect for quick recovery needs. 24 grams of protein a scoop keeps me from drinking shakes all day. I drink 2 and a half of these a day and feel fine. No bloated feeling after drinking which is a plus.
