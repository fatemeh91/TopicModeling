review/text: After the first shock of realizing that one has to take 18 pills per day I started my first month. So far lost 6 pounds in three weeks. At the same time eating low-carb and 4 times a week exercise. It supports a good exercise and diet plan but I doubt it will cut your weight while you stay on the couch. First days were tough because it raises the heart-rate. Cound not sleep first night. Would recommend not to use it if you have high blood pressure or similar health issues.
