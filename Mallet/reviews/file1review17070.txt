review/text: I always used Wahl trimmers but the last one i bought was a piece of junk so i switched to a Remington beard trimmer based on all the favorable reviews.I am very happy with my new purchase.It has good hand feel and balance and has many settings for various lengths.I used the lowest setting and was left with only a stubble of a beard but that was my own fault.I kind of like the look it gave me.There is no more oiling which is a nice feature.It came fully charged out of the package which was nice.There is no charging stand to hold unit while charging which is not a problem for me.All in all it seems to be a well built unit that should last for years....
