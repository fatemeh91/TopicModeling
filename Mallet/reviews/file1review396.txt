review/text: As my title says this vibrator has strong vibration and is amazingly quiet when using the vibration only. The "Floating Beads" are a bit louder, but are worth the extra noise. I love being able to adjust the level of the vibration with just the touch of a button. This allows it to suit your individual needs all through out the experience. It is a bit on the large size, but not to the point of being uncomfortable by any means. This toy is also very durable and is now going on one full years use, (Deployed husband turned ex-husband this toy has seen some use!)
