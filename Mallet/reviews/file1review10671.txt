review/text: Overall, this was a good bathtub for us and served its purpose until our daughter was a little over 7 months old and outgrew it. HOWEVER ... I want to warn everyone interested in this tub that the ducky begins to take on that "wet-sponge" smell very quickly in spite of regular machine washings and hanging it to dry immediately after bathing (at least ours did). The tub without the ducky is pretty slippery, so I would recommend buying a non-slip mat to put in the tub instead of the ducky. You can always use the non-slip mat again when your baby transitions to the big tub.
