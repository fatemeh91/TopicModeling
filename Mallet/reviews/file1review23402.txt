review/text: Very cute stethoscope, but not recommended for any clinician that is interested in auscultating without having to guess. It would be a great gag gift or even sufficient for pediatric patients. Not recommended for patients with various co-morbidities. I wouldn't spend more than $19.99 or less on this product.
