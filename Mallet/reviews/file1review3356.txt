review/text: I started taking Chitosan around the 13th of Nov. I wore a size 16-18 in pants. I am a 46 year old truck driver so losing weight was very difficult. I was taking two pills,20 minutes before each meal. By Christmas I was down to a 13 pants. 30 days I lost 4 pants sizes! I didn't change what I ate and I didn't exercise any more than usual. I did how ever have to go buy new pants... lol. Now I only take it once a day every other day to maintain my size. I hope it does the same for you.
