review/text: I bought this for my wife. We both read the instructions and tried to figure just why there were so many attachments. We hunt for a AAA battery for it, which was not included for some unknown reason. She tried it. She tried another attachment, then another. Now 20 minutes into the project she picks up a 5 blade razor and in 15 seconds was finished. She packed up the Revlon Grooming System and said "Return it!" Now I am busy hunting for all the packaging bits and pieces. A waste of time and money.
