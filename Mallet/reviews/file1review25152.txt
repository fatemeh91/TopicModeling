review/text: We had the diaper champ with our first and I wish I had bought another. The "touch free" worked with about as much frequency as those hand dryers in the public restrooms. And the gears inside jammed up everytime the pail got full. (about 1-2 times a week with 2 kids) Don't waste your money with this it's a piece of crap.
