review/text: I have taken MM B Complex for several years as I have hypothyroidism and need my B Vitamins to keep my body running smoothly with fewer aches and pains. Many doctors recommend Metabolic Maintenance supplements and Dr.Burt Berkson recommends this B complex to be taken with MM's Alpha Lipoic Acid to heal a damaged liver or just to stay healthy. Berkson likes Metabolic Maintenance brand because it is a high quality supplement.It pays to shop around for the best price but I have found Amazon often has the best price on Metabolic Maintenance supplements.
