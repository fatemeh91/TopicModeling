review/text: I've used custom made orthotics inserts for several years an spend hundreds of dollars but the never work good, them my doctor gave me a pair of this ortotics and they worked better than the $300 custom made and cost only $30. Since Then I order 3 more pairs from Amazon. Very satisfied. Good quality and feel great,As always Amazon was excellent in the buying process and the shipping,Mario
