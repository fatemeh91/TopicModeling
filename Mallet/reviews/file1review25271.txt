review/text: I bought this in a package deal since there are many times when the rechargable battery doesn't have enough power to get through what I trying to do. I assumed that the package was put together by people who knew what they were doing. No Way. There is now way this battery can be used with the Sennheiser headphones that I purchased. I have no idea how to find out what it can be used with.Lesson is; research the parts of a package before you buy the package.
