review/text: I have been using this shampoo along with the mink oil balm by Klorane for nearly 2 months. Unlike other shampoos that give good results the first few times, and then you need to switch, this shampoo consistently gives great results. I have wavy hair - this give the perfect amount of conditioning and cleaning without overdrying hair, which leads to frizz. It is light enough to leave volume! I highly recommend using both products, you will see the difference in the first use. You can also see my review for the mink oil balm.Klorane Balm Mink Oil 5.07oz
