review/text: I just received my magnifier and I either have a defective one or I am not using it properly. I have placed it flat on a table and put a stamp under it to test it out. It's a tiny stamp and yet it doesn't show the whole thing plus, what I can see, is distorted and hurts my eyes. Is it supposed to be like this? I can see far more with my 10x hand held tiny loupe. Guess I need to return this.
