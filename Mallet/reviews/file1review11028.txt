review/text: People usually don't tell you. They might just tell somebody else you have bad breath. Fortunately my girlfriend has no problem being blunt. And if you believe mouthwash has anything to do with odors coming out of your nose and mouth and pores... well.. whatever. Read about it. Alcohol and chocolate and lots of different foods will feed the bacteria in your digestive tract and then you have 'bad breath' that you can't smell but people in your face can. Take a swig of this stuff. Tastes good. And the chlorophyl do their thing on you immediately. Nice. It works.
