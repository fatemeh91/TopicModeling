review/text: I've had this trimmer for about 2 years now. At first I loved it's simplicity and not having to interchange a bunch of guards to fade my beard up to my sideburns but now it's time for a new one. It just doesn't hold a charge anymore. Even on full charge I can only get through half my beard before it dies. Maybe 10 seconds of run time. I'm not sure why. Maybe the battery suffers from memory issues but I thought it was a Lithium Ion battery which shouldn't have that problem. Now looking for a new trimmer but may purchase this one again. I have a Norelco, for nose trimming and edging, and it's battery has lasted for over 5 years.
