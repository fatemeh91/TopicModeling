review/text: For anyone who is informed enough about B-12 to actually order Methylcobalamin in particular (good job by the way - it's the active form of B-12, better quality, and more expensive), you really need to know that this is NOT methylcobalamin. Like me, you might be swayed by those gigantic block letters that read "METHYLCOBALAMIN B-12 5000" on the front of the bottle into thinking that this is, well... Methylcobalamin B-12 5000. The truth is, it contains perhaps a trace of Methyl-B12 but it is mainly just good old Cyanocobalamin - the cheap, inactive, synthetic B-12. See, what the Amazon description and images do not tell you (as of this post) is what the back of the bottle says:Vitamin B-12 ------------- 5000 mcg*(as cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin)Notice the order of those ingredients on the back label, and also take note that the word cyanocobalamin does not appear on the front of the bottle whatsoever. This is very deceptive and I had to waste my time sending these back.Unless you don't mind paying for Methyl-B12 but receiving cheap Cyano-B12, steer clear of this product.
