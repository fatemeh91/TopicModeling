review/text: Got a new Oral-B Triumph toothbrush for our second home. It is a significant improvement over my older Oral-B. More power and stronger battery. My old oral-B collects crud on the post as moisture from my rinsed toothbrush drips down to the bottom. The triumph doesn't seem to have that problem. One thing my old one has that I miss in the Triumph is a blue light to indicate it is charging. The blue light serves as a small night light in the bathroom.
