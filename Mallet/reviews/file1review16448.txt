review/text: My sister gave this to me when I was having problems. The container she gave me is dated back to 1981 and it stilll works great. I am ordering another bottle only becuase I am afraid that I may not be able to find this in the future. It works wonderful. The tag on the 1981 bottle cost 4.71 amazing! I recommend it to anyone.
