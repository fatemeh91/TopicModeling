review/text: I have been using this device for about 6 months, and I really don't think it's doing anything. The spray does not really make it all the way to the back wall, and when it does, it is only about 3 feet off the floor.When you add up the expense of the refills, there is not really a benefit for the cost. Stick with regular cleaning supplies.
