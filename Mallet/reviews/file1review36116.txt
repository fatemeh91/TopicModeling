review/text: I'm in the middle of this cleansing program, I am only doing 2 weeks of cleansing. Not to be too graphical, but I am very regular most of the time so I didn't think I needed a product such as this. After I started the cleansing as specified, (you start at night) the next day I moved bowels about 5 times, and not just a small amount each time. Thinking, hmm, "I have to be empty", but wanting to complete the treament as specified, I still continued to take the product. The next day I moved bowels again 4 times, and I am now on day 4 with 2 movements again today. My stomach is flatter as they say it the documents included with this product. I guess I had a lot of build up in my colon and didn't realize it.I still have 10 days left on this product (you can do up to 30 days, but I don't think I will need it) and will finish as directed.I am 37 years old, and I did try a cleansing kit from GNC (don't remember the name), this is the first time I have had anything like this work the way it does. It really works fantastic.The only downside is that after I take it, I need to stay near a bathroom for a few hours. I would recommend this product and will continue to use in the future.
