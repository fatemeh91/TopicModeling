review/text: I have a son who has never fussed taking his vitamins. I love the rainbow light brand for myself so when I saw these I thought great. Wrong! These taste horrible. At first I thought my son was fussing because they weren't the cool dinosaurs so I decided to give them a try. Yuck. This is not a kid friendly taste at all. Food based or not these are not worth the price because the will not be consumed in my house.
