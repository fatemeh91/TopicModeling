review/text: I was referred to this product by a lactation consultant who swore by it. I had gone back to work a few weeks prior and my supply was dwindling severly due to the pump not being nearly as efficient as my little man. I began taking far more than the recommended dose of the More Milk Plus, in an effort to really up my supply. The product tasted really nasty, even when mixed with a strong tasting drink and I did not see any major difference in my supply.
