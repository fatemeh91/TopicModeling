review/text: My infant son had a persistent oral thrush and neither nystatin or diflucan worked t get rid of it. The last resort was the Gentian voilet and it should've been used as the first trratment. Other than the purple mouth, it worked great.WARNINGIt stains pretty badly so make sure it doesn't spill or get on any good fabrics.
