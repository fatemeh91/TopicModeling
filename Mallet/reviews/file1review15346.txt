review/text: I used one of these Zippo pocket ashtrays for about two years. It is well designed, worked great, and was very convenient. My only complaint was that it was made out of cheap pot-metal and looked really beat up in a very short time. One made of aluminum or, better yet, stainless steel, would be a much better deal.Maybe they listened to me, because this product is now made of, I believe, aluminum, and doesn't look shabby in a short time, like my last one did. Now, it not only works great, but looks great as well. Five stars this time.
