review/text: should have bought it a long time ago - no more shaving or waxing for me! i was a little nervous because of all the reviews saying it hurt to use but i dont think it hurt that much. like lots of little pinches. i think to test your pain level you can try tweezing out some hairs without the emjoi.again - LOVE it - my underarms and legs are soooooo smooth.
