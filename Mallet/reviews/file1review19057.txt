review/text: I have used this product for a few years now and I love the product but the company is what I have a problem with. Shipping took forever to get here and the shipping cost was outrageous. They were on clearance so I got 5 boxes and was charged $5 per box in shipping but when they got to my house all the condoms had been removed from their original packaging and place in one box and i was still charged $25 for shipping even though it cost the company less than $2. The S&H for this company rips you off!!!
