review/text: I love theses pills!! I started taking these on Aug 1, today is Aug 23 and I have lost 15 lbs to date (175lbs to 160lbs). After doing my research I decided to start out taking only 1 pill in the morning with lots of water. After the first pill I did not feel nauseated at all. I felt extremely energetic. I still take 1 pill a day but never later than 1pm, because I found that I have a hard time sleeping at night if I do. I am caffeine-sensitive so the one pill is plenty for me (I don't drink coffee). I must state that I do not believe that these pills are a miracle worker, they are simply giving my weight loss a boost. I exercise about 2-3 times a week for about an hour and I take the stairs instead of elevator and always park farthest away. I also eat what I want, but I don't have bad eating habits to begin with. However, if I want a piece of cake, I will eat a piece of cake. I don't deprive myself of anything, but again at the same time I make healthy food choices. To be quite honest, I don't crave junk food like I used to. I think that losing this weight has had a positive impact on my food choices. I have tried just about every diet known to man and I finally feel that I am not dieting. If you are considering zantrex please try 1 pill a day to see how you react to it. I don't have any side effects that some people say they have experienced. Again start slow to see if these pills are for you.
