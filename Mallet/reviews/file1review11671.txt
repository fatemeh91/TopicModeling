review/text: This charger does charge very fast either a standard or high capacity Panasonic and generic brand batteries. I have 2 standard, 2 extra capacity generics and the original battery that came with the PVGS-12 camera and charges all without no problems in about 1 hour.The included car adapter is perfect for when you take the camera on the road.I've bought 2 of this units now 'cause I have many batteries and remember that when it comes to video/photography, you can't have too many batteries, always be prepared with a charged battery.
