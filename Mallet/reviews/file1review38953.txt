review/text: She'd been using the same old cartridge for much too long, and didn't even realize how bad it was. Like others I tried without success to find refills in a local store. I think it's the same thing as refills for the Gillette Excel, just a different color, but you can't get either in drugstores -- probably a case of planned obsolescence. I'll continue to buy refills from Amazon for as long as I can, rather than the latest higher-priced razor systems that don't work any better.
