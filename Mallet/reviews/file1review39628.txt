review/text: I bought this on a whim and it definitely has helped me keep a regular flossing schedule which I had trouble doing before. I like how I don't need to buy replacement head packs like the other flossers out there. I can just use whatever floss I have. My only gripe is they could have made the prongs a little closer together so it would fit in my mouth a little easier.Some advice: Make sure you get shred proof floss when using this.
