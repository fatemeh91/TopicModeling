review/text: I think Speed Stick is a quality product. I like the way it goes on with no mess. It's effective at odor and wetness control. The unscented Speedstick is especially nice because it doesn't clash with the scent of my after shave, like some deodorants do. This is a great product at a good price. I'll definitely purchase and use Speed Stick Antiperspirant & Deodorant again.
