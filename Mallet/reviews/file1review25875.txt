review/text: The first time I tried to use this charger it did not work. When I plugged it in the charging light did not come on. A friend who is an electrical engineer checked it out with his volt meter and verified that it did not work.I bought a new and different charger that does work. I kept the batteries from the first unit so now I have 8 rechargeable batteries.I did not try to return the bad unit yet as I went on a trip with my new camera.
