review/text: I'm and older woman and have recently started running, I was having trouble with my knees. Several of the women I run with said I need to be taking glucosamine(sp?)so I bought some. Then one of the ladies told me about Joint Health and how it could take the place of all my individual vitamins but pretty expensive. I immediately went online and found it at Amazon for about half the price and it is awesome, been taking for about a month and it has made the world of difference. Love it. You can get a free sample at health food stores.
