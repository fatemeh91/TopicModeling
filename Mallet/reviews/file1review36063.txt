review/text: I can eat pretty much anything, I just don't care too much about the taste, however this one is beyond just a bad taste, it is much worse than just disgusting. When I opened the can it smelled very bad, similar to rotten fish mixed with spoiled eggs.I still tried it. I had to hold myself from vomiting it. It stayed down. I put the can in the fridge, and it tasted slightly better next time but the taste returned after about a week. I threw this in garbage where it belongs. I tried several other products by "NOW" which were great by the way, they just need to fix a taste on this one.
