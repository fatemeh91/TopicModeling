review/text: initially excited about this product. Must say after 1st use, I haven't used it again. It's cumbersome to use because it's heavy to carry after filling it with water. I do like the fact that the water continues to be heated. One of the things I originally liked was the pumice stone. But it's in a position, where you have to take your foot out of the water to use and even then it's not that effective. So if your primary objective is to use it for exfoliating, it's not very good at that.
