review/text: I've had dry eye for a few years, not realizing what it was. Itchy watery eyes every day, I assumed it was allergies. Then in casual conversation I described my symptoms and someone said "Oh, that's dry eye" which didn't make sense to me since my eyes were watering, tears dripping down my face, for most of the day every day. But they insisted that it was dry eye... I began with the thera tears lubricating drops which felt AMAZING so I decided to try these supplements. Less than a week in and the difference is remarkable. No more "crying" all day, no more blurred vision, itching, sandy feeling. It's wonderful. I hope it will last. As for "fish burps" I take it before bed. It's digested by morning.
