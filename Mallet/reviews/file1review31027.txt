review/text: Three letters. O..M..G! I freaking love this lip balm! I gotta say it had me fooled, cause here I was thinking,"this is just gonna be your average natural product that works okay, but still not be good enough for me not to stray away from." Well let me tell you this..I was completely wrong..wrong in a good way of course. The second I put this on, I literally wanted to discard all of my other lip products that don't compare. For starters, this lip balm smell sooooo good, I wasn't sure if I was suppose to eat it or put it on my lips. And it just leave your lips feeling oh so soft and supple. You should definitely put this product on when your lips are fresh and soft, or you will lose a battle to this balm being softer than your lips. And oh, the texture, so silky and smooth; not like those stiff to the touch chap sticks, where the tops break off upon application. Everything about this product, says you're about to get a run for your money. I honestly feel like I should have paid more for this. And the spf is just the cherry on the top. Buy this product if you want your lips left feeling silky, soft and supple! My tip is to wet your washcloth in warm to hot water, wring it out, fold it, and bite down on it with your lips; then apply the balm. What a beautiful result! Kiss My Face has got my vote!
