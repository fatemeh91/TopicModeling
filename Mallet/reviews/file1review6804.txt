review/text: I actually almost sent this product back without even opening it. Just before it arrived I went to Brookstone and purchased a pulsating massager w/ a lot of power. It worked so well I figured I didn't really need the backbuddy. I use the massager almost daily...but yesterday felt like I was overdoing it a bit. It's super powerful and when I do my neck I literally see triplicate, lol. Also, even thought the pulsating is good, i didn't feel like it was really getting this particular knot out. I decided to get the box for the backbuddy off the porch, open it up and try it. The moment it touched my shoulders I knew it was a keeper! Very impressive. Seriously. I had doubts about how comfortable it would be but I have to say its perfect. I like a lot of pressure and this thing gives you a ton of leverage w/o having to work too hard. Very well made. Def recommend!
