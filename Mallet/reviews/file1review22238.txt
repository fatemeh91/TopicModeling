review/text: I prefer using glass storage as much as possible but once in a while when I have to freeze something, I prefer these so I dont have to worry about it. Once they have been well used, I can recycle them too. Of course they stack more neatly in my cabinet than the glass locks.This was a very good deal even without the subscribe and save. I have used rubbermaid until now but am very satisfied switching to ziploc. I especially like the measure marking on the boxes. Very good package, every piece in it is equally useful. Glad to recommend.
