review/text: I've been taking half a scoop (see why, below) each day for a couple weeks now and I think I do see an increase in energy. Also, my fingernails seem to be stronger and growing faster, interestingly enough.My main reason for posting this review is for folks like me who don't like the taste of Green Vibrance. I've been doing the following and it is working like a CHARM:1) Fill shot glass 80% full with cold water2) Mix in half a scoop of Green Vibrance (any more, and it won't really dissolve.)3) Pinch nose, take shot4) While still pinching nose, begin to chew on a Lifesaver or other candy5) Un-pinch nose, and voila! You taste only candy!I guess I could do two shots to get the full one-scoop dose, but so far I seem to be getting results with only half, so I'm not going to fix what isn't broken.
