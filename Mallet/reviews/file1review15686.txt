review/text: I have a problem with my ankles swelling (especially during hot and humid weather.) They swell so bad that you can't even tell that I have an ankle bone. I always keep Capisette in stock for this purpose. I take them regularly during the spring & summer months and just whenever I need them other times. I hate going to the doctor and definitely prefer natural herbs to prescription medicine. I would recommend this product to everyone with fluid issues.
