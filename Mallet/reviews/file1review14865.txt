review/text: I love Met-Rx. I have put on pounds of muscle with Met-Rx. But stick with the basic vanilla and chocolate. This does not taste like you would imagine cake batter to taste. I was so excited when it arrived that I made one right after my first workout. What a disappointment. I had visions of licking the bowl when my mom was making a cake when I was a little boy. Instead it was sort of an artifical flavor disaster. So use Met-Rx for sure, just not this flavor.
