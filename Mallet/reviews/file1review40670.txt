review/text: I love the EAS Carb Sense Bars - Peanut Butter Choc flavor. I ordered through Amazon because I couldn't find them in my local store and the other store I used had melted version of the bars. I ordered from Amazon hoping they would have figured out how to circumvent the texas summer heat. I was wrong. The 3 boxes I order all came melted. I love the product but delivery seems to be a problem in the summer. I'm not ordering via Amazon until the weather turns in my favor.
