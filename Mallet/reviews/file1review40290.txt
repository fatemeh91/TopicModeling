review/text: These straps are cotton so they stretch during a heavy lift and transfer a lot of the weight back to your hands. It's difficult to get a good grip on heavy weight because of this. Also, the pad is too long so the strap can't be properly tightened around the bar because the loop hits on the pad. I would suggest non-cotton straps with a better pad design (e.g. the Harbinger nylon straps) for advanced lifting.
