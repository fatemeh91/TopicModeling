review/text: I purchased this because it was recommended by my Dr. I have ALS and my neck cannot hold my head up very long. I purchased the largest one I could find, and the merchant sent it on time, etc. My problem is that I did not try one on first, and these cannot be returned. The brace is too small for my neck and head. So try before you buy is my recommendation.
