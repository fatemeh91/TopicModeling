review/text: Unlike most of the other reviews i did not grow up using this razor. When i started shaving i tried every razor on the market, then my mother bought me a Personal Touch Razor, and i have been using it ever since. I was forced to search for a new razor a year ago after i left my razor in a london hotel room. This search forced me to try Schicks newer produts, in addition to products by every other razor company on the market. NOTHING COMPARES to the personal touch. This razor is the BEST razor on the market, and the company needs to bring it back it is without fault. Even if i am in a rush and shaving too fast, i still do not nick or cut myself, something that has happened many times with the many other inferior razors. There is no comparison when it comes to this debate. This is the best, and i agree with the other women on this site, and Schick needs to bring it back.
