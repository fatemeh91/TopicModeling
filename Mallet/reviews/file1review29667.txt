review/text: I would have one let down and the pad would be soaked through PLUS my clothing. And sometimes just a part of the pad would be wet but still leak all over my clothes! I am not impressed but having washable is nice... Avent's disposable pads are AMAZING however. I'll have several let downs and not a drop will get anywhere but on the nursing pad. So if your let downs only produce a drop or two, I'd definitely get these washable ones...but keep the lanolin close by cause if you don't put some on you'll stick to the pad and pulling it off after you've had let down and it's dried is pretty painful. But those disposable ones don't have any problems like that. GET THE DISPOSABLE ONES!! :)
