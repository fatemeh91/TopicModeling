review/text: I've used a less expensive ($50-range) Braun shaver for more than 15 years, & I think that this model is infinitely better. It provides a much closer shave w/ far greater comfort. It's esp. good at getting hard-to-reach curved surfaces (chin, jaw, adam's apple).I'm a little skeptical that the cleaning system is necessary, but the quality of the shaver suggests that the cleaner may be just as good.
