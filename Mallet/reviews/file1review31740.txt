review/text: As a Volunteer Search And Rescue team leader and someone who has spent a lot of time of in the field, I recognize good gear when I see and handle it. The selection of items Doug Ritter personally picked (and in some cases worked with companies to have made) is incredibly well thought out and, almost more important, it is all of high quality. Perhaps the best thing about this kit is that you might actually have it with you when you need it - that part is up to you, but carrying this is no imposition. If you do need it, you can count on what is there to work.You should consider also carrying a small first aid kit (into which you've put any personal meds). One of the Adventure Medical Pocket first aid kits will fill the bill for this purpose. With only minimal additional gear (knife, map, water, something to eat as a start) you'd be pretty well set for an active day hike - perhaps more.But anyone can carry at least this small kit basically everywhere. Do your local SAR team a favor: don't get lost without these items! If you can be heard, stay warm, and attract attention you make it much more likely that you'll be found. This kit make all that -and more- possible!
