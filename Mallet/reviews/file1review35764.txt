review/text: Great Deal! Great Price! Sent to me &#34;lickity split&#34;! Would buy from this store again if they had these in stock. These are very comfortable. I first got these at a Brown's shoe store but then moved to another state where they don't have a Brown's. they are supposed to last a year for the average person...for me I would rather have a new one every 6 months. Online is the best way to get the best deal~!
