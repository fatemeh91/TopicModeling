review/text: The mirror is excellent - almost too much magnification - but the apparatus that extends and holds the mirror is stiff, not great in the adjustment department, and it is very expensive for what I got, in my opinion. I will be surprised if it will last and work very well for more than a year - used not for travel but in my home.
