review/text: I rarely go a day without using it to check halftone patterns and set files up for print, an essential tool. I also work with staccato screened prints, so the dots are twice as small as conventional screens, and this is good enough for that. a 15x might be better, but it would be too much for normal screened designs.This one is great quality and the best value of the 10x's I have seen.
