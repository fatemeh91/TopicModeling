review/text: I have tried every brand of diapers on my twins.. Pampers is the best! They never leak and hold on tight while my babies run away! I don't have to worry about them breaking open and leaving behind a big mess. The pampers Cruisers Have gotten me through all my Toddler days! I Love know that when one of my Toddles has a fall that their diaper will be there for the long hall!They are not Big or bulky and I Love being able to dress my Twins without the worry of having to dress them around the diaper!They have a great fit and so far my twins have not been able to take them off like a few other brands.~~ Amazon.com makes it easy for me to buy diapers.. However I wish that they would get the price to stay one price.. and be able to keep these diapers in stock.
