review/text: My husband has developed a case of Tinea Versicolor in the last couple of years. Last fall, it got really bad, it was all over his chest and shoulders and was spreading up his neck. I found this product on Amazon and read a ton of reviews. I thought this would help him, or at the very least not make it worse. Unfortunately, it didn't have any affect on my husband, but... in one of the reviews someone commented that their daughter took their bottle because it worked on their acne. I have adult onset cystic acne and it had exploded on my face recently, so I thought, "Why not" so I tried a little on my face and thank goodness. It helped calm my face way back down. It didn't happen overnight, but consistent use with my regular regiment really got it under control. So at least this product worked for one of us.
