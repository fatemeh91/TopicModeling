review/text: it holds heat and cold pretty well. for some reason i thought the picture made the item look full but mine is a different color and very thin and flat. because of this it actually doesnt even make contact with the majority of my cervical spinus processes which is where i need some direct contact. it certainly gets cool in the area underneath the collar but its not nearly what i was hoping for. i'll certainly continue to use it from time to time but i will also be keeping my eyes open for something more substantial that actually provides me with some significant relief. right now my best cold treatment is an ice bag awkwardly strapped around C7.
