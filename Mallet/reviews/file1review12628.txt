review/text: This just did not work, and i tried and tried and tried, i added lots and lots of lemon to water and drank it on a very empty tummy late at night before bed, nothing, tried it in the AM same thing nothing, i upped my dosage...nothing. well to be fair a little watery diarheah came out but not much...i have to say i am sticking w/ my swiss kriss...never lets me down, works in just hours. and costs only $9 online, lasts 2 months, but this would last maybe a few weeks given i took like 9 a day...and still did not work, too expensive, and since i got from an "independednt ebay distributor" at retail cost mind you who tells me she wont uphold the money back guarantee, i called the main company and they wont help me either, nothing. thats pathetic. really is. Have receipt for full price of $42.95 plus shipping costs, from their own distributor and they cant uphold the guarantee, which they offer 60day guarantee to customers. oh well. crappy company, hate the pills and dont like the way they treat their customers....wherever they purchase.
