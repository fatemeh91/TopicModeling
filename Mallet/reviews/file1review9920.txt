review/text: I have had my angles tweezerman's for a few years and finally decided to try the ingrown hair ones. Thats really the main reason i use them and let me stress how awesome these are.I was able to pull out hairs that were barely visible with little to no work. These are keepers and id rather use these instead of regular tweezers.
