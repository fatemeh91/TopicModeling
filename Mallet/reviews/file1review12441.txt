review/text: We paid a $187.00 copay at our podiatrist office for this splint. That's copay, after insurance paid their part. I wish we had thought to tell him we didn't want it until we checked online for one. We were ripped!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband had plantar fasciitis with a lot of heel pain in the morning so severe he couldn't walk first thing when he got up. After using this splint for a few weeks, he no longer wakes up unable to walk.
