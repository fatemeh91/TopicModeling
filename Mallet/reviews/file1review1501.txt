review/text: I just started using this, so maybe I should have waited a little longer, but here it goes. I think that for plantar warts, the best thing that works are the Dr. Scholl callus pads, however, they are expensive, and you have to keep them on for 48 hours, which is hard when you shower everyday, and it is located on your foot. The nice thing about the stick is that you can replace the bandage, or whatever you use, everyday. I tested out a spot on my foot without a bandage to keep the wax in place, and I still noticed something, so the people who said they might as well have been rubbing chapstick on their skin clearly did just get a dud. I ordered two sticks just in case that happened. The bottom line is, warts are stubborn, nasty little bastards, and no matter what you use to get rid of them, you have to be relentlessly consistent. This stuff is not going to make your wart go away overnight, but it definitely works, it doesn't smell at all, it's very easy to use, and the price is good.
