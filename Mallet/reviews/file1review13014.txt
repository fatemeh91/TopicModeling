review/text: I have chronic pain and muscle problems and was uncertain if this item would help anymore than a heating pad or ice pack. Here is why I'm glad that I bought it: 1) I can walk around and move without having to worry about it falling off or shifting because it has a Velcro strap and an soft plush cover. 2)It heats in about one minute and cools in the freezer to a nice gentle cold that is not startling and does not require me to remove and reapply because of my cold sensitivity. 3)The shape of the product with adjustable Velcro strap lets me place it high on my neck or draped lower over my shoulders which allows me to teat my entire shoulder/neck region. This product does not provide neck stability and does not have a stiff form, but is firm enough to reach the upper neck without falling over. One more thing) I accidentally microwaved it too long once and the product recovered nicely and did not change shape so I would sat it is great quality and durability.
