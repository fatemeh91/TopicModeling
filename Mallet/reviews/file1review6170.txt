review/text: After only a week, I clearly noticed a memory improvement. But Darn! I am also allergic to one of the ingredients because it caused a rash on both sides of my torso. It took a while to clear up after I discontinued. So now I'm trying out Standard Poors Ginko version -- so far no rash :)
