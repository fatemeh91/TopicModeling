review/text: I have chronic knots in my upper trap, levator scap and rhomboids. The best thing is to get a good massage but who can afford that? and I feel bad asking my husband every night. BBuddy really does allow you to apply a good amount of pressure to unreachable places. I also bought one for my sister.
