review/text: My husband really likes these vitamins! He works REALLY REALLY LONG Hours! Mostly 12 hours+ a day 7 day work weeks. He swears by them, they help keep him well through his stressful Aeronautics job! He has used them for years! He also takes extra Niacin, Vitamins C,D,E, Fish Oil, & Ginseng. He also eats alot of veggies and fruit, and gets regular rest.He said he would give it a 5 star except for they don't make him into Superman! Only close!
