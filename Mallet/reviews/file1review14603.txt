review/text: My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:1) Asthma2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)4) High blood pressure (hypertension)5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)8) Diabetes9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)10) High cholesterol11) Male infertility12) Heart attacks or strokes13) Leg cramps14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance."So, tell me what it cant heal?" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to start taking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.
