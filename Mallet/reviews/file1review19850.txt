review/text: We had a hard time finding a toilet trainer that would prevent our little boy from getting pee all over himself and our bathroom. This seat did the trick. It is easy to place on the toilet - our 2 1/2 year old can do it all by himself. It also seems comfortable to sit on. You don't have to worry about them falling off as this is a deeply seated toilet trainer. This allowed our little boy to sit confidently on the big toilet without fear of falling off. Overall, an excellect toilet trainer. We bought two for our house and two additional ones for the grandparents' homes.
