review/text: I have post-polio syndrome and my left hand and fingers were becoming weak. Because of this, one day I was unable to get out of the bathtub. A friend of mine had to help me out. But with the purchase of this item I am now able to take a shower and not worry about not being able to get in and out of the bathtub. I also like how it has the back which gives me support amd a sense of security. There is a shower head holder close at hand as well. The way it extends out over the edge of the tub is extremely convenient for transferring myself out of my wheelchair and onto the bench. All in all I'm extremely happy with this purchase.
