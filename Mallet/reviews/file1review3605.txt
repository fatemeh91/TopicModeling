review/text: It is way too hard to get this stuff off after use! If you happen to touch anything but your body, it is on there for good. The bottle itself develops a super greasy feel immediately after the first use. Go with the ID Glide water based lube instead. Millennium costs twice as much, is a total mess, and doesn't feel nearly as good. My GF hates this stuff too so it was a total loss!
