review/text: Works great. I was actually looking for something for the shower but I ended up just washing my windows and will be using it on the car windshield. It's sturdy , heavy, and the sponge feature is very nice. I'm gonna have to get a different one for the shower but this was worth getting. It looks like it will last a long time. I would not store any rubber products in the sun and wipe clean after every use to allow the blade to last longer. Also do not rest the squeegee on the rubber.
