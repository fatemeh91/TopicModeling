review/text: This product isn't as easy to do as I thought. I had to put them in water 3-4 times before I got a decent fit. After the fourth time, they stopped molding as well. I haven't used them with a whitening product yet, so we will see how they do with that. They don't get as snug of a fit as I was hoping, but we will see if they work.
