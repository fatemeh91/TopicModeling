review/text: This looks nice at night as at day. It is plastic and the detail design work is cheap. The lamp that came with it was damaged in the first moment I put this on. It needs a special lamp, you know there are two standards of winding most widely used, dont asdk me about how to call them, there is the one thats used everywhere and a second that has a smaller winding, well, the lamp needed is even a bit smaller then the second. It was not so easy to find replacement.
