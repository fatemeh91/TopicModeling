review/text: I bought this for my mom who is always complaining about achy feet. However, she is also a diabetic and not really supposed to soak her feet much, so she does it maybe once every 2 weeks or so, or when she really needs it, for about 15-20 minutes and I monitor the temperature for her. She loves the jets. Even though it was a bit pricier than most other spas, it has the advantage of adjusting the jets and the temperature which most of the other cheaper home spas didn't have.I plan on using it sometimes too, there's only one draw back, you can't add salts or any sort of lotions/oils to the water as it may clog the bubble jets. Apart from that, it's a really great product, especially for my mom, who can't use anything thing else to compliment the soak anyways, so she's happy. It's light weight, easy to drain and easy to clean!
