review/text: These pills are very large and thick and even cut in two, I found it difficult to shallow a pill cut in half. Since the pills are soft I would recommend that you grind the pill, using back of a spoon, into a powder and mix with something such as apple sauce or cottage cheese. If you attempt to shallow a whole pill make sure you have someone available to perform the Heimlich procedure.
