review/text: I'm really excited because after three days of use, I can see some improvement in my teeth already. I've had no burning of gums and have experienced only a slight sensitivity to my teeth. I don't know if the Sensodyne I started using two weeks ago in preparation for the use of the strips had any effect but the sensitivity is very tolerable for me. Some gripes: I wish they made the upper strip longer to cover more of the upper teeth and I wish they had cut the lower strip better because you can very well see 3/4 of an inch wasted when you peel off the lower strip from its plastic backing. Will report back on the final result once I've finished the whole treatment.
