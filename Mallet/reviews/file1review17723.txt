review/text: I've been using this trimmer for 2 months now and I have to say, I'm really impressed. Once fully charged the battery lasts for about 10 trims. For a full charge, it takes about 2-3 hours. And it does what it's supposed to. It helps me sculpt and maintain my beard and mustache. I haven't had any issues with it, no razor burns, etc. I would easily buy another. Very impressed!
