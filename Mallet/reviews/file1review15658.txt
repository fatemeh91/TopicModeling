review/text: I don't know what the other two ladies are talking about. I have 6 kids in my care five days a week for 8-10 hours, plus my own 15 month old. I use Pamper's Cruisers on all of them and have yet to have a leak. I guess it depends on the child and the person doing the diapering! I'd never buy any other brand.
