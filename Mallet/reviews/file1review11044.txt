review/text: Throw away your aluminum-filled deodorants and take these! If you're health conscious you can safely deodorize internally and use a chemical-free, natural deodorant or crystal. This will not keep you from perspiring but WILL stop odor, as long as you take it twice a day. GREAT insurance for those who have tried all other natural products--and been disappointed with the results. Give it a few days to 'kick in'.
