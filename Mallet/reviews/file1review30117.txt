review/text: I ordered this produce while suffering yet another sinus headache. As fate would have it, I haven't had one since, but I decided to try out the Bed Buddy one night any way. Now I'm addicted. I heat it in the microwave for a minute while brushing my teeth, snuggle down in bed and place it over my eyes and that's all she wrote. Yes, there is a slight odor which bothers some people, but not enough to be a problem for me. I also like that it's not attached to my head so once I go to sleep and roll over, it slips off and doesn't bother me when I wake up. Still waiting to try it on a headache, but it's already worth the money.
