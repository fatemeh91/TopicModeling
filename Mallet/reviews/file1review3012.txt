review/text: I was very happy with price, quality & performance of this product. I read somewhere about throwing a ring of condom-safe lubricant around tip before crowning-up. That works well for me! I am an average-Joe, but have in the past, broken through so many Durex products that I am utterly disappointed with their performance and was shopping for alternatives. I read about & sampled Crown, what a good choice. I cannot break a Crown during normal use, even if I try. They far exceed my expectations, though they truly perform just about as well as is frequently described in so many public reviews. Please, leave some for me, I will likely need to buy more 100's after visiting LOS. Happy to be Crowing up these days! Thanks for supplying high-quality products to protect the community.
