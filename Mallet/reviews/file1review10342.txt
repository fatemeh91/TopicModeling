review/text: New 9V batteries are supposed to be good for 5 years or close to it, according to Energizer. The batteries sent to me were old, it says right there on the battery they expire in 3 years. I don't use 9V as often as the other sizes so I might have them for a while therefore I need maximum shelf life. Mostly they will be used in smoke detectors which take a long time to use up a battery. It's not a good deal if you end up throwing them out before having a chance to use them.
