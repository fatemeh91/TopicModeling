review/text: I am very surprised at the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I have not been overly impressed. Yes the product is cooling but that is where it stops. The smell is very strong and musky, so strong in fact that I'm self conscious to use it if I am going out in public. Also, the packaging is entirely in Chinese ( god only know what we are really rubbing on our butts!), and if you read through the reviews, there is no consensus on what color and consistency it is supposed to have - again, not a confidence builder. It all makes me dubious about these miracle reviews.
