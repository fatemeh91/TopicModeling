review/text: I bought this mask for 2 reasons: 1) I suffer from terrible migraines 2) I have horrible allergies that affect my eyes. I was searching for something that would form to my face while having some weight to it. I have used it both cold and warm. In both instances it conformed nicely to my face and provided appropriate pressure where needed around my eyes. It remains cold or warm for approximately 15 - 20 minutes. Depending on your usage, a 2nd mask may be necessary to complete a treatment. The cover is made of a silky material that, according to the manufacturer, should not get wet. It is extremely comfortable to the touch and stays nice and soft, even after storing in the freezer for an entire day. The mask is adjustable and sized appropriately to accommodate large heads.
