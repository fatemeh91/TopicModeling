review/text: I was hopeful that this would be the affordable answer to the bunion problem (as opposed to surgery), but this product made my foot more painful than it was already. I stopped using it after about a month and have had better success (or at least less pain) by wearing only comfy shoes (no heels) and swimming/bike riding instead of walking for exercise. I don't recommend it.
