review/text: As a long time user of sleep masks to shut out light, I was looking for a lighter product for the upcoming warmer months. I tried this mask and I am so pleased with the product!It is much lighter yet it is still effective in shutting out annoying light. I actually purchased a second pair for my brother who is also sensitive to light when sleeping. This is an effective sleep aid. I highly recommend it.
