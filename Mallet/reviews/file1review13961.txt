review/text: After dipping these into hot water and fitting them, they only covered just my front teeth (about from the canines forward if you're curious). I was really looking for something that was like a whole fitting mouth tray without having to pay a dentist $250.00 or whatever they charge to mold one.If you just want something cheap to whiten your front teeth, then this product should do the job just fine. If you are looking for something to fit over all your teeth (molars included), then you may want to look elsewhere.
