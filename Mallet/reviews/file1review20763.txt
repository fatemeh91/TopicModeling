review/text: I just bought it and the first few shaes I have taken were amazing, so close I'd never use a blade again because of the convenience, closeness, and self cleaning.It's very close and for the amount of time you shave, unless you are a mutant lumberjack and grow hair at a fantastically fast rate, who cares how loud it is (not very compared to others), it if gets the job done...and it does.I've heard people complain it doesn't sit well in the station because they are right handed...well I am too, and I manage well enough to pick it up with my left hand too.my only complaint which can't really be helped is that in a month or so I will have to buy a new cleaning solution cartridge but it's still cheaper than razors, and cream and other things you use with a blade, and it can't really be avoided for the great feature it is. (the cleaning solution I mean)
