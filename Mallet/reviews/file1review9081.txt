review/text: i have been drinking it for 2 years- at first the taste is funky but mix it with cranberry or orange juice and it is ok- after awhile you wont even flinch at the taste and can even mix with water in a pinch. after all this time i can tell u that my gastrointestinal tract feels so much better (but be warned- when u first start dont leave the bathroom area for about an hour; i would walk our dogs in the morning after drinking it in the beginning and find myself running home); at some point during the first few months u find yourself craving it as a beginning to your day- i work in healthcare and am exposed to lots of infections and can tell u that this is an excellent product- i have been the butt of many jokes by friends and family, and yet i still continue my daily regiment of drinking it- 5 stars
