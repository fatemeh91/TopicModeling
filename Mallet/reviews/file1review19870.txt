review/text: I have tried several potty seats in the last 3 months in an attempt to find one that actually fits my oval toilet seat but have been unsuccessful until now. Not only does it fit perfectly, it's also adjustable for a regular round seat as well. It's VERY easy to adjust just by turning the dial underneath the seat itself and once placed on the toilet it stays put. When you're ready to remove it, just grab the front and pull straight up. It says it will fit a child up to 5 yrs. old, but I have a 2-1/2 yr. old who is average in weight but very tall in height and I can't imagine she'll be able to use it past 3 or 4 yrs. old.
