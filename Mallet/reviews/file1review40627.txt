review/text: Unless you have extra time to inspect and re-clean all your dishes, don't buy this product. We gave it a try for three loads and each time found numerous dishes with food particles remaining, mugs left with tea stains, and even a white film left across plates. We tried increasing the amount and running the loads again, but the stains still persisted. We ended up needing to hand wash about 1/3 of our dishes. Considering all our extra water usage and extra time to get the dishes clean with Wave, we are immediately going back to conventional dishwashing gel, which always gets our dishes clean without pre-washing. We'll recycle the Wave plastic bottle, but sadly the contents are going down the drain. It's a shame that it's useless and actually created extra waste to buy it.
