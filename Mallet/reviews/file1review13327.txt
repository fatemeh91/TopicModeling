review/text: Our daughter is 27 months old and we have decided to start her night time training over the hot summer months. This has been great when she has accidents at night. She's completely diaper free and has very few accidents at night. We had ordered 2, so when she has accidents, then we just switch it out quickly and we all go back to bed quickly. Thanks!
