review/text: These cases are great. I fill them once a week for pills that I take two times during the day. They are easily opened with a twist. There is no problem with them lying flat. When you open them you bent the hinge all the way as far as it will go without forcing it. The case will then lie open flat. When pouring out one compartment I just hold my thumb over the other one.
