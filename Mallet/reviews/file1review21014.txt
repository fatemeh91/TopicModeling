review/text: I purchased this mat for a birthday gift for my husband. We took it out turned it on and laid on it. Yeah, it heats up and vibrates. Yet massage is not what you get. It's gives the same feeling you have when you get finished mowing the lawn on the riding lawn mower. Your sort of numb, but you don't feel anymore relaxed or massaged.
