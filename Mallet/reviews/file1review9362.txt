review/text: I found this product very convenient as I take quite a few vitamins and medications. It has a divider between the AM and PM sections. The only downside to the product is that it can be tough sometimes to open at first as there is not a point of leverage to grab on to. This might be tough for those with bad arthritis. (I'm only 26 so it doesn't bother me much.)
