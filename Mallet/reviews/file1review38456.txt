review/text: I had the original Emjoi for many years and loved it. This model is great too, and the extra blade for long hairs is a plus that the other did not have. But having large hands, this sometimes is tricky to hold, and because the cord comes out from the side, instead of the bottom like the original, it gets awkward at times handling. But I still think Emjoi makes an excellent product.I think when this goes bad after many years of use, I'll think which I will purchase next, this one or the one closes to the original. If I find I am using the long hair blade, then I would replace with the same, and if not using the long hair blade, I would replace with one similar to the original.So over all, I am pleased with the product.
