review/text: I found out why you can't find this liquid detergent anywhere. I looked on Colgate-Palmolive's website and here's what they said: "We are sorry to inform you that the product you are interested in is not currently being manufactured. In response to decreased consumer demand, we sometimes have to stop making a product." Since they don't make it anymore, maybe you might want to give this a try:Octagon All Purpose Laundry Bar Soap by Colgate - 7 Oz. I think this is the bar version of the Octagon Crystal White liquid soap. It's supposed to work really good.
