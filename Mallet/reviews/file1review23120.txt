review/text: Sweeper was easy to put together, no problem with handle falling apart. Light weight easy to push. It only picks up about half the stuff from my carpets. Brush is not very stiff. Will not pick up cat hair. I bought it just for this purpose, for quick cleaning between using the heavy vacuum cleaner. Maybe a higher price one would be better. Will not buy another one unless I can feel the weight for the brushes.
