review/text: I bought this item because I try to get liquids of 1 oz or less for travel . One problem is that the item received does not look the same as in the pictureIt is not round as shown in the picture but has a large capThat being said , the cap prevents the spray to be engaged accidentally and some other lens cleaners sold on amazon do not have ANY cap to prevental accidental release of the spray
