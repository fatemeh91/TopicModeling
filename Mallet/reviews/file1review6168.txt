review/text: In the afternoons at work, I'd get tired and not able to focus well. I really needed a nap to reset, but they tend to frown upon that at work, so... I looked around for a product that included Ginkgo, Choline, & DMAE, to which this product has all and more. The first week, I could tell I was more alert in the afternoons, and was able to focus better. I haven't used it for more than a couple of weeks (hence only 4 stars), and not consistently, but I do notice a difference is clarity level when I use it. No ill side-affects, bad taste, etc. I can't find anything wrong with this product.
