review/text: I'm very aware of my health. I have Rheumatoid arthritis, blood pressure and cholesterol problems. I hate taking medicines and so I try very hard to eat healthy, exercise and do what my Doctor says. After reading a wide variety of web reviews I bought the 15 package box of Green Vibrance By Vibrant Health. The taste is well - awful! But than I guess what do you expect with something that's all natural and healthy. I followed my 15 pack box with the big 60 day supple, again all from here on Amazon. I figured I'd give it a chance and for those who hate the taste I'd say "cowboy up" and be an adult about it. For me the solution is to mix with Low Sodium V8 and add a few shots of Tabasco! It goes down pretty good than if you take a deep breath just chug it.I went to doctor for all my blood work on Monday of this week, I'd been taking it daily now for over a month. The numbers that came back were stunning! Everything is within the normal range! My doctor told me that what ever I'm doing, just keep doing it! I have more energy and I feel totally great! Yeah, tastes bad - learn to love it! Health is more important than taste in my life. I'm 64 years old and feel like I'm 20. This has my highest recommendation! I know we're all different and results for each of us will be different but I've found my elixir of youth! Even my wife has mentioned to me how much energy and spirt I have. I plan on buying this for the rest of my life which should be about 46 more years:)
