review/text: Bought 4 cross sterling silver pens as gifts. $75 or so each. Did not think I had to inspect them, beyond looking quickly in the box. Gave them as gifts, and all of them exhibited tarnish at top and or bottom. To late to return. First really bad experience with amazon. Should have bought crome for $20 each.
