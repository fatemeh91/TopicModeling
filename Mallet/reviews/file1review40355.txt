review/text: If you are reading this review then you most likely are already a believer or want to be a believer in herbal medicine. That coupled with the fact that we will never really know what would have happened if we hadn't have taken this medicine (so we cannot actually prove it works) makes this a tough review. I'll try to be as helpful as I can.First, this collection of herbs is for fighting a cold or similar illness right at the onset of the symptoms. Once you've got the cold, this may not actually do anything for you according to the manufacturer. If you do start taking these pills, be advised that this package (the 20 count) is only enough pills for a single instance. You will take 10 capsules a day for two days in an effort to put a quick end to your impending illness.I started to feel the symptoms of a cold (sore throat) so went out and bought a box even before my Vine package arrived. Here is what I found: I did not get sicker. The sore throat didn't progress and it went away after the first day.I'd love to say that it was because of these herbs, but the fact is that while I believe that enough to buy these I cannot guarantee that the "cold" wasn't actually just a slightly sore throat that my body would have handled on its own after a day. That's the problem with all these kinds of remedies: there is no way to prove what we avoided.That said, I'd buy this product again because for me the price is worth the probability of avoiding the illness.
