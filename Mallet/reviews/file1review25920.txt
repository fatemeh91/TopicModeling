review/text: I bought the product for my new Camera - Canon Powershot SX20 IS. It was advertised along side with the Camera in Amazon website. So I thought they are the right AA battery for my camera, which uses AA. When I used them in my camera the other day, the camera did not turn on. Then to my surprise, I found the rechargeable AA batteries that came with this product have 1.2V votage instead of a standard AA battery, which has 1.5V. I felt cheated, and do not know how to return the product to the vendor for a refund. Any one has any advice?
