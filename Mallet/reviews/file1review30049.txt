review/text: This is a wonderful tea. I have been drinking it as iced tea, unsweetened for five years. It keeps me hydrated, have a healthy tongue and helped me to detox from aspertame when I switched from diet soda. I keep a balanced wieght using it. My neighbor just started using it and has lost 4 lbs in two weeks after trying every diet she could find. It has also resolved a thrush issue she has been expierencing from one of her medications side effects. I would recommend and do recommend it to everyone I know.
