review/text: I bought this originally at the health food store for my smoothies. I can't taste it when it's mixed with the berries etc so that's a good thing. I've had some green powders that had a strong taste so if I can get the nutrients without an overwhelming (bad) flavor, I'm thrilled. This does the trick.
