review/text: the package has a good variety. The majority are quality durex and trojan of all sorts in my selection, although trojan are a bit tight.I have to say Kimono sucks. I got two of them, but won't use the second one after the first time experience. It is very dry, thin and tight. given the price, still a good deal.
