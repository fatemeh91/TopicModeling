review/text: At first, I was always able to clean my eye glasses with this cloth without any smudges being left behind by rubbing the glasses only a couple times. However, after washing it 6-7 times in the washing machine, I've noticed that it takes a lot more wipes with the cloth to get the smudges off. Despite that, this is probably the best cleaning cloth for glasses that I've come across, so I'd still recommend it.
