review/text: I ordered this same razor from another site and after reading several reviews i was a tad worried.....however once i received the razor all my fears disappeared.......granted this is not a top of the line razor....however it was only $12......the blade was very sharp upon arrival and with a quick stropping it is very shave ready......i am able to shave the soft hair on my arm very easily and thicker facial hair is no problem at all...the handle is a tad flimsy but it shaves well and isnt really noticeable...over all its a fair razor and a good start for a first time straight blade shaver.
