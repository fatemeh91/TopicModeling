review/text: It has been 2 months since a dislocated my right knee and it hasn't been the same ever since. No matter what prescriptions or therapy I was prescribed with doctors I didn't see much improvement. Five days ago I went grocery shopping and noticed Osteo Bi-Flex triple strength and everything it claimed sounded great, after 5 days I noticed decreased pain and strength in my knee that was't there at all before taking the supplements. I can only imagine how better off my knee will be when I'm done with the bottle.Unfortunately I discovered that this product contains Titanium dioxide, a compound well known to cause cancer. I won't be buying another bottle until they correct this flaw and will be looking for other alternative products that do not contain harmful chemicals as well as are more natural.
