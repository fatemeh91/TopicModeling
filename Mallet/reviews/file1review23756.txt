review/text: this always helped my achy arches. In the end after a year of having arch problems and using these to give me relief, I finally tried a barefoot shoe (Merrell Vibram) and my feet can go days without ever feeling any pain. Now the only pain i get is when I wear clunky cheap shoes.I figure, this insert is like a medication to a problem that fixes the symptoms but not the underlying problem. The barefoot style shoes for me were like the cure that tackled the whole problem and not just the symptoms.So short term, these are awesome! Long term, I would totally look into barefoot shoes!
