review/text: This sweeper helps our family tons by picking up crumbs from the floor around the dining area and all the nuts and seeds our parrots throw on the floor! It works on bare floors, but not as well as on carpets. These used to be called "carpet sweepers", until bare floors became all the rage! I don't have many bare floors so it is not a problem for us. I love being able to pick up debris without lugging out the huge heavy Dyson vacuum we have. Then when I do vacuum, there is a lot less work to do.Another reviewer mentioned a problme with the handle falling apart. I followed the directions to put the handle together (by banging it on the floor after putting the parts together) and it is fine. It has never fallen apart.Someone else mentioned that it isn't a very strong vacuum, maybe because it's NOT a vacuum! It is manual. These have been around since the turn of the 20th century and they work great without electricity, thank you very much.I like it a lot, I expect it to do what it is designed to do, and it does.
