review/text: I was very pleased to find these batteries at a great price. I use them to power my Pelican 2360 for duty use and seem to last a bit longer that duracell or engergizers. Rayovac Ultra line is the only brand a major oil refinery selected as its vendor. The contractor pack helps keep them in secure and in order.
