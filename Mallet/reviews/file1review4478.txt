review/text: I use the Mach III Turbo and am very happy with the three blade system for my face. I tried this one ONCE on my face and cut myself in two places. It is just too big. HOWEVER, I am an avid cyclist and body builder and shave my legs and chest. THESE WORK GREAT for large areas like legs or chest if you are "into" that aspect of the sports. I have to shave at least once every two days or I get complaints from my wife when I cuddle up to her at night. I like the definition of my legs much better shaved as well as my abs and chest. Fortunately I don't have to shave my back as I have next to no hair on it.
