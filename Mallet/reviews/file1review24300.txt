review/text: I did the 3 day walk for 60 miles. I saw infomercial 5 days before the walk and bought them. During the walk, my arch was hurting. I put these in and it saved my foot! I couldn't keep them in for more than a few miles cause they hurt because I would think they just need to be slowly worked in to get used to. But I was worried I would have a hurt foot, and with these, my arch doesn't hurt and I made it through. So glad I found these!
