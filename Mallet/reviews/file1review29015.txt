review/text: Bought this as my first electric shaver.After spending a frustrating 20 minutes trying to shave 3-day old stubble, only to find it had only shaved a few patches, returned to the instruction manual, assuming I must be doing something wrong. Re-read, attempted again, same problem. Read these reviews and realised that this shaver is, essentially, a waste of money. For an item that touts itself on its flexibility, this is nothing short of a rip-off.
