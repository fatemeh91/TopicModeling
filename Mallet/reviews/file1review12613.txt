review/text: I first heard of this product listening to KPFK during one of their fund drives. I have had a gut for years in spite of lifting weights, doing crunches, practicing yoga, riding my bike up and down the hills in Tujunga, and of course following all kinds ofdiets. I assumed that at 61, my metabolism was the problem. I completed one week of this product three weeks ago. There is no better feeling in the world than putting on a pair of pants that are loose. In fact, all of my shirts are loose. I can now wear the clothesfrom the back of the closet that I almost forgot about. When my wife told me that she noticed I had lost weight, I knew the reason.The product worked for me. Warning, do not travel far from a toilet. By the way, I'm now very regular. As for those people who sayit doesn't work, see a doctor. There has to be something wrong with you. One more thing, I am no longer dieting, and for some reason,I don't have the cravings I had before. And I can now do yoga with a little less in the way.
