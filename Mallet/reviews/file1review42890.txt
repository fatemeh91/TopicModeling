review/text: Ever since we remodeled our bathroom last year, I had been wanting a support bar for the fiberglass bathtub/shower. I couldn't use a traditional one as the remodeler advised against drilling holes in the fiberglass. I was a little leary at first about this product as I've had other suctioncup mounted accessories that didn't stick. Another thing I like about it is that I can reposition it depending upon whether you are going to use the tub or shower. The handle is ridged so that you can grip it securely. If I ever move, it's coming with me!
