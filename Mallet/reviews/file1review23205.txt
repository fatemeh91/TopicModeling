review/text: Years ago I inherited a Bissell Sweeper from my mom. Years passed, we moved, I don't know what happened to it. I found the identical sweeper on Amazon for about the same price that it cost 30 years ago! I immediately ordered it and am very happy I did. Now, when I don't feel like hauling out the heavy carpet vacuum cleaner, I can do a quick pick up on my carpets (have two indoor cats) with my Bissell. It does a very good job for in-between cleanings, is lightweight, and easy to empty. Thanks Amazon.
