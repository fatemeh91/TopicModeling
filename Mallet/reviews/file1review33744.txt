review/text: An old herbalist and naturalist doctor in the mountains of Pennsylvania started me on the wheat germ oil when he told me that he could see the side effects of rheumatic fever, that I'd had as a child, in my heart beat. I never knew that I'd even had rheumatic fever but my mother confirmed it. I started taking the Viobin and it helped, immensely, with my energy level and now I can feel the effects, of not taking it, a few days after I run out of it.I wouldn't advise starting any supplements without consulting a physician but if wheat germ oil is indicated then this is a great, reliable source.
