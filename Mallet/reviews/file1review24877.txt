review/text: I started taking FertilAid and FertilAidCM in November. I have noticed an increse in my CM and I am getting EWCM. I also got a period after taking them. I was on day 66 of my cycle when I started taking them, so I was very happy to get AF. I am still waiting on my BFP. My husband and I have been TTC on and off since July 2006. I have PCOS and we are having a very hard time. I am going to try taking Soy Isoflavones when I get my next cycle to see if that will help kick ovulation into gear. Lots of prayers. Good luck to everone out there taking FA or any other TTC suppliment. Also congratulations to all who got a BFP from their suppliments. BABY DUST AND PRAYERS TO ALL! :)
