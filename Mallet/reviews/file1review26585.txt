review/text: Having had extensive spinal fusion surgery last fall, I was sent this by a friend who ironically had the same surgery a month before mine occurred. She swore this really helped and I have to agree from my point of view. It makes you "sit right" which is half the battle with back issues (having had chronic problems for many years). After approx eleven months of daily use it has finally developed a leak, so I am ordering a new one! Of note, one month after my back surgery, I took a long plane flight (overnight) and I would not have done well without this cushion, it will be coming with me on any future flights!
