review/text: I never thought I had a need for a hair trimmer of any sort.. I've never seen hair in my ears and I have a full mustache that blends in right up to my nostrils.. However, after shaving my mustache off, I noticed my nose hair was a little longer than I'd expect..I read the review for this product on Amazon and wondered how so many customers could speak so highly of a nose hair trimmer.. That was until I received mine today and put a single AA battery into it, turned it on and began to use it in less than two minutes from its arrival..This has to be the most effective means of getting rid of your unwanted nose/ear hair that's actually fun, safe and semi-enjoyable (for the tickling effect)..If you're hairs are going astray and if you're having a bit more of a difficult time breathing than normal, try this product out.. You will NOT be dissatisfied..
