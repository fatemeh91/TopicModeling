review/text: There are a lot of lubes on the market, but there are drawbacks to most. Water-based lubes can be used with anything, but they dry up too fast. Silicone lube is great and stays slick forever, but can dissolve silicone toys, can be messy, and tends to be too thin and runny. Liquid Silk combines the best of both worlds to give a lube that won't get dry or tacky and is thicker and stays in place better.
