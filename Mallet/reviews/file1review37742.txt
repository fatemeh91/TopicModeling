review/text: I was diagnosed many years ago with acid reflux. I had all the classic and unpleasant symptoms, as well as two procedures to check my esophagus for damage. I read an article at Whole Foods one day that spoke to how orange peal was a natural remedy so I decided to try it and purchased these orange peel gel caps. It was like a miracle. You have to do the entire regime....10 caps over 20 days. Even my doctor could not believe it. I would say that I cured myself, but maybe one time a year I take a few caps when I even begin to feel the reflux return. Try it!
