review/text: I wanted an all-natural allergy medicine and found this. It is very reasonably priced if you can get it for close to $20. It is upwards of $24-$27 on other sites. At first, I wasn't sure what a difference it made... until I didn't take it. Then, I was amazed. It really helps with upper resporatory health and is good for you anyways since it's mostly turmeric and nettle leaf. Follow the directions and make sure to take it inbetween meals so it "packs the most punch." I take 2 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon. If I'm having an especially rough time, I take it before bed too. This is now a must-have for getting me through the spring and the fall! Love it and highly recommend giving it a try. Get rid of your chemical allergy meds (and their side affects) and go back to nature! :)
