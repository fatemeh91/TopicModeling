review/text: I got this for my dad with the "chic oil burner," and its perfect for a guy. My dad, unlike me is a very macho and masculine mans' man. This is a very good scent for a man because most men don't want to sell like they are trampling through a lilly field. This has a pleasent scent but isnt offensive to most people. My father uses it to eliminate the smell of smoke in his room, and just to add some freshness to the air. I think for a guy this is the pefect kind of room fragrance you could ever find. On a personal note, I think it smells like old people....but he, and his friends love it. But I will still take me lillac vanilla candles any day of the week. But this is a great gift idea, or a way to help those sticky straight guys out there wothout them getting threatened!!!
