review/text: i use these for cleaning the rubber tips on my in-ear headphones, and they're perfect -- in fact, they're even a little too big for that particular job, so they clearly could be used for a larger job, as well. (they seem to be on the cheaper side than some of the similar products, too, so you can't really go wrong.)
