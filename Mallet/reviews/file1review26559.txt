review/text: I bought this cushion for my husband when he's going on a long flight (about 16 hours plus) and he has some serious backpain. It is not comfortable at all being in a long flight where you have to stay too long in a cramp seat even if you don't have any back problem, so you can imagine how it would be when you have a backpain. He told me that the cushion helped supporting his back while he's on the plane for 16 hours. When I tried it myself at home sitting in front of a computer, it felt good. I think it feels better than the inflatable pillow we used to buy at REI (now they don't have it anymore) which cost only $3. It's much more expensive than that old inflatable pillow, but it is more durable and has better shape for your back. Plus it is still easy and light to carry while you're traveling. So I think overall it's a pretty good purchase.
