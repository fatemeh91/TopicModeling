review/text: Seen the commercial and thought, wow. That stuff looks amazing. Up until I had bought myself some. Tried it on my boat. Fiberglass and vinyl seats. There were some rust spots. Did absolutely nothing. Did not work. Started walking around my house to see what it will work on. Tried my vinyl front door. Results were so so. Tried it on my exterior window sills. Again so so. Maybe I was expecting a miracle. Some soap and water with a little elbow grease would have accomplished the same. Don't let the commercial fool you.
