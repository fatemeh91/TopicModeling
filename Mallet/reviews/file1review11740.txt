review/text: My daughter is a typical toddler, one day she eats great the next three I can't pry her mouth open for anything. (Not even pizza) I go out of my mind on those days. I have spoke to her doctor about it and she tells me the same thing each time - as long as she's drinking and her weight isn't going down she's not worried. Well, I'm her mother and I am. So on the days when she won't eat I pull out a PediaSure. (Approved by her doctor and many pediatrician's recommend it to be used)*Recommended for children 1 - 13 years old. Complete Liquid NutritionThe Strawberry flavor is my daughter's favorite.It actually tastes pretty good. It is light and thin. So it can be put in a sippy cup with no drinking problems or have them use a straw.(like the commercial) It also comes in Chocolate, Vanilla and Banana cream. But, we stick with the Strawberry. She didn't seem as crazy for the Chocolate or the Vanilla and at just about $1.50 per 8 oz can,(more if you buy them as singles) I wasn't about to experiment with the Banana Cream since we had found the Strawberry and she loved it.Instructions for use: Shake the can very well before serving.(Tastes better served chilled) Do Not add water. Once opened,cover, refrigerate and use within 48 hours.
