review/text: Love this for cleaning hard-wood floors. Stirs up much less dust than broom sweeping. Lots cheaper than mops (Swiffer) with the disposable cover that you have to replace each time.Does a great job of gathering the dust bunnies and pet hair. Works well on steps. Shake outside after each use. Our previous refill lasted more than 10 years.Keeps our floors shiny without scratching.
