review/text: I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it. So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled. This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations. Not good as a toothbrush, but good back scratch! I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good, and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier.
