review/text: This contains the natural form of vitamin E Tocopherols (d-alpha, d-beta, d-gamma, d-delta). Do not buy cheaper products that use the dl-alpha, etc tocopherols as they are synthetic forms of Vitamin E and can cause more harm than good. not all vitamin E's are the same.the only thing that could make this better is if it also contained the same mix (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) of the Tocotrienol family of vitamin E (yes, there are 8 members of the vitamin E family). I have yet to find a cost-effective version of vit E that contains all 8.
