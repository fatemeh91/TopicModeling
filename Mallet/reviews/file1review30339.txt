review/text: When my handheld vacuum crapped out and I needed a new one, I found this one. When it said it could pick up pet hair, I thought "yeah, right." We have 2 dogs and 3 cats and my handheld and upright vacuum struggled to get the hair. This one does it with ease! I was floored with how easy it got the hair up!!! I use the vacuum with the rotating brush piece on the "extender" hose. I have to use 2 hands: one on the handle of the dustbuster and one keeping the hose on the dustbuster. A minor inconvenience to be rid of dog hair. Hooray!!!!
