review/text: ON whey protein is a great way to add protein to breakfast, supplement nutrients in your coffee, your favorite smoothie, and of course your pre-workout and post-workout.From what I've read and in my opinion, it's crucial to get at least 30g of protein within 30-45 minutes of waking up. For me, that's where ON comes in. For those on the go, ON whey is perfect to get the protein you need quickly. Also, vanilla ice cream flavor, mixes easily into any smoothie, shake or blended coffee. With 24 grams of protein and only 120 calories, why would you choose any other protein?UPDATE -- I've had Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Coconut and White chocolate flavors and would say the flavor breakdown looks a little something like:Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Vanilla Ice Cream, 5 Pound: Flavor 7.5/10; Ability to mix with different ingredients 9/10Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, Chocolate Coconut, 5 Pound: Flavor 8/10; Ability to mix with different ingredients 6/10.Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard, White Chocolate, 5 Pound: Flavor 9/10; Ability to mix with different ingredients 8/10
