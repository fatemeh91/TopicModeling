review/text: My relative has an elongated, higher than average toilet. The description states it fits an elongated toilet. What I found that means, is that it will fit on a elongated toilet, but what it doesn't state is that it is shorter than the elongated toilet.Seat does not cover the entire elongated toilet bowl. It fits a round bowl/short bowl, but does not (to repeat) cover the entire elongated toilet bowl.However, it does fit the bowl okay. You can still use it on an elongated toilet, it just won't cover entire bowl. Which is better than being too large for bowl. It is easy to put together. Easy to put on and take off toilet at any time, so someone not needing the seat, can easily remove and then replace. You just slide the back piece under the toilet seat. Toilet seat always remains up when riser seat is in place. NO tools needed to put this together!As for using on a higher than normal toilet bowl, it still works fine. Looking at the toilet, the legs of the riser seat do not reach the floor. However, when leaning on the handles to rise from the toilet seat, it pushes the feet to the floor, so we have found that there really is no need to remove one of the blue foam portions, unless you wish the seat to always be planted firmly on ground.If the legs do not entirely reach the floor, press down on the seat bars and if the legs then reach the floor, it is plenty sturdy. Have someone who is not in need of the seat try it out and see, before having the one in need use it. There is your test.Our one complaint is this: There is a small indent in front of seat, but for some people, it would be more helpful to have a total front cutout. This would help avoid accidents.
