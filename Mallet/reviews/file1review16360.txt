review/text: I find this to be one of the best shaving creams available. The Lemon + Lime version smells a bit old-fashioned. I suppose if you like that sort of scent, you'll love this one. This is not my favorite (my all-time favorite is Avocado). It's best when used with a good brush (preferably made of badger hair). It provides excellent protection from your razor. I find that a tub of this stuff lasts approximately 4-6 months, depending on how often you shave and how large a dab you use; you'll be surprised how just a little dab develops into plenty of lather. Highly recommended, but be aware this may not be the best scent.
