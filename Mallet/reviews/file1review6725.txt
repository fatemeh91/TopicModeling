review/text: I have perpetual tension and terrible knots in my upper back area, shoulders, and neck.A few minutes a day using the back buddy brings a great deal of relief. I feel like the circulation is even improved to my head... I feel more alert after using it!I used to have a body-builder friend who would give me massages, and I'd tire out his hands and arms!!This works better than I could have imagined. If you can't afford good deep tissue massages and you have these types of tension issues, I highly recommend the back buddy.
