review/text: I've had these clippers for about two months now and very happy with the hair cuts I get with them. I never had any problems with my clipper, unlike the other comments people have left. If you like a fade, bald or even a military high and tight hair cut, these clippers will perform. It shaves very close and very well made. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is, it could use some type of carrying case to put everything inside but other than that it's a great buy.
