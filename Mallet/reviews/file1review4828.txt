review/text: The very first rule of surfing the internet is "never believe anything you see on the internet." having said this,even though the reviews of this product seem too good to be true with the exception of three (two which criticized the product and one which was indifferent, i still went on purchasing the product. common, lets be logical, it will be awkward for me to buy something that has low rating, however i'll update you guys if this is a hoax..
