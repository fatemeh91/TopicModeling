review/text: For $24 this carpet sweeper is a steal in my opinion. Come on! People spend that much on dinner at a restaurant! I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but I am already convinced that it is fantastic.You DO have to spend some time cleaning it out pretty often. I was shocked to see that it had picked up a LOT of my own hair, which is rather long and twisted round and round the brush. What amazes me even more is that just before I discovered that it was literally packed with my hairs, it was STILL cleaning and picking up stuff just a few minutes before. How does it do that?! Amazing.If you have longer hair like me (mine is probably 12-16" long) it is a bit of a hassle removing the hairs from the roller. Best to remove the roller entirely from the bottom of the pan and use scissors to cut a lot of the hairs.I am very glad that I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this carpet cleaner; thus, I knew the importance of using a hammer to connect the pieces of the handle before screwing onto the bottom portion so that the handle would not fall apart.If you don't mind cleaning the brush of the sweeper -- and frequently -- I think you will probably like this sweeper as much as I do. I did not want a vacuum cleaner because I have no place to put a vacuum cleaner without it being visible at all times. This little sweeper can handily fit in a pantry or under the bed and is perfect for my needs. I don't bother sweeping the kitchen floor with it (for that I use a small broom). I think it works best on low-pile carpet only.
