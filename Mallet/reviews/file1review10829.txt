review/text: So far, this scale is fairly good. It gave weights that are pretty close to what other electronic scales gave (and the .5lb increment on this scale is precise enough, for those of you wanting a .2lb increment). My Body Fat measurements were fairly consistent, with it not varying by more than 1% from day to day.BUT!!! The main suspicion I have with this scale is that it seems to have a "lazy" weight measurement change. What do I mean by that? Let's say, for example, you weight yourself and the scale says 154lbs. If you step off, take off a jacket u know weights about 1.5lbs, and step on the scale again, the scale will show that you still weight 154lbs. BUT! And here is when it gets interesting, I suspected that the scale might have a 'short-term' memory built into its eletronics and will simply go back to the most recently measured weight if the difference in weight is small enough. SO, I weighted myself, at say, 154, then made the scale go to some other weight, say 130, and then take off my jacket and weight myself again, and guess what? I now get 152.5lbs.So, in summary, a pretty precise and good scale, but for some reason, its designers decided to build in a 'cheat' like that just to give the illusion that it is even more precise.
