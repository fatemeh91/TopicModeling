review/text: I have never purchased an electric toothbrush before but did so on the advice of my dentist. I have sensitive teeth and receding gums so I was somewhat concerned that this type of toothbrush might aggravate the problem but the opposite has been true. It is like having your teeth professional cleaned daily. This is one purchase I will replace immediately if necessary.
