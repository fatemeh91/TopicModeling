review/text: It did work, but once you read the ingredients you will realize that you can get the same results and health benefits from the other prducts sold by health force.You are intended to use this and a single cleasing regiment with nothing left over after completion. So you are paying to consume the 150 caps in the 13 days I believe it is. It does work but I have done my own regiment with the health force earth, fruits and others and have lots left over. You are paying for this stuf to be in capsule form. waste of money there. this is not engineered medication, the quantities need not be that exact, taking a table spoon or teaspoon at a time will not make significant difference.Pros1. Did work great2. Health Foce makes quality productsCons1. Way too expensive for a single regiment2. Benefits can be obtained from their other product lines and need not be in capsule formRecommendation.Use the powders in large quantities instead of this, you will get the same cleansing if you read the ingredients in them and compare to the ingredients in this and not be paying half what you pay for this.
