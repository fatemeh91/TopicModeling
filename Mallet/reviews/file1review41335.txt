review/text: This particular type of condom has an ingredient called benzocane which REALLY numbs your genitals. I found it REALLY difficult to climax after any amount of time. With the extra long time it took, my partner became dry and it was uncomfortable. In fact, if you're not EXTREMELY excited, it's very easy to become limp just by putting the stupid thing on. Go with this condom if you're the type who gets off in under a minute.
