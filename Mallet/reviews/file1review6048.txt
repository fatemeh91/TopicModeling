review/text: I'm a homecare nurse and this is one of the best wrist cuffs I've used. It works well for most all of my patients, even the squirmy ones. Plus, it's a great price. I've paid more and gotten less. The pulse tends to measure high, at least on mine, but I like to take that manually anyway.
