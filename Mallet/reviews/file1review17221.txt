review/text: Long story short, the rechargeable battery on this trimmer is very poor. You have to charge it hours before you shave for it to work for more than 2 minutes. Forget about using this wirelessly at all. If you're fine with having this plugged in 24/7, then by all means, buy it.I have never really given anything a bad review on Amazon, as things can be easily researched in terms of quality. However, I made the mistake of buying this trimmer based on the other reviews here on Amazon. What a lot of them fail to mention is that this trimmer has to be plugged in at ALL times in order for it to be able to work for more than one minute. I often wanted to hide the cords for this trimmer, as it makes the sink look messy; I just wanted to get them out of the way. So I would unplug the trimmer from the outlet and leave it until the next time I had to shave.Problem was, the next time I would go to shave (say, a week later), the battery would be completely depleted. I would plug it in assuming it would work while plugged in. Nope. It works for about 30 seconds, then dies out and stops working.The solution to this was keeping it plugged in at least 2 hours before I needed to shave. I wasn't willing to do that. I shouldn't have to plan out my shaving habits and remember to plug this thing in 2 hours before every shave.
