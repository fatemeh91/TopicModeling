review/text: I suffer from year round allergies and nothing helps. Absolutely no antihistamine or nasal spray helps for long. I can NEVER breathe out of my nose. I loathe getting a cold, as breathing is near impossible. These strips used in combination with a netti pot and I can actually breathe at night. I also wear them when I exercise, again to help me breathe better.I also prefer Breathe Right to generic product, as they stick much better and stay in place better.If you can breathe just fine through your nose without these, then no, these aren't going to be of much help to you. But if you're like me and you have trouble breathing b/c of chronic allergies then I'd highly recconmend these! Also highly reccomend using a netti pot in combination with it! The netti pot (saline solution) helps reduce the swelling in my nostrils along with just general cleaning them out.
