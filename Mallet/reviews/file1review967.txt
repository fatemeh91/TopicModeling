review/text: Now that I'm 88 and have been taking VIAGRA, testosterone, and ground tiger penis for years to enhance my jaded failed sense of my libido (with which myself is intimately bound up...having no definition or self understanding beyond my sexual prowess) I finally came to need this product, as the river of piss which my John-Thomas spews forth, like a giant fire hose, was far too much for an adult diaper to contain.Hence: the penis clamp. A small device which seals off that which God gave me and fulfills as prophecy most profound that most memorable line from "The Graduate": ....plastics."Yes, in my entire life of striking against nature to satisfy my disengagement into a skewed worldview of the mind-body problem I took every erectile panacea under the sun. Like an aged Mao coupling with peasant girl after peasant girl well into my 80s I fled from reason and nature and took Rhino horn, ground Tiger nuts, Monkey spleen, VIAGRA, cunnilingus lessons (expensive!) and snake whisky to emerge as only this jaded shell that has no hermeneutic structure to interpret value in life beyond that of an adolescent 13 year-old boy: that "sex" is everything. And by "sex" we mean self-centered masturbation where women are objects and our own solipsistic fulfillment is the sole arbiter of our transvaluation of all values.Really cuts of your urine flow hard. If I never wanted to pee my pants again, this would be the product I'd use....but now that I'm old and disgusting according to zeitgeist...a good pee is about as thrilling as my sex life gets.
