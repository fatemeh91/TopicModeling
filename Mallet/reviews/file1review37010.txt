review/text: These condoms lived up to their promise of being roomier and thinner. After using Trojan Larges, Trustex XL, Magnums and several other brands over the years, these have my vote for all around best large condom for comfort and roominess. They don't squeeze around the base like the Magnums, and they have a silky soft, thin construction that is pleasuable for both partners. They even have a subtle hint of bergamot that covers the unattractive latex smell most condoms have. Highly recommended for guys who are tired of getting that uncomfortable squeeze from other condoms. To get the larger sized condom, make sure you order the Maximum Love instead of the regular Durex Love product.
