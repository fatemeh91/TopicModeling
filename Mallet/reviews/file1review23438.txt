review/text: I am a nurse in a cardiology office. I must admit that I was first interested in the Clear sound Prestige because of the heart shaped head. As I am getting older :) I have noticed I have been having increased difficulty hearing vitals. The blood pressure sounds very clear and audible on all sites even radial pulses. I can also hear through the sweaters/shirts with ease just like they advertise. Some of our patients with heart disease or valve issues have difficult to obtain heart sounds- no problem with this stethoscope. I particularly like the fact that when I am holding the head to obtain vitals- no noise from my hand touching or rubbing disturbs my hearing. Our patients understandably have some anxiety about having to see us.The comments I get from my patients are amusing, but just talking about it also puts them at ease. It doesn't appear as "imposingly medical" to them.I have seen since I have been using it- that they are more relaxed. It is also very very light around my neck. I liked using my cardiac Littman- but it was heavy and expensive.The prestige ear pieces are exceedingly comfortable to my ears, something I have always had issues with in the past. I can honestly say this is such a super deal and I will replace it with another in a second if I needed to. Everyone of my fellow nurses now have ordered this stethoscope.
