review/text: These are, hands-down, undeniably, without a doubt, counterfeit blades.The construction on each blade is cheap, so much that the individual detailing blade does not exist. It is simply a hard edge of the blade housing.Upon using a fresh, clean, new cartridge, it feels like running a rusty can across your skin: scratchy, irritating, cheap.THESE ARE NOT GILETTE.I am seeking what further steps I can take to hold Amazon, LLC accountable for selling me a fake item that poses a risk to my health.
