review/text: Me and the ladyfriend always seem to prefer silicone to water based even if its known to mess up the sheets. Such a better price here than local stores. Easy to use cap container and arrives in discrete packaging also wouldn't look crazy on a dresser. This and gun oil are the two faves we have found. Lasts longs almost has a feel of a warming gell without the smell of petroleum. ok if you taste a little never easy to clean though.
