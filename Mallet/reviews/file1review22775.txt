review/text: Ive been using this product on and off(one month with, another month or so without) and taking it as recommended on the label, twice a day 4-6 hrs in between. I must say i absolutely love it!! This product works for me and it pushes me every workout and training session. I know there are some that shy away from supplements such as this because of concern, as it is not recommended for those who have heart complications, but if you are generally healthy, and accompany this supplement with intense weight training/cardio and a good diet, you will most definitely see results as i have. My body fat % has dropped enough so that definition has started becoming noticable, and hopefully with one more cycle and consistent training, i WILL GET MY SIX PACK TO SHOW! ;) i do recommend this product to athletes, and bodybuilders looking to further define their shape, and to those seeking a lower body fat %. Good luck to all who read this :)
