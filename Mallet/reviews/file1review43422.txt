review/text: I have back pains, lower abdomen pressure (since I'm carrying my baby low) and the vulvar pressure; mainly after being on my feet for awhile. So far this contraption isn't what I'd hoped. Perhaps its too big and not holding me well enough yet. I did purchase it with room to grow in mind, but its not loose; yet I feel more comfort from the V2 pull up and a belly belt. The cradle plus is NOT something to wear if you are wearing anything other than a scoop necked shirt and its a hassle to get in and out of for the frequent restroom visits, (especially while out and about, which is when I need it most). I am 6mos and have gained 33lbs already, so though I am trying to slow it down big time, I have hope that one day this will be the support it appeared to be when I purchased it. Definitely not there yet. Not adjustable (except the straps around the behind, and I don't need to switch that, but it'd be nice to get a better lift in the front based on comfort and support need.
