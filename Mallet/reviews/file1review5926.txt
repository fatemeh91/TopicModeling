review/text: I bought this from reading the reviews, but when I got it, I rinsed it out and left some water in it and tried it out and it immedicately leaked all over the place. I tried a few more times to be sure the lid was tight and same thing. It held the water, but when you shook it is leaked. My advise on this one, is to get the real deal, Tupperware. They have a 16oz instead of 12oz with a real seal proof snap on lid and the mixer that will help mix the powder. I am now looking into getting one of those. Thought this thing was worth $2 if that.
