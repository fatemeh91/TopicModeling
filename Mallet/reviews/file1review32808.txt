review/text: I'm really bad at eating early in the day and also organizing time for working out. So this is what I do.I have a Slim Fast shake early in the day for convenience, and I have a notebook for keeping track of my eating and my working out. I list the exercises I want to do and the amount of which I want to do each day and as I complete them I check them off. I don't do them all at the same time and that is why I listed them to check off what I did do, to make it easy to keep track. I have another shake during the day sometimes and sometimes at night for a snack that fends off hunger. It's a nice product to have when you want to lose weight. The only issue I have with it is the 3 pack. It only lasts for 3 weeks because each can has 14 servings and at 2 a day it's only one week so 3 cans make for 3 instead of 4 weeks. I hope they make a 4 week pack for convenience. Good taste, works for the appetite issue and if you are willing to commit, you'll see results.If you want to know the fitness routine to which I'm committed, it's weight training. Handweights used in different routines will do the trick. To tell you what types, well, it would take too long to explain but it was designed by me for me and you can do the same for you. If you're skeptical about it remember, build muscle, burn more fat so it's better for you to incorporate it in your routine than to just do cardio. If you would like some inspiration, well, you could always look online for video routines you can look at. Youtube is a free source for workout videos. You can use some simple 2 or 3 pound weights and it helps.
