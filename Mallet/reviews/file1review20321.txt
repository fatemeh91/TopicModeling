review/text: This orange spray is the most wonderful thing! Many products like Oust or Lysol make many claims about eliminating odors, but most do it with chemicals that have other effects, perfumes that are chemically based, and various other nasties. This product not only freshens the air, it purifies it with the natural essence of orange! Great for those who are chemically sensitive. If you haven't tried it do it now. And remember, a little goes a long way--you don't have to hose down the air like with the aforementioned products. Good Health to You!
