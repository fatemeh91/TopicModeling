review/text: I'm convinced this is the perfect potty seat. My daughter started out with the separate potty, but once she got the hang of it, she wanted to use the big potty. This seat is perfect to ensure she doesn't fall in! And the "pee guard" is a great feature. Easily conforms to our standard toilet seats and our oblong ones. And VERY easy to clean.
