review/text: We have a house with no bathtubs! The previous owner was disabled and installed easy access showers throughout the house. They're nice... until you have to give a toddler a bath! After reading reviews on similar products, and using an inflatable duck tub for months that was given to us, we bought this one. The duck tub was way too small for our almost 2-year-old. This was the biggest inflatable tub we could find, and so far it's doing the trick. Our daughter loves taking baths in it. She especially likes the headrest. She'll actually lay back and let me wash her hair without a fuss! I know she'll eventually outgrow this as well, but hopefully she'll be more ready to learn to take showers by then. Oh- she really likes the fishes on the tub as well.
