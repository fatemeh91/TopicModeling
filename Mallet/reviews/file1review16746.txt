review/text: This ottoman arrived in a timely fashion for a very reasonable price and no shipping, which is what I like. The legs to the ottoman were ingeniously located on the bottom of the seat inside a zippered opening. Here's the kicker....there are extensions on the bottom of each leg that are attached by a screw so we didn't need the extra height so I proceeded to remove each of them. As I was taking out the screws, I wondered why each screw was so rusty...hmmm! So after I removed all the extensions and turned the ottoman over, why there was water coming out of the legs! The legs are made of heavy duty plastic! How odd I thought. Where had the legs to this ottoman been? And seeing as they were tucked underneath the seat part of the ottoman I thought there should be some sort of water damage to the fabric but no, everything else was in perfect condition. So, after draining all the water out of the legs, I proceeded to put felt pads on each of the four feet, to protect the hardwood floors. What a nice addition to our seating in the living room! I'll probably never know where that water came from or how many oceans it had to cross to meet up with the seat part. Oh well, I am very happy with my purchase. But I would like to know more about its history.
