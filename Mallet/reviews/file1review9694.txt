review/text: These round frame glasses were bought for a Christmas gift and ended up being the hit of the night. Everyone wanted a turn wearing them for a while and getting their picture taken. The size seems to be a smaller type frame. They looked like average sized frames on the more smaller / average shaped faces, but a bit small on the larger faced guy. He still liked them though.
