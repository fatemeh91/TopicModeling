review/text: I've had one of these for almost a year now. I think that it is great. I cuts about as close as a blade without the hassle and time. Also no nicks, scrapes or cuts. It's not real fast, but it sure is faster than getting out the razor and going through that routine. I just use it dry and dump out the clippings every few days. I wash it when it needs recharging (every 2 or 3 weeks). It seem to cut a little closer if you use shaving gel, but it is not worth the hassle for me. My sons have used it when they are home. They like it, but one says that it doesn't work well if you have not shaved for 2 or 3 days.I think it's as good as they get. Give it a try!
