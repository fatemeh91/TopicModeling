review/text: This is by far the best potty seat for toilets on the market! I've tried several others, and this is far superior to any others. Since it is adjustable, this potty seat doesn't shift at all when put on the toilet seat.The sit down Baby Bjorn potty is also wonderful. For potty training, we're only going with Baby Bjorn products from now on!
