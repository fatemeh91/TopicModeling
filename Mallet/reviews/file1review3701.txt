review/text: I expected the product to cover my ankles, but instead it was long enough to go to my knees. It was extremely stiff, uncomfortable, dificult to fasten, and my feet got wet each time I used it. I wanted a refund, e-mailed the company, but they did not bother to respond at all. So don't expect to be treated like a person after they have gotten your money. What made matters worse, was that the elastic broke the 2nd week. I will never do business with this company again, and suggest the no one does.I needed this item so badly that I bought 2. What a waste.They will ignore you after they have gotten your money.The product was bad, and the vendor's Customer Service was non existant.Very unhappy NEVER to use again past customer,B CookPS. DON"T BUY IT ! ! ! ! You will regret it.Amazon didn't help me either. Shame on them to.
