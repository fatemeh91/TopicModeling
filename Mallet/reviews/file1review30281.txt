review/text: I bought this vacuum to clean up my bathroom after I trim my Bichon Frise dog and after styling my own hair. I tend to shed like a puppy!!!! It is great & it is wonderful to vacuum stairs. It has a nice long cord. I start at the top of my hardwood stairs & work my way down. I am very happy with this product.
