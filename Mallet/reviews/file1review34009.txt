review/text: I am going crazy trying to find the right product for eczema. I have been using pine tar soap and olive soap for cleansing, then argan oil and/or tamanu oil with Kiehls body lotion and Aveeno Anti-Itch Cortisone cream on top of that. I have read that cortisone is not good to use long term because when you quit using it, the eczema comes on twice as bad and then there is the issue of cortisone being absorbed into your system thus causing liver damage. Sigh. So I decided to try this because it is - ta DA! - all natural blah blah blah. I put in on and it felt nice initially but within the hour my spots were itching again. I am using tamanu oil under it (I recommend Teliaoils Madagascan tamanu oil) which seems to help. It is a pleasant cream to use, unscented, moderately moisturizing but it really does nothing toward healing the abominable curse that is eczema. I have ordered another product called Gormel cream which has 20% urea in it and we will see how that goes. This Psorzema cream would probably be great for someone who just has sensitive skin but no psoriasis or eczema. It will not worsen the condition but will not help it either - for me, anyway. Good fortune to all those seeking relief and please comment if you know of a good remedy...******** Update 12/7/2012 ********My skin problem was not eczema at all, it turned out to be a fungal infection - so please take my review with a grain of salt. Since I do not have experience with how it works on psoriasis or eczema, I have changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.
