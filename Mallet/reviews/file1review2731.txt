review/text: We love Beanpod candles and have ordered from many different companies and the last 4 do notburn like they are suppose to. The wax still remains about 1 inch around the inside of the glassand does not melt or give off the lemon smell. Are these old? Beanpod candles are the best and we have never had a problem with these candles? Will probably not order from this company again.
