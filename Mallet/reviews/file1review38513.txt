review/text: I have tried a lot of heated eyelash curler: from Talika's which is really pricey (and not curling the lash very well), to Sephora's which is just about the same price as Emjoi but its curler case would split and the battery would fall off after using for a while. Emjoi is by far the best heated eyelash curler I've used. It heats up in seconds and the heat is just right to curl the lash. It also comes with a cleaning brush. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a heated eyelash curler.
