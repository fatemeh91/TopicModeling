review/text: I would highly recommend this product to any of my friends and family. The pad itself is much slimmer than I'm used to but it's very absorbent. Easily fits into a pocket or purse and doesn't feel bulky. I loved the wings on it, because there's less room for accidents, and I didn't have to wash out or toss any panties because of leaks. I will only use the Always Overnights with Wings from now on.
