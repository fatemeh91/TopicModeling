review/text: I own a cross pen made in usa. The pen is heavy, very well made and gorgeous. I just recieved this pen thinking the reviews were just being over dramatic however, the pen really does feel like cheap tin. I have requested a refund immediately. For 75 $ the pen should be flawless and it just isnt.
