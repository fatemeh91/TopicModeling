review/text: This is week one day two of using the product. It is quick to work, when I worked out my muscles got sore for very short periods of time. I normally work uppers body one day, abs another, and lower body on day three, but I finished my upper body work out so fast that I just worked everything. So I'd give it 5 stars on the energy boostHowever, at the end of my workout I had one of the worst stomach aches I've ever had, I felt it earlier in the day, but It did not really kick in until I took the second pack and a few hours afterward. I sat down for almost 15 mins before I do bare to stand and walk home. That didn't matter to me much maybe it does to you. I'll keep posting as the continue to use the product
