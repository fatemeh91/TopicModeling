review/text: This is a good idea in theory, however, it just didn't work for us. Our son took a pacifier with no problems, but he knew this was different and just didn't want to hang on to it. Even though taking a rectal temp is no joy in itself, it's the best way to get an acurate reading. It's all our doctor's office would really take.
