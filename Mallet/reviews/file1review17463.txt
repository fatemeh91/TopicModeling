review/text: First off, this is a great trimmer at what it is meant for: trimming your beard/mustache. I was very satisfied with the trim it delivered; it was easy to set the length and the setting stayed in place. The blades seemed to be nice and sharp, it provided a smooth trim and didn't pull any hairs or otherwise cause any discomfort.The reason I am rating this 4 stars is because it can be a bit messy to use. When using this trimmer, because there is no vacuum function the hairs literally go all over the bathroom sink and this can cause clogs if you just flush everything down the drain. I actually have stopped using this and am using a competing product that contains a vacuum that sucks all cut hairs into a container for easy disposal in the trash.Overall, this is still a very good product, I just can't rate it 5 stars because I feel it could use the extra feature of a vacuum suction. If you don't need this feature, there's no reason not to purchase this trimmer.
