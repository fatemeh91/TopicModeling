review/text: I was very disappointed in this product. I ran the dishwasher once and there was still quite a bit of food stuck on my dishes. I ran it a second time just to see if it would help and it didn't. I ended up rewashing the whole load by hand because I simply didn't trust that anything really got clean. I'm one of those that basically washes the dishes before loading the dishwasher and I really hoped that this would elminate that step for me, but unfortunately my search continues...
