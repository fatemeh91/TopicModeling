review/text: reliable battery and strong machine. Very useful and worth the money.Two things i didnt like about the machine:1) It doesnt matter how careful i am, it throws the cut hair all over the place. so it is kind of messy2) i have to change the head for different length settings. and i am afraid that i will loose those little pieces some day.
