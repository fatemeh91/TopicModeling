review/text: Best Whey. Excellent flavor. I have tried every type of Whey from numerous companies. Mixes well. Consumer Reports rates it the lowest in all the toxic heavy metals. Use to drink Muscle Milk but Consumer Reports reported that Muscle Milk is the highest in Lead, Mercury, Arsenic, cadmium and extremely toxic if taken three times a day. I don't work for any company or Consumer Reports. My three muscular sons all drink this before and after their daily workouts. Have been using this product for over 5 years. Can't beat this price. I also buy the Optimum Nutrition Casein vanilla protein which tastes wonderful and better than vanilla whey.
