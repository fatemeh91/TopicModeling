review/text: This product is great! It's made from CreaPure branded creatine monohydrate, which is a pure as it gets. It does take some doing to get it to dissolve, but I just put it in the blender and let it run for a few minutes - much better than shaking. Once it's dissolved, you cannot taste it at all; I actually drink it as my water during workouts or sometimes mix my protein shake using it. My results have been great too. I added 25 lbs to my bench press in a little over a month and can definitely feel that this helps me recover faster. Plus, the price is basically unbeatable, especially if you order it via the subscription option, which gives you a discount and free shipping!
