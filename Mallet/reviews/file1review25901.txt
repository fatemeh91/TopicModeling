review/text: I had never been a big fan of rechargeable batterys, since they discharge so quickly after a full charge. I had also never been familiar with this type of rechargeable battery. Trust me, these are immensely superior to regular rechargeables and the price was fantastic when purchased with my Canon Powershot. Anyone who buys a camera and can get special savings on this battery pack is really missing the boat if they don't take advantage of the offer. The batterys charge up faster and last so much longer. Definitely worth the cost.
