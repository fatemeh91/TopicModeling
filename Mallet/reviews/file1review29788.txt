review/text: I had been usingPure Alaska Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil 1000mg Softgels 180-Countand never ever had any after taste. I bought this product because of the lower price. After two days of taking this, I am ready to pitch them into the trash. They are causing me to burp with a terrible fishy after-taste. I would not re-order this if it were free. Too, these Softgels are much larger than the "Pure Alaska" product, even though both claim to be 1000 mg. If both do (you never know) contain the same amount, then the "Pure Alaska" is much easier to swallow.
