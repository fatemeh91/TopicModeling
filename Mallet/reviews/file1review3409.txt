review/text: I bought ID glide from a store and paid way more than I will pay for my next bottle from Amazon. Many of the lubricants dry on the skin quickly, this does not. It's not a massage lotion. But it does let your stuff slide and glide for long enough. I use it with a vacuum device and ID stays slippery and doesn't "chill". The other lubes dried out and made my penis cold. ID has no taste in case one was concerned about that.
