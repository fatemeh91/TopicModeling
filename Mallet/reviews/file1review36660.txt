review/text: I always thought of Irish Spring Soap as having an overpoweringly strong smell, but now it has a pleasant, fresh smell. It lathers great, especially when using a washcloth. Also, the bars seem to last longer than Zest, our usual soap. That's great if I don't need to buy soap as much. My whole family uses it, our youngest being six years old. I'd definitely buy this soap in the store, when my three bars are used up.
