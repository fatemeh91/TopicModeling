review/text: As I get older, and heavier, etc., my sit down job tends to cause my ankles to swell which annoys me.. alot. Sometime in the past I bought a cheap pair of compression stockings but they really didn't do any good. Then I notice these and decided to try them out. I haven't seen my ankles in about 6 months.. at least. After wearing these for two days, the swelling has disappeared. Now, I put them on every morning (well, not the same pair). I've got one open toed and one closed toed.The only thing is that they are (and no real surprise) something of a challenge to put on but on the positive side I think I'm building up my hand and finger strength.These are high quality and high compression and do exactly what they were designed to do.
