review/text: I was amped when I ordered this, I was really looking forward to my first purchase!!!When I finally got it in the mail I used it soon after that.It was a little loud but otherwise it served its intended purpose!!However, about a month after I purchased it , it stopped working, I phoned Amazon and they told me thatthey would not reissue a replacement, and they don't offer returns on this item... (AS IF.. I would have returned it anyway).All I'm going to say is be cautious when purchasing this item.. it states WATERPROOF.. , but it's really not good in any water!!
