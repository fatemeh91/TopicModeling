review/text: Bought two of the organizer's for a 10 day international vacation and was quite impressed with how deep the individual four compartments are for each day of the week. In fact I was able to get 9 large & small capsules and tablets into each box for my morning supplements dosage. In addition the box lids stay shut and require a bit of effort to open but well worth it!
