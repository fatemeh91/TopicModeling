review/text: Let me preface this by saying I am a big Animal products fan so needless to say I was incredibly disappointed at the quality or lack thereof of this product. Let me also say that this was just my personal experience with this product and yours may differ.I have been utilizing this product for 2 weeks now (bear in mind it's only a 3 week cycle at 2 packages a day) and I have noticed absolutely ZERO benefits from taking it. There is no increased energy, no increased strength, and let me be on record as saying there isn't even a placebo affect from taking this supplement. The only thing it does do is give me severe heartburn.To the company's credit they do offer a money back guarantee but like anything in life I think it's wrong to consume 2/3's of a product and then demand a refund. I will take this as lesson learned and stick with the Animal products that I KNOW work (i.e. Animal Pack).
