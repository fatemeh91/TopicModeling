review/text: I purchased this deodorant for my husband who has developed chemical sensitivities to a number of products due to mercury/heavy metal toxicity caused by the "silver" aka mercury fillings in his teeth. The packaging and label fooled me into believing it was a good, natural product. When my husband developed a bad reaction to the deodorant, I inspected the label and the list of ingredients. The very first ingredient is Propylene Glycol - do some research on this chemical - it is reported to have severe adverse health effects including contact dermatitis and allergies, kidney and liver damage. I didn't need to research any of the other ingredients as this first one was enough for me to toss the remaining deodorant in the trash. I'm completely and totally offended that this company would put itself out there as producing a healthy, safe product when in fact it contains harmful chemicals. Yes, it has no aluminum, paraben or alcohol, but it does contain toxic substances. Buyer beware!
