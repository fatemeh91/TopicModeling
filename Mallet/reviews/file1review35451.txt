review/text: I waited a while to publish this review, to make sure it was not a fluke. And here i am!! We moved to this apartment a couple months ago, and everytime i took the dishes out of the dishwasher they smelt like fish dirt. It was horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!***Please see my BEFORE and AFTER pictures.***So i googled and seen on some forums and seen people talking about this "dishwasher magic". Well dishwasher magic it is!!! I used 1 bottle and i cant believe how clean it got the washer. I cleaned it out with soap and water before i took the dirty picture, and all that was stained in there. I used the dishwasher magic, and POOF! its gone!!! Anyways, its been over a month and NO smell at all!!!SO HAPPY!!!!
