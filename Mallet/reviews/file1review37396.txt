review/text: I'm not gonna lie, I'm a wimp to pain and this HURT when I used it right after I got it in the mail...I had never epilated before and was expecting it though so it was bearable. Af first though I could hardly see my legs through the tears in my eyes. But my mission was accomplished after 1 1/2 hours (but I did both of my entire legs, not just the knee and below).Come the next morning, lo and behold...stubble! So disappointing. So I waited another day and tried again. It didn't seem to be working. Sure thing, the darn machine was broken and I knew I would have to send it back. Or was it really broken, I wondered? Soon enough I realized that somehow, inexplicably, those pesky little hairs were coming out steadily, and without pain! How was this possible?? I have no idea. All I know is third time was a charm. NO stubble, very little pain (doesn't even faze me), and legs like a movie star for several days (at the time of this review, I have gone for 4 days without even a stray hair peeking out). I'm hooked on this little miracle!!! If you buy it be sure to go really slow up the leg. I learned that my first mistake was blazing through my hairforest like a lawnmower gone amuck. Doesn't work that way, because it just rips the hairs off at the surface. That's why I had stubble after only a few hours. I am now the epilating queen when only a week and a half ago I cringed at the thought of even tweezing a single hair off my leg. By the way, I have not tried underarms or bikini line so good luck with that. Maybe someday.
