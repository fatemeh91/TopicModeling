review/text: I would recommend this product to friends. I felt that my teeth were much cleaner and fresher after using Plax rinse. The taste is pleasant and it's easy to use. I like the benefit of knowing that I'm fighting plaque and freshening my breath at the same time. It's a wonderful product and I'll continue to use it!
