review/text: I just got my ProFibe through Amazon yesterday so I can only rate this at 4. I am supposed to take three servings daily which are 10.4 grams each. I put 2.5 grams in my two cups of coffee this morning which became smooth without any odd flavor. I drink Fenugreek tea after my coffee and did the same to achieve my first 10.4 gram serving. There is only .5 grams of fat in every 10.4 grams of serving and is VERY soluble. I am going to start cooking with this too!Happy Holidays
