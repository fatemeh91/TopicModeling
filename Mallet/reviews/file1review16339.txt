review/text: I used to be loyal to the Costco Kirkland liquid dishwasher detergent, but for some reason just stopped working. I tried other brands, same result: had to basically wash the dishes by hand before putting them in the dishwasher, otherwise they never got clean. I thought there was something wrong with the dishwasher until someone recommended I try "Finish". Wow, amazing difference -- dishes are clean again without needing a pre-dishwasher handwash!My only nitpicky gripe is that I wish each "powerball" weren't individually wrapped, but I guess that's to keep the moisture out or something.
