review/text: The Overtired & Cranky scent is blissfully sweet and refreshing. My eight-month old son loves playing in the bubbles and smells terrific after his bath and massage. The massage oil doesn't feel greasy and smells cleaner than the Calming massage oil. (Though, the Calming oil is great, too!) Not to mention, this tote comes with a cute yellow ducky!
