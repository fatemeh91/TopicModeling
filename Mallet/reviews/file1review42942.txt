review/text: I absolutely love this product! Whenever I have grime or tough stains on my counter or dishes, I always reach for my Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Surface Scrub! Other products leave my pans and dishes with a metal smell, and after using this product, I only smell a clean flowery scent! I love it so much that I use it in my sinks too!PS.. For some reason my grocers carry all things Mrs. Meyer's EXCEPT the powder scrubs!! So, I have to purchase a case of this through Amazon!!! Matter of fact, many discount stores don't carry it either!! Thank you Amazon!!
