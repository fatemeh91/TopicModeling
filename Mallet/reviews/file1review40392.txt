review/text: Cepacol lozenges are my first line of defense once a sore throat strikes. Generally I try to ward it off with vitamin c, apple cider vinegar, etc. but once it's there and not going anywhere anytime soon, I turn to Cepacol.Why? Because these are hands down the best pain relief lozenges for mouth/throat irritation. They last fairly long and have a decent taste. I wouldn't say it is as sweet as say, that fruit breeze flavored junk nor as herbal as Ricolas. It is somewhere in between those, with a more medicinal taste than both. I don't find it in any way offensive, and the menthol in the drops just makes your breath minty, rather than shout out to everyone in the vicinity "Steer clear, infectious person coming through" in silent, artificial cherry steam (yuck) as so many lesser quality cough drops do. The relief is strong for about 15 minutes, to the point that your taste buds are useless and your mouth might even be numb and tingly, but then it just seems as though your sore throat is completely gone for about 2 hours.Even better, these lozenges are reasonably priced and widely available. Amazon seems to have a better price than most of the ones I've seen in store (as usual), but they are by no means a huge investment and are often on sale.So get some ASAP, whether you're currently suffering or just to keep on hand when that inevitable cold/flu strikes each winter. Your scratchy throat will thank you.
