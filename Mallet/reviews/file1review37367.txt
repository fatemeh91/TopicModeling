review/text: I used to use wax strips to wax my legs, which were relatively fast and easy. Until I found my SilkEpil. The first time I used it I didn't even try it with the head which supposedly makes it less painful, because I am used to waxing. I was a little shocked by the pain at first, but quickly got used to it, and by the end of the session it was more like a warm sensation with no pain. I then tried it on my bikini line with the head to reduce pain. I have since decided never to try it again. Waxing is equally painful, but lasts half-a-second, where this takes 5 minutes to do a couple square inches. Very uncomfortable, I didn't even finish. However, it also comes with a shaver head which is very convenient. (you can trim your bikini hair to half a centimeter) I did both of my lower legs in 20 minutes on the first time, and have been quicker since. It also takes only a couple minutes to clean it. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. I was spending much more for the wax strips. (which are about 6 bucks per waxing, which is a fraction of the cost for professional waxing). Another benefit to this over waxing is that the hair doesn't have to be as long for it to be effective. Which is a major perk to my husband, because I don't have to go as long with gorilla legs.*update*I now only use the shaver head, because I was getting way too many ingrown hairs when I used the epilator. Now I just shave my legs like the regular girls. :) Also, my sister tried this product and she couldn't bare the pain for even an inch of her legs.
