review/text: First of all this medication is no scam it really works. After reading all the reviews I was a bit hesitant to order this as I have an external hemorrhoid now for over 2 weeks where nothing helped. I received this on Friday and used it immediately. For anybody having problems with the smell and burning/cooling sensation, you are using way too much of the ointment. You need to use only a tiny bit of it and wait a few minutes until it starts working. I believe everybody thinks you feel immediately something and puts more and more, but dont!!! I put a tiny amount and first thought, wow I feel nothing, but waited. After like 4 minutes it started to feel like ice on it and the pain started to stop. If you put only a tiny bit on it you smell nearly nothing. I put it in the morning and I am out and about and nobody smells anything. Others commented that they get all the clothes dirty, but really with this small of an amount nothing stains. Again please do not put much of it on your body its not necessary. The tube is very small, but if you use only tiny amounts it can last a long time. My hemorrhoid is still there (used it only three days) but the pain stopped nearly immediately and I can get up without pain and enjoy life again. Hope to update my review soon and be able to say that the hemorrhoid is gone, but so far I am really happy with this product.
