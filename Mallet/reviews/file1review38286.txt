review/text: Honestly, I like the version Life Force offers that are in capsule form. Hides the smell (which, yes, is nasty) and the taste. I'll probably go back to the first version after I finish this bottle and try to gauge which one made me feel better...which is the most important thing, right? I don't like that these are so much more expensive than the capsule version either.
