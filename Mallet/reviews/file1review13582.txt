review/text: Love having a alternative to Baby Vicks(and the horrible additives in that product). This product was soothing and smelled great. Thanks to Amazon we were able to reorder, as it was sold out locally during the cold and flu season. We could only find nasty Vicks, and I wasnt about to put that on my 6 month old baby.
