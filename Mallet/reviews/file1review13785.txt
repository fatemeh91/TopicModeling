review/text: Too tacky--not worth it. The led is too small to truely illuminate and it is not focused on the area being illuminated. I, too, thought I was going to recieve a pair of them but did not. The magnifier works fine, but you can get a thinner card to do that for less cost. I also bought the "Fulcrum LED 2-Pack Card Magnifiers" which is a little over 1/4 inch thick but works, is lightweight, and contained 2 of them, as advertised.
