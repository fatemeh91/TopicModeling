review/text: I tried this on my legs, underarms, and stomach. It would hardly pull off any hair, just hurt a lot pulling on skin.If I had problems just because I'm a novice (though I tried it multiple times, so you'd think I'd make headway with it), I gave it to my sister to try who is an expert at waxing her own legs as she's been doing it since she was in her teens. She didn't have any luck with it either so we chucked it. Big waste of money.
