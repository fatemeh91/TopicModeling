review/text: Seriously, it is. I discovered this because I was looking for ways to sweat less without the use of antiperspirant. Since I've been taking this, my back stopped hurting (working in a cold meat cooler destroys it) and I have more energy. I feel all around better.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the description did not include dosage size and serving size was off. The bottle actually says take 2 capsules 1-2 times daily as needed. I went with this over Nature's Plus because this had reviews, and I figured they were similar in dosage. They are 100mg. The natures plus is 600 mg. they cost about the same after shipping too.Hope that helps in your purchase decision. This is still a great product, but the Nature's Plus seems like a much better deal.
