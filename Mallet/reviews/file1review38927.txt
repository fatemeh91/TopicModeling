review/text: Nutricology is the retail version of Allergy Research Group's brand of supplements. I started taking Acetyl-L-Carnitine about 13 years ago and have found this to be the best brand. It helps a lot with mental alertness but it's very good for heart health. L-Carnitine doesn't cross the blood brain barrier as easily. I take a number of supplements but this is my #1 pick for well being and heart health.
