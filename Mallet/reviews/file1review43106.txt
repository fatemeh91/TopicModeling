review/text: I am a waitress and 8 months pregnant. My Dr. recommended this product to relieve back pain and discomfort due to my expanding waistline(haha) It looked promising but upon arrival I tried it on and instantly it was itchy and uncomfortable. The next day I tried to wear it to work with a tank top underneath to help with the itchiness. I took it off within the first 10 minutes of work.My two year old now wears it around the house. I do not recommend this product.
