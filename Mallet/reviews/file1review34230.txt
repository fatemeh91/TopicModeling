review/text: After a year of PAINFUL, marble sized hemorrhoids and trying everything else to relieve them, I'm finally free! This ointment really does work. The smell (as some have mentioned as being horrible) is NOT bad. I'm guessing maybe some people got a bad batch or something? It has a VERY mild (can barely smell it if you put your nose to the tube) "Chinese" scent. It isn't bad. If you've ever been in a Chinese person's home, you know the Chinese smell. Smells like my in laws haha (my husband is Chinese). I smelled it and thought "Family!" Even if it were stinky thought, it would be well worth it to not suffer from the pain.
