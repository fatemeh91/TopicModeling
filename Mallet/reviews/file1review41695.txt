review/text: 1. It comes packaged so securely as to be nearly impossible to open (and I should have stopped right there, given how the rest of this experience played out).2. The brush binds up, cuts on and off briefly and unpredictably while brushing. And it does not shut off automatically at the end of the recommended 2-minute brushing period.3. There's no way at all to SEE how long you've been brushing without turning it OFF to look since you cannot remove it from your mouth while turned on. There's a different Oral-B product with a separate timer (the Oral-B Triumph with SmartGuide Electric Toothbrush). But that timer cannot be purchased separately.4. On both low and regular speed this brush shakes my head violently, enough to make me dizzy (I have to sit down to feel I am brushing safely... and can watch the clock that way, too, since the brush-based timer is of no use whatever).5. After only 4 uses (two more than I thought I could stand) and a consultation with my dentist, it's back in the original package and replaced with a Phillips Sonicare. More than dismal for a "$139.99" toothbrush!6. When I contacted Oral-B (now Crest, i.e., Procter and Gamble) they basically told me to go pound sand - actually what they suggested was since it didn't seem to suit me I should just throw it away, which they based on the production # having been 2 years ago (as though that had any bearing on its newness).In summation, Oral-B may be the recognized leader in toothBRUSHES and know all there is to know about brushes but they do not know the first thing about electronics. I paid for their learning curve. Never again. Too bad NO stars isn't a rating option.
