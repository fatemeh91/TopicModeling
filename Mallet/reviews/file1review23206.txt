review/text: I bought this because I have some cats that don't get along and have to keep litter boxes upstairs. I didn't want to constantly haul my vacuum upstairs and scare the timid kitties who live there. So I got the idea of an old-fashioned carpet sweeper. But this has proved so much more useful than just to pick up bits of litter. I take it down to my dining room where I have a kilim rug that always bunches when I use the vacuum on it, and this little carpet sweeper cleans it up perfectly. And I just run it over the carpets from time to time when there's a little cat hair or bits of paper, and it does the job just fine. Quiet, time saving, a great product.
