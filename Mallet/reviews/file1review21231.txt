review/text: I was a little wary of buying the Oral-B S-200 because I'd had a Sonicare Advance 4100 for probably 3 years before. I was so used to it I thought I'd not really want the Oral-B. I am pleasantly surprised. It is slightly harsher - the brush with it is a little harsher on my teeth and gums, but not in a bad way. After using the Oral-B for about 3 weeks I am very happy that I made this purchase. It's light, does a great job cleaning, and should be fairly easy to find replacement brushes. Thanks, Amazon, for such a great deal!
