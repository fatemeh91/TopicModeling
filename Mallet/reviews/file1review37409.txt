review/text: It only got about 60% of the hairs, even after I went over an area many many times. And many of the hairs just broke off and didn't get pulled, leaving stubble. So I tried an experiment: I did one leg with the epilator and one leg with the electric razor attachment that it comes with. The epilated leg was only slightly smoother than the razored leg-both were left quite prickly. Very disappointing. I will not use it again.
