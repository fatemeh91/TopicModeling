review/text: I like the oral b triumph a great deal. My teeth very clean when I use it. The only thing I don't care for is the expense of the brushes. They are quite expensive. But I guess if it saves one filling, it more than pays for itself. I did just have an oral b that was a plain model. My teeth feeler alot cleaner with these particular brushheads. The timer one this model is nice and having different speeds on it is also nice. I am glad that I purchased the Triumph and if it lasts a decent amount of time, I will purchase it again.
