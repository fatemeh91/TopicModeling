review/text: I purchased this Oral B Triumph Professional Care 9400 because my old Oral-B electric brush just went out of commission after more than 10 years. In the product description, they said that Triumph would stop if you applied too much pressure. But that didn't seem to be so. What really happened is the 30 seconds timer. Whenever the timer expires, the brush just paused a few seconds before resuming the operation. This action signals the time that the user should switch to a different quadrant. I used to spend about 10 minutes to brush my teeth. The timer helps to keep me in check so that I wouldn't over brushing my teeth too much even though I often go over the limit of two minutes. I like the floss action brush head that comes with the order. It made my teeth feel exceptionally clean the first time I used it. I also used the Oral-B extra soft brush head to avoid damaging my gum. The three brushing modes are not necessary. The cleaning mode is the one you need most.
