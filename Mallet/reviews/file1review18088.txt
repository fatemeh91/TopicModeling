review/text: We have a baby who (like many babies) gets up once or twice in the night. I nurse her, and this used to be hard on the Mister. As I work from home on a flexible schedule, I can sleep in or nap with our daughter, but he can't do as he has to drive to work. He had the idea of using a sleep mask. When I'd wake him, he'd sometimes stay up and keep me up, too.I did a little research, and we decided to give this a shot. It's been nearly a week, and we are all very happy with it. My husband is well rested, and I don't worry about waking him up by turning on the night light to nurse our daughter. He said the mask is super comfortable (something we were concerned with as he has a larger head). I tried it out (I'm small) and it is very adjustable and comfortable on me, too...so head size shouldn't matter. The only issue is there is a tiny bit of light that comes in around the nose for my husband, but he says it's very minimal and does not effect his sleep. It's very nice and dark. Thank you for giving us good sleep!
