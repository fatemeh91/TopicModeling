review/text: Of all the protein powders i've used, this is the best tasting and easiest to mix. I strongly suggest mixing most flavors with milk instead of water, for the chocolate and banana flavors it makes it taste much better. Of the three flavors I've tried, on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being some theoretically best tasting protein powder in the universe), I'd rate them:Banana Cream: 9Double Chocolate: 7Milk Chocolate: 4
