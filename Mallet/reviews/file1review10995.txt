review/text: I bought this clipper for occasional use. It was just what I needed without spending a lot of money. It works GREAT! It doesn't seem to have the power (I believe) for heavy duty work, but for the trims and summer cuts - it's perfect! *One note - Have the blades regularly sharpened (every 3-4 cuts) and it will run through the coats like it was brand new!
