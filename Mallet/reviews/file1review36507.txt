review/text: I was really amazed by how much I loved this product. I'd been trying different brands of natural deodorants and nothing seemed to work. Finally, I decided to spend a little more than what I'm used to on a deodorant and it was worth every penny! Traditional antiperspirants/deodorants tend to build up defeating the purpose of wearing a deodorant in the first place: to feel clean. The scent also lasts very long which is unusual because natural deodorants tend to fade very quickly, making me feel self-conscious. With Weleda, that doesn't happen, the smell kind of lingers on in a very pleasant way, without being overpowering. I purposely try to get a little on my hair in the mornings because I love the rose scent so much. The only drawback would be the bees being too attracted to the floral aroma, which I can forsee happening in the outdoors.
