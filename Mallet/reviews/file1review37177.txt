review/text: I was so excited when the gloves initially helped my hand issues. I slept for the first time in many nights without having severe pain issue. HOWEVER, the first pair were rubbing/cutting a sore between my middle and ring finger. Amazon customer service was awesome (I do have Prime) when I contacted them. They gave me an immediate refund and had me order a second pair. We thought maybe the first pair was defective. The second pair arrived and within just a couple days, I had the issue back...EXCEPT this time it was with both hands. I called the maker of the gloves. Their representative, Dawn was kind and courteous. Yet, she told me that my complaint is one they have heard before. The company believes it is from a glue used during the construction of the glove causing the issue. She said, I could return the gloves and get another pair...but I don't want to order a third pair with the possibility of the same issue. My second concern, Dawn had not heard before. The gloves seemed to work great but after continuous wear the numbness came back to my hands. The intense pain didn't return but the numbness did. Therefore, I am back to waking up during the night. :-( I ordered two different brands of gloves today and will see how they work.
