review/text: I have searched high and low for a complete, safe, natural, animal-free pre-natal vitamin. I am glad to say that thanks to Rainbow Light's One, I need look no further. I love the fact that I only need to take one pill a day as opposed to six like some other brands. Moreover, I never realized how much of an energy boost these pills gave me...until I ran out of them one day, that is. Hands down, this is the best option on the market today. The only reason I gave them four stars is their enormous size, which makes them a bit hard to swallow. There is nothing better out there so I guess I'll just have to start cutting them in half. :-)
