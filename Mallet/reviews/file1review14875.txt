review/text: The ad for this item shows 40 packets for $77 (about $15 more than last time I ordered, a couple months ago). The detail ad says the cost per packet is $0.23. It takes real magic, to divide $77 by 40 and get $0.23 (It's actually $1.92/packet). I'm not buying till Amazon goes to school and learns simple arithmetic.
