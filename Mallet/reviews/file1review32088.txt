review/text: I love this product! I'm clumsy, so I'm always spilling things on myself. Tide-to-Go keeps me from looking like a slob. :-) It gets out most stains, and the stains that it can't get out (mostly stains that have already set or grease spots), it will lighten so they're not as noticeable. I keep a Tide-to-Go in my purse so I have it at all times.
