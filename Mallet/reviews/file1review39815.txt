review/text: I already have an Ontel Gopher and bought this one as a gift. It turned about while they have the pictures of the original Gopher listed in item description they you get has nothing to do with it. You will get a "JMK Pickup & Reaching Tool" which is very really cheap looking and has nothing to do with the Ontel Gopher! Don't waste your money.
