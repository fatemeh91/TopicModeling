review/text: I bought 5 of theese for 20.00 dollars. I turned all of them on at 10:10p.m. At exactly 10:11 p.m. they shut off and wouldn't turn back on. They had lost all of their battery and I was forced to throw them away because what is the use of a BROKEN litecube. They JUST HAVE TO make a charger for these. They were cool until they went out.
