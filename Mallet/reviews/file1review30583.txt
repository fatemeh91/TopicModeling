review/text: I first bought one of these Hyland's Remedy Chests decades ago when my children were very small. If you had to replicate this Chest by purchasing each of the remedies it includes one by one, it would cost well over $250, making this an exceptional bargain.Based on over 200 years of research and observation, Hyland's pharmacists carefully put together this Chest by choosing the homeopathic medicines that apply to the widest range of everyday, acute illness and injury. In addition, the Chest includes a helpful reference guide to all the remedies it contains and the symptoms they address.I've listed below the remedies included in this Chest. Note that the product name for this Chest as listed here on Amazon states there are "29 Pieces." In fact, though there are 29 different remedies included, there are 30 bottles because there are two bottles of Arnica. I have included a notation of the most common usages for each remedy.1 ACONITUM NAPELLUS | for Colds & Fevers with Sudden Onset2 ALLIUM CEPA | for Runny Nose3 ANTIMONIUM TARTARICUM | for Coughs with Mucous in Chest4 APIS MELLIFICA | for Bites, Stings & Swellings5/6 ARNICA MONTANA (2 BOTTLES) | for Bruising & Muscle Soreness7 ARSENICUM ALBUM | for Diarrhea, Food Poisoning, Anxiety8 BELLADONNA | for Fevers & Inflammation9 BRYONIA ALBA | for Dry Cough/Arthritis Pain10 CALCAREA PHOSPHORICA | for Teething11 CANTHARIS | for Bladder Irritation12 CARBO VEGETABILIS | for Nausea and Indigestion13 CHAMOMILLA | for Teething & Irritability14 FERRUM PHOSPHORICUM | for Fevers & Inflammation15 GELSEMIUM SEMPERVIRENS | for Headaches/Flu with Muscle Pain16 HEPAR SULPHURIS CALCAREUM | for Cough & Runny Nose17 HYPERICUM PERFOLIATUM | for Nerve Injury18 IGNATIA AMARA | for Grief, Emotional Upset & Insomnia19 IPECACUANHA | for Nausea & Vomiting20 LEDUM PALUSTRE | for Bites, Stings & Minor Puncture Wounds21 MAGNESIA PHOSPHORICA | for Menstrual Cramps & Muscle Cramps of All Kinds22 MERCURIUS VIVUS | for Sore Throat23 NUX VOMICA | for Indigestion, Nausea & Hangover24 PHOSPHORUS | for Cough & Sore Throat25 PULSATILLA NIGRICANS | for Colds with Runny Nose26 RHUS TOXICODENDRON | for Arthritis Pain, Measles, Chicken Pox & Poison Ivy/Oak27 RUTA GRAVEOLENS | for Sprains & Tendonitis28 SPONGIA TOSTA | for Coughs29 SULPHUR | for Rashes & Eczema30 VERATRUM ALBUM | for Diarrhea with VomitingIf you have never used homeopathy before, it is a good idea to read at least one introductory book on the subject of using it for home health care. For example:Homeopathy: An A to Z Home HandbookorThe Complete Homeopathy Handbook.
