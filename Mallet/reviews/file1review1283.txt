review/text: I've been a personal trainer for 13 years and I've tried so many products out there. I believe this one is great. Only been on it for 4 weeks of a 12 week cycle it's been great thus far. I sleep better, wake better it's just been great. As for muscle improvements I've gained some muscle mass and leaned out rather nicely thus far. I'd recommend this product to anyone looking to help even things out within their own body. Also this was recommended to me for anti-aging I think it's great.
