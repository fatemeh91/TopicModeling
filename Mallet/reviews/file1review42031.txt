review/text: I recently purchased this shaver and I am less than thrilled. The double sided trimmer blades make it VERY hard to shave without hacking away the hair you aren't intending to shave. It works somewhat okay wet, though it takes a long time to get very good results. Dry, forget it. I must have gone over the same spot fifteen times and with very very little noticable hair shaving.So, save your money and look into another brand. Preferrably one with only one trimmer blade.
