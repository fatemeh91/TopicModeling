review/text: These pills are massive and they smell so bad that I could not continue taking them. They taste horrible and the taste lingers for a while... its totall gross... i would reccomend Source Naturals Herbal Resistance Liquid (Alcohol Free Formula) as an alternative. It works amazingly and basically you'll never be sick again! and it tastes much much better and is much easier to take!!!
