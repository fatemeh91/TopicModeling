review/text: My last nose hair trimmer was my Daddy's. It was big and had handgrips for each hand, an old plug- in- the- wall type. It was best if you had someone help holding it cuz it was heavy. You had to keep the blades sharp, or it'll rip the hairs out of your nose. Most of the time it left you bloody.I like this one better cuz all you got to do is put a battery in and turn it on. This thing cuts all types of hair. I bet this thing would cut a male gorilla's nose hair pretty good if you could teach a gorilla how to turn it on. It's real easy; you just push that switch on the side. Big thick black hairs too. It isn't like those cheap trimmers that were made in Japan. This one was made in China. I bet I could teach a Gorilla how to use this trimmer. It works on batteries. It works good.
