review/text: I loved the fact that the sheets were individually wrapped to allow them to stay moist. They are very effective at removing dirt and those greasy fingertip marks on glasses. My only complaint is I would like to see the sheet be larger. They seem a little small and sometimes two were needed to complete the job. Made the glasses spotless. Have already recommended them to several people.
