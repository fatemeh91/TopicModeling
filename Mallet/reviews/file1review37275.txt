review/text: Speed Stick Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant, Unscented -- used by the man of the house -- worked very well in many situations. It held up well at work and at the gym. There were no ""pretty"" smells, which many dislike. The only minus was the white residue buildup on his clothing. They're hard to get out in the laundry.
