review/text: When it works, it's great. Unfortunately, we've already been through three of these units in 3 months. They all worked for about 2-4 weeks then they just stop working. It sounds like the pump is trying to pump but is all jammed up. We didn't clog it with anything and yes, we did our best to prime the pump. I've never seen a product like this which consistently breaks after 2 weeks. Amazingly bad quality control.
