review/text: I purchased the Omron HEM-711AC to replace a Mabis monitor that was not giving accurate measurements. So far, the Omron has performed very satisfactorily. I like the fact that this unit came with an ac adaptor as well as a storage case. My previous unit had neither. I also like the large numbers on the screen. The Omron brand was recommended by my cardiologist. Amazon had the biggest selection and the best prices.
