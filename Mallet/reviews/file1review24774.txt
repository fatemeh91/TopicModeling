review/text: Some reviewers have complained about the scent of this shaving stick. Granting that, initially, I thought that it smelled a little bit like bathroom cleaner, after a time or two, I didn't notice the scent. The shave stick works well, and, with a good badger brush, leads to an outstanding shave. (I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because there is a learning curve involved and because some creams, which cost considerably more, give a better-feeling shave.) It is quick and efficient to use. I have used my first Speick stick for months--on and off, along with a couple of brush-applied and brushless creams or gels--and it looks undiminished in size. I recommend this product.
