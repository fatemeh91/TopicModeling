review/text: I recently tried different brands of tweezers; I have come to the conclusion that for me Tweezerman has the best performance tweezers. I also recently purchased the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Pointed Slant Tweezers to give it a try, I was excited at first because it pulled out the finest hairs on my face, I have use them every day since I purchased them, the performance of the tweezers diminished over time, they still work, but not as good as when I first bought them. I have to pull multiple times to get the hairs; they tend to slip from the tweezers. They are still better than, other brands
