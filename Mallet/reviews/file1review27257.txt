review/text: All of the flavors I've tried have been great tasting and the vanilla ice cream is no exception. The powder mixes easily in a shaker cup with no clumping, even if you add a little too much powder. The flavor is great with milk and still very good with cold water. Warm water is drinkable, but not necessarily the best. I have had no ill effects (upset stomach, cramping, etc) while using this protein. It's a great protein, not really much else to say!
