review/text: This is a unique product. I've tried about a dozen different creams and gels, including some mug soaps. This one feels different right out of the can. It's DENSE; lots of protection. The scent is mild and simply smells "clean"; not musky, not citrusy, not flowery or feminine; just clean.
