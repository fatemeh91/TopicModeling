review/text: I don't know which item other's are getting but I am glad I did not listen even though there were many negative reviews. I used in the bathtub no problem just make sure I repeat make sure the cap is tight and not cracked from overtightening. This vibrator is large, yes, but I have been with many black men and the size is about an average sized black man's penis! (TMI I know!) The penis part does move, some say only the rabbit vibrates, in fact in practically dances and is also hard enough as some said it was not stiff enough. One thing is the rabbit ears are NOT sharp in any form, they are very soft and pliable. My money was very well spent and I love this product. The plastic smell eh get over it, it's no stronger than latex gloves!
