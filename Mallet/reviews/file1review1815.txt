review/text: A very good soap, especially if you are known to have problem skin(rashes, irritations, etc.). This soap kills any viruses or bacteria on the skin giving a more complete wash than normal soaps. The tea tree oil in this soap is known planet-wide for it's healing capabilities. Give this product a shot and you will not regret it!
