review/text: Just to inform, the title is inaccurate for V-caps 120 count. They are not 200mg tabs. Serving size is three tabs and there is not an annotation for amount of Magnesium total per serving, i.e. one cannot deduce the per tab amount. The bottles I received are 3 tablets =500mg, ~167mg/tab. The other sizes listed all seem to be 200mg/tab stated in descriptions.
