review/text: Recently I bought Crown condoms. I thought this could cheep and works well but when I use with my girl friend it tore, I was really shocked because this is the first time I am seeing that condoms also tore. I suggest don't ever try to buy this kind if cheep and useless condoms, be safe and secure yourself.
