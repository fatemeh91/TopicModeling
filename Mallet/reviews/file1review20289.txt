review/text: Believe it or not I have been using cloth diapers for years as dish towels. I have never found anything that works quite as well with the "absorbGerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White" factor being the key element. I was purchasing them for years at my local K-Mart but they stopped carrying them. Diaper services were out of the question for my needs, so my solution was Amazon.com. I can't tell you how pleased I am to be able to order these online saving time, and money. Fast shipping and true product! Thanks again Tom
