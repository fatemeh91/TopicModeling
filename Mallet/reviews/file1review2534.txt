review/text: I have been using the same epilator (older model) since 1999, and it fell down and broke so I decide to replace it for this one. I have to say I am very happy with this kind of epilator, it works as good as the one I had before so I hope it last me as much as the other one last. It doesn't hurt and it cut down my shaving (under arms, legs, and bikini) for every three days that i used to do it before to twice a month. I recommended because I am a satisfied owner.
