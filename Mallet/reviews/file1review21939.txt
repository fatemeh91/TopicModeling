review/text: I bought two boxes of Clif bars for a friend in the middle of his first tour of duty in Iraq. He's a US Army chaplain, and asked for the Clif bars to share with his fellow soldiers. Clif bars are a preferred gift for the soldiers for several reasons; they travel well and arrive in good shape, they keep well and they're easy for the soldiers to grab on their way out on patrol. But mostly, the familiar taste and label make them like comfort food to the soldiers. . .something very welcome and needed after hours in a hot Humvee.
