review/text: I love this toothbrush! i've had Oral B's before, but always the cheap $20. ones. Then it broke and circumstances prevented me from replacing it as quickly as I would have liked. But when my birthday rolled around and i received a Amazon gift cert as a gift, i knew what i ahd to do: by an electric toothbrush. My teeth have been in Heaven since and my mouth feels so much cleaner. I love the options this model provides. Hope everyone treats their mouths / teeth to this kind of care.
