review/text: Easy to use and keep clean, I use this foot bath every other day to help with arthritic symptoms. The only drawback is not being able to use any products in the bath water. The recommendation is that most products clog the jets. However, I am glad I made the purchase, since it seems well designed. I have owned it for a month.
