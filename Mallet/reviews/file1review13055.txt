review/text: Got this for Christmas this year. Didn't even know this product existed. I'm loving it heated. Just 2 minutes in the microwave and I get 30 minutes of soothing heat on my tight neck. I highly recommend it for its comfort and durrability. Recommend putting in a zip lock if it goes in the freezer... I anticipate that the cover will take on a funky smell if placed in there directly.
