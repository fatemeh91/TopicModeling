review/text: This flavor was so terrible that I ended up throwing it away after trying it once. I absolutely love the vanilla ice cream royale and the strawberry banana smoothie flavors of this same product. I bought the chocolate mint flavor based on positive reviews - so maybe it was just me but I really could not stand it!
