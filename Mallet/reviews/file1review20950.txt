review/text: This product is a waste of money and potentially dangerous. People have suffered serious harm and even death through relying on homeopathy instead of medicine. Homeopathy is often confused with natural or herbal medicine, but that is a false perception (seeTrick or Treatment? : Alternative Medicine on Trial,Bad Science,Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraudand other sources).There is a strong scientific consensus that homeopathy is bogus: it is based on principles that lack any scientific validity, and the standard methods of preparation mean that there is absolutely nothing left in the supposed "remedies" other than water and sugar.Oscillococcinum, in particular, is literally a quack remedy: it's prepared from ducks, but there has never been any credible evidence to underpin this; the man who invented oscillococcinum did so on the basis of believing that he observed an "oscillococcus bacterium" in Spanish flu victims, and then again in a duck liver, but we now know that the oscillococcus bacterium does not exist and flu is caused by a virus. The standard dilution used for oscillo is 200CK, which means that an amount of "mother tincture" is diluted 100 parts to 1 and shaken, then the entire contents thrown away and the vessel refilled on the assumption that this is roughly a 100:1 dilution; this is repeated 200 times. If accurate it would result in a dilution of 1 part in ten to the four hundredth power (for comparison, there are roughly ten to the eightieth power atoms in the entire known universe).There is no reason to suppose this product works, no remotely plausible mechanism by which it can work, and no good evidence that it does work beyond simple placebo. It works like an inert sugar pill because it is an inert sugar pill.
