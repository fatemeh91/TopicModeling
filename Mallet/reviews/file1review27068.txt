review/text: Gold Standard just may be the best Whey protein you can buy at a good price(ON's Platinum Standard Hydrowhey is too expensive). Barely any fat and all the protein you need. If you are looking for a fantastic Whey supplement, you don't need to look any further.Also, for all you vanilla lovers out there, buy French Vanilla Creme, its the best. Avoid Vanilla Ice Cream, its horrible.
