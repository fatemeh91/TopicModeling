review/text: Like most of the other people here it seems, I've never been that religious about flossing. I have very tight fitting teeth, and normal dental floss just frays like crazy and makes it even worse. I have to use that Glide stuff, but it's so slippery that it cuts off the circulation to my fingers when I use it. I'd floss for awhile, then forget about it. This always showed as puffy and bleeding gums after I visted the dentist, and even sometimes after brushing. So my dentist gave me a Reach Access as a freebie about two weeks ago after my last teeth cleaning.I was kind of apprehensive at first, since I don't like those toothpick style flossers. But since I've gotten the Reach Access, I've been flossing every day, and it's really showing. My gums don't swell up and bleed anymore, and they seem to adhere to my teeth a lot tighter. I floss before bed, then brush and use antiseptic mouthwash. The daily flosser has been a godsend. I lost mine a few days ago, and had to go out and buy another one. That's how much I love this thing.The only drawback is that the daily refills are a bit expensive, at $4.50 a pack of 28. It's well worth the cost, though. Oh, and for those who have trouble with getting it between their back teeth, you can bite down lightly on the top. This always forces the floss between my back teeth, with no worry about breaking the handle.
