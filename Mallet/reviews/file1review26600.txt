review/text: "The Back Booster is a terrific product. I have had one strapped to my desk chair for months, giving me the best back support of any cushion or wedge that I have ever used. This thing is very rugged, and the company prides itself in quality as well as customer service. I actually had a problem with one cushion leaking (in the valve, I believe), which I believe is pretty rare. I emailed the company and the owner immediately replaced mine, without question. Again, I think such problems are so rare, but defects do happen, with any product.
