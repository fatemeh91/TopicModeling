review/text: Remington has made a great product. It does exactly what it advertises: trims beards and mustaches. The 10 adjustable settings can keep your beard looking long or short. And it effectively defines contours for beards. This is my first beard trimmer and I did not want to mess up all those weeks of beard growing by getting an inferior beard trimmer. The battery life is pretty good as far as I can tell. I haven't had to recharge it since I got it a couple of months ago. I think it is also a little more affordable than the other beard trimmers of its kind.Definitely recommend
