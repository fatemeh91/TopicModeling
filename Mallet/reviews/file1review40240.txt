review/text: I like this toothpaste because it does four things: whitens, protects against cavities, provides tartar control and freshens breath. It has a smooth consistency, and isn't too minty. I've only been using it about a week, and I'm not sure if my teeth are any whiter, but I think that I probably have to use it a while to get the full results of the whitening.
