review/text: I'm 19 and tried Crest Whitestrips Premium expecting great results. After finishing one box and using it correctly, my teeth were maybe half a shade whiter. Since Crest will send a free box to anyone who is unhappy with their results (awesome offer), I requested a box and it arrived within three weeks. I used the second box and it whitened my teeth maybe another half a shade. Overall my teeth are basically the same shade. I was hoping that the Whitestrips would actually whiten my teeth, but they are still yellow! They are also a little hard to keep on, but it gets easier with each use.
