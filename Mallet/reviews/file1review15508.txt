review/text: I really can not find this good everlasting deal in local stores(also I should mention tax). I use this battery for my logitech optical mouse and toothbrush,and it works for months. However I do not suggest you use this battery for some certain cameras which will drive you mad to the anger of changing batteries. But it's not the fault of this battery. I will give a 4 for this battery.
