review/text: I was surprised to see so many low ratings. I bought this tub at the start and had a 8 lb 12 oz baby that was 21" long at birth. She's now 6 months old, and approaching 18 lbs - I'm only now looking for a new tub. I always used this tub on my counter and only once had a spill. I just pick it up and pour it out afterwards.Definitely a great tub.
