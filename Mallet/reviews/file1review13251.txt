review/text: I don't know why I never ordered one of these before. I have a 4 year old who still wets her bed at night time so having to wash her bed sheets plus the waterproof mattress cover everyday was too much for me. When I found this, I saw a lot of reviews of other parents using this product on their kids since it does have the absorbency it claims to be. And I don't regret having to order 2!!! Now, the only things I wash are this Priva product, her blanket, and her clothes. And changing it is a cinch! Just remove and replace it with another Priva. And this product does stay put after all the movements that my daughter does. And I love the feel of quilt, it doesn't feel so plastic and make sleeping so comfortable for her. You gotta try it!
