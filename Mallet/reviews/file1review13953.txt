review/text: These fit my mouth perfectly, and help with great teeth whitening. I don't use a bleach product. I a peroxide/baking soda mixture that I make myself for much cheaper. The peroxide/baking soda mixture doesn't have a minty taste, but the taste is very mild. I'd highly recommend this, especially at the price!
