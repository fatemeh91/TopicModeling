review/text: This product has the best volume to price ratio I could find. It tastes great, and it really seems to help. I've been using it since about January, and my 1 rep max in benchpress has gone from 240lbs to 280lbs. The only problem is, it's a little hard to mix by hand. There are always little globby bits at the top no matter how long I mix it.
