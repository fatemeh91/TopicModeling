review/text: I purchased these gloves to use for a Halloween party. I put one candy corn in each finger/thumb (fingernails) and fill each with popcorn, finishing it off with a spider ring. If I were going to purchase again, I would get the XLarge as it was a bit difficult to get the popcorn in the fingers. I also wish I could of purchased in a smaller quantity, however the price was great.
