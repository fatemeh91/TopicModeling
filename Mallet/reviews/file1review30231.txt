review/text: I just bought this item at Walmart. My intent was to use it for quick daily pickups in between the weekly thorough vacuuming- pulling out my big machine is a drag.I chose it because there are no air vents on the sides as some other hand vacuums which cause dipersion of debris. I have 2 cats which shed their hair on my sofa and armchair. The Retriever was promising as it sounds very powerful, but it did not collect that much hair. You had to "insist" and still it would leave hair behind. A favorite spot of my cats is on the top of the back of the sofa which is 3 inch wide, it was next to impossible to collect the mat of hair there. An annoying feature was the "neck" of the pet brush which connects to the machine. It is very flexible and if you try to apply pressure, the brush just raises and just skims the sofa lightly. Very fast, 5-10 minutes into the job, the machine starts feeling very hot. I am returning the Retriever tomorrow. It is not saving me time at all.
