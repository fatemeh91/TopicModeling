review/text: This is by far the easiest product to use and it does work. Does have a smell but is tolerable if it is harmless as they say. I spray it on while shower is still wet and use it after each last day shower. One bottle 28oz last me 25-30 cleanings. If you use less it will not do the nice job I have come to expect. If I run out it takes about 2-3 weeks for the shower to start showing the scum and then it takes about 2-3 weeks of continuous use to get shower back clean again. If shower has scum showing you will have to apply the product about 1/2 again as heavy as you do once it is clean.
