review/text: Like most men, I loathe condoms for their unique ability to kill the moment and suffocate junior to the point where... well, you know what I'm talking about! But this condom is amazingly sensitive, and you can barely tell that it's there. Goes on fast, and gives you a darn close to bareback feeling. Highly recommend this condom!!!
