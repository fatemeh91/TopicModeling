review/text: Only two companies still making SE razors should be considered: Dovo (Germany) and Thiers Issard (France). Otherwise, get older/discontinued razors from someone who knows what they are doing. Check out straight razor place or badger & blade (google them). Simco makes their blades in Pakistan... and are not shave-ready out of the box (or ever in my opinion).
