review/text: Just received and tried out the French Vanilla Creme. It mixes well with water and tastes pretty good (tastes like watered down French Vanilla ice cream, or something along those lines). But tastes better than I expected and mixes easier than I expected. I just used a funnel to put a scoop into a water bottle, filed it up with water and shook it, that's all it took. I'll buy this again, and maybe try out some of the other flavors. But this one is pretty good.
