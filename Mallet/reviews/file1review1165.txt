review/text: my teeth are very close together and flossing is always a chore. these things are very nice cause you can slide them in easily at the gumline and swoosh them around. i used to use wood toothpicks and various dental type implements, but these are more durable than toothpicks and more effective than most of the dental tools i've used. plus they are compact and work fast. i wish i'd discovered them a long time ago.
