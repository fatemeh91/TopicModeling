review/text: Vibratex supposedly makes the best stuff, well there must have been a miscommunication on the factory floor. The motor on this is far too weak for its intended purpose and the motor will start to burn up during use. My wife was not too happy. Very dangerous. I am sending this back to Vibratex, this needs to be pulled off the market or the correct type/strength of electric motor needs to be used.
