review/text: My father was first to introduce me to Afta... It's the best after shave on the planet but its getting very hard to find at a lot of chain retail stores that always used to carry it. I have order 3 packs of 6 just to stockpile it. I gave a bottle to my 14 year old son and he loves it! Use it after you shave/shower...it soothes your skin with no burn at all. I use it all over and even put it in my hair instead of gel. Ladies love it!!! If you have never tried this product BUY IT!!! They better not ever stop making this stuff...I'm gonna order another 6 pack right now!!!
