review/text: We bought this thermometer because our other one took forever to take a temperature, and we weren't convinced of it's accuracy. For those reasons we went with this instant read one that goes in the ear.It is instant read taking just one second, and it tells you your temperature. It comes with a white carrying case. The display is large, and it shuts off automatically.It read temps consistently. Interestingly enough, temperature varies between ears. Or at least in my family it does. But the readings were consistent no matter how many times we checked. But I'll have to read the manual to see if it says you are supposed to check one ear over the other.The battery it takes is one of those weird circular kinds, so when it does run out of batteries I'll have to make a special trip somewhere - but that is a pretty minor concern.
