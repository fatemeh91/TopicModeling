review/text: I am not pregnant yet... But Fertilaid has totally helped regulate my cycle. My cycles were anywhere from 26 days to 30 days, so not that crazy. After the first month of fertilaid, I have a perfect 28 day cycle. The pills are not hard to swallow. Taking them three times day, gets old. So hopefully I will get my BFP soon!
