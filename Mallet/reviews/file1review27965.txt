review/text: I purchased 2lb Vanilla Ice Cream from Amazon and I have to say it is pretty good. I have been using it at post workout and seeing good results.I was running low this week and wanting to buy more so I purchased from local Vitamin Shoppe the Double Rick Chocolate that a lot of people here are saying is good (taste wise). Now maybe I'm use to another brands chocolate (MRM) from the past but there is nothing "Double" nor "Rich" about ON chocolate. And no I don't think it's spoiled or bad, just dose not taste that great. It tastes like Vanilla Ice Cream with a very light teaspoon of Nestle's Quick powder thrown in. I was expecting a thick richer chocolate. I think for me I will stick wit Vanilla Ice Cream, I can always add whatever flavor I want when I mix it.One other note... at the local Vitamin Shoppe no matter which flavor 2lb's is $25.99 ($28 w/tax here) which is why I purchased the Double Rich Chocolate there. On amazon Double Rich Chocolate is $30+ and each flavor is a different price. I don't agree with this practice.
