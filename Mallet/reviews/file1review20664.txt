review/text: I think the replacement of the cutting blades is good, but a little pricey considering you already spent close to $200 on the shaver. Also you need to replace about every 4 months with normal use, I think they should last a little longer than that.The foil is good as well but I have dropped my shaver a few times and it has punctionered every time. This is frustrating at this price...However, this is the best facial shaver on the market right now so I guess I am locked in. The power of planned obselesence.......oh well!
