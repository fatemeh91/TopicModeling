review/text: I saw this product in a hospital and when the patient came home all the little bottles they had brought into her room came with her. When a well-meaning nail stylist came to the home to do a manicure the smell from the products was horrific. Two sprays of this stuff and the odor was gone. Amazing. Now I have it in all my bathrooms. (The merchant wasn't so hot - I ordered two bottles but the merchant was out of product and with no notification when the order was placed only delivered the first bottle. Back ordered the other. I've found another supplier).Regardless of the vendor snafu, the product is great and I highly recommend it.
