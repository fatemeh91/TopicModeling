review/text: When buying whey there are two notable criteria to be mindful of: no fructose, which increases insulin resistance, and no soy, which, apart from posing an allergy problem for many also contains estrogenic isoflavones (soy lecithin is a reasonable exception since it's used in minute quantities as an emulsifier, though egg lecithin would be preferable). I placed an order for the Pina Colada flavor upon reading the favorable ingredients list in Amazon's description. Surprise! It contains soybean oil. It's also not eligible for a return, despite being unopened. I feel duped and now I'm out $40. Am I going to wither into the opposite gender from eating soy? No. Should I be able to choose what I put in my body and feel confident that what I'm buying online is representative of the actual item? Hell yes.
