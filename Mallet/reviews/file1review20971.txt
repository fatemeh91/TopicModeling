review/text: The product as received was in desired new condition and works well. The irritating factors in making the purchase were/are ...1)the difficulty in securing this particular model of shaver head in the first place, as the Braun company keeps issuing model after model, and retailers who do actually sell shaver heads have not been stocking parts for the equipment four generations back. I am grateful for the connection with the online retailer through Amazon, and the shipping was accomplished expeditiously.2) I ordered from and received the merchandise at a temporary residence in Alaska -- and the "low-cost/no cost shipping offers disappear when the buyer is not in the "Lower 48." I would prefer that the full set of limitations on "free shipping" offers be more visible, preferably on the first screen on which the offer is presented.
