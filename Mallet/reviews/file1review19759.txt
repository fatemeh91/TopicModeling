review/text: This potty seat is amazing! My two year old son just toilet trained this week. We have the Bjorn toilet and the toilet seat. We took the toilet seat to a baseball game (fits into a backpack) and he used it four times! Now he just wants to use the toilet seat a home. I suggest getting the step stool too, it is very sturdy and makes getting up onto the toilet easier. Great buy! (I am buying another one for grandmas house)
