review/text: I went to great lengths to research this product and make sure that it would fit a particular trash can (Rubbermaid Brut Rollout) and these bags are not wide enough to actually fit the can. We waited over a month to get them and then they are the wrong size. The bag is heavy and clear/frosted and is very deep but they are tall and narrow at the mouth. They are advertised as 38" but that is their diagonal measurement - not the depth or width of the product.
