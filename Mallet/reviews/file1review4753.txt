review/text: I bought this toothbrush for my 3.5 year old. It is much larger than I thought it would be. It is 8" long, and almost 2" wide at its widest part, making it as big or larger than a Braun Oral B adult toothbrush.The brush head is larger than an adult Braun Oral B brush head.In addition, the on switch is very hard for a child to click all the way so that it stays running.I think this brush is better suited for a 5+ year old. My child loves the brush, and it does a good job once its locked in the on position.
