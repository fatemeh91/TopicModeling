review/text: I used to sleep with therapearl masks to help with my sinuses, but they kept popping after I fell asleep with them on and rolled around at night. This is a nice mask that I usually put on before bed and sleep in all night, it is lightweight and easy to clean... best of all... you can't pop it! I am a big fan, though it doesn't stay cold that long, but what eye mask does? I also wear it around my forehead when I have a migraine and the lower part that goes over your sinuses covers my temples on both sides, which is where I get my headaches.. highly recommended!
