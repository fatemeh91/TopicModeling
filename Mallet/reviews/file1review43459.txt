review/text: I own this product for about a month.I got this blood pressure monitor mainly for my parents to monitor their blood pressure. I think every house should have this because high blood pressure is known as the silent killer. Anyway, I love this product. It is highly accurate compared to the manual one I have. I like the fact that it has intellisense. I think it's what makes it more accurate. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is not very easy to set up the time and date. You really have to read the manual to do it. I am just lazy I guess.
