review/text: Why spend all that money on disposable nursing pads? I absolutly loved these because they were comfortable. They stayed in place and did not leak. The only thing that I feel women should be made aware of is that my gyno informed me that it is not good to put these in the dryer. (The washer is ok but not the dryer) This never mattered to me because I washed all mine by hand and air dried them. It was easy enough to wet them, rub them real good on a bar of soap, rinse them, and let them dry.
