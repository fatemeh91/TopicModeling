review/text: I was on this product for a long time and felt great- well, I got on a liquid multivitamin and felt I didn't need this product anymore. I got a kidney stone(If you've never had one, pray you never do), and then I got a cold.So, is this coincidence?? I think not. I am getting back on and STAYING on this product. The taste really isn't that bad- but even if you think it is, it's better than being in the hospital isn't it??I've tried other green products that hide behind "propietary blends" so you don't know what you're getting, and really, nothing has come close to green vibrance.I'm just mad at myself for being so stupid as to getting off this product when it was working so well for me. You know the old saying, "if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it"So, unless you have a PERFECT diet, never ever eat junk or fast food, and drink only highly purified water and lots of it, you need this stuff.And if you have stomach issues, like I do, this product will be a godsend to you.I know there are some people who will knock this product because of the taste, but to be honest- I have a VERY sensitive stomach, and I just mix this in cranberry juice, and I have no issues. It's hard to believe there are people out there who are even more sensitive to taste than I am, but I guess there are.And I've tried other green drinks, and believe me, NONE of them taste like chocolate milkshakes.I would even go so far as to say that if you could only afford one product, this would be it as it has so many things that are good for your body.
