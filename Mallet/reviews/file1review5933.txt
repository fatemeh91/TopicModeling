review/text: I love this shaker! I love the separate compartment for the powder, so I can mix it later. It holds 12 oz and is plenty big for my shakes. I haven't had any leaks at all, while shaking or toting it around, and I haven't had any clumping problems. I also love the option of using the ice wand. This is the only shaker out there like it, and I'm completely satisfied with my purchase!
