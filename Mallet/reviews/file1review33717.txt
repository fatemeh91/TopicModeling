review/text: I have been sampling serums and moisturizers and I find myself comparing whatever I'm trying to this moisturizer every time. Is it better than the Zia one? No? I'll pass. When they say 'oil free' they mean it. This is a super lightweight serum consistency and absorbs immediately. Doesn't leave a film or creamy oily feeling sitting on my skin. The citrusy scent is nice. This is perfect for my combination skin during spring, summer and fall. I do sometimes need a thicker moisturizer during winter, as this will not touch the flakes. The price for this is just fine - I would even pay more for it because its so great. If they could improve on it at all, it would be removing or replacing the parabens in it.
