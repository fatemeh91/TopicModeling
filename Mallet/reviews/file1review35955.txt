review/text: The head of the toothbrush is small and the neck is slim, so it is easy to reach all areas in my mouth. I find the bristles medium-soft. This ionic toothbrush really does work to give me that "clean mouth feeling" after a professional tooth cleaning. Before, brushing teeth was a chore but now it's fun to brush and immediately feel and see the results.I'm really happy I decided to buy an ionic toothbrush. I did as much research as possible to make sure this wasn't some quack product. My teeth became sensitive to cold liquids the next day (too clean? haha) but using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth cured that for me. I'm using the new Sensodyne ProNamel and I do recommend it.
