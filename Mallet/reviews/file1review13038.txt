review/text: I bought this after having used one at the Occupational therapy appointments. It is well-balanced, has great coverage, heats evenly(I haven't tried it chilled). I have a LOT of tension in my neck, pinching nerves which causes paralysis in my arms, and my entire C-spine is degenerated. This definitely gives relief.
