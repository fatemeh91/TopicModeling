review/text: This bath tub is a great idea, but it's made of vinyl, which makes it unsafe for babies & children. Vinyl leaches chemicals into the air which are very dangerous to humans, esp. babies & children. Ever smell that "new shower curtain" smell (you know the one) its a result of chemical off-gassing, releasing phthalates in your home. Phthalates cause endocrine disruption, are linked to asthma,and have developmental and reproductive effects.If you are buying this thinking it offers a safer bath environment for your child, think again!
