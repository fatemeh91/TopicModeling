review/text: I, like a few other folks in the reviews, picked this FungaSoap up for my feet. I noted the smell was a bit like a bathroom cleaner at first, I've grown to be okay with it and when you wash the soap off you smell "clean." I noted on the bottle to use it as a full body wash, and it's definitely awesome for that. I have very sensitive skin and prone to bad breakouts on my shoulders and back, however I noted a large improvement since switching to this. Recommended.
