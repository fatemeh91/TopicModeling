review/text: These insoles offer good padding. I'm an OR nurse on my feet for 8 hours a day and I stuck them in my old tennis shoes at work. They make a nice padding but I don't feel the "workout" qualities that they were boasting. Good sizing. I wear 10 wide shoe (I think work shoes are 8 mens) and the mediums fit fine.
