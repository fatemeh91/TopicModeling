review/text: I have tried a few different protein supplements and this one probably offers the best bang for your buck. I use this stuff daily so I go through a lot of it. At first I was buying the 32 ounce containers of a different brand. I decided to try these because the price was less per ounce. I use the supplement with water in a shaker and this brand mixes really well. It doesn't clump like some others I have tried. It offers a good amount of protein, they almost all offer the same amount. I wasn't too happy with the taste. The artificial sweetener has a bit of an aftertaste. The only flavor I have tried so far is the cookies and cream.Pros: Low price. Mixes well.Cons: Aftertaste.
