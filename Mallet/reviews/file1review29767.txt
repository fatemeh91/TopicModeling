review/text: I have tried Gerber disposables, lansinoh disposables & avent disposables, as well as avent reusables & tommy tippee reusables. Avent is thicker and more absorbent for their disposables and their reusables, although i found that none of the disposables stay in place as well as any of the reusables.
