review/text: I have not had back pain but figured this belt would help me support all the extra weight... I liked the product because it did help support my back but... the one thing that would have made me like it better is if the support band that goes under the belly was wider. It tends to leave a mark right under my belly button that makes me itch once the belt comes off. I am 8 months pregnant but because the baby is big and I am little I measure like I am full term. I have tried loosening the belt but even that only helps for a little while... If I didn't spend so much time sitting at a desk I don't think it would be an issue.
