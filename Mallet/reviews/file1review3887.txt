review/text: Okay I am not going to go over the same moans and complains that you have heard everywhere. The main thing that you should really think about is the fact that if you need deep cleaning all over, then this isn't for you because they really only do the front teeth. There is nothing more gross than seeing someone's front teeth bright white and then they grin and the side ones look gross. It is a weird and creepy effect. Also you have got to put them on straight every time! Otherwise you could have spots that aren't as clean as the others. Yuck! Can you imagine looking like you have a piece of a popcorn hull stuck in your gums forever?! Another important thing is that they will not fit everyone's teeth. I have relatively standard sized teeth, but my husband's are a bit wider, so they didn't cover his teeth the same. Keep this in mind because his teeth are not big. I have seen big ones that they will not cover completely regardless. The main thing that I am sure has been mentioned over and over is pain. Well, don't think that it won't bother you. It will. Some people can take it better than others, but almost all feel some sort of pain and sensitivity afterwards. To me it feels as if a layer of your teeth have been stripped away. You have a sort of raw feeling like you get when you cut yourself, but not deep enough to make it bleed. Well imagine all of your front teeth feeling like that! They are exposed to liquids and foods of all kinds of temperatures. Yikes! This feeling sticks with you for quite a while after this, so if you can afford it, go to the dentist and get the real stuff done. Otherwise be prepared to pay more than the $28.50 for it.
