review/text: I bought two of these for my 86-year-old mother, but I will be returning the product. I liked everything about the product as described, but there was no indication that one lid covered both AM and PM compartments! This would be disastrous for an elderly person trying to dump out the appropriate meds without mixing up the AM and PM doses.
