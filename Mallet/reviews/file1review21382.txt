review/text: Fits my Oral-B S-320 Sonic Complete Rechargeable Power Toothbrush perfectly. Nice firm bristles, color change to let you know when you &#8220;should&#8221; change but I use them for a while after that. Have bought several and all of them fit as they should and no problem with bristles or anything. Found a generic version but with the reviews about not staying correctly on the unit or bristles falling out I didn&#8217;t want to chance it as I knew these are good quality and have never had problems&#8230; not going to mess around with my health. Dentist always compliments how clean I keep my teeth so I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re doing their job.
