review/text: This thing annoys me so much. I came on Amazon to find a different brand. The velcro is incredibly weak. I can not fill the thing up with diapers b/c it can't handle the weight. It is very sloppy looking. It's made of fabric and sags all over. This thing looks nothing like the picture. I do not recommend.
