review/text: We've had this memory foam mattress by All-Sleep since February of this year (2009). By July it had begun to fail - 2 deep wallows where we sleep (130 lbs and 200 lbs). You have to go through a climbing exercise to have both of you cuddling in the middle of the bed. You have to clumb up and out of the bed in the morning.Really unacceptable after 6 to 9 months of use.Called All-Sleep (there website seems completely inoperative) about the 10-year warranty. Hard to find out anything. Appears that to replace the 4" Visco Elastic Memory Foam layer - the layer you sleep on - costs $25 to ship to them - $25 to ship back to us - $100 warranty proration charge for a total cost of $150 (plus packaging) to replace a $400 item that I'm sure we want replaced!!!!!I think this company is deceptive at best and fraudulent at worst.Buyer BE WARE.
