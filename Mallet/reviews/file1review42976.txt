review/text: this is the best cleaner ever. we have all stainless in our kitchen and I was not happy with the cleaners on the market. They are very harsh. this stuff smells good and works great, you only need one spray to clean the whole dishwasher and maybe two on the fridge. I feel it is safe enough to have around food. love it!
