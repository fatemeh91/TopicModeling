review/text: These are made with typical German engineering. Definitely sharper than the drugstore blades I had. They won't cut your face off, so don't worry about that, but you can't get away with the sloppy form you can with plastic cartridge doo dads. I would be happy with these for the rest of my shaving career, but I am tempted to try the Japanese ones that everyone says are so sharp. That is just curiousity. These blades are fine.
