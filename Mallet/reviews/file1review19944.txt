review/text: We originally bought the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty chair as well as another type of potty chair for our then 2 year old daughters. We've had a tough time potty training them (must be something with twins - mine are much more stubborn about it when they have each other as backup). I saw all of the great reviews on this seat, but still hesitated because I was worried about spending $30 on a seat they may refuse to sit on. We finally bought this potty seat when they no longer wanted to use their potty chairs and wanted to sit on the big potty. Since then one of my daughters has made great strides in potty training (still have to work on the other). Both girls know how to put the potty seat on the toilet on their own. I think the fact that they know how to put the seat on and can climb up on their own helps them to feel more in control of using the potty. This seat makes them feel like big girls! Also, we bought the white seat with black trim, so it doesn't look like a complete eyesore in our bathroom. Strongly recommend this potty seat.
