review/text: The Balance chocolate brownie bar with almonds was not the best tasting product out there on the market today. It was heavy and somewhat filling, but very thick, dense, and tasted bland. It really left something to be desired. It was chewy like a brownie and it sort of resembled a brownie, but upon biting into the bar, you just know it's not a brownie. After the first bite, it was kind of hard to eat. It reminded me of these terrible diet cookies that tasted as though they were filled with sawdust. It really needs more taste. Overall, I rated the brownie bar as three stars because I suppose that taste versus nutrition is a tradeoff.
