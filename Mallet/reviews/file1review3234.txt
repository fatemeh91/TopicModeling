review/text: I got these tweezers because I was very happy with my previous tweezerman for many years (but I lost it). When this one arrived it looked just great until I tryed doing my eyebrows. Instead of pulling the hair out, the edges are so sharp that they just pinch the hair off. It has been a great annoyance!!! Only 1 out of every three hairs actually comes out, the rest get pinched off and stay in leaving a short black stump. To even try to pull out the stump again you have to wait till it grows out a bit. Very disapointed!!!!
