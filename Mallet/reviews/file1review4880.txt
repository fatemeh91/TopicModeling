review/text: The brush part of the broom is as pictured. It sweeps really nicely, is light weight and all that. However, the handle is black plastic. Another reviewer said it was hollow aluminum. I expected a modern silver handle and just got cheap looking black plastic. Oh well. It wasn't that expensive I guess. It's odd that the handle is cheap plastic since the bottom brush part is crafted from nice wood and says 'made in USA' on it.
