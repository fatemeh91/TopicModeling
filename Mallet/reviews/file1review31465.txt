review/text: I ordered this Adventure Ultralight/Watertight .9 Medical Kit as an addition to my bug out bags. My bag out bags are for a family of 3. I received it today and am surprised at how small and light it really is. Given I was a trained EMT who carried a fully stocked EMT gear bag, I think I was expecting something a bit more substantial. But I won't count that against them. Plus, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing given that the weight of this kit makes it ideal for hikers or evacuees.The exterior bag (yellow) is made of a very fine plastic which feels a bit flimsy, but is watertight. I would be afraid it would get ripped if it was stored in a compartment with any tools or instruments. (In my case, I have an additional medic compartment to my backpack dedicated solely for medical supplies.) The contents of the bag are zip-locked sealed inside two waterproof bags. There is a bit of spare room in both bags to allow one to personalize this kit by adding a few additional small items. In my case, I will be adding several additional supplies to make it more comprehensive.After sorting through the contents, I am glad to report that none of the items have expired. The earliest expiration date I found was well into the year 2014.Overall, given the price, overall packaging, and weight, I think this is a fantastic kit for basic first-aid. Once I have added a few more items, it will be perfect for my bug out bag!
