review/text: Optimum Nutrition is the only whey I will buy. I have tried other brands, but none of them offer the taste, high protein content and quality that ON does for the price. I have tried TONS of their flavors, but my favorites are: Extreme Milk Chocolate, Double Milk Chocolate, Banana Cream (tastes like banana laffy taffy), Mocha Cappachino and Vanilla Ice Cream. These are all delicious flavors that I can handle in large quantities (as you get when buying 5lbs of the stuff). Bottom line - this stuff tastes great for a great price and will help you reach your fitness goals if used with proper diet and lifting.
