review/text: I needed to buy a new 5x serum and have been getting mine for over 7 years at my doctor&#8217;s office. That no longer was convenient so I searched for one to buy online. This product transitioned perfectly into my routine without any peeling, flaking or redness. It was a seamless switch and the price was lower than my doctor&#8217;s brand. I intend to stick with this retinol!
