review/text: The Crest Whitestrips do reveal good results, but if you drink tea or coffee, you are fighting an uphill battle. Instead of whitening your teeth all at once (although that is a good option at the start) you may want to keep these around for occasional touch ups, important occassions and feel good moods.The strips for upper and lower teeth are easy to use and don't seem to promote as much tooth sensitivity as other whitening procedures (like with the annoying gel). In fact, it almost seems to make your gums more healthy than before.Probably the most pleasant whitening experience on the market with fairly good results. Why the box has a mirror in it, we will never know unless it is useful to see the results of the whitening. It would be difficult to hold the box and put the strips on your teeth.I'd recommend trying these and then keeping a box handy for touch up use. Probably will whiten your teeth one or two shades on the first use.~The Rebecca Review
