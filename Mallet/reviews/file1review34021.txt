review/text: I always knew zippo was the way to go on long lasting lighters, but I always had in the back of my head that it wasnt good quality. Well this lighter has proved me wrong. This lighter is amazing! It is made very well and it is very scratch resistant. I love this lighter and will continue to use it. This lights is fantastic for just about anything! I might just have to pick up a few more to add to my new and starting collection. Great lighter 5/5
