review/text: My vet wanted me to give my dog a fiber supplement since he has soft stools. She originally recommended Metamucil but I had a hard time finding the unflavored variety and I didn't like giving him the extra ingredients. The Psyillium Husk powder is the active ingredient in Metamucil and this has no additives. Purchasing through amazon is also much cheaper.
