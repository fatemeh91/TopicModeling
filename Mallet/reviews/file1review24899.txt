review/text: I was hesitant to try this given the negative reviews, and because I ovulate regularly on my own. I purchased this product hoping to extend the length of my luteal phase, which is typically 10 days. After 4 months of taking as recommended, I didn't see a change in my cycle at all, so I stopped. I do take FertilCM as well and find that very helpful.
