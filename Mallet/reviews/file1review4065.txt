review/text: These are the best blades you can buy. I usually get two months of shaves out of one blade! Bought some here from Hotdealz and went through 8 blades in 5 weeks. After reading some of Hotdealz responses to negative reviews, I saw they get a little touchy when someone cries "counterfeit". I'll refrain from that here. You decide: Normally one blade in 8 weeks. Eight Hotdealz blades in 5 weeks. Hmmm. Not such a hot deal. Let the buyer beware. Stick with a reputable dealer, like Amazon.
