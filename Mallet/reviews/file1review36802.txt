review/text: I am really pleased with this product. I have a bad hip that is facing replacement, hopefully in the near future. I've been struggling with putting a sock on for some time. I would have my husband help me when he was available, but more often than not, struggled by myself. My sister-in-law suggested a sock aide and I checked the reviews for this one on Amazon. I find the Deluxe Sock Aid to be a simple but effective design. I don't have any trouble putting the sock onto the aide. The fabric side "grips" the sock nicely. The straps are long and very sturdy. I simply use the straps to lower the sock covered aid to the floor, slide my foot in and use the straps to pull the aid up as it pulls my sock on. Simple. I use this every day and love it. No pain and no hassle.
