review/text: When my old trimmer broke I looked through the Amazon reviews and decided on this trimmer. I want to thank all those who had previously reviewed this trimmer. I've had it for about two months and it has performed flawlessly. I don't think the guard is flimsy. I don't think the controls are confusing. I do think it holds a charge, has good settings for length, has a great pop-up mustache trimmer. In fact, my only problem with this device is that you have to pull off the guard before you can use the trimmer.
