review/text: I guess that you're supposed to know what "Acesulfame Potassium" is before you buy this. I didn't realize that it was their artificial sweetener before I bought it because this is the FIRST time that I've seen Aspertame listed as "Acesulfame Potassium". Why would anyone want to purchase a health product that has an unhealthy ingredient in it? Total waste of a product and $52. I did get an awesome migraine out of it this morning after tossing some down before I went to work. Maybe that's worth $52 somehow? Nope, not for Toxic GARBAGE.
