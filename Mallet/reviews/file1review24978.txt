review/text: I rarely write reviews but felt it I needed to for this product. I'm 41 years old and my boyfriend and I were trying for about 5 months with no luck. I have a son from a previous marriage and it was no problem conceiving him, however that was 5 years ago and with another man. We got my boyfriends sperm tested and it was ok, not great. 70 million but only 35% swam. My period is irregular which compounded the problem. I meditated on getting pregnant and asked for guidance. I came across these products and ordered them right away. This is what I took: FertilAid for women 3 times a day. FertilAid for men for my bf. He never took it 3 times a day but at least once a day usually twice. I had to remind him to take it. Fertilitea 2 times a day. I also took Pregnitude 2 times a day. ( I recommend this as well and you can order it from the website and it ships via Amazon). The total cost was $100. I stopped exercising except maybe twice a month. I never noticed any changes physically but missed my period around the time it was due. As I said I'm not regular. I took a home pregnancy test and it was positive. I'm so enjoying writing this review. One other thing I did was visualize my baby in vivid detail every day. I also gave thanks for my baby at least 50 times a day. When I went to sleep at night the last thing I thought was thanks for my baby. I went and re-read the reviews (only the positive ones) and visualized myself smiling as I wrote my own successful review about how it got me pregnant. The first thing I did when I woke up was visualize myself pregnant. Was it the FertilAid for women, the fertilitea, the fertilaid for men, the Pregnitude, the visualization? Who cares all I know is it was a winning combination and it worked in 2 weeks! I know it can be a scary road if you're trying to conceive. Have faith and it will happen for you. Good luck ladies!
