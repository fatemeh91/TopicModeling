review/text: it was a nice toy, but won't recommend it being your first toy. it was too big, took me awhile to adapt to the size. and the smell is very strong. it doesn't smell bad, just when you put it in a drawer it makes everything else smell like it. it started to rip at the top of it within 4 months. still satisfied with it, just wish it wasn't as big or strong smell.
