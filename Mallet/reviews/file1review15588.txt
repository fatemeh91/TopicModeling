review/text: No other deodorant I've tried actually works the way this does, they just try to cover up the smell. This one really kills the smell, for days at a time. Depending on how much I'm sweating it works from 5 days to almost 2 weeks with one application. You must follow the directions: Stop using your regular deodorant for 3 days and wash your pits to unclog your pores, then apply this stuff at night. It does become more effective over time. Try it.Worth every penny.
