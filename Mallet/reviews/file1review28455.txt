review/text: I just got my whey protein by ON, the delivery was really fast; I ordered on Sunday afternoon and I received package on Tuesday.I ordered the strawberry flavor, not bad at all, tastes pretty good especially when combined with milk. I have also tried the double rich chocolate from my cousin; taste is good as well. I guess what I am trying to say is that the taste is not horrible at all as many of the other people had stated.Since this is my first time trying this product, I really can not comment in the effects it has on building muscle. I really wish people had focused on that rather than the flavor, so if you recently bought this product and know its benefits, please tells us, but only if you have seen a change in your body.A month from now, if things work (i.e. I see results), I will be buying another tube and writing another review
