review/text: I had this item for 15 years, but the blades got dull. I replaced it with the Sharper Image version which cost twice as much. Worse then being more expensive, it was painfull to use. I returned the Sharper Image version and bought another Panasonic. It's true that the parts don't seem as well made as the one from 15 years ago, but I am back to a pain free experience. I would highly recommend this item.
