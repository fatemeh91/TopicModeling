review/text: This cooler bag is a nice addition to my City Mini. I honestly do not use it very often, I always forget it is there. But it is nice to store cold drinks and food. We used it a lot on vacation. I would bring the stroller down to the pool and store water and lunch in the cooler bag so we didn't have to go back to the room until the day was over :)
