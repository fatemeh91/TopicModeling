review/text: I bought Animal Cuts with the intention of shedding my Summer beer-gut. I already exercise about 5 days a week with heavy weights and moderate cardio. My diet is pretty clean. Animal Cuts was a nice replacement for coffee in the morning -- kept me energized. All in all, I didn't lose much weight - but I didn't have much to lose in the first place. I can tell it's a quality product, and honestly I felt great when taking it. I'm just on that stubborn last 5-10 lbs which is completely unrelated to water weight. The thermogenic helped a bit, but supplements can not replace a clean diet and hard work. If you're about to get back into the gym, Animal Cuts is a great way to kick start your weight loss.
