review/text: This stuff really works. It fills you up, satisfies your protein needs, and is some of the most affordable protein on the market. Highly recommend for those wanting to put on lean muscle mass. Its low carbohydrate content makes it harder to gain weight however so not as effective in that regard. Other than that, tastes great and highly recommend!
