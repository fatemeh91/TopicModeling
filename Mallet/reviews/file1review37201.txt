review/text: The gloves really fit well (I needed an XS and couldn't find it in town). They really feel comfortable for about 2 hours, but then my fingers begin to get achy and I rip them off during the night. I have put Aspercream on my hands about 30 min. before putting them on and it helps a little. I would benefit from wearing them during the day (especially early morning) but it would make my teaching routines harder. I'm going to continue to use them and hopefull increase the time I can keep them on.
