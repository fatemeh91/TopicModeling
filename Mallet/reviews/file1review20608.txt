review/text: I would give this foil/cutter zero stars if possible. I took another reviewers advice and bought the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro/Syncro Replacement Combo and it delivered a very nice shave. This replacement pulled whiskers and was a very bad shave. Braun should be ashamed of themselves for selling such junk.
