review/text: This is a great product for the flu. My husband got sick with the flu last year. He couldn't get out of bed he was running fever and really weak. He had to go to work that night and was planning to call off. I gave him some oscillococcinum. He was up and out of bed in a couple of hours and did make it to work. He couldn't believe it! He countinued to take for 2 days. He swears by the product and he does not get the flu shot doesn't need it with oscill. We have told everyone about this product and how good it works and they have had the same results.
