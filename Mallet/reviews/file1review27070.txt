review/text: Review is about the Rocky Road Flavor.From the 4 different proteins that I have had in the past, this one is by far the best tasting. I have tried Isopure Vanilla, Myofusion Delicious Vanilla, and Banana Perfection. The taste seems more natural, though not perfect, but still pretty close. It doesn't have the creamy texture at all like the above brands.
