review/text: I bought 3mg Melatonin over 5mg (even though they were the same price) strictly because the picture on the site said it didn't come with B6 however it did. Also B6 couldn't be found anywhere else on the ingredients list on the site. B6 is found in energy drinks, for example 5 hour energy and needless to say this product didn't help me sleep any faster!
