review/text: I just bought this mustache and beard trimmer about a month ago to replace my old dirty one. I cannot say its the best i have used but it gets the job done and its cheap. I mainly use to it to shave my beard and it cleans up pretty nicely. The head is adjustable so it doesn't need to be changed constantly. The drawback is that my skin hurts sometimes because of the plastic on the tips..
