review/text: What a great product. When we finally realized what was causing my son's discomfort, we started buying Lactaid milk. But, that only worked at home. At school & on the go, frequent stomacheaches, and potty breaks were a way of life. Then, a neighbor told me about Digestive Advantage for kids (I feel like a commercial). She had just bought a case of it after finding it worked for her daughter. I tried it for my son, and it was amazing. After the first day we noticed a difference. He no longer came home from school and ran to the bathroom. He could drink the milk at the cafeteria. And, the most important thing for him, he could eat pizzeria pizza on pizza day at school and not feel sick. We love it. And, if I ever forget to give it to him before breakfast, he is right there to remind me before he ever drinks his milk. He still remembers what it was like before.
