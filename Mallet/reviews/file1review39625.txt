review/text: I bought this to avoid the disposable flossers. I have a hard time using straight floss because of pain issues so flossers are best for me. I wanted to love this but I had a harder time managing it than floss alone. Let me be clear that this is not the product design or anything, but my hand issues. So I'm giving it 4 stars. It really is a great little product and I'd be using it if my painful hands allowed me to. Definitely give it a try!
