review/text: I've been using this product for several years. It is a 'Perfect' way to get all your vegetables in one serving. Some people have trouble with the taste/look (tastes and looks like liquid spinach) but it is well worth it. Suggestions: use a blender and put it in a strong tasting juice like cranberry. I actually incorporate it with a protein shake I make and it works fine. It energizes and feeds your body on a cellular level. Your body will thank you!
