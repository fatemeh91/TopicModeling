review/text: Like many others, I tried Athletic Greens because of Tim Ferris' book, &#34;The Four Hour Body&#34;. While AG does taste pretty good, the cost and marketing scheme left me underwhelmed. After reading a bunch of reviews, Green Vibrance seemed to be the next best choice,even though it receives low marks for taste. I had been using Fiber On The Go (Citrus Puhch) packets as a prebiotic and decided to add one to my Green Vibrance drink. Wow. In a word, the combination tastes awesome. Fiber on the go &#34;is sweetened with natural Stevia extract. It contains no sugar, and no aspartame or other artificial sweetener. As a natural prebiotic, the inulin contained in Fiber On The Go nourishes good bacteria in the digestive tract.&#34;
