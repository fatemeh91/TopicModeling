review/text: I've tried many different brands of condoms through the years, ranging from Trojan, Durex and Lifestyles. Trojans, by far, were the worst because they never felt right and smelled absolutely terrible. I'm convinced they use the cheapest latex they can find. Durex and Lifestyles condoms were good brands and felt much better, but I wanted to try out some of the Japanese brands I saw floating around the market. A couple of years ago, I decided to try out one of Okamoto's Beyond Seven condoms (the studded version). While I found them to be on the snug side, they were thin and transferred body heat well. The best part was, they had almost no latex smell whatsoever! I decided later to try out the main line of Crown condoms. I found out that these are the pink condoms used in JAV (Japanese Adult Video). I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Needless to say, my woman and I were handsomely rewarded by this particular purchase. These were the thinnest and most sensitive condoms I've ever used. They also had virtually no latex scent. With just enough lubrication, it really does feel like you have nothing on. These also can be on the snug side, but I don't really have any problems with them (again, good lube goes a long way). Bottom line, you owe it to yourself and your partner to give these condoms a try.
