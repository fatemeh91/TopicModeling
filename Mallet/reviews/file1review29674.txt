review/text: Love these pads. Was sceptical at first because of the lace on one side, but they are less visible through a shirt than ones without lace on the outside. They ar small, yet absorbant. I have had them leak but only when they got really wet. I like that there are 3 pair, but if you order them you might want to order 2 sets. Don't forget to use the included back when you wash them, they tend to get lost in pants legs and in the washing machine abys.
