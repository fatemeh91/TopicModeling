review/text: I've used SlimFast for years. It works and it tastes great. Strawberry flavor a bit harder to find so Amazon best place to purchase. I like the chocolate and strawberry. I compared this to Special K shakes (plastic bottles) with SlimFast (cans) and it has the same amount of protein but Slim Fast is considerably. If you purchase in this form and make your own it's even cheaper. Great buy for the money.
