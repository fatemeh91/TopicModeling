review/text: Benefiber is the best fiber product I have ever used. I have been plagued with a serious case of Irritable Bowel Syndrone (IBS) for nearly 25 years. Since, I have used benefiber for the last two months I am free of any IBS symptoms. I usually drink plenty of water, so that might contribute to my success with this product.
