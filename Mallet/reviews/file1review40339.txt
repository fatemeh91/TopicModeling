review/text: It's so hard to tell if herbal products really work or not. The difference in your condition will not be remarkable with most herbal products but it's worth a try to help your immune system when coming down with a cold. I've heard on the news several times that Echinacea is not effect in preventing colds which is the primary ingredient in this herb defense product. I was relying more on the lesser ingredient Elderberry which I've heard really great things about.My son got a cold so I started taking the Gaia Herbs Quick Defense, it did seem to help. I did get sick but I would feel better after I would take a dose and I didn't get "that" sick. So the verdict: I would try Gaia Herbs Quick Defense. During cold season, I think it couldn't hurt to do all we can do for our immune system. It's really hard to prove one way or another whether this herb defense helped my immune system.
