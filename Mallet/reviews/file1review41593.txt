review/text: I got this when it was over $100. I will say it is worth it. I've had several Oral-B's before, one for the road and one battery-powered (7000, I think), for home. While this does little more than brush your teeth, I like that it is rechargeable, as trying to get batteries inserted into my old brush is a nightmare (requires three hands, or maybe pliers).What really got me to like this toothbrush is that it let you know when you have spent long enough time on each quadrant. It gave me an incentive to brush my teeth at least twice a day, as I knew that I spent long enough time everywhere. It was a bit confusing to figure out how this worked, thought. It has a timer that counts down (or up, I forget, never have to look any more), and I expected it to beep, which it didn't. It sort of halts its rhythm for a couple of beats, and that is the cue to move to another part of the mouth. At first I thought it was that I was pushing to hard against my teeth, but that was not it, as I soon found out.It also has a nice curve that makes it easier to reach to the back of the mouth, and it sits well in the hand. I am not sure it is worth the money, but I am still glad I have mine.
