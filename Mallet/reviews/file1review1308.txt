review/text: I have had problems with my feet for many years. I have visited a Podiatrist once a month to have calluses removed. I just changed to a different Podiatrist and he suggested I use the shower foot file. I am amazed with the results. I no longer have to see him every month. This file really works. I use it everyday in the shower. It is so easy to use. The results are much better then using a pumice stone. I am buying this as a gift for my mother and daughter. It is a great product.
