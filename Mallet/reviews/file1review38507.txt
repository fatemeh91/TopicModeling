review/text: After owning an Epilady for 5 years, I was hesitant to try a new brand. However, after receiving this product, I am glad I switched. This product performs outstanding and the curved head is a plus. The only thing that I need to mention, is that this epilator is not cordless, something that was a plus on the epilady. However, that was an oversight on my reading the description of the item. A great product at a great price. I am a satisfied customer and have recommended this product to others.
