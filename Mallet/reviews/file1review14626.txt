review/text: Out of all of the sugar substitutes I've tried, and I've tried them all. this one is the best.It feels like sugar, it acts like sugar, and it tastes like sugar. There is no aftertaste, and best of all, unlike all the others, there are no side effects. It is also safer than the other sugar substitutes, according to my doctor.It all natural, made from Birch Bark and is rumored to have some health benefits, such as, it metabolizes in the body without using insulin making it an excellent choice for diabetes patients. It it also rumored to build immunity, protect against chronic degenerative disease and has anti-ageing benefits and is an antimicrobial, preventing the growth of bacteria.Unlike the poison, Aspartame, and other artificial sweeteners, Xylitol is actually good for you. I highly recommend it over all other sweeteners.
