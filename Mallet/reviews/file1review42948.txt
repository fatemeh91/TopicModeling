review/text: I've been transitioning most of my cleaning products to more eco-friendly brands and I needed something for scrubbing the shower and tile. Some of the Mrs Meyer's scents get bad reviews for just... smelling bad but I have yet to encounter a mildly unpleasant scent and I use various products in the geranium, basil, and lavender. I'm not crazy about lemon verbena to begin with so I may just not like a product scented with it, but I doubt it would be terrible given that these products are very light and fairly natural ingredient-wise.That said, I'm really happy with the effectiveness of this scrub. I also now use it on my kitchen sink (stainless steel) and other similar surfaces like the front of the fridge and dishwasher. It keeps them sparkling and shiny. It makes me wonder if the ingredients are similar to Barkeeper's Friend, with some additional cleaning components. I suppose baking soda and some good scrubbing might do the same job but I love the light, subtle scent in my kitchen after I use this and it rinses off easily. I've also actually cleaned a few heavy old mirrors with it and they come out sparkling and without a scratch. No streaks. It's a gentle, effective, environmentally friendly product that also smells wonderful - perfect!
