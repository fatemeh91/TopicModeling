review/text: Based on high ratings/reviews of the product, I purchased the Babybjorn white/blue trainer for my two (3 & 6 yr old) boys. In a nutshell, I would *not* advice parents with boys to purchase this seat. The biggest problem I have is the front shield is too low. Almost always, the babybjorn ring, toilet seat and the bathroom floor have pee all over by the time the boys are done doing their business. This product is not a unisex product.
