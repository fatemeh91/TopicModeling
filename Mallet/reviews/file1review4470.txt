review/text: I've been using Gillette Fusion razor blades since just after they were released. They are miles better than the old Mach3 blades.With my beard, I can get about 3 weeks out of a blade before I need to replace it. I've also tried the Fusion Power blades. They lasted a little longer... but I didn't feel the performance was enough to justify their additional cost.Speaking of cost... man are these blades expensive! My advice - use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program and buy the best per blade deal. It's not like they're going to go bad before you use them!
