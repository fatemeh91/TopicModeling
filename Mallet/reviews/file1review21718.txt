review/text: I was hoping this would be a good transition tub for my 6 month old who is growing out of the tub that fits in the sink.If you are in the same situation, I caution you with this purchase -1) It reeks like plastic and has for weeks.2) it is dangerously slippery. My son can sit up very securely, however he immediately slid. I even bought a tub mat insert to try, and he still slipped.3) It barely fits into our tub.
