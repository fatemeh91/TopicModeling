review/text: When our daughter first started potty training, we bought one of the less expensive character covered potty seats. However, out toilet is elongated and the cheaper seat did not fit flush and always wobbled. Our daughter couldn't get on and off the potty by herself because the seat would always move as she was trying to sit down. It was clear that our daughter felt very unsteady and uncomfortable on it, and frankly it set back out potty training efforts.Flash forward, my husband shows me the Baby Bjorn seat one day while we were walking through a local baby retailer. I first I thought "$30 for a toilet seat!?! Seriously." Well folks, it was $30 well spent! Not only is this seat fashioned to fit elongated toilets without the gaps, but the rear dial truly allows you to get a snug and secure fit. My daughter is clearly more confident both getting on and off the toilet and while sitting on this seat.I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone toilet training a young child!
