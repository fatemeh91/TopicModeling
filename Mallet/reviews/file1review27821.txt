review/text: Not much to say about this whey protein other than it tastes great and mixes easily. I can't speak much for the other flavors but this one isn't hard to get down. I only use mixer cups and never have had an issue with getting this to dissolve using one of those cups. I find it hard to want to take a risk and try other brands/flavors when I know this one is as good as it is. If you're on the fence about this I say pick up the smallest size available and give it a try, at worst you have a small amount of protein to get through. But if you've tried a bunch of different kinds looking for one that meets your needs, I can promise you that you've had worse than this one.
