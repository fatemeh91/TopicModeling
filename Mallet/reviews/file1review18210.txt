review/text: This sleeping mask can definitely make a nap during the day a much better experience. Despite the brightness of the room, it can easily block out the light. In addition, the concavity of the mask allows you to open your eyes even with the mask on. My only gripe is that the mask still allows some light in around the nose. The strap didn't bother me at all and felt comfortable. Overall, the product is great for sleeping in a bright environment.
