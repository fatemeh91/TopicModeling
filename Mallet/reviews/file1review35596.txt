review/text: I just rec'd this and attempted installation. This definitely was not made to fit my Kohler Cimmaron elevated toilet. This must be designed for older model toilets that are of normal height only. First, my toilet does not have an opening between the seat and the toilet bowl -- there is a plastic plate there -- so the bracket for installation cannot slip in between the toilet seat and the bowl. So, we had to remove the bracket (against the recommendation of the installation instructions). Then, as MANY reviews on the internet state...the legs wobble and do not sit flush on the floor -- especially if you are trying to install it on an ADA height toilet (16 inches or greater). So, we removed one of the padded cushions on each arm which allowed the legs to be extended to the floor -- it barely sits on the floor now. There is quite a bit of the seat that fits into the toilet bowl, so it should not come up when rising off the seat to get up after use. BUT, my elderly, overweight mother has not used it yet, so we will see. BUYER BEWARE: this will NOT fit an elevated toilet and do your research on the internet before purchase -- the internet reviews are not as good as the ones on Amazon. Also, the width between the hand rails is 19 3/4 inches -- so if the person is wider than that, it will be too small. THIS PRODUCT CANNOT BE RETURNED, so please make sure it will work for you before purchasing!!
