review/text: I bought this for my brother and he said that this is one of the best shaving creams that he has ever used, He used an almond size worth of shaving cream and it could have lasted him 10 lathers. It was very smooth and easy for him to shave using this cream. The smell is great too! Not overpowering in the least.
