review/text: Update/Edit: I am giving this 4 stars now instead of 2. We completed the product and have repurchased it. My entire family came down with a bug which caused the cramping that I felt in my earlier response, so I decided to update my review because it was unfair. Both my husband and I have seen an overall increase in energy, regularity, and we have noticed that our skin is no longer dry, we have experienced minor weight loss, and oddly, I am experiencing less sensitivity during tooth brushing. I am giving this 4/5 because of price.Original review:I purchased this product to supplement my vitamin regimen after reading all of the excellent reviews online. Since giving birth to my second child 20 months ago my energy level has been down. My husband is also a former football player, now a carpenter, who struggles with shoulder and knee pain. We have been on this supplement for a little over two weeks but we have not noticed any muscle pain relief or energy improvement. In fact, I have experienced cramping from supplementing this. Because this supplement is so pricey we are finishing it - However unless one of us sees some improvement we are unlikely to repurchase this product. I am giving this a 2 because it does help with regularity but many, more affordable products help as well.
