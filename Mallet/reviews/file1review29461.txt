review/text: These are great natural mints that don't have the saccharin, Nutrasweet, Aspartame or Sugar that is found in so many other brands.My dentist recommended a natural mint such as this to give to my kids to correct the Ph balance in their mouth after having a sugar treat - since it's impossible to get them to brush each time they snack. My kids love these mints as do I. After years of not being able to have a mint due to the tooth decaying sugars they either contained or Nutrasweet, to which I am allergic - I am pleased to find these fantastic mints!
