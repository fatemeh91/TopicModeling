review/text: I bought this pad for its larger size. I haven't seen any other brands with 34" length -- those extra inches are really nice for a toddler! However the plastic material tears soooo easily. My last pad (diff't manuf.) held up for 16 months before developing one small tear. This one developed its first tear in the first week and 3 months later it is riddled with big tears. We're so careful when changing our LO and don't wear any rings or bracelets which might snag on the pad, but nonetheless it tears. We now have to buy another smaller one as this one is no longer useable after 3 short months.
