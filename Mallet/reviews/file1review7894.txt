review/text: Okay so I decided to give waxing a try since shaving doesn't last and epilating ( I probably didn't spell that right) just wasn't my thing, and I can honestly say I HATED IT! Maybe it was just the product but the wax is SUPER messy and it pulls more on skin than hair! I mean you'll wax an area on your leg and u'll go through some pain and remove barley any hair at all. The wax doesn't stay heated long so by the time u finish waxing half of one leg u need to reheat it -_-. I do have to say that the sent is really pleasant but thats not enough of a reason for anyone to buy it. Maybe i'll try a different product for waxing but I must say this one is AWFUL!!
