review/text: My 7 year old was coming home from school smelling like BO. I let her use deodorant but wanted a natural alternative and found this all the reviews were great. This smells like roses and I also bought the sage which smells great I even use it too sometimes, But I still need an antiperspirant. Last a long time too. Worth it.
