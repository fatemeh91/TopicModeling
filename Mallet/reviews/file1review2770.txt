review/text: this is not quite as slippery as astroglide but it doesn't get dry and it stays alot more where you put it, and works just as good or better. the one thing w/ this is it says you can use a few drops but i find most girls need more than that, theres only i girl i used this w/ that was ok w/ a few drops. i mean maybe for frontdoor sex you can use a few drops but i never use lube for that, but for backdoor, deff. use some more. and my girl says this is much less messy after we're done than some of the other big name lubes.
