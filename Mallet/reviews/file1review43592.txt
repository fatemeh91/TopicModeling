review/text: This product is very easy to use...however my BP readings were 30 points higher than at my Dr's office. I took it in to compare to their readings, we took my BP 4 times-twice with the Omron and twice with their cuff, on the same arm, and the Omron readings were much higher both times.I think this is dangerous and I am returning the product.
