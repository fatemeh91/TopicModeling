review/text: I give this blade 3 stars because it does an OK job, and is certainly better than some blades out there. And for some shavers, it is an excellent blade, so if this is your go-to blade don't be put off by my comments. But the truth is, there are a few other blades out there that will work better in your Merkur razor than the stock Merkur blade. Blades such as Personnas, Derbys (also sold on Amazon), Gillettes, and Feathers will generally do a better job in a Merkur. I only post this info because I own several Merkurs and have never found the Merkur blade to yield a good shave. YMMV, of course.
