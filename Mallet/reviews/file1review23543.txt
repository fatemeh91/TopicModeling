review/text: Don't understand why Febreze no longer makes this. It's a delicious scent and I've had so many people ask me for the name. It's spicy so if you don't like ginger, sandalwood, etc it won't appeal to you. In a small, closed area it might be too much but our home is fairly open and it's perfect. Now to resume my hunt for more of it...
