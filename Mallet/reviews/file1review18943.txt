review/text: Good but a bit bulky. Does what it's supposed to do and probably the best commonly found knee brace available. Still it's bulky and needs to be washed often (after removing the metal hinges each time and then reinserting once done) to avoid smelling.Hopefully more light weight design and materials will be available soon but this product is good overall.
