review/text: Coming from using the Electrasol Tabs, this detergent leaves many more bits of food stuck to the dishes and seems to be leaving my dishes looking visibly dirtier as time progresses. I find that to get the dishes to come out of the dishwasher looking anywhere close to clean, I have to pre-rinse them to nearly the point of hand-washing which, of course, defeats the purpose of having a dishwasher. Additionally, the increased hand-washing uses much more water which is not environmentally friendly. On the plus side, the scent is great.
