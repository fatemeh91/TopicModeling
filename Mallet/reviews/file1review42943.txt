review/text: I really like the smell of this product. Works well in my white tub and sink. However, in my kitchen sink and counters, I found it kind of difficult to remove the residual powder. It took me quite some time to rid my counter tops of the white powder. On the plus side, they smell wonderful. I plan to mostly use this product in the bathroom where the hardware is mostly white.
