review/text: If you aren't very good with syringes, this is a very good tool to have. I'm not sure how I would have felt if I didn't use these for a while before my first practical test in nursing school. The magnifiers are really excellent for people like me who might not be as dextrous as they want to be with a syringe. They were good for my needs, so I like them. Would I recommend them? Yes!
