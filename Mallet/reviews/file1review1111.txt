review/text: I bought a pair of Futuro tennis elbow supports because I'd recently started to have some pain in my elbows and forearms. They arrived one day before I had to help a friend move, and they made a huge difference! I was able to lift and grab with little to no pain. I've even slept with one on and felt some relief the next morning. My tennis elbow pain is gone now, but I use the still supports when doing any heavy lifting or grabbing. The material of the strap is soft and is relatively easy to adjust and tighten.
