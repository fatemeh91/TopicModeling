review/text: After being shocked at the price of these refills in the local drugstore I was glad to find them on Amazon for basically half the price. I bought two packages to take advantage of free shipping so it was like getting 6 heads for the price of 3. They were exactly what I needed for my Oral B Vitality Sonic toothbrush, Type 3709. They even arrived faster than expected.
