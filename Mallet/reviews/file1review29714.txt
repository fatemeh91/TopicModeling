review/text: I really wanted to like this product. I wanted to avoid using disposable pads and purchased these pads based on the positive reviews of this product. I was totally disappointed. The pads are thick. They are so thick that they are so indiscrete when wearing them under shirts that aren't totally baggy. They're not that absorbant either. I would wake up at night soaked and be fearful all day long that I was leaking through my shirt. After a few weeks, I gave up and switched to disposable pads and I am much happier.
