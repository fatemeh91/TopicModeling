review/text: I took the tea in the evening and actually woke up in the night having to use the restroom. It works! A word of warning, though: you may want to start with 1/2 a cup instead of a whole because it can really cause a lot of cramping if you're sensitive at all. It tastes good, too, if you like tea.
