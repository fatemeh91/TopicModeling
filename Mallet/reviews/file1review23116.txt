review/text: I almost never write reviews unless I feel strongly about something. This is one of those times.It picks up little bits and pieces off of my cowhide rug! BUT....the handle is VERY poorly designed! The three parts do not lock into place and disconnect every few passes. Totally fixable with some electrical tape, but you shouldn't have to doctor brand new purchases for it to function as it should in the first place.
