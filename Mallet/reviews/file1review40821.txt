review/text: I hated shaving anywhere on my body. I would always nick my legs and really hated shaving. Intuition razor has made me WANT to shave. I LOVE IT!!! It makes me want to sing in the shower and I really enjoy that it actually lathers and moisturizes as I shave. My skin is smooth and red bumps are no longer a burden. I truly appreciate that the Intuition razor does what it advertises and I am SO glad it was invented. The price for the blades are a bit expensive but it is sooo worth it!!
