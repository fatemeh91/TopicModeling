review/text: I put like 1 and a half scoops in a glass of milk and it tastes good. This product is very helpful for my protein needs. I'm just a little worried about all that aspartame and artificial sweeteners. I'd gladly drink it without that stuff even if it tasted bad because if you have the discipline to work hard you should have it for eating healthy.
