review/text: I received a free sample so I gave it a try and have been using it for about two months. It is expensive compared to twin-blade razors, but the five-blade shaving heads last longer. The blades are available from a variety of sources ranging from local supermarkets and drugstores to Internet sources, so shop around for the best price.I found that this razor gives a smoother shave than the older twin-blade razors, and the flat five-blade surface has less tendency to cause nicks. The trimmer blade on the back side is convenient - something that was missing on the twin-blade razors.It is worth spending a few bucks to give it a try. I will probably stick with it.
