review/text: Please, please can we have a "no-star" rating on Amazon, because this piece of cr-p does not merit the single star that I am obliged to award it if I wish to post this review? Bought this item from Amazon about a year ago, and have been giving it the benefit of the doubt until now, but why bother? Have just spent 20 minutes of my time trimming a shortish (about 1.5" long) beard. This is ludicrous! My old, basic Remington clippers, which I was dumb enough to throw away when I acquired this item, would have handled the job in less than three minutes. Unlike this model, it would also have done a decent job of trimming my beard! If this item ever reappears on Amazon, shun it like the plague! In the meantime, suggest you approach any similar Norelco product with extreme caution.
