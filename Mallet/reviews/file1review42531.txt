review/text: For the price point you can't beat this Protein. I have had better tasting and mixing products but for those of us who are consuming over 3 scoops per day, price has to be a consideration. I am unsure how other users can rate it's effectiveness, from one protein powder to the next I can never tell the difference. 4 Stars
