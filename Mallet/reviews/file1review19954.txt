review/text: This seat fits my toilet beautifully and only wished I bought it from the get go. Nice quality seat, smooth and easy to clean, and fits my elongated toilet seat perfectly (due to the adjustability of the seat). Most importantly, my son is very comfortable using it and no longer fears the seat moving on him and now is getting on and off the potty by himself. Dramatic change in just 2 days of getting the seat. Worth every penny in my book!
