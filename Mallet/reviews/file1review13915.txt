review/text: After seeing the low price and free shipping, I figured I'd give this a try. Shipping was super fast and it was very easy to assemble. The plastic seems very sturdy, other reviews said the plastic broke but I am sure they must've been using it wrong because I they fit right in and pull out with a little tug.Overall, I'm happy with this product because it feels really nice, but my family has nicknamed it the "dildo head massager" because the vibrating part looks like a sex toy.
