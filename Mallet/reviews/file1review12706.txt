review/text: I could not even put my feet in the stockings. They are absolutely worthless unless you have a trained person to put them on you and take them off. I wanted them for circulation problems. This did not work at all, since I could not even get them on at all. They are not good for elderly persons, as elderly persons do not have the strength to stretch the stockings onto their feet or legs. The stockings were entirely too tight for my purposes. Jobst have said no return on the items. I haven't put them on since I could not stretch them with my hands in order to put them on my feet or legs. I am totally disheartened by this whole episode. They have been totally unused, not even tried on, as they were too tight.
