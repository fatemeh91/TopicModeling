review/text: I bought this product because it was the highest rated amongst the green drink powders on amazon.Firstly I will say that the taste is horrible, and with products like this that is expected and acceptable, but this one seems to be particularly bad.Secondly I will say that it does not seem to be affecting me in the way that other products have, the powder itself is more of a dull grey than a vibrant and healthy green, nor does the powder stain a dark green like others I have had. Overall after 2 weeks of consistant use I have experienced no increase in energy or any other benefit.Instead of leaving with a negative review saying how I like other products better without mentioning them like others often do, I will recommend to you NitroGreens by Biotics Research, it is a much better product. Hope this review was helpful to you.
