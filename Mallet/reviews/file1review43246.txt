review/text: I bought the Banana Cream flavor and it was delicious, I use it with Special K Meal Bars and Protein Shake. Ultramet for lunch and Special K for dinner, worked great. This formula gets you stuffed, I love it cold. Tastes just like an ice cream shop shake, not only is it very good but it's good for you.
