review/text: I was desperate for help for two of my cats, both of which were leaving blood-tinged puddles around the house. Like so many others, I didn't have money to take them to a vet, and in past experiences didn't have much success with treatment from a vet. I ordered this product and followed the directions, and it seems to have done the trick. One cat had a bit of a relapse but seems to be OK now. My only negative comment is regarding the dosage - it's very vague, calling for a "large pinch" or a "small pinch" of the product. I do believe that switching their food to the "Special Diet" canned food, mixed with water, also helped a lot. No more dry food for my cats.
