review/text: I have a toddler, and instead of dragging the vacuum out all the time, I can easily sweep up crumbs with this sweeper. Such a time saver! Seems to pick up a fair amount of cat fur, although I didn't buy it for that purpose. The only problem I have is that the brush comes within 1.5" of the edges and 3-4" of the front/back, so it isn't good to clean along edges. Lays down flat to get under the sofa too!
