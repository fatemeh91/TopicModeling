review/text: Whether an incontinent, special needs individual or a child whose 'not quite there yet' with their nighttime toileting, these pads are something you have to have; if not for the time, energy, and money you save from having to change bedding all the time - then for the sanity you will save from having to change the bedding all the time. I keep several in case we have more than one accident overnight. They do shift if the person lying on them is a 'mover and shaker' while in bed, that's another reason I have more than one - I layer them all over the bed. They are comfortable to lie on and they are completely waterproof, even up to the edge. I cannot recommend these bed protectors enough!
