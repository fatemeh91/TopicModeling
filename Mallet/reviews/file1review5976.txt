review/text: I read many reviews for this type of product & was convinced by one of them from a nurse. EVERY time I have tried this I get a different reading, even back to back readings. Talking to my doctor, he said that was totally possible. But when I told him the variance between readings, he said that there should not be that wide of a variance. Another disappointment is CLEARLY marked on the box: "STOP!! Please Read Before Opening: Due to the nature of this product, product that has been worn or used cannot be returned to the place of purchase." How are you supposed to try it without wearing it? It goes around your wrist, no bodily fluids contact it, what makes that non-returnable? Clothing that does not fit can be returned. This is the first time I have felt compelled enough to write a review on the countless number of things that I have purchased on Amazon.com, but I really feel like I have been sold a piece of junk!
