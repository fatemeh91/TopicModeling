review/text: I ordered three of these for my mother who has severe incontinence which leaks through diapers and these have been through the mill. I rotate them but each one is washed on sanitize cycle and dried on hot at least once every 3 days and ocassionally bleached if a fecal accident which does ocassionally occur. I am impressed. Unlike others we have bought they did not shrink in a differential manner and lay flat without separation of the bottom material. I am sure they will wear out but so far going strong.
