review/text: I had some annoying pain that my dentist said could only be caused by the state of my gums. (Which wasn't so bad, but apparently I'm really sensitive to the state of my mouth.)So, after nearly 60 years, I'm finally flossing, in self-defense. Tried it with fingers, remembered why I'd never done it for more than a few days before quitting. Ordered this. Works great - I happened to have a cleaning coming up after the visit where I complained of the pain, and the tech said my gumline was way better after only three weeks of flossing with this implement.Not the most convenient or enjoyable thing to use, but a lot better than sticking my fingers in my mouth!
