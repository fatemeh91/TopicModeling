review/text: This scale really is quite poor. I find myself taking an average of 3-4 weighings each time I use it as it varies by as much as 1 Kg. It is neither attractive in appearance, accurate, nor consistent; and for this price it has no redeeming factor whatsoever.I would definitely recommend against this purchase. I am considering purchasing the Ozeri ZB13 scale to replace this one, as it has MUCH better reviews. Or if other stats beside weight are important to you, consider the Omron HBF500 series for a few bucks more. Note, that I haven't had experience with either of these, but they received excellent reviews on Amazon.
