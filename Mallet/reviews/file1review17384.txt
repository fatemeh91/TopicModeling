review/text: I would have to say that the Remington mb-200 does what its supposed to. You have 8 various settings which is more than enough to choose from. Didnt like the cheap plastic of which its made from, but that doesnt bother me as much as long as it serves its purposes, which it has been doing (so I'm very satisfied). Didnt have any problems charging/cleaning the trimmer, thus far.
