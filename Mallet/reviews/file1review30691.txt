review/text: I admit, I used to use those multi-bladed razors. I just didn't know any better. I came across a few articles on shaving with a safety razor and thought I would give it a shot. I love it!! Much better of a shave then the newer cartridge types!! Just take your time, rushing will lead to irritation and possibly cuts!
