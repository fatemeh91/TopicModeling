review/text: I bought this kit thinking it was a good deal, but that turned out to not be the case. The mat after just a few weeks of use is no longer sticky and it came with a few nicks in it. I fixed the nicks with tape and I thought oh that's not so bad, but then I slid down the mat doing downward dog and hurt my shoulder, ouch! I would say buy everything separate and save yourself the pain. The blocks and the strap are good just not the mat. My old mat I had for 10 years before it finally lost it's stickiness. It cost me $20. What a deal.
