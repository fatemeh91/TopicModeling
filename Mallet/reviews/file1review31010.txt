review/text: I started taking these for pain in the center thumb joint. It had been continuning for about 2 weeks. Since I had taken Glucosamine and Chondroitin for severe and persistant hip pain about 10 years ago with very good results, I decided that would be the way to go.I have been taking these pills a little over 2 weeks now and am already seeing some relief in pain. I like the fact that they only require 2 pills a day. I wish that they were gel caps, because these "Easy To Swallow Coated Caplets", are not that easy to swallow. Since they are working so well however, I will continue to take them.Update: I have been using these pills for almost 2 months and they are really doing their job. I no longer have the pain in my thumb and the minor pain in other joints seems to have gone away.
