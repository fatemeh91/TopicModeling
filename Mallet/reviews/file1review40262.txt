review/text: Picked these up at the supermarket because I wasn't satisfied with the Finish pacs I tried. With Cascade, I have been able to get my dishes clean, including the greasy ones, with just one pass on the normal cycle. And the dishes are noticeably more "sparkly" that the Finish ones. I am extremely pleased.
