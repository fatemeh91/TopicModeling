review/text: As a Gillette Mach 3 owner, I decided to give the new Fusion a try. Much to my surprise, this new shaver is hands down better than the previous model. Cuts better, smoother and the five blades result in a faster shave. Unlike the Schick Quattro, the Fusion is very easy to clean after use.
