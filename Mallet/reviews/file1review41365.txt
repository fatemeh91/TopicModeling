review/text: Those of you who are using orthotics / arch supports probably already know that it's a very personal thing -- the support has to be not too high, not too low, and in the right place on the foot. For me, these are just about perfect.I also like that they are 3/4 length and relatively slender so that I can use them in a range of shoe types. (In contrast, I tried some of the full length Superfeet insoles, and they were too long to fit in my shoes, and the arch was misplaced. So, even within a brand, you just have to try them and see.)By the way, my MD recommended the brand to me. She says some brands are too soft and don't really do what they are supposed to do, but these are good. So, for what it's worth, the brand is "doctor recommended"!
