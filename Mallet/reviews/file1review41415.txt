review/text: I like bioplex wpi its the best. it mixes very easy (i use a blender). after the gym i use 3-5 scoops with about 10-12 oz of water which equals 100 grams of protein.(20 grams protein a scoop) sick! it dont tastes the best but not the worst i mean, i drink it cause its good for you. dont believe me that its the cleanest protein out there? read the back whats in it. another plus is the scoop size, 22g not b.s. like isopure which is like 60 something grams per scoops.do the math. the guy that rated it a 1, probably works for b.s.n. lol. serious
