review/text: I was so happy to find Mentadent Toothpaste on Amazon.com. I used to use this toothpaste all the time. I am allergic to an ingredient in many toothpastes. However, I never had any problem with Mentadent. It never bothered my mouth. Also after using Mentadent Toothpaste, my teeth felt like I had a professional cleaning at my Dentist's Office. A couple of years ago, I began having problems finding Mentadent Toothpaste on the grocery and drug store shelves. I even made several telephone calls to stores that I did not visit to see whether they carried it. I could not locate anyone in Johnson City TN who carried it. Then I thought to try Amazon.com. I AM SO GLAD I DID. I even paid less for it on Amazon.com than I had been paying for it in stores! Thank you, Amazon.com. You have made my mouth very happy!
