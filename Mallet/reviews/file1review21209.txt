review/text: I had a lot of pain in a tooth that has a silver filling. I bought this toothpaste and the pain has gone completely away. This toothpaste is wonderful. I gave a new tube of it to a co-worker that could not afford to go to the dentist and he came back and said that his dental problem also disappeared. I think that the tea tree oil may be fixing things because it has healing properties. Whatever the reason, I also love the taste and feel of this toothpaste. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a better product at a low price. You definitely get more for the money than you would ever believe.
