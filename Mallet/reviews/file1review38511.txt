review/text: I have really long eyelashes. And besides lipgloss and eyeliner, my other essential item is my eyelash curler. I thought this product sounded like a great little invention. HEAT of course should set and curl your lashes all day. But after opening the package and using it, it didn't work at all. It did a good job of separating my eyelashes, but nothing else. I say go for your old fashion eyelash curler. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS KNICK KNACK.
