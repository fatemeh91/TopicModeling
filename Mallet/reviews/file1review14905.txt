review/text: I have a ULU knife set (not this particular product, however) and use it almost daily to dice up chicken or fish for our cats in the morning. I like our ULU because it's particularly useful for this particular task. I don't have to touch the smelly meat, don't burn my fingers holding things steady.I bought this particular ULU set for my 87-yr-old Mom. She has bad arthritis in her hands. She says she likes it and uses it often. I had occasion to use her ULU fairly recently and found it actually superior to the one we use at home. Her knife seemed sharper and more well-balanced than mine, and the cutting-bowl that came with her set seemed to accomodate a larger portion than the one we use at our home.If you don't already have a ULU knife set (knife and chopping block), get one! You'll be wondering how you ever managed kitchen-craft without this inexpensive tool.
