review/text: This razor ranks on par with single blade disposable bic shavers.It is positively awful. Right out of the box it caught my beard and felt like it had been used to strip varnish off the furniture. I thought it was something with the first one and tried a second. Same deal.I wondered if maybe I was doing something different so after trying it once and finding it unsuitable, I used a one week old, used several times, two blade generic disposable razor. It was far and away much better, much smoother shaving and less painful than this razor.I have tried this razor using gel, foam and shaving in the shower. Nothing can redeem it. Well.. one thing.I noticed that after I shaved with another razor, this razor glides over the skin quite smoothly.
