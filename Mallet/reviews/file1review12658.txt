review/text: I bought this product twice for my dad around Aug-Sep 2008. The price went up substantially from the first purchase to the 2nd, which was very irritating. I saw the infomercial on tv about how people having stents or bypass surgery for their hearts were able to avoid surgery by using this product. Since my dad just had a stent and he was scheduled for more and/or bypass surgery, we gave it a try. He was put on meds and he took this product. He recently was given the prelim exam before the surgery and there was still one blockage instead of several and the decision was made by the dr. to cancel any surgery. I can't be sure if the result was from the meds or the product, but whichever, it was worth buying and taking the product.
