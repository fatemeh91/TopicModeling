review/text: This is an excellent product. I had been feeling very heavy in my second pregnancy and my doctor suggested this product. Even with all the positive reviews, I wasn't really a believer. Once I figured out all the straps and placed it on, it really worked wonders. I feel like I can go about my very busy and active day now and rarely do I feel discomfort or heaviness anymore. The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because the cross body straps really do show themselves, making it virtually impossible to wear anything. I have been wearing the same sweatshirt to cover the straps for months now but I guess that's the trade off for comfort. I am a very small woman but do please listen to the reviews and buy a MEDIUM or one size larger than your average size. I'm usually a size 2/4 so the medium works perfectly. A really great thing to have. One less thing to worry about as you progress in your pregnancy. This is truly wonderful!
