review/text: This is a high quality protein powder made using premium processes and sound ingredients. The high degree of quality whey isolates makes this a perfect protein for many uses. It blends very easily (unlike many others) and is free from artificial ingredients, cheap fillers and the dairy source is healthful and free from antibiotics and rBGH free. Only caveat, this tends to need a bit of sweetening which can be done without violating the integrity of the product, a little bit of Stevia would make this a perfect 5 star.
