review/text: This is my 2nd order of this product. I'm very happy with this particular flavor - Double Rich Chocolate. What I like about it is that its not very sweet like the other (Extreme milk chocolate). The protein content etc is the same as others and I won't be adding any information about that. I'm not too much into building, so I have this shake on the days I go to the gym - 3-4 times a week. I would say its a very good post workout supplement.I recommend making a milkshake out of this. Here is a quick recipe: 1 scoop of this powder, 8 oz Soy Milk, 4 strawberries, 3/4 to 1 banana, (peanut butter optional). Put all these in a blender. It makes a very yummy shake. Try it with soy milk, IMO it tastes better than dairy milk. Enjoy!
