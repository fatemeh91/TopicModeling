review/text: The ugly hole was two inches and this hard-plastic grommet fit snugly in. As an added bonus, it allows you to adjust the hole within the grommet that your wires peek through so that the wires don't just fall back down when you unplug them from your laptop/speakers/mice/Hitachi neck massager.
