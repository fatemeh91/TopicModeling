review/text: We use this toothpaste for two reasons; it works and it's inexpensive. We normally keep multiple boxes of this toothpaste around the house and at this point probably have around five or six unopened boxes in reserve.The toothpaste has a pleasant taste and is only moderately foamy which, in my opinion, simplifies the whole tooth brushing process.As another reviewer has pointed out a consumer testing organization has given the toothpaste high marks; that I'll have to admit was the reason I first bought this brand. According to the box the product is made in Mexico and distributed in the USA by Colgate-Palmolive. It contains sodium fluoride .24 % for anticavity protection.We have been pleased with this product for years and see no reason to change.
