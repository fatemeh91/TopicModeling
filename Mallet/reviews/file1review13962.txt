review/text: I ordered the Opalescence 35% and 3 D.I.Y trays in a package all together and while the whitening gel was as described, the trays were a great disappointment. I wasn't sure what to expect and from the other reviews I had read I figured that perhaps I should try it out on my own and not go by others opinion. The trays are very thick acrylic that doesn't mold to your teeth as you would think they do, even by following step by step instructions. Very poor quality trays and not good for using with whitening gel. Playing football, perhaps. Ive decided to invest money in a professional dental trays instead.
