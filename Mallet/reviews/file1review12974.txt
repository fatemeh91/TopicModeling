review/text: I do like this collar. it's large and wraps around my neck snug. it heats up well. it can be used for other areas as well. i heat this in the microwave for 45 seconds per side. the heat lasts for about 20 minutes and does a great job. i have multiple herniated disc, and this relieves pain.this is a high quality collar, and i would recommend this to anyone with neck and back pain and tense muscles.
