review/text: It appears to me that the majority of people rating fewer than 4 or 5 stars here are doing so because of the taste of this product, which is highly subjective as I found it to actually be the tastiest whey product I have tried even amongst others of this same brand (Dymatize). This is a "pure" protein product - no carbs, no fillers, minimal fat and cholesterol, added glutamine and other amino acids and all at a terrific price (around $36 USD at the time of this writing for the subscription). To boot, I have found that this brand digests much easier than other wheys I have used - and I have been using protein supplements on and off for about 10 years now. No gas, no bloating - makes a stomach (and those around you) happy :-).
