review/text: Cooling, and sure helps. I have a moderate case of hemorrhoids but Preparation H helps not. This is not a magic bullet either but it does give relief. It is cooling, it does shrink the hemorrhoids some. The price is right so go for it.OK I CHANGED THIS FROM FOUR STARS TO FIVE.Why because after using the product several days the hemorrhoids keep srinking. Hope it keeps being effective.
