review/text: For about a year I was trying all kinds of supplements to improve my health, including this one. But, I never noticed a difference, so I have quit taking this--and most of the others. I'm not saying it doesn't work, I'm just saying for me, I couldn't tell any difference. Money is tighter now that we're nearing retirement so I can't afford to keep spending money on supplements that don't make me feel any better, or give me any better test results, sorry.
