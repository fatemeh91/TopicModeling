review/text: A great value for the price (I buy by the case). In winter and cold season, when I'm around people with coughs and colds, I constantly keep one of these cough suppressants in my mouth to coat my throat and by doing so don't allow the germs to take hold. They taste good and they're sugar-free. They work!
