review/text: The package came with a few leaking batteries (pictures uploaded), and what first comes to my mind is that they have been in that package for a long time. I didn't get a chance to test the remaining batteries. The appearance is ok, but I'm not so sure about their quality once many batteries were covered by a white powder and some viscous liquid (I presumed is the battery acid leak). Lesson learned, next time I'll consider getting fresh batteries at a local store, where you can check expiration date, package and batteries conditions, etc before you buy it.
