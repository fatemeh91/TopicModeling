review/text: I can't stand using this thing on my legs because it hurts way too much. But I started using it on my husband's back hair about a year ago. It quickly tears all of his back hair in less than 10 minutes. I can't say that it isn't painless for him. Actually, I kind of enjoy making him squirm. We only need to use it about once a month to keep him completely smooth. Unlike the other reviews, I can't say that his back hair has decreased or become more fine with use, but I can say that it works better than any other device we've tried and is much cleaner than sugars and waxes.
