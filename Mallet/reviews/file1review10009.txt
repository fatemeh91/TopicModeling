review/text: So I get my Caliper in the mail, open it up, read the directions. First step, programming the Caliper was easy. Second step, pinching my thigh, easy. Third step, tummy, easy... But then comes the tricep, NOT so easy. I don't think I got a valid reading and my body fat still said 8%. Just the day prior at the gym I go to, I measured at 20%. So I re-did all my spots and still, 8%. The next day, I retested the same spots and got the same reading... It has been in my gym bag ever since, and my bruises from pinching my fat are finally gone.
