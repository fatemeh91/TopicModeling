review/text: After reading many reviews, for many different makes and models, this one seemed to make the most sense for obvious reasons. Only thing is, it's kind of large. I just saw in a store, they have a newer model which looks almost identical, but is half the size.In any case, I haven't hard to charge it since buying it, but it feels very sturdy in your hand and is very easy to use. for 15$ you can't go wrong here.
