review/text: This product is somewhat of a waste of time depending on your teeth. Unless your teeth are perfectly straight you can hardly get the floss/pick in between your teeth and once you do get it in between your teeth you can hardly move the floss up and down or left to right because there is no power in just holding the device with one hand. Also, I think that even if your teeth are perfectly straight (which I doubt everyones is) I doubt you still will be able to use this product properly because of just how weak the floss and your control over the product is.
