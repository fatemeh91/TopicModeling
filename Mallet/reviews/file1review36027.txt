review/text: I just received and started using this product this week and it already seems to be working.I had a myocardial infarction 2 years ago, and after having a stent implant, my cardiologist has had me on blood thinners, high blood pressure and cholesterol meds ever since. Needless to say, all those meds cause the usual negative side-effects. After reading so many positive reviews on L-Arginine, I decided quit taking all of my prescribed meds and to try L-Arginine just to see what it's effects would be. Although the information I have read states that those who have had a myocardial infarction should not take L-Arginine. Oh well, I'll take the risk. It's one of those quality of life over quantity of life issues.So far it seems that L-Arginine is having a positive effect. Let's just say that the wife was surprised ;P.As far as the taste and smell are concerned: Yes, it is nasty! I used to take Creatine and always had the problem of having it dissolve completely in juice, and have the same problem with the L-Arginine. So what I do, is in the morning (on an empty stomach), I place a teaspoon full of L-Arginine in my mouth and then drink a mouth full of apple juice, swish it around and then swallow it down in one gulp.The taste is nasty, but it doesn't seem to be as bad as some are making it out to be. At least it is not as nasty as taking a shot of Jack Daniel's whiskey - yuck!
