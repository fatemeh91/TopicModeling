review/text: This is a review of Metab herbs. I have been using this product for over 20 years with magnificent results. It comes in a crushed herb formula and I take 1/2 tsp. almost every night. I recommend not taking it on a full stomach and not taking it with a lot of water (dilutes the potency). It works 8 to 10 hours later and it works EXTREMELY WELL! If you suffer from any type of constipation or irregular bowel problems, this is the product for you. For those of you that know anything about herbals, this product is considered a "bitter tonic". I am 60 and have recently had a colonoscopy, not a polyp in sight!
