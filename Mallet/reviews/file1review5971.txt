review/text: I have been using Omron blood pressure wrist monitors for a few years now.I found this particlar one to be of excellent value and a great Workhorse.This one you can use in bed and get a true reading just by elevating your arm by your side to heart level.It reads within a Few units up or down as compared to a doctors office unit.(very accurate)Very close if not right on. A bit noisy but a fine instrament..
