review/text: I have used several trimmers in the past and have been very dissatisfied with the majority of them. A purchased an MB-400 but dropped it an could not get the trimmer back onto the handle. As this product was discontinued I bought the MB-200 and am extremely pleased. It is smooth, easy to adjust, and never pulls or gets caught in the beard.
