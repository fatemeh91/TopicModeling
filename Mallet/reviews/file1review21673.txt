review/text: Snug Tub is great tub. It fits very well in a standard bath tub. Easy to clean out and I love the hang up feature so that it can dry out. The only down side is emptying the water. The water plug is on the bottom and the weight of the tub with the water in it prevents easy drainage of the water. I literally had to lift that end of the tub up so that the water can drain.
