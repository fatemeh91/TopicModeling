review/text: I have been using this brand and flavor for a while now. I made the mistake the last time I ran out of ordering "Natural Strawberry", and that was the worst tasting powder I have ever had. I bought a 5lb version and after one shake I couldn't take it and threw it away. I went back and ordered the delicious strawberry and this is so much better! This is an excellent product and tastes great. It fills me up so that I don't eat too much throughout the day.
