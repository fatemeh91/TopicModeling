review/text: This product may be exactly what it is supposed to be, however I used it for aproximately 2 minutes and could not stand it any longer. Despite the fact that I followed the directions given for maximum efficiency and for least amount of pain, it was extremely painful. The amount of hair that was removed was almost unnoticable and I was bleeding to the point that it was on the epilator. If more hair had been removed I might have suffered through but it was clear it would have taken at least an hour or more to complete the process. I was unwillingly to endure the pain for that long. My hair was not extremely long and so this could not have been the problem.Again, the product may be a good one, maybe it is supposed to hurt this much. My pain tolerance is fairly good. I have had several surgeries and managed high pain levels with minimal pain meds. I cannot imagine anyone enduring the epilator process though. Waxing never sounded so good.
