review/text: I have tried many earplugs over the years, most of them costing much more. These are the only ones I have found that fit both ears perfectly, stay put while I sleep, and do not have a rigid stem that protrudes into my ear (causing pain) when I sleep on my side. They can be used for swimming as well. Great product!
