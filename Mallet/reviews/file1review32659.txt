review/text: Common people!,I have read other people's reviews and was laughing hysterically.Do you really believe this product is going to save you from autoimmune or other disorders?And according to one review it is full of antioxidants??? ARE YOU SERIOUS?How do you know? Or you are from the company who is selling this really chalky powder on recent ACAI HYPE??Everybody, please just stick to taste, flavor, price etc in your reviews. Do not give poor people ideas some product that has absolutely no proven evidence on any facts it is good for you is going to help with disease or any health problems!Do not waste you monies, this product will do nothing for you health wise!Taste is OK, nothing very special. If you want to add to smoothies, it is not bad.However do not fall for miracle food advertising!Pricey and very bland. Three stars at most.
