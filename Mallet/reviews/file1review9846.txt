review/text: I'm a male and often have ingrown hairs. I own Revlon tweezers which I purchased long time ago from Target. They work pretty well for most ingrown hair and grab the hair very firm.The problem with Revlon is though that first I have to slightly free the hair from the surrounding skin using a needle or other sharp tool.I purchased the Tweezerman tweezers based on mostly positive reviews, but I was not able to use them for ingrown hairs. The tip is sharp and thin. The tweezers either cut or fail to grab the hair. When I tried harder, they would cut the skin, cause bleeding and make more harm. They are pretty much useless.Unfortunately I missed the window for return.
