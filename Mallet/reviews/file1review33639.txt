review/text: Package arrived and it was much smaller than expected. Maybe 5-6 inches tall, happy about that. Any rate, filled up the blue thing with water and turned it on - after putting it on the white base. Gotta say that it started shaking at first and it worried me.I read the instructions. Looks like everything's normal, it's just a little noisy, kinda like an RC car. No biggie though. Put it at full blast and this thing does some damage. Wow. Turned it back down to smallest setting and used it for a bit. Worked great, except it kinda splattered a bunch out of my mouth. Maybe I should learn how to use this better. But anyway, stopped using it in the mirror and got down to business and it did the job.The thing packed up neatly, can't complain about that. I'm satisfied though!
