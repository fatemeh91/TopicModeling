review/text: I am so, so happy with this BabyBjorn Toilet trainer. No other trainer we tried would fit properly on the toilet. They were all very wobbly, and my son would freak out and refuse to use them again. This one not only has the little grippers on it, but it also seems to be a much better fit for the toilet altogether.We are well on our way to potty-training success, and it wouldn't have happened without this trainer!
