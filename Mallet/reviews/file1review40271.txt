review/text: Wow! That is exactly what I think of these vitamins. I hadn't really taken vitamins faithfully, prior to these, but I've really been good about taking these because I can definitely notice positive results... I feel far better physically and mentally! Also these vitamins have natural nutrients, which support healthy and natural testosterone levels. These vitamins are primarily marketed towards weight lifters and athletes, but I'd recommend them to anyone (men). They have more nutrients and what not for active athletes! Hope you all experience the same nice results! Also, they are somewhat large vitamins, so you may want to take them a few at a time? Take it easy all and all the best...Peace,Rich
