review/text: For the first time since I was a kid I have had batteries corrode and ruin my equipment. This time it happened to my very expensive Mag-lite 3 Cell and 2 Cell L.E.D. flashlights. These Energizer batteries have "Energized" me to never buy anything made by this company ever again. My batteries were part of an 8 pack and the 3 unused batteries in the 8 pack were also corroded.This reminds me of what "Burgess" batteries would do to anything you put them in. That company has long since gone out of business.UPDATE:-------I emailed them about what happened to my flashlights and the rest of the 8 pack of unused batteries. 10 days later via U.S. Mail they did offer to repair or replace them and even included a prepaid label to send my flashlights to them for evaluation. I was able to clean them up enough to get them working again before I received the prepaid shipping label. I sent them another emial that I was able to get them working again and asked for tips on removing the rest of the corrosion. A week later they mailed me a coupon to cover the cost of the 8 pack of batteries, up to $15 and a letter from their technicians with tips on cleaning them up further. I am pleased with their response to my problem. Maybe a little scared to use their batteries again but now I know how they honor their guarantee. I will give them another shot. I will give the service department 5 stars and will up the overall rating to 3 stars.
