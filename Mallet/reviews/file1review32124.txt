review/text: I'm (whoooo!) using the HydraClens Sitz Bath right now -- as I type this (yeeee!), in fact.It takes some (gerk!) getting used to, but...Hold on a minute......there. As I was saying, it takes some getting used to -- particularly gauging the proper water pressure (heeoooowww!), but it's been a Godsend after, um, taking care of business (interpret that as you will).The 9.5' hose means I can even bring it to work with me! I get some odd looks, but I'm more concerned with comfort and cleanliness than appearance, thank you very much.Man, this is great.Anyway, it's proven to be a durable, reliable item. I'd recommend it for (phooooooo!) anyone.
