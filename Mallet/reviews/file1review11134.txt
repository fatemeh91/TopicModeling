review/text: I bought a five-pack of these at a local Costco and they are just terrible. Being from Minnesota, I am a firm believer in all things made by 3M, but unfortunately these lint rollers just don't stick. I'm really confused how 3M/Scotch managed to get these on the market after doing any sort of testing in the field. Their postal tape, packing tape, and every other sticky substance that they make is usually the best on the market. However, these lint rollers fall way short of expectations. The sheets are very hard to tear off and they just don't grab the pet hair like they should. I have a hound and he is very hairy, but these rollers just don't grab. What Scotch should have done is used their packing tape that's the color of masking tape for their lint rollers! If you buy lint rollers, buy the kind that look like masking tape sold by other companies, as they work WAY better than these. I bought these because they were a good price and will definitely not buy them again. Come on 3M, you can do better than this!
