review/text: Perfect size and fit for someone who hates to go clean-shaven and goes scruffy. I imagine it would also be helpful to use it to get your facial hair down to a manageable length to be able to go clean-shaven if you wanted. The adjustable length setting seems durable, but for the most part I just use it on the first setting without the plastic guard. The battery stays charged for a long amount of time. I feel like I have left it off the charger for about a month now and it's still going strong. That is definitely a plus for people like me that are always forgetting to plug things back in.
