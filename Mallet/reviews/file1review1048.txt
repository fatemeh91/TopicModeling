review/text: I purchased this talking watch, along with another -also talking- for an elderly of 85 and BLIND. The watches are quite beautiful, well designed and fit for its purpose of telling the time. Until, by accident, I discovered that it announces "seven" for the number 11, be it hours, minutes, am, pm. In disbelief, I discovered that the other (talking)watch I just bought is ALSO doing the same.I've notified the vendor and Amazon for further investigation: fabrication defect or design flaw.NOT, I'm pleased, NOT Made in USA.
