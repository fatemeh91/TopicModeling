review/text: People love to look at this stethescope. It's eye catching and a total ice breaker. Makes it much easier to talk to patients especially being a student nurse. Patients are much more smiley when I say "I'm going to listen to your heart now, with my heart". Yeah, it's corny but it gets them talking. It deserves the 5 stars because it's exactly as described. The price is pretty good for the quality here. It's not top of the line and doesn't have all the features of a classic stethescope but this will get me to graduation.
