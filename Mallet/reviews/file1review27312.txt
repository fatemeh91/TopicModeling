review/text: I'll never see how good this is because I can hardly manage to choke it down after a workout. I've tried it with water and/or milk in a shaker bottle, blended with banana, yogurt, peanut butter, etc...an't make it taste decent. By time I can get it to taste like it's edible, I've mixed so much other stuff in there that I might as well have not even bothered. I got this as a gift from a friend that had a BOGO coupon from a local supplement shop, and I really wish she had the decency to get a good flavor.
