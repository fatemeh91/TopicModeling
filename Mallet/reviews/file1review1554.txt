review/text: Ok, I've always felt guilty that I use product reviews every single time I purchase something, but never have I left a review for anything I've bought. I swore, though, when I bought this that if it actually worked, I would finally get on here and write a review for something. I had 3 plantar warts on the bottom of my foot for over 2 years. I spent a ton of money and tried everything to get rid of them so I could start getting pedicures again. Gels, freezing kits, liquid treatments from all major and generic brands. Then I tried the home remedy route. Apple Cider Vinegar did work for one of them, but it was a long, smelly, cumbersome, painful process. Banana peel, duct tape, grapefruit seed extract nail polish... I tried it all. Little did I know that relief was in this inexpensive, simple tube. At first I applied as I had read in the reviews but I personally found it easiest to scrape some off with my fingernail and apply to the warts that way. I would then cover with bandaids that sealed all the way around and leave on for as long as the bandaid would stay. I noticed serious improvement after just a few applications. Within 10, all warts were gone. I am dumbfounded and so grateful. I hope to not have this experience again, but if I do... this will be my first course of action.
