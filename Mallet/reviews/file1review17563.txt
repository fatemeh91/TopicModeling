review/text: There is absolutely nothing fancy about this trimmer! It has an adjustable guard, an on/off switch, and an LED charging indicator. It does not come with any type of stand but it does come with a small cleaning brush and a beard comb. The guard adjust to cut anything from a medium length beard to a close stubble and the adjustment wheel securely locks into place so there are no worries about the guard retreating while in use. One nice thing about this trimmer is you can keep it plugged in all the time with out worry about overcharging and killing the battery. This trimmer is replacing my 2 year old, $50+, phillips norelco whose battery no longer held a charge longer for 5 seconds, and I can say with out a doubt, this $15 trimmer works 10 times better than my old trimmer, or any other I've owned, for the matter. We are all looking for a trimmer that is reliable and simply works and works well, right? Well, look no farther!
