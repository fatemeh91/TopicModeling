review/text: I love these prenatal vitamins! I'm now purchasing my third bottle. I plan to continue taking them after pregnancy while I'm breastfeeding. These are big vitamins, which some people might not like, but I love that you only have to take it once a day. These never make me sick to my stomach and even though they have a lot of iron in them, they don't make me constipated, which is a miracle! The only negative I can think of is that these don't have a lot of calcium in them. There is a reason for this--calcium interferes with iron absorption. You need to take an extra calcium supplement, preferably at a later time in the day than when you take this vitamin. These vitamins have helped me avoid becoming anemic because they have a high iron content. It's so hard to find iron supplements that don't mess with your digestive system--these are great!
