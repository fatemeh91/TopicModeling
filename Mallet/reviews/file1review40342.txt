review/text: I had this product for awhile before using it and when I started getting sick I almost forgot I had it, so I did not start taking it immediately at onset. I know that Echinacea is supposed to be good for colds and that's the main ingredient in this formula. I ended up taking the entire 20 capsules and it may have lessened my symptoms, but unfortunately I was still down for the count.I would recommend getting the larger 40 count size (plus it's cheaper that way) and have it on hand so you start taking it at the first sign of a cold or flu.
