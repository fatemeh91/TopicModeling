review/text: I bought this for quick runs in between vacuums. Perfect! Gets the cat hair on the hardwood floors and goes smoothly onto the carpet. Easy to open and empty.In the Fall it even did great job of getting up the wet leaves that track in on your shoes. I like that it doesn't require a battery or electricity. I don't recommend using it to do a whole room, but it sure can! (our vacuum had broke and we had company coming). Believe it or not it did as good a job as a vacuum, but unless your really fit, it makes your arms tired! lol.Buy this for the modest price if you have pets and kids.
