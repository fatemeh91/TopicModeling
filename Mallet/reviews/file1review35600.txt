review/text: I purchased this elevated toilet seat for my disabled mother. It is made of strong lightweight plastic. The handles are easy to insert and it attaches to the toilet in seconds. It says the seat is extra wide. While it is true that the plastic area upon which one sits is wider than the standard toilet seat by about 4 inches, the center opening is small. I had an elevated oblong toilet installed for her a few years back. This fit over the toilet fine. However, the opening is much smaller than the oblong toilet. She went from a 14" to 12" opening. This made it difficult for her clean herself properly. The bidet spray I purchased recently has helped with that issue. The handles on each side of the toilet seat keep it sturdy and hold it in place. This is great for persons who have difficulty with mobility. I wrapped a bungee cord around the base of the toilet to each back leg and this kept the unit from sliding forward as she tried to stand. I do not recommend it for people who are overweight or who need to spread their legs wide. The handles fit against the hips of an average sized person. But it is a great product for someone needing handles to hold onto and a little wider and elevated seat.
