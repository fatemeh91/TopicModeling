review/text: Before I bought this, I asked my doctor if she'd ever heard of the brand, pretty much expecting her to say, "Of course, I use Bluebonnet margarine all the time!" but, in fact, she was familiar with this supplement and said it'd be perfectly good to take. Like another reviewer here, I noticed that my nighttime foot cramps vanished almost immediately -- though, to balance the picture, that also may have been the case when I was taking Citrical alone. (I take Citrical Calcium + D in addition to Bluebonnet -- too neurotic to rely on any one brand to protect my bones!) The advantage of this formula is how pleasant and easy the liquid is to take compared to the usual horse pills that calcium comes in -- so while the pill-taking feels like a chore, having a spoon or two of this fruity liquid seems more like a treat, which means you'll be less likely to skip a dose. In the back of my mind, I have a little concern over the lack of a "USP Verified" mark, which would give some level of assurance that this Bluebonnet stuff does indeed contain what the label says it does. But it seems like an honest product, so until I turn on CNN and see Bluebonnet execs being led off in handcuffs in "Calcium Crisis 2012," I'll keep on taking it.
