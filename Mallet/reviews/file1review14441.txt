review/text: My 97-year-old Mom has always been independent and is really mad that she's "getting old" and losing her independence. Everyone thought she'd resent getting the Rollator as a Christmas gift, but she loves it! Especially happy about being able to sit when she needs a rest. The trickiest part is getting her to remember to set the brakes when she sits down or stands up ... I worry that it'll shoot out from under her. It was easy to put together. Rolls smoothly and is very maneuverable.
