review/text: I ordered this cleaner for an expensive leather purse that had gotten dye on it from a dark-wash denim jean. I tested it on a small piece of leather that was hidden and it didn't change the color at all, so I used it all over. It took the denim dye right out and made the leather look brand new. Could not be happier with this product -- want to get the leather conditioner as well!
