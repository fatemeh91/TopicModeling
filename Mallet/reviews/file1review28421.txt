review/text: An adequately priced, run of the mill whey. I prefer Biotest's unflavored whey because it's essentially this product but cheaper and just a bit tastier (a very relative term in this case).This whey has a weird taste thing going on that I can't describe. It is a good whey though if you're not into Biotest, and I had been using it for about a year with no problems.
