review/text: There isn't too much you can say about a grommet. This is well made and suits the purpose. Perhaps more importantly, I emailed the manufacturer to determine if the center section could be removed and got a response. Sadly having ANY manufacturer respond shouldn't be a big deal but it is. These people passed that test so I recommend them and their product.
