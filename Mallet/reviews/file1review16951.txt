review/text: My husband recently had bilateral knee replacements and needed an ice pack that he could wrap around the knees. We already had one from my son's usage, and since he needed two so he could ice at the same time, this fit the bill as I was checking your website. It could not have been better. After eight weeks, he is still using this product with satisfaction.
