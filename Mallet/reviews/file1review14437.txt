review/text: I originally bought this at a health food store, being very skeptical. I was looking for a product in addition to my prenatal vitamins. I wanted to get more fruits and veggie nutrients for my future baby, and this stuff works great! I prefer drinking the green powder with organic apple juice. Orange juice isn't the best combo for my taste buds :) The taste is grassy, but I'll deal with that. Health (to me and baby) is more important than a few sips of a less-than-delectable green drink. I, also, love the fact that I am getting probiotics; my husband loves that fact, too! I would take the adult version, but I was told by a doctor that it may not be good for the expecting baby (since it has ginko biloba extract in it)...the GV Junior does not have this ingredient in it. Overall, I'm very pleased with this product and I have not had a cold, flu, or any other illness since I have been taking this (about 2 months now). Woohoo!!! I highly recommend this product!
