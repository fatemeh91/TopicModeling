review/text: I wish I had read the description more thoroughly. The product description says "White unbleached rags Cotton/cotton knit blend" so I assumed this to be a box filled with scraps of cotton cloth(rags). This is a box filled with paper towel that has a texture of quilted toilet paper. If you are in need of shop paper towel you are better off going to Walmart and buying 2 "Shop Towels On A Roll" for $3.47 a piece which will come out to be 110 sheets for under $8 compared to buying rag in a box at $8.50 for only 85 sheets. If you are looking for actual cloth rags then this is not the product for you.I gave it 3 stars not because I was expecting cloth rags, I gave it 3 stars because the rags reap easily and for something call rags I expect it to be tougher.I have added pictures to compare these so called rags to regular paper towel.
