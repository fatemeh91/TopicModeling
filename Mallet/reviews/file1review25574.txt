review/text: First one broke in less than a year. Same for the second and third. I give up. Don't buy.Edit: Tried the Wahl wet/dry. I sucked arse in a big way. Didn't trim close at all. Completely useless. I'm going to buy this one again, because it does work well. It's noisy, and will break within 6 months, but it does the job. Actually, I'll buy two. I hate it, but I can't try all of them.
