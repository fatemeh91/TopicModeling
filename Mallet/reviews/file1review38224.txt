review/text: I always feel better after using Psyllium,it cleans your Colon out VERY well.I've found this stuff goes down alot better if you sweeten it up and a good way to do that without sugaring it up is with Stevia.I use it along with Lifes Greens powder from Puritains Pride,that way it really does a good job of healing as it's cleaning.If you want to go one step further a couple tablespoons of of your basic Curry powder(very healing and beneficial to many organs and overall body function) to the mix and wash down some multi vitamins and Bee Pollen and nothing can get in your way during the day.Tip:Use a shaker cup and don't shake it more then 4-6 times or it will start to gel,then hurry and drink it within a few seconds.I usually turn the water on ahead of time to get ready to wash the shaker cup out and find it allows me to focus on the running water and keeps my mind off drinking the this super sledge,once it's down the day gets increasingly better so that gives you inspiration to keep gulping.
