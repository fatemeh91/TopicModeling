review/text: I ordered this item because I was just recovering from throwing out my back and was taking a long flight to Hawaii. Before the flight, I used the Back Booster a few times in the car and at the office, and it felt pretty good. Definitely made the recovery easier. The elastic strap that is attached makes it easy to hold the support in place on a car seat or a chair. This is espescially useful for taller people who may want to position the support a little higher. It takes some time to figure out the right inflation amount for you. I use it half inflated at most.The big test came on the 6 hour flight to Hawaii. Again, I found it to work the best when it was about half inflated. One nice feature is that the support is shaped so that one end is a little more round than the other. The instructions state that the round end should be at the top, but you can also turn it so that the round side is down if you need lower support. On a plane, you can't secure it to the seat since you can't wrap the elastic straps around the back of the chair, but since you're sitting in one spot most of the time, it stays in place. I thought that it provided great support. I honestly wish I would've used this even before I had back pain - it would've saved me many uncomfortable hours on flights.I give the product high marks for portability and durability. It deflates easily and folds nicely into a small pouch. I'm a big guy (6'4, 300lbs.), and lean onto the support as hard as I need to, but this product has not leaked at all. I keep it in the office now in case I start to feel a little bit of back discomfort. For a portable device that can help with back support and discomfort, I'm really pleased with the purchase.
