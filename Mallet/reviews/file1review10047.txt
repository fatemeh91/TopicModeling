review/text: I've tried them all, expensive, cheap, rotating, vibrating, pulsating, you name it... None match the effectiveness of Interplak's independent brushes. True, certain design elements could be improved, but it still leaves its competition in the dust, and it's an unmitigated bargain to boot. Why it has become less popular than several years back, boggles the mind.
