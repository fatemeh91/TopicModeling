review/text: Many years ago, I suffered from a bad care of interstitial cystitis. I could not sleep because I going to the restroom 8 times a night. I was exhausted and frustrated. Nothing worked. I even consulted with the top medical doctors at the UCLA Medical Center and the USC Medical Center for help. Some doctors were using DMSO and baking soda cocktails that were inserted in the bladder, yet these treatments were controversial. Depressed and desperate, i decided to try Mag 07. It was a miracle !!! From the first night that I tried it, I was able to sleep through the night ! I will be forever thankful to the creators of this product. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from interstitial cystitis.
