review/text: This is a perfect description of what this product has become and the people who use them. After purchasing two battery charged water piks, the first was an Inter-Plak, and having them both die within weeks, I looked at the comments and found everyone has the same problem. What's worse is that the nickel cadmium battery can't be thrown out without environmental harm, they have to be returned to a qualified dealer. Of course, most people probably don't do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers, they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that can't be safely disposed.I just bought the model that attaches to the shower. Don't know how it will work out, but it won't burn out. It won't foul the environment. It doesn't use electricity and it won't clutter my counter. Its considerably cheaper. It seems like the way to go, doesn't it?
