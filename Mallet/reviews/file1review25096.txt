review/text: You can't tell from the ad that this has trans fat in it, but when the product arrives, you'll see "Partially Hydrogenated Soybean and Cottonseed Oil" --> trans fat.This is not advertised on this product page.While it is a negligible amount, most experts advise having ZERO trans fat in your diet. That's 0.00000 grams -- not the "zero" that people can claim if its &lt; 0.5 (or &lt; 0.05) depending on the packaging.
