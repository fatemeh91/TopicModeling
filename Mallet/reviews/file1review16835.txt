review/text: I'm seeing a lot of reviews for the "peanut butter" even though this particular product is "black cherry almond". But I guess people are not paying attention to the flavor when they search "Clif Bar" or "energy bar". My review is on "Clif Bar Nutrition Bars, Black Cherry Almond". That is what the top of my screen is showing. So if this review ends up under a different flavor, well, it is not my fault. :-)I have not eaten an energy bar in years. When I saw the bar out of its wrapper my first thought was how UGLY the thing was. I mean it was U-G-L-Y people!I picked this brand because the package states that it is "Made with ORGANIC oats & soybeans". My husband and teen son seem to be trying to buy more organic foods, so I decided to help out.Only very people should even consider picking up these bars. They are a little over 200 calories in each tiny bar. About 25% of those calories are from fat. (Saturated fat is 1g. Trans fat is zero. No cholesterol. But sodium is over 60mg. Potassium is over 120mg. TOTAL carbs is 22g. Sugar is about 10g.)Diabetics, stay away! Hypoglycemics, stay away! The protein is only 5g and that is just not worth it for the amount of carbs and sugar involved in one bar.However, if you are not diabetic or hypolycemic and you are very active, then this product is the way to go! It looks bad, but the taste is really great. Also perfect for business people who are too busy to stop for breakfast or lunch.Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.
