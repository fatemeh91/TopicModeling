review/text: Just about exactly one year after purchase, this thing no longer works for more than a few seconds. It does not work on A/C. It only works on a battery charge. The battery is just about dead. If I keep it charging, it runs for a few seconds, then dies. If I don't keep it charging, it does not run at all. From now on I will NEVER buy a product that operates only on a built-in, non-replaceable rechargeable battery that cannot run on A/C.
