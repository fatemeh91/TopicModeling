review/text: This waterpik stopped pumping out water after 5 weeks and used a few times. It is still under a two year warranty. I returned to a local repair shop who told me they don't repair this equipment but return it to Waterpik who should send me a new one. I don't expect much reliability from the device. If it was within the 30 day period after shipment I would return it for a refund. Don't get stuck with this product like I am.
