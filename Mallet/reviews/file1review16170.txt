review/text: I have had a wonderful experience with this mattress that I bought a couple of years ago, and I am about to make a second purchase because I loved it so much, and I happen to be in need of another King size bed. I was very pleased with the company's delivery and packaging of the mattress. As well, I always have good experiences when dealing through Amazon. The company itself I did not have to personally deal with, as everything went so smooth and the bed is almost 3 years old now, and is holding up very well, just like new!
