review/text: I have taken this product along with swapping my margerine for Smart Balance Heart Healthy Plant Sterol and have seen some impressive results. After a full male ultimate blood test after 60 days, my total cholestrol went from 220 to 205, my HDL went from 59 to 67, my LDL went from 140 to 120, and most unexpectedly my c-reative protein was cut in half from 1.8 to 0.9. These number seem to be inline with the posted product benefits. However, when you add the margerine substituion to the Twinlab product, I exceeded, on average, over 2000 mg of plant sterols per day. My other bloodwork showed no changes due to this higher plant sterol consumption. This beats all the "prescription" stuff for the moderate reductions I was seeking.
