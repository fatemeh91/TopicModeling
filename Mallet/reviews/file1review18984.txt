review/text: My daughter loves this "huggy" or "clutch" but I dont think it would make a good burp cloth. The diamond pattern is very soft and I would think it would just run off instead of absorbing but hey whatever! I am giving it a 5 star because it is a great security blanket for Anna Kate and she wont leave home without it.
