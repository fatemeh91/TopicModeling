review/text: I went on ambien when I was going thou a stressful patch going thru a divorce, home sale, changing jobs, major relocation. My Dr in my new city did not believe that I needed Ambien anymore and I panicked thinking I may never get a good night's sleep again! I tried melatonin and it worked slightly but I was afraid of the effects of long term use on natural production. Deep Sleep was recommended to me at my local food co-op and I bought a 30 pill bottle. I'm telling you....it's a must try. It doesn't knock you out like Ambien but it makes you so relaxed and wake up so refreshed. I will not go without it now!!!
