review/text: When he was a little over a year old, my son developed some patches of mild eczema on his cheeks and the backs of his knees. We used hydrocortisone for the maximum amount of time recommended by his pediatrician, with little luck. I then tried the Gentle Naturals Baby Eczema Cream, which worked, but it had to be reapplied daily, and I was also concerned about the parabens in the product.Enter Burt's Bees. I'd heard some moms suggest the Baby Bee Skin Creme for kids with eczema, so I picked up a jar. (Incidentally, the product description here seems to be missing the ingredients, so here they are: prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, water, beeswax, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, kaolin, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract, chondrus crispus (carrageenan) extract, fragrance, sodium borate, glucose, glucose oxidase, lactoperoxidase, tocopherol)The cream is quite thick and has that wonderful buttermilky, apricoty smell that a lot of Burt's Bees products have.I was AMAZED at the difference it made in my son's skin. Not only did it clear up the eczema right away, but it I -very- rarely have to reapply it. Maybe every few weeks or so now I need to put a bit more on, but I'm amazed at how little of the lotion we really need.I also use it for any other irritated parts -- like when my little guy's bum looks a bit ouchy -- and it takes care of the redness right away. I used it myself recently when I had an irritated spot on one of my hands, and I couldn't believe how soothing it immediately felt.Definitely highly recommended for your parenting arsenal!
