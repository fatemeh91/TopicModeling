review/text: I like a tasty protein, without having to add honey or some other sweetener. This protein gives you about 26 grams per serving. When you work out you need 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, so if your target body weight is 190 lbs then you need 190 grams of protein a day.The taste is quite good (vanilla cream) and mixes easily. I have been replacing meals with a protein drink, and have lost an inch on my waistline in a week. I am not hungry. Plus, I'm weight training 3 days a week. Five stars!!
