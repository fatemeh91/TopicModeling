review/text: The OXO Good Grips 3781 Grout Brush does a good job cleaning very dirty grout. I'm using it withHoover AH30285 Floor Mate 32-Ounce Tile and Grout SprayandHoover FloorMate SpinScrub Wet/Dry Vacuum Cleaner, H3044.My process is to spray a heavy coat of the grout cleaner, wait 4-6 minutes, scrub with the Good Grips Grout Brush, wipe up the excess cleaner and loosened dirt with a sponge, and then scrub with the FloorMate.I like the Grout Brush, but there are two improvements I would make. First, I would have a longer handle. With the short handle, it's definitely a hands-and-knees operation, and that wears thin when you have many square feet to clean. Second, I would make the bristles stiffer. I've used the brush to clean about 450 sguare feet of tile, and the bristles are already beginning to seem a bit mashed. That might be because I was cleaning very dirty grout, but it does make me think that the life of the brush may not be that long.
