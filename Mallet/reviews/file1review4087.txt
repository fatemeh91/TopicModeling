review/text: Overview: I have been using these blades with my Fusion Razor and they do a great job of giving me a close shaveCloseness: These blades are very sharp and take off hair with one strokeEase of use: All you have to do is snap the handle bit of the razor to the blades and your good to goReliability: I use these blades a lot, they do not dull quickly so I get a long life span out of each of them (usually 2 weeks)Pros: the extra blade on the back for little stuff is actually more useful than one may think, also the strip runs down when you should change your blade which if you are lazy is great.all in all: I would recommend this to somebody looking for a razor that gives a close shave without giving up comfort
