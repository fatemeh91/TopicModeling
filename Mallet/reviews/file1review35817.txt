review/text: I recently started shaving. I used Edge Sensitive Skin. It was like putting lighter fluid on my face and lighting a match. So I bought this.First impression: Very, very thick. You nerd a little more water. It doesn't rinse well. It has an ok smell.Cons: Doesn't rinse well, burned my face a little.Overall, not bad, but my skin says no.I tried Edge Ultra Sensitive. No dyes or perfumes. NO IRRITATION! Great lubrication, closer shave.
