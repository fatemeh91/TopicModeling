review/text: "Nivea Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin' is probably the best shaving gel I have ever used. It is ideal for those of us who have sensitive skin in the neck and beard area that becomes red and sometimes inflamed after shaving. This shaving gel allows me to shave very close both with the grain and against the grain without irritation.I have been shaving my head for over 10 years and this shaving gel allows me to get the cleanest, closest and smoothest head possible. Even after shaving my head with the grain and against the grain and doing it several times at one shaving I get no irritation and never get a cut with the razor. I recommend this shaving gel to anyone who wants the clean shiny smooth bald look on their head. I also recommend it for the shaving of the face for closeness without irritation. I feel it is a slight bit expensive, especially when you use it on a daily basis for shaving both your head and face. While the fragrance is not bad, I feel it is a slight bit strong and clashes with any cologne one might wear.
