review/text: I used this brand during pregnancy because they offered mini-tabs since I have a difficult time swallowing normal size pills. It would be so nice if they offered minis in these.After using this for just over a month I have really noticed a big difference ! I've suffered from depression on and off since middle school, I'm now 26, and I feel so much better on them. It is annoying to have to take so many, I just take 3 at break feast and 3 at lunch. At first I took these with extra vitamin B pills and I had the runs all day, when I cut the extra B's out I was fine. These are safe but still entirely powerful.The size of the pill hasn't bothered me too much so far even though it's bigger than I preffer.
