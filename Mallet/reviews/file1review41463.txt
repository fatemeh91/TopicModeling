review/text: I was having quite a bit of trouble with lower back pain and after talking to a friend of mine who is a physical therapist, he recommended trying an orthotic. I saw an infomercial for the WalkFit and decided to give them a try. I felt relief almost instantly. They didn't solve my problem entirely but they certainly helped a great deal. I've had them for two months now and I noticed that they're starting to wear a bit - probably because I switch them between shoes and wear them all the time. I need to order another pair so I don't put so much wear and tear on the same set. Overall, I've been very happy with my WalkFit orthotics.
