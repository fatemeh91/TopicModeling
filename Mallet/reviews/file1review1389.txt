review/text: This Detecto beam scale is a quality (MADE IN THE USA) product. The assembled product feels rigid - NO loose pieces - NO bent metal..... SOLID construction. Just like the ones in the your physicians office.It is shipped in one large flat sturdy box. Inside are two components... one inner box contains the base plate/stand and 6 screws. The other piece is the upright center column.Assembly is quite simple... connect center column to base plate. I must confess, at my age I needed the assistance of my son to do the actual assembly.Once assembled... the calibration is very simple. I was weighed at my physician's office this evening, and the weight matched the Detecto scale weight.This same scale is just under $275 at a medical supply store in town. My cardiologist's technician informed me where to purchase this scale..... my cost in Amazon was under $165..... thank you AMAZON
