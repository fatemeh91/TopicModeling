review/text: A product that actually does MORE than it promises. You name it, and I've tried it ... and nothing comes close to this product when it comes to shower stalls and tiles. Almost totally effortless ... and the results are astounding. Spray ... and walk away. And when you return, it's all done. Heavy grout soil? Zap! Gone. Mildew? Gone! Floor tiles in the shower come as clean as can be. I was a thisclose to spending a mini-fortune to have a grout expert in ... just because I couldn't stand the grungy, mildewy grout lines. A few bucks and all was very well.I NEVER write reviews like this ... but this was no chore at all. I wish I had a piece of the action ... this is brilliant. Btw, a single bottle will last for months ... in actuality, it's more cost effective than anything else. And you won't have your bathroom ... (and maybe your bedroom, too) ... smelling like a janitorial supply store. There is no odor that lingers. The air is as fresh to breathe as you can imagine ... and the stains are GONE.Even used it on a water stain on the ceiling ... using a brush to appy ... and the stain vanished ... AND NEVER RETURNED EITHER.I walk down the cleansing aisle in the local supermarket and laugh my chops off ... because those products do NOTHING ... except make your house smell like a hospital room. Instagone is fast, economical ... and you won't believe your shower area could ever look as good.I know there's more hype around than air sometimes ... but every once in a while you find something that actually does what it promises to do. That alone is a shocker. Then comes the realization that you have solved one of life's most annoying and sloppy tasks ... with a spray bottle no less.Give it a shot ... and hold onto your jaw 'cause it might hit the floor.
