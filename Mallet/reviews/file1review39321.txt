review/text: This arrived very quickly which was good. However, even though it does pull my shoulders back a little, I was hoping it would pull them back more. I do use it as it does make me more aware of my posture. It is certainly better than the other Underworks product that I ordered at the same time and which was three times the price (New Posture Corrector back Support Brace)
