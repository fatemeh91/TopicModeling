review/text: I don't normally write these reviews or leave feedback, but my fiance/now wife and I have not been using any form of protection since July.. We weren't trying to the point of calculating ovulation or anything like that but we obviously weren't preventing anything from happening. I started taking this stuff end of September/Beg. of October 3x a day (in the morning w/ my breakfast) and today we took a test and received a positive. Maybe it has nothing to do with this, but based off all the reviews and how I felt different down there (felt like i had blue balls to an extent). Anyways, I would say this stuff definitely works. 1 month in and pregnant. Obvioulsy a lot of things can happen, especially in the first trimester, so we are not announcing it to extended family / friends for a while.. but hopefully everything goes smoothly with the pregnancy.
