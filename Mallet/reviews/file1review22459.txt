review/text: Had been giving my son Animal Parade Vitamins by Nature's Plus for a few years and he seems much healthier. I've been trying to find a good vitamin for years and decided to try the Nature's Plus Source of Life. Have been very happy with them in comparison to other vitamins and will continue to use them. Shipping was very fast.
