review/text: i have been most pleased with this product. along with the cruzer 3 i have a braun 8585. i bought the cruzer for the trimmer. i have a very large thick stache . this unit is not an 8585. with that said. it is a damn good trimmer. and for a quick clean up shave is quite good. don't expect a 50 dollar unit to shave like a 150 dollar unit. but for a trimmer. which it is why it is designed. it is as good as it gets without your barber doing the work. they provide a length guide or you can go it free hand. i will replace with the same if the battery ever dies. good luck stache guys.
