review/text: This gizmo is a costly dud. The first set of test strips let me use it successfully twice. The machine insisted the rest of the strips had passed the expiration date. They had not. Then the last strip worked. I must have made a mistake, I thought, so I stupidly bought another $25 box of test strips. Now, the machine simply rejects the lot number which you must dial in. It will not accept even one of the new test strips. I emailed the company's "customer service" department. They eventually gave me a refund for the second box of strips.Do not even think about buying this thing.
