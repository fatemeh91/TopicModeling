review/text: First off -- After reading most of these reviews, I really wonder what this world is coming to (lol) People complaining about the size of the pill? Well, yes, it may look rather large and scary to swallow, but there's always a way to fix that. Unless everyone that complained about the pill size wasn't using their brain. What I did was bite it in half, drink a sip of water and swallow. (they are not hard to bite through.) Then swallow the other half. Ta da. Problem solved!Now for the good stuff. I was drawn to the "Once a Day" label on the package, and of course that these pills are all natural, made from plants, "gentle" and easy to digest for pregnant women and comes with every vitamin/mineral you and baby need. This product proved to be wonderful. I feel great taking these, I look FORWARD to taking them. And what's strange? I actually am addicted to their smell! They have this herb-like/vegetable scent that I find so delicious. Anyway, I am now 38 weeks pregnant and still using them once a day. I absolutely love them and will recommend them to any mommy!
