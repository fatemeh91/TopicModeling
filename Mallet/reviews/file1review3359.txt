review/text: Arm & Hammer is the only antiperspirant I have ever used that is totally 'irritation free'. All other antiperspirants I have used irritated my underarms. I have gotten rashes, prickly heat, redness and itching from the use of all other products. I began using Arm & Hammer Powder Fresh Antiperspirant about 9 years ago. Since then, my underarms feel, and smell like a newborn baby's. Soft, clean, and fresh! Outstanding product!! I would recommend it to anyone.
