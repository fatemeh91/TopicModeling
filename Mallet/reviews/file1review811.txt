review/text: Just what you need at home to replace those lost little screws from your different eyeglasses. It has some nose pieces and some nuts and plastic washers that may come handy too. A delicate arrangemente of parts that include 'friction tightening screws' too, though I prefer to match the slot. One little piece of advice: when replacing the screws use some nail paint or shine on the new screw. The nail paint will glue the new screw in place and it won't be loose again!
