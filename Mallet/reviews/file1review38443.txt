review/text: I have had many different types of epilators before from rubber band types to coiled metal springs, none of them ever pulled out much hair and the i ended up just tweezing most of them anyways. My sister had this emjoi optima epilator sitting on the bathroom counter and i just happened to try it. I was super suprised to find that it got all the hair on my face. I hate shaving so i tried cold laser and electrolysis treatment but none were permanent, all they did was make my face all red and turned the hairs white. This little emjoi epilator gets out any hair that you could tweeze with a tweezer, the only hairs left are the ingrown ones which of course is under the skin and cant be pulled unless u get a needle and lift if out. BELIEVE ME when i say this emjoi AP99 also known emjoi optima gold is the BEST DAMN EPILATOR U WILL EVER GET !! Just make sure u clean between tweezers when u see build of dead skin, so easy, i just hold a toothbrush on the lower outer edges on both sides while its on and it cleans itself. I cant say enough on how good this thing is, and im not exxagerating cuz i hate bull crap reviews on worthless products like anyone else.
