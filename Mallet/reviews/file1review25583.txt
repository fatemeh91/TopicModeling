review/text: That's right, ouch. I'm surprised other reviews haven't said this thing friggin hurts to use. A few point to keep in mind; I have used a nose trimmer before w/ no problems (chrome Remington model). By "hurt" I mean it doesn't feel good, not "I'm a puss". Lastly, I have nose whiskers not just nose hair, this matters. Just like shaving your teenage peach fuzz was no hassle compared to knocking down the man beard. This trimmer pulled out some hair and kind of ground down the rest. I think it would do a better job cutting finer hair... not the 20 gage wire I'm growing. Overall this product gets the job done but I would not recommend it.
