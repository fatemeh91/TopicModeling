review/text: This is my second Wahl 4000 (or 7367-500) Shaver. The first one is about 7 years old and still runs fine but the battery doesn't really hold its charge anymore. Since I had to keep it on the charger nightly in order to use it, I decided to get a new one. I highly recommend them...it's a good product.
