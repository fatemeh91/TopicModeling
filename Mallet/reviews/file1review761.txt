review/text: I would hate to try and survive without these. I panicked when I could no longer find them in the stores, and life was good again when I found them on Amazon !!! I know, that sounds a bit like &#34;over sell&#34; but, these little cloths are just so perfect for so many things: from smoothing drywall taping compound, to removing anything sticky, or stuck, in the kitchen. They last forever, and do just about anything you ask of them..
