review/text: First of all, I never wrote a review, but this thing sucks so bad, I had no choice. Consider this a warning.First of all, the magnifying lens is useless. If you were tweezing your brows, you would have to hold it almost vertically just to see thru the lens. I dont know about everyone else, but I hold mine at slightly more than a 90 degree angle. The people who made this must have forgotten that your eyes are under your brow not over it and a mirror would not help with this very much. And if using the lense, you would have to pull the hair straight down instead of in the direction of the hair growth like youre suppose to. So basically the lens is nothing but a piece of plastic that just gets in the way. Attempting to actually make use of it, will only make tweezing more complicated. And it really isnt.And the light is a sharp blue LED which is almost too bright. Honestly I dont see the point. Maybe if it was just a regular light (not blue) it would soften the glow a little bit, making the hair easier to see. I just turned it off.I tried to use it as a regular pair of tweezers, and the palm of my hand started to get sore. The Luma Tweeze is made slightly wider because of the lense and the light in the middle. It is actually too bulky to even use as a regular pair of tweezers.I figured this thing would be too good to be true. I love cool gadgets. Too bad this was not one of them. So instead of ordering it online and paying for shipping, then again for shipping if I had to return it, I went Beyond. I mean Bed Bath and Beyond. They had it for $6.99. Not too much of an investment for something that doesnt work. But I prefer to get my money back and buy me a nice pair of plain tweezers that I can actually use.To LumaTweeze......Thanks but no thanks.
