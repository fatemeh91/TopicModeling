review/text: I love this for between vaccuum days. It picks up so much more debris than I thought it would. My 18 mo son uses it too (that's mostly why I wanted it since he doesn't use the vacuum very efficiently). I removed two links in the handle and it is perfect for a toddler to use and maneuver and the bins even need to be emptied after he uses it! Saves me some electricity and allows my son to be helpful.
