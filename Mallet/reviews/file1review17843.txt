review/text: This unit needs to be usable in all respects by anyone who might need help remembering to stay on a medication schedule. That would mostly be older people. In that respect it falls far short. Two stars instead of one because it does hold pills and you can get them out reasonably easily (assuming you've re-assembled it correctly; see below).1. The slots do hold several pills (as advertised) but they are narrow and hard to fill without spilling a pill into a neighboring slot.2. If you take it apart to wash it it is hard to reassemble. In particular, the center unit that holds the clock has to be inserted just right, which isn't obvious. Once that is in place, putting the cover on is pretty simple, but it's easy to get the center unit wrong.3. The clock/alarm is a joke. First, it only alarms once a day, which makes no sense for someone needing to take meds more often. Second, it's hard to set (hold down two little keys, release, then press another to adjust hours or minutes). Third, the display is small and not well lit. Fourth, there is a "reminder" function, which requires more button pushing and notifies you in a fixed number of hours (not hours and minutes, just hours) and is easy to confuse with the alarm (which is a once a day setting). Fifth, the alarm is both a buzzer and a small blinking light, but turning the buzzer off (using the very small switch on the clock unit) also turns of the flashing alarm. So if you just want to be reminded by a flashing light that you need to take your meds this morning you can't do it. And if you want to be reminded in the morning and evening, forget it.4. The manual is not much help.Seniors would need considerable help setting this up, if it's appropriate at all. We'll probably return it.
