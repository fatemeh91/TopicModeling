review/text: This stuff is awful! I read most of the reviews beforehand and when I opened the canister (I have the vanilla flavor), it smells wonderful. I'd almost equate the smell to vanilla bean ice cream. But I've mixed it with water and milk and it always tastes SOUR. It's disgusting and impossible to choke down and now I can't return it as it has already been opened. Don't buy!
