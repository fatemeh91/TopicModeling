review/text: I'm probably the realistic target market for an item of this dimension- a male size queen. It's the right width for me, working on depth. But this isn't the right toy to do it.Y'know all those warnings on the 8-inch variation about how there's something wrong with this and it burns the exact sensitive tissues you'd be using it with? This has the exact same problem. It's too large to use condoms as a workaround.Mine was packaged plastic-sealed over a cardboard backing. The cardboard backing had a moisture stain pattern obviously related to where it was contacting the toy. There's definitely something chemically wrong with this product.
