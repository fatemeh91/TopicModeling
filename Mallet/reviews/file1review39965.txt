review/text: I have fibromyalgia and IBS and I am sensitive to a lot of ingredients. This is one of the few I can use daily without any adverse effects. No sugar added, no artificial sweeteners- so I can use with my HG (hypoglycemic) diet. Doesn't taste great but doesn't taste bad either. Doesn't taste like much of anything and does dissolve better than most protein mixes. I mix with water and olive oil, and sometimes some sugar free splenda raspberry "syrup." (DaVinci syrups)Watch for newer changes and versions of this product. The only one I know to be 100% good for HG is the natural vanilla flavor.
