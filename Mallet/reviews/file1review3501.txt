review/text: This is a great personal lubricant that doesn't dry up TOO quickly. When it dries it isn't AS sticky as other lubes, however it is still sticky. I suppose it's average really. Be forewarned that it DOES smell like bubble soap. It isn't noticeable unless it's near your face so it shouldn't be that big of an issue. It's not too watery, but not too thick. A little goes a long way when mixed with saliva or a few drops of water as recommended.
