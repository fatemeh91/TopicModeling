review/text: I saw that this was reviewed badly and I wanted to offer a REAL review. I'm not sure how a natural product like this could make someone feel bad. If you look at the ingredients, they are all very healthy and safe. I give this to my family regularly and have for years. Never had a problem. Vitamins that you buy at the grocery store have synthetic and unnatural ingredients. They are bad for your liver and overall health and most of the ingredients are from China. When you buy a natural product like this, this is what vitamins are supposed to be.
