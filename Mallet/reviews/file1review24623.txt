review/text: This product gives me energy and actually medicates my ADHD and helps me lose weight. However, I take only 2 tabs a day in the morning with a big breakfast. Taking 6 tabs as directed caused me to sweat and caused my heart to beat really fast but other than that this is the perfect drug. This prevented me from getting fired from my job made me more productive and clear headed I don't drink coffee so it was just the perfect caffeine supplement for me. It handles my ADHD that has troubled me since childhood. I can't say enough good things about this drug....but like I said before definitely take less than instructed and with food as it causes nausea. I love it it is more pleasant than Ritalin. Thank you Zoller I rely on this drug daily to make me productive and energised.
