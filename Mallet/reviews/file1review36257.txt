review/text: This is a great talking clock because you can't accidentally change the time or set the alarm reaching for the button to tell the time. Our previous model the set buttons are next to the announce button and large enough to be accidentally pressed. We would have to reset the time and turn off the alarm frequently. This is good for my mother to only have 1 easy to use button to press.
