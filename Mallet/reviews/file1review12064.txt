review/text: I appreciate only having to take one pill a day - I would have a hard time gagging down the five pills a lot of brands list to take. Also, this one has a lot of natural ingredients for settling a pregnant stomach and making you feel more comortable lik the ginger juice. I took the bottle into my OB after he prescribed me a pre-natal, and he told me that this one looked great. I wanted him to sign off on it before I made the switch during my first pregnancy, and he gave it a go. If your worried, take the bottle into your doctor and let them look over the list. I've trusted this one for years, and it has done a great job helping me produce healthy babies :)
