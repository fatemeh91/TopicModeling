review/text: I tried this diet pill in 2003 after having a daughter I went from 180 lbs to 115 lbs.Now,I gain few pounds since,work and night school so,I plan on taking them again.They did make me have tons of energy and not eat but,I love the fact that I lost weight with ONLY this product.I have to be faithful to something that works.I take only ONE PILL since,I don't want to go nuts to lose too fast.I'm in no rush to be thin.Iam now 140 lbs and my goal is to be healthy 130 lbs.Having a family who has health issues,i don't want to be one of them.So,do this for health reasons not too be skinny period for the fact that it DOES WORK FAST.In 2003 I lost total of 50 lbs and got scary skinny to 109 with 2 pills so..This time I will try one pill.can wait to get it.
