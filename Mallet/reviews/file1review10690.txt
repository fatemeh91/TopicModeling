review/text: I've tried several versions (and not bothered to buy even more) of pill organizers and have never found one to work as well as this one. The separate compartments for each day make it easy to take pills along for the day, and the entire unit is small enough to travel with conveniently.I take meds four times a day. Including vitamins and supplements, three of those times takes considerable space. This organizer holds them with some space left over - which, of course, is the idea so they don't fly out when you open the compartment.Every one of the twenty-eight lids still snaps shut securely after a year of use. Filling the compartments is like other systems; difficult to hold the lid up and put pills in at the same time. I've found an easy solution to fill this one. I hold all four lids open in the center with a rubber band stretched around the upper edges of them (but make sure the rubber band is large enough to not add "twist" to the lids by being too tight).If mine broke tomorrow, I would simply order another without even looking for anything else. It just works that well.
