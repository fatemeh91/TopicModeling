review/text: All this proves is the power of the placebo effect [which is very strong in certain people]. A recent [Cochrane Library] medical meta-analysis of all the "trials" showed an overall effect of 0.2-days of relief! The reason you feel crummy with flu is because it takes that long to generate the antibodies to clear the virus from your blood, and to generate CD8 T cells [white blood cells] to knock off infected cells tricked into producing the virus.This product [which is just powdered sugar] claims to be produced from duck liver which is "a natural reservoir of influenza viruses". This is not true; viruses tend to be species-specific and this is certainly true for human influenza viruses. An extract is then diluted out a gazillion times, but this leaves an "imprint". An imprint of what? The influenza virus? Why doesn't the product then itself give us the flu? How does our immune response make a response to a ghost? My hearty congratulations to the French charlatans who stick sugar in a bottle and sell it for over 10 bucks at a time.
