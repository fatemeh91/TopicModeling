review/text: My wife and I have been purchasing various items from Amazon for years, and we have never been disappointed until now. The issue is not about the cost of the item, it is about the seller NOT specifying that the item could not be returned. The collar does not fit me. Therefore I cannot use it. I would suggest that all Amazon customers make purchases of items offered by Amazon ONLY!! That is what our family is going to do from now on.
