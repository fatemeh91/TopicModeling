review/text: I first tried this lube when it came out and was quite expensive, and stopped using it until it dropped considerably in price. About a year ago, KY raised the price by a considerable amount, and at its present available cost I don't think it represents a good value. There are other silicone-based lubes that work just as well or better for cheaper. The lube is decent, though, for a silicone lube. It's long-lasting, like one would expect from a slicone-based lube, but unlike many it leaves only a slight residue and has less of a slimey feel than many.Intruige falls short in the bottle department, though. The lid is terrible, and probably half or more of the bottles I've used leaked considerably. Nothing like having to store your lube in a plastic bag to keep it from soiling every surface it touches. Nothing sexier than a sandwich bag to mix it up a bit, huh? Anyway, as a silicone-based lube, Intruige risks staining some fabrics, so it's a especially bad for it to have such a lousy lid design.
