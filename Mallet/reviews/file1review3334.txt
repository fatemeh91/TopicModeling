review/text: The effect with this stuff is mild for me. I feel slightly in better spirits. Have less social anxiety. I am so happy to have something that improves my life like this. I would not ever take RX drugs, I don't have such major issues as to need them and I think they are unhealthy. Its great to have a natural AND organic (that's a big one for me with supplements) that makes me slightly calmer.
