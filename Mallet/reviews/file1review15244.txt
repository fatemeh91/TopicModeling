review/text: This is by far my favorite Balance bar flavor - and hard to find in the stores. Chocolately. Nice chewy texture, with some nuts. Just the right amount of sweetness. And for you nutrition buffs - this flavor has no fractionated palm or kernel oils in it -usually a component of the candy like coating of most other flavors..Yumm! Another bonus for people who need to avoid gluten - this is one of the few bars that does not have a "candy coating, is high protein, and is also gluten free - many of the coating free "trail bars" bats contain oats or barley, which contain gluten, or rely on nuts, and are high in fat and low in protein.
