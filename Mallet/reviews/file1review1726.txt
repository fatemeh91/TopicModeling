review/text: I began having tinea versicolor my sophomore year of college on both of my ankles. At the time I thought they were just a strange arrangement of freckles so I didn't do anything about it. Flash forward 4 years and I still hadn't done anything about it, but by know both patches had grown to cover the posterior aspect of nearly my entire lower legs, and wrapped around to the anterior portion of both legs. I began using both 2.5% selenium sulfide and 1% clotrimazole to treat it. The clotrimazole seemed to work well at first but then I began to have a skin reaction to it. The selenium sulfide worked minimally, I'm guessing because the tinea had been growing so long.After 2 weeks of minimal results I switched to this FungaSoap Tea Tree oil. This has been the only product with which I have seen a marked improvement in my tinea versicolor! In about a week's time, the patches have dramatically faded, nearly to my normal skin color, and the borders of each patch have shrunk to about 1/2 their size before treatment began. This is a great product that has worked many times better than prescription strength products.A few things to keep in mind: The bottle does not come with instructions! This can be a little frustrating, but here's what worked for me:With the FungaSoap Tea Tree Oil, purchase a bar of Lava Soap from any CVS or Walgreens or from amazonScrub the tinea versicolor patches with the Lava Soap and leave the soap on for 5 min. This exfoliates the skin and fungus, allows the FungaSoap to penetrate slightly deeper, and helps begin dry out the oils and moisture from the skinRinse the Lava Soap off wellApply the FungaSoap liberally to versicolor patches and let sit for 15 min. You'll probably feel a tingling or burning sensation, especially where the tinea isRinse well but do not wash treated area again with any soapDry area thoroughlyTreat 1x/daySome reviewers have stated that they have used this FungaSoap for full body bathing, but it seems a little strong for that, especially on your face. Some have complained that the soap stinks. While it does have a strong smell, it's nothing compared to selenium sulfide. Avoid letting the Tea Tree Oil sit in skin folds or sensitive skin areas to keep from having irritation to it.Bottom line is it's a great product for tinea versicolor, and probably other topical fungal infections.
