review/text: I bought this because it said it was a foaming cleanser. Instructions said turn nozzle to "FOAM." I had two settings ON and OFF so itturned it to ON. When I sprayed it, I got a runny, dribbly mess than ran everywhere and stunk to high heaven. I live in a 2-storeyhouse and you could smell it everywhere. I left it for 10 minutes and wiped it clean - I just had to do it again. I could have useda 99 cent bottle of bleach and some water and gotten the same result. Very disappointed.
