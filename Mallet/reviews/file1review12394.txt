review/text: Love these things! We take them for whatever mail ail us and they just work everytime! These are coated like candy so you don't really need a liquid if you're out on the run. Great stuff, can't say enough good about it - just buy it but be sure to NOT take it on an empty stomoach. It will tear up your stomach and will probably come back up for a little "chat" if you know what I mean! Highly Recommend!
