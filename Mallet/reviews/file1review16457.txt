review/text: I've used Tom's of Maine toothpaste, love it and decided to try its natural deodorant. The Long Lasting Honeysuckle Rose smells uniquely vibrant and applies clear. It's not an antiperspirant so it won't prevent sweat. After using aluminum based, fabricated scent deodorants, this product is a pleasant change. There are several scents to choose from, some of which contain zinc. I stick with the HoneySuckle Rose or Soothing Calendula, both of which are zinc free. Another great product from Tom's. Love the brand, don't ever stop producing.
