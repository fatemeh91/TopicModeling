review/text: Honestly, I ignored other ppl comments in regards to the taste. I've taken many supplements, and I think (most) people are just fussy when they say they dont' like the tasts of stuff such as gu energy gel or whey protien. Well, this stuff is horrible! I sipped some and almost puked all over my desk at work! You can mask it with lemon juice.I can't say much about the results since I just started taking it - but from the research I looked into, this can benefit. I mean, lots of protein and water is 95% of diet...so I doubt I'll be buying this stuff again. I'll be lucky to finish this order since it tastes so bad.
