review/text: This is the flosser I use in my office. It has a stout plastic handle with two forks with slots for easy loading of a piece of dental floss (of your choice). The floss is secured by wrapping it around the mid-handle button.This flosser enables the user to reach all areas of the mouth quite easily. No more purple floss-wrapped fingers!With three to a package, this is a bargain, as the flossers will last years. Get one for each family member!Flossing is often the most overlooked oral hygiene practice, yet, is essential for cleaning off plaque from between the teeth. Flossing prevents cavities in-between the teeth, and also cleans away gum disease pathogens. Brushing and rinsing is not enough - make flossing a part of your daily oral hygiene habit.The only floss that I have (occasional) problems loading onto the holder is Glide. It is "slippery" and may loosen, therefore, it takes an extra wrap or two around the handle button.Konedog
