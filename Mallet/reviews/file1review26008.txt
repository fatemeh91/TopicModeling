review/text: This is just a piece of plastic with a piece of foam glued to it. The foam has cutouts for the eyes, so you'll get good blackout when using it. Ergonomics are poor, and it oozes cheapness. So, practical and useful, but not very nice looking. I keep it in an end table drawer for occasional use in the living room on the sofa.
