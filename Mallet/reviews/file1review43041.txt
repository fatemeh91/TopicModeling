review/text: This has been a wonderful support during my 2nd pregnancy. I wish I had used it with my 1st pregnancy. I wear it all of the time unless I'm sleeping. I have fewer contractions and zero back pain. The pelvic pressure is very minimal. I travel for a living and this has allowed me to do my normal daily activities without pain. I also like to walk, typically 2 to 3 miles at a time. At 37 weeks, I can still walk and not have pelvic pressure or pain. I recommend this to everyone. The only negative is I had to reinforce the straps. The straps started to pull away from the band. I did buy the correct size. I'm not sure if it's b/c I wear it ALL of the time. Even with this negative, I still recommend it. I also wish I would have bought 2. I don't like to go without it when it's in the laundry.
