review/text: The old adage, "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is," is perfectly applicable to Lavilin. I researched this product and read the reviews here (among others) and decided to try it with a positive attitude. To be fair, Lavilin is better than nothing in that it offers very, very minimal protection against odor as opposed to using nothing at all. However, after weeks of use I have come to find that eight to ten hours is as far as any real deoderant protection lasts, after that the least bit of excercise, etc., causes a significant increase in underarm odor that is very noticeable. Daily application is necessary, and that coverage is marginal at best. Yes, I followed the application instructions TO THE LETTER. I think the rave reviews for Lavilin are mostly due to wishful thinking. My recommendation is do not be taken in by this modern version of Snake Oil.
