review/text: I have been using this product in my dishwasher for awhile now and with no additional products, such as extra powder or separate extra jet dry. The products fits nicely into one of the two sections available for washing products. They are wrapped individually, but are easy to unwrap and drop right into the approrpriate dishwasher tray without touching the product and I have never lost or dropped the ball anywhere but the proper place in the dishwasher. To me they don't smell bad, don't particularly smell orange, they just smell like dishwashing cleaner and actually barely have an odor all on the dishwasher begins to receive the water.My dishes come out completely clean without residue, water spots, or film. My dishwasher is not the top of the line as dishwashers go, it is reliable, with no bells or whistles, really just the bare minimum necessary to qualify as a 'dishwasher' actually. Still, having used other products previously, I know that sparking clean dishes can be achieved by using top-notch cleaning products - and this product, even in my plain, ordinary dishwasher is top-notch all the way.At one time I purchased this product in a 'tin'. If there is anything I think could be improved it would be selling them in a tin instead of a box; but that is not a deal breaker when I consider how well my ironstone, crystal, stainless, and silverware, as well as my stick-free pots and pans, look after washing them in Finish Powerball Tablets with Orange Scents. I highly recommend this product.
