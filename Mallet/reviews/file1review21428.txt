review/text: We were a little disappointed that none of the stores carry these toothbrush heads for the Oral-B Sonic Toothbrush anymore. But we were so excited when we discovered they had our toothbrush heads on amazon. They are the same brand we used to buy in the store just a couple dollars less online for 3 toothbrush heads instead of just the one we used to buy for the same price, which is fabulous! This product is superb because they last up to 4-5 months before having to change the head on the toothbrush. Plus they ship pretty fast. A win, win for this product!
