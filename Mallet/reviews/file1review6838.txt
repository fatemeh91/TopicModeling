review/text: I would probably have returned this "loupe" (actually a cheap magnifying glass)if shipping hadn't exceeded what I paid for it. I have a true loupe, a 4x Schneider that cost me $80 on eBay. I thought that, for $6, a 10x loupe would be handy for focusing my medium and large format cameras. It didn't work out that way.Only the very center area is in focus, more or less. One's eye has to be back about 5-6 in. from the "loupe". This all means that you only see a very tiny area, which makes using it a real pain. Comparing what I see with this thing at 10x and what I can see with my Schneider at 4x, I wonder if it's really 10x.I''m not a happy customer. This is the first crummy thing I've gotten from Adorama, having been a steady customer of theirs for several years. I'm disappointed and saddened.
