review/text: My daughter had the munchkin duck tub for awhile until it broke. Well...she is almost two and I was thinking of getting another one or bath mats. Our tub is very slippery. So I found this one and the age limit was past 2years old so I thought I would try it out. I really think it is a good transition to the tub. It is not real deep and she has lots of room but it still makes her feel safe and secure.
