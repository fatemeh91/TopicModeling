review/text: I bought this kit because several of my sunglasses have lost screws so I just keep buying new ones and wasting my money. I was very disappointed to find out that after I bought this kit NONE of the screws fit in my sunglasses! They were all too small. I'm sad. Now I have to buy some more sunglasses!
