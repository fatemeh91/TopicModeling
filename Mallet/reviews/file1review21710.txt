review/text: Thank god a manufacturer is using there head. This tub is awesome. It fits in the tub great. It gave my child a much more comfortable bath experience than that nasty Swivel Bath Seat. If your child is too small to sit in this seat front to back, rest assured they will fit side to side and still be comfortable. The seating surface gets blown up as well so the child is not sitting on a hard surface. If you need a transition tub, this is the one.
