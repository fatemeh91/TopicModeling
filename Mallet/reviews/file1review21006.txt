review/text: Pros:- Mat itself is comfortable- Relatively inexpensive (or in this case, maybe cheap IS the correct word) for a massaging back matCons:- Cord is short - the picture of the guy on the couch using it is unrealistic unless he has an extension cord under the couch- Low massage strength- Massage areas lose effect when more than one area or heat is turned on (see comment)- Strap that is designed to hold massage pad to chairs is ineffective- Not easy to roll up for storageI purchased this as an impulse buy (for myself) at Christmas time. I intended to use it after my daily gym workouts.Long story short, at high-power, each area gives a so-so massage. However, unless you have hours on end to spend on the pad, that is worthless, since the massage motors are all dependent on one another.What I mean is, if you have one of the zones on at full power with no heat, it works at full power. Add a 2nd section and each section operates at 1/2 power. Have all the sections going, and well let's just say the vibrations certainly won't disturb anyone. Add the heat, and the whole thing might as well be turned off.Bottom Line:Find another option
