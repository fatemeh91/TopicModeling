review/text: I bought a couple of these diapers after reading positive reviews on Amazon, and thinking that All-In-One is a better and more convinient option then cloth diapers with inserts. (We have twins, so dealing with inserts did not appeal to us :-))However, after trying it for a few times, I have to report that it does not hold moisture as well as Bum Genius diaper with inserts. This one looks attractive, and it is easy to put it on, but it does not hold moisture beyond 3 hours of wear (for 8-mth-old boys). That means we could not use it overnight, while Bum Genious diaper worked just fine overnight. Also, after just 3 hours, it was soaking wet inside and my boys had a bit of rash from it. It starts to leak on the sides too. There are more absorbent AIO diapers out there and at a lower price. This one is $20, and Bum Genius is $16. I have not tried the other ones, but this one does not seem to compete as well with Bum Genius.
