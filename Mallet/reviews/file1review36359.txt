review/text: So I know what this product is *really* for, and even though it's amazing for that (as long as you use a condom over it) the reason why I bought this product is for salon waxing.Getting a brazilian can be painful, but if you douse yourself with this stuff 15 minutes before you go in, you feel much less pain. It's quite tolerable actually! with 9% lidocaine it is the strongest analgesic I could find. My doctor could only prescribe me a 5% concentration! This stuff is 100% amazing. I usually bought this for 18$ at a sex store, but on amazon I got 3 for $18! I will buy again when I run out.
