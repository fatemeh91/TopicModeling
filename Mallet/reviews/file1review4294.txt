review/text: I used the Gillette Sensor 2 blade razor for years. Gives an excellent and as close a shave as possible but not easy on skin; left it chronically slightly rough. The 3 blade Mach 3 was as good but couldn't shave under nose closely. The Fusion solved both problems. Shaves as close as the Sensor and has the single edge to shave under nose. And it is very easy on skin of face. The Fusion lasts a month shaving once a day; I've timed several blades.
