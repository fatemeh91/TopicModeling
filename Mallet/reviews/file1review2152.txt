review/text: Used to work in a restaurant where they used Dip-It to clean the large coffee pot. It seemed to work well then, but I was not really into coffee much then. Now, I drink it almost all day and had trouble with buildup in the coffee maker. After about a year and a half of using vinegar monthly and other products several times, the inside was brownish black. I decided to try Dip-It.Wow, talk about surprise! One use and the water came out looking like coffee and it even cleaned the little outlet filter on my Hamilton Beach Brew Station. I just used it a second time after a month and it was not nearly so dramatic, but the coffee maker works like new and the coffee tastes good.Very highly recommended. The highest praise I can give to anything is to say, "It works." This one works.
