review/text: I really enjoy this product. The only thing that's missing is a lock button. It tends to get very slippery at times, and buttons are accidentally pushed, which makes the experience less pleasurable. I would by this product again, but only if it has some sort of locking feature so I wouldn't have to stop and adjust it all the time.
