review/text: Out of the crunchers line BBQ was my fave. They tasted like you were eating a real chip and were spicy to boot. Wish I could find them back on the market.. shame they dont sell them anymore. Also wish i had known earlier that Amazon sold these.. would have saved $$ instead of buying from the stores.
