review/text: This is my first sonic toothbrush and I am please with its performance.Pros:-powerful-long handle makes it easy to reach into tight places-operates app. 2 weeks on one charge (takes 12-14 hrs to fully charge) and the charger unit makes a convenient stand for the toothbrush-charging unit serves as toothbrush stand (would be even better if the power cord was detachable from the charging base to allow for clutter-free storage for the toothbrush between charges)-price; I had considered the Sonicare product but decided on this because of the huge price difference. I am satisfied.Cons:-difficult to complete a full brushing without tapping the power button (first tap cycles to low speed, then off, then full power)-30 second timer is annoying - brush signals by going into a quick on-off sequence for a few seconds.
