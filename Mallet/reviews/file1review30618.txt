review/text: This diaper cream is great. It's fragrance free. It's white so you can see where it's been applied. And it does the trick in preventing diaper rash. I've used it for both of my kids and it's been very effective. This diaper cream used to be cheaper and a lot easier to find (Target carried it); even though the price has gone up and I have to search for it, I continue to seek it out. [If ever a touch of rash does appear, I use Aquaphor (another great product) on the affected area and then coat the entire diaper area in diaper cream.]
