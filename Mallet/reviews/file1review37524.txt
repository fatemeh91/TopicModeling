review/text: It took one little spritz.. My breath was fresher, mintier, and the taste of cigarettes was absolutely gone. I felt like I was kissing the holy mother herself. I got this strange sensation, waving through my whole body like electricity. Colors became brighter, everything was more vivid. Anything that moved left lingering, blurred trails. And then it happened.. I saw god.. He had long hair and a beard, loose fitting clothing and resembled my hippy roomate. He said "hey man! did you see a little spray bottle full of mint? I've been looking all over for it and I really need to find it now or we'll be late for the Phish concert." I handed it to god, a little hesitantly, who just just smiled and laughed. "Thanks dude, have a nice trip!" He even knew I had a long car ride ahead of me, but of course he did.. What a nice guy!
