review/text: I also read the Consumer Reports article, which is why I chose Solgar. I'm happy to report that it's also delicious and blends very well. I blend one to two scoops with milk in a Jay Robb shaker bottle with wire whisk. (They're sold on Amazon.) It doesn't clump at all.UPDATE: After using Solgar for about 30 days now, I've gained obvious muscle mass. I drink it right after my daily workouts. I'm very glad I found Solgar and recommend it to my friends who are also trying to develop more muscle mass and definition. Overall, I've been working out for about a year. But only after getting the protein I need through Solgar did I start seeing this fast muscle gain.
