review/text: My Wife and I both are very happy with our purchase. We were impressed with how fast we received it. It does a really good job on B/P and Pulse rate. You must be careful to place the ARM CUFF properly as it seems to change the numbers substantially if you don't. Very compact and easy to use. After By-Pass surgery in the family this and a Blood Oxygen unit is very useful. We purchased both through Amazon.
