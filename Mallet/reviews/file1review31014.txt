review/text: I bought this 'cause I need it for my mother since she had an arthroscopy in her knee. Her meniscus teared and it was mandatory (according to the doctor of course) to procedd with the surgery. He recommended this product in order to help her with her joints so she couldn't feel pain after the surgery and most of all, to help her with recorvery from the arthroscopy. Along with the rehab, these product have been of much help to her. I fully recommend it.
