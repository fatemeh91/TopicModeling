review/text: For what it does, it works fine. It's comfortable enough but I wish the tempurature would last longer. Seems to weigh down my shoulders which is a good thing. I tense up and raise my shoulders causing pain. This does remind me to relax my shoulders and eases the neck pain but it's bulky.
