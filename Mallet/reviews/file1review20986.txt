review/text: The first thing you think about when you take the Jeanie Rub out of the box is how well constructed it is. It feels like its made of high quality parts, not cheap plastic like most other massagers.The Jeanie Rub performs remarkably well, placing it on a troubled area for a few minutes is all it takes. My only complaint about it is how large the surface area of the massager is. Because of this, you can't really pin point a specific area of the body. You can adjust the intensity as a workaround, but its really not ideal. Overall, very happy with the purchase.
