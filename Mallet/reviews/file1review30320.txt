review/text: I purchased this corded handheld vacumn because another brand unit my wife had had for many years finally wore out. This unit has proved to be a disapointment because of the egeronomics of it. this actual brush/cleaning head is so far from the handle that it puts a large amount of stress on your wrist and tires you out quickly. Also the dirt collection chamger is awkward to open and close and too small so it needs to be emptied often. It does clean but with so many problem I cannot recommend it to others.
