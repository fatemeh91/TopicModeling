review/text: This is a great sweeper for light carpets such as the one I have in the master bathroom. We have ceramic tile on the floor and it sure gets quite cold in the winter to walk on it. So, we installed a bathroom carpet and to use a regular vacuum cleaner only pulls up the corners of the carpet. The Bissell Sweeper is just handy for such a task. It works well in picking up dirt and lint.
