review/text: Bought these batteries about a month ago to replace the ones in our video baby monitor. The batteries that came with it wouldn't last 5 minutes with the video on, if that long, after a 16 months of leaving it plugged in 90% of the time. We got these in, replaced them and now it never runs out but we make sure to leave it unplugged when not in use. For our application these batteries did the trick flawlessly but the real test will be the long term ability to take and hold a charge.
