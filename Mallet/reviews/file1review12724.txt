review/text: I have fat ankles (cankles) and wear wide calf boots. I have a severe strain/sprain and my doctor prescribed a metal lace up brace, but my ankes were to fat to fit. I have been searchinf for a week not for an alternate brand that will tighten on ankle for ZERO side to side motion and free motion in other directions. This brace feels great, but doesn't suit my purpose, so returned. My issue is that the molded plastic brace is flexible - it gives more support than an elastic bandage without the bulk, but didn't full prevent movement. If you have a fat ankle and smaller foot this brand was the ONLY one that fit snug on ankle and opened with full flap coverage on calf. I were a women's 8.5-9 and have a 19" calf muscle whith a cankle below. The XL fit me perfectly (boxes said s-xl so I don't know how they translate here.
