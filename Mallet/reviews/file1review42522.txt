review/text: This protein is comparable to whatever your favorite is. Gone through 7 tubs of various protein products in 2 years and this one is choice. Taste is best for price and amino acid profile is heavy for the price. Good buy. Very stirrable, not clumpy at all really, of course best mixed in a shaker. Better to spend extra 5-8 dollars and get this over body tech, I know I am at least, and I'm a cheap skate.
