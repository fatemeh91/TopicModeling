review/text: I am a bariatric patient and as such my stomach is too small for me to eat enough fiber to get my daily recommended allowance, benefiber has been a life saver for me. It has NO flavor or smell and mixes well with any liquid and even yogurt. I haven't tried it in cooking yet, but I'm told it is just as good in that form as well. I would truly recommend it to anyone needing to up their fiber intake or who wantS to get their kids to have more fiber...they will never even know its there!!
