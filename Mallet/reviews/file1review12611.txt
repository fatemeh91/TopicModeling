review/text: This product is one in a line of many that we have tried in order to help our boy with chronic constipation. He is on the autism spectrum, and like many of these kids, has gut issues. After trying for two years to balance his system, I am happy to say that this product has been the leading contributor to his improvement in regularity. It doesn't taste great, but we mix it with lemonade to make it go down easier. After hearing many parents recommend this product, I'm glad we gave it a chance because it has given us a better quality of life. My boy is healthier, no doubt.
