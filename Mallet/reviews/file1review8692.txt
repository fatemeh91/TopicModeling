review/text: My sister has a pair of these and loves them. I love her pair, too.Unfortunately, I have not been able to get a good pair myself. The one I ordered from Amazon was defective - the tweezer only met at the tippy point, not all along the slanted edge as it's supposed to. Amazon sent a replacement and that, too was defective.I gave this product 3 stars because I know they can make a great pair of tweezers, just not reliably. I would suggest purchasing these from a retail location so you can inspect the pair before you take it home.
