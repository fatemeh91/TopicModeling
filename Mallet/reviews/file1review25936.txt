review/text: These were one of those items on the side of the page that caught my eye. The 4 AAs are 2700 milli-amp-hours (mah) which is the highest capacity I've seen. Duracell NiMH in AA are 1800 mah, for comparison. The charger is quite nice as well, with a 2 or 4 battery selector switch, a wall charger, and a mobile adapter for your car. I'd say either the batteries or the charger are both worth the price, so I bought 4 of them for my model helicopters.
