review/text: My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/s1dAJ ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!I read a article about TA65 Astragalus's effect on telomere lengthening, effectively reversing the aging process. Studies have revealed that astragalus is quite effective in enhancing immune function and can be used to treat a wide variety of illnesses, ranging from the common cold to cancer. One extremely important conclusion from several US studies is that Astragalus seems to help the immune system differentiate between healthy cells and rogue cells, thereby boosting the body's total 'cancer fighting system'.This has been very successful in preventing illness this winter. Working in a health care field, I contact may people each day, and have not been ill yet. When I am around people with colds or other illnesses this helps me with an almost "invisible shield." Additional it enhanced my energy and gave me more power. Amazing!
