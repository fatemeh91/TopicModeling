review/text: I bought two of these, after reading so many great reviews, to cover a large chair in our living room where one of our cats has taken to peeing. He tested it out almost immediately and it worked perfectly! What a relief. There was a lot of pee and none of it went through, the back wasn't even remotely damp. I like this better than the different waterproof bed cover we have for our mattress because this actually absorbed the pee rather than just pooling it on top of the waterproof part. And as many have said, it washed and dried perfectly. UPDATE: I have now had this for many months, in continual use, and have even bought 4 or 5 more. The cat has "tested" it several times and no urine has leaked through to the back side. It has kept our couches completely safe from all kinds of spills.
