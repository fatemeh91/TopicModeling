review/text: Nice toothbrush that meets pretty much every need. The internal clock feature that tells you how long the brush has been on is a nice touch as it really encourages you to brush for a full 2 minutes and the distinct change in vibration at 30 second intervals allows you to be aware of the time without looking at the clock.The only reason I dropped a star is that the brushheads tend to collect water/paste so you have to remove them after each use and clean the unit with a towel or the paste collects and dries under the brushhead. Really a minor annoyance and for the quality of a brushing session it's something that most people wouldn't care about. Besides almost all brushes do it and at least this one allows you to seperate the unit and clean it manually or in a dishwasher.Definitely an improvement over my old automatic brush.
