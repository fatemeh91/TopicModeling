review/text: I've had this shaver for over two years. My interest was in *not* having to clean my shaver - just let the magic box do it. I tend to have to replace the cleaning solution around every 30 days - I would clean the shaver every day. I have a slender face and average to heavy beard growth and for me the shaver did an average job. I noticed I had to go back over some areas and I must have been pressing harder then usual as I would never get 18 months of screen use...more like a year.The cleaning process is noisy it would have been nice if Braun had a delay start or an automatic timer - but since my Braun coffee maker can't keep time on a power loss maybe just a delay start. If your bathroom attaches to your bedroom and you kick off the cleaning process while the spouse is sleeping plan on an early morning fight as you will surely wake up the better half.The cleaning unit takes up a lot of space on the counter and the plug for the unit is oddly shaped and sticks out about 6 inches for the wall. I have knocked it out a few times. This may be a non issue for some as they have kicked off the cleaning process too early too often and now find themselves shaving in the same place you keep the power tools.The shaver is not as loud as my Remington - I think the blades may move slower.The battery seems to have keep it's charging power even after two years.The beard trimmer pops up high enough so you can see what your trimming.As a side note I also bought one for may dad who has more of a rounder face and he noted this shaver did a better job then his Remington.
