review/text: This is the 2nd Oral B electric brush in my house. It replaces the previous generation which went bad after 4 years of multi-person daily usage (the brushes are interchangeable so this is not an issue).I stick with the more expensive Oral B product because of the design and material quality. The new Triumph series is available with some excellent new heads for deeper cleaning. One of Oral B's greatest weaknesses has been the lack of brush-head varieties. The Triumph series finally solves that with a much deeper cleaning 'flossing' head design. This is a HUGE improvement over the standard soft bristle design I've been accustomed to. It also makes it more competitive with the other brands which have offered a wider variety.The LCD display is useful since it lets you know the status of the battery and the duration of your cleaning session. There is a fairly useless mode selector which allows you to cycle between different brushing methods depending on the head you are using. But it seems gimmicky and less effective than the regular brush mode.Otherwise, I didn't buy the Triumph for its new features, but it helped entice me to keep loyal to the brand after the old one retired.It's a fresh new design with the features and quality you expect from Braun
