review/text: I am 25 weeks pregnant with twins, I started wearing mine last week. I purchased a medium size even though the size chart suggested a small, I knew with twins I would get much bigger. The fit is good, I get the much needed support. the design reminds me of the back supports for people who lift heavy loads. Yes, the shoulder straps do show under almost all my shirts but I am more concerned with less back pain, support for my belly and less contractions! I am 5'3 with a short torso and I did not have the fit problems others listed. I strongly suggest for women carrying multiples, its makes a huge difference!
