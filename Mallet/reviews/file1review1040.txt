review/text: Granted these aren't quite as strong as some of the other brands but at 6.95 in the subscribe and save the price is the best around. I take it every couple hours if I need to use it in place of an antibiotic...and it has worked very well. It also seems to be the only brand that has the veggie capsule for those of us that only eat clean foods.Good product, good quality, good shipping...Thank you Nature's Way for providing the veggie cap.
