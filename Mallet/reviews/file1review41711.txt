review/text: I had used a power tooth brush for 15 years,when I needed a new brush, I bought an inexpensive unit and found that the in-and-out pulsations this model offers were not featured on it. In-and out pulsations combined with side-to-side oscillations distinguish this high quality brush. If my brush doesn't have both motions, I don't think it's any better than a manual brush. I also tried going back to a manual brush and found I was brushing too hard and damaging my gums. If painful descaling under the gums has been part of your dental cleanings, this brush will end that. Your time in the chair for cleanings will be short and probably painless. Definitely worth the cost, light weight, I take this brush when I travel as it has a very small charging unit. Since I already was sold on dual-motion power brushes, I found the timing devices and audible signals including the smiley-face handle display amusing and fun.
