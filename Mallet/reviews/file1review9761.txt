review/text: These are great for removing ingrown hairs and splinters. I had an ingrown that was several months old and nothing short of going to the doctor to get it removed was going to work. My waxer recommended these tweezers as a last resort. After a few tries with the tweezerman, I was able to get the hair out. I highly recommend this product to anyone especially if you get ingrowns from waxing or sugaring.
