review/text: Lately I've learned not to assume that a product is safe just because it's sold in a health food store. I recently discovered the Skin Deep Database, where you can look up products and ingredients to find out if they contain toxins. I'd used this deodorant for two years. Even though it only kept me smelling fresh for a few hours, I figured it was better/safer than the drugstore brand I had been using. Wrong! When I looked it up on the Skin Deep Database, I found out that this deodorant rates a 4 on the toxin scale, which is the "caution" range. I switched to Lafe's spray deodorant, which is a 0 on the toxin scale, and it works MUCH better without any toxins. Lafe's keeps me and my husband smelling good from morning to bed time.
