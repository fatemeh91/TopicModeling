review/text: I normally use an electric razor but I'm not happy with how close the shave is. I've wanted to try some of the disposable razors to see if they're worthwhile. I was pleasantly surprised with the Good News razor. It was a very close shave but the razor itself seemed a little light in my hand (maybe I'm too used to an electric). I'll continue to use this razor for a few weeks to see if I can get used to how light it is.
