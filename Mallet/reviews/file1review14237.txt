review/text: Tried many, and did not like any product until we tried this. Started with a small bottle, and we were sold. Haven't had any problem feels fabulous, and easy to use, slippery and feels most like nature. Haven't noticed any funky smell, but I'm not into tasting lube, so don't know about that. Seems to stand up long enough, but as with all lubes, you would probably need to add if you're running a marathon. Overall if you're looking for something that feels great, lasts a while, and get's the job done, then this is the one for you. It's our favorite.
