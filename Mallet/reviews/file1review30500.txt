review/text: I must say that I was not entirely excited when a friend gave this face wash to me as a gift. Perhaps I should have taken offense? In any case, I looked past that as soon as I tried this wash because it is just so great--just a straightforward, gentle cleanser that does exactly what it's supposed to. With all the face washes available out there, you'd think it'd be fairly easy to pick one up that is no-frills and doesn't hurt your skin but it's been a lot harder for me than it should be. So I'm so grateful that this was given to me, just a great overall cleanser!
