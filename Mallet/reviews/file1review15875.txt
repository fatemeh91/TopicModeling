review/text: I purchased this particular belt because of the reviews, plus my local Babies-R-Us didn't have a size small support belt in stock.This belt has turned out to be one of the few lifesavers for my pregnancy -- my sciatica was horrid from month five on, really, and this was the ONLY thing that relieved it. It comes with easy-to-read and understand instructions with pictures and a nice disclaimer about how it doesn't constrict bloodflow, etc. (And it doesn't.)I have yet to wear the upper strap part (it would slide down a little when I was smaller and I've just grown used to not wearing it), though some women might find it useful. I saved mine just in case but have yet to wear it.The only downside I can see (and it's not really much of one, IMO) is you might have to buy some really long, thin tank tops or long john style shirts to wear under the belt, as it could irritate your skin otherwise. But given that I've had a winter pregnancy and the long tanks were readily available from several stores, this proved no problem for me at all.This belt is on my list of must-have things anyone I know who's pregnant and having back or sciatica issues. I highly recommend it!
