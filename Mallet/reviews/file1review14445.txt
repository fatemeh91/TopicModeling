review/text: I bought this Rollator for my brother who has had a mild stroke and has trouble with his balance and stamina. The item was easy to assemble and is very sturdy. It took only 5 to 10 minutes to assemble. It was just a matter of putting the bars in the slots and tightening a couple of bolts. I would highly recommend this product. I saw one at a local medical supply store that was twice the price. I received the package 2 days after placing my order. Great item and great service!
