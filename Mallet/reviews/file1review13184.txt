review/text: I was VERY pleased by the quick turn-around from the time I ordered from Amazon to when I received my order. THANKS!The matress pads I ordered were better than what I purchased at the local store but not as thick as a friend had loaned to our mother-in-law...I think she said hers was "hospital" quality...thicker with a blue background. I really liked the size of the pad that covered a twin bed very nicely!
