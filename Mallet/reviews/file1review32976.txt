review/text: Great deal - ~$40 for a box of 50 strips on a disk and a Breeze 2 meter. If you buy this bundle though - be aware that the Ascensia AutoDisc test strips are DIFFERENT than the breeze2 strip disc that ships with the meter. I didn't understand why the strip discs themsevles had different names until I read the fine print.The free strip disc that comes with the meter is labeled 'Breeze 2 test strip disc' (dropped the Autodisc part of the name) - while the extra box of 50 strips bundled with the meter are named 'Autodisc test strips'. Both versions are physically a foil disk that contain 10 test strips. The differece is that the 'Autodisc' test strips were designed for the ORIGINAL Breeze meter, while the 'Breeze 2 strip disc' was designed specifically for the Breeze 2 meter.The Breeze 2 meter DOES WORK with the 'autodisc' test strips. The difference:The AutoDisc test strips require a little more blood and take ~30 seconds to give a reading. These strips will work in the original Breeze meter AND the Breeze 2 meterThe Breeze2 strips require a very small drop of blood (no double pricking) and give a reading in 5 seconds. These strips will only work in the Breeze 2 meter.So there you have it - I didn't even realize when I placed the order that there were two different types of strips that shipped with the model. Not a big deal - but a little more clairity around that point would have given this transaction 5 stars.
