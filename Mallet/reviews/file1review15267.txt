review/text: I suppose if you're just looking for fuel for your body or emergency food to keep in your trunk, then these would be okay. If I'd purchased this box of Balance Bars, I would've brought it back to the store for a refund. The taste was pretty bad, and the consistency was gummy/muddy. It's better if you have it with a full glass of water, although there's a very strong aftertaste. My husband took a bite and spit it out -- the same with my six year old. My two-year-old son, however, seemed to actually like it and will eat a bar as a snack if I broke it up into small pieces. I just couldn't get past the taste. I still have over a box left, which I'll dole out to my son as snacks, but it's defiantly not something I would ever buy or recommend. In fact, if someone told me they were going to buy them, I'd ask if they'd ever eaten them before and if not, I would tell them pick a different product. Big thumbs down on this one!
