review/text: I broke the little finger on my right hand just below the knuckle about three months ago. I had a partial cast on for four weeks, after which the pinkie and ring finger were incredibly stiff (it's amazing how just a few weeks of immobility can cause your muscles to tighten up).I participated in hand therapy for 12 sessions. The most useful part of this therapy was heat treatment with stretching exercises. To heat the hand, they used a cool machine which bathes your hand in a whirlwind of hot shredded corn husks. After 15 minutes of heating, the hand is much looser and ready to stretch.The corn husk machine costs thousands of dollars, unfortunately. Other alternatives suggested included hot water (wash lots of dishes), paraffin dip, old socks filled with rice and heated in the microwave (helpful!), and long hot showers.I decided to try this moist heat pad after reading the reviews-- it sounded like just what I needed. It works great! It's cleaner than the corn husk machine, handy enough to keep at my desk (so I don't forget to loosen up) and has done wonders to loosen up my stiff fingers. There's plenty of room in the muff-shaped hot pad to stretch the hand in either open or closed fist positions. I use it to warm up the fingers first, then close the fist and stretch them out.Using the pad helped me complete my hand therapy more quickly, and gives me a convenient way to continue working on the finger muscles for the next few months to maximize my range of motion. Great product!
