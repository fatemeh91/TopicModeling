review/text: I like the Jeanie Rub massager but these accessories are flimsy and poorly designed. They fit poorly and worst of all, create a loud annoying rattling sound when the massager is used, especially at higher speeds. I returned this item. A note to those considering ordering from Pro Therapy Supplies: this seller charged a 10 percent restocking fee, claiming there is nothing wrong with this product. I will not be ordering from Pro Therapy Supplies in the future. Consider another seller if you are going to try this product in case you need to return it.
