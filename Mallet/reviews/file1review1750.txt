review/text: First of all, if you don't have acne (like me) and you aren't sensitive to tea tree oil, this is a great wash for your face. Check out those ingredients! All very good stuff in there. I use it to remove makeup from my hands after applying it, and I do use it in the summer time and before pedicures because it's got a great fresh smell. Too bad the name is kind of embarrassing, but I don't mind. It's too good!
