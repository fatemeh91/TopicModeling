review/text: i saw these at walmart sometime ago, but i was skeptical about trying them so i passed them up.i went through just about every eye drop on the shelf and none seemed to help me too much. i was suffering fromsevere dry eye. Some days it was so bad i could hardly keep my eyes open and would blink so much that my eyelids and eyeballswould hurt at the end of the day. i went to see an eye doctor and had no luck getting much help with my condition.He wanted to run more tests which i could not afford and send me on my way with a baggy full of more eye drops.I finally read up on thera tears omega 3 capsules and was surprised to see so many people talk highly about them. So i said tomyself, i've tried everything else, might as well give these a shot.I am about 2 and a half almost 3 weeks into taking these supplements, and i already can feel positive results.I hope im not jinxing myself lol, but i was using artifical tears about once an hour. I havent used them in almost 3 days now!i will keep taking these and write a follow up review in a month and see if they still help me with my dry eyes.I am very greatful for these pills and will most likely continue to take them for years to come.One side note, i read that some people complained about the fishy burps and aftertaste.I stowed mine in the freezer, problem solved! No fish burps or aftertaste!
