review/text: After paying almost $200 for dishwasher repairs, I still had poor performance on the top rack. The repair guy suggested trying Dishwasher Magic, which I was able to buy locally. (The alternative was a new motor and pump.) It's mostly citrus acid, and you run it in the empty dishwasher with the hottest water possible. (I used high temp boost and sani-rinse). Its purpose is to clean out the lime, soap deposits, calcium, etc. that build up in the water tubes. Well, I am happy to report that it performed its job admirably! I hadn't been able to use the top rack in a couple of weeks - just no cleaning power up there. Last night after using Dishwasher Magic, I loaded everything in nice and dirty, just like I usually would, and it came out great. I am so delighted and wish I'd tried it before spending $200 with the repair guy. Maybe that could have been money still in my pocket. The same company also makes Washing Machine Magic. Might be worth a try - maybe my clothes would be twice as sparkling clean!
