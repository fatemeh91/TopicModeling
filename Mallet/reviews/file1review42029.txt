review/text: Upon receiving this supplement from Vitasprings I noticed that the external safety seal had been broken and there was no internal safety seal. Vitasprings said that the only way they could send a replacement is if I would pay the postage to have the damaged or tampered bottle sent back to the company. Since there is a chance that this product had been tampered with, I told the company that I felt a responsibility to dispose of the product. Heck, for all I knew the product that was sent to me had previously been returned by someone else. Who knows what may have been done to it. Destroying the product was the only responsible thing I could do.They still refused to send a replacement without me paying to have the damaged/tampered product sent back to Vitasprings. That is their right and I understand their position but I also feel an obligation to notify the public of the chances they take when dealing with this company.My recommendation is to find another suppler for your vitamin & supplement purchases. One that won't put a bottle of supplements in a box to ship to a customer that has obviously been opened before.This is not a review of the product itself but of the supplier, Vitasprings.
