review/text: You CAN NOT shave with this razor on delivery. Maybe if you have facial hair like I did in the 6th grade. If you have facial hair that's even slightly course ( like most men's are ) this is not going to cut it. After the first few painful strokes that felt as if it was pulling the hair out instead of shaving it off I decided to strop it. 150 strop strokes later ( properly done with the edge trailing I might add ) it improved a bit but still wouldn't take the hair off properly. Pulled out my old trusty Mach 3 and finished shaving. Came honed from the factory but I guess I will try honing it myself and stropping. If I don't get anywhere with it after that to the garbage it goes and a well known more expensive blade will be purchased.
