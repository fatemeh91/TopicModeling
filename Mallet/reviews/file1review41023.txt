review/text: By far the best rush from any energy drink I've ever had. Normal energy drinks over the years have really lost their effect on me, and in turn I'd had to resort to drinking more and more to feel energized. The energy shots like 5hr, etc never gave me a rush, they just usually made me feel hot, flush and at times dizzy. These Redlines, though, perk me way up and do it within 10 minutes. For most you really shouldn't drink more than the half bottle that's recommended. Even on that half bottle I feel more energy and stay "up" longer than with anything else. I also don't feel a crash, as there's no sugar.
