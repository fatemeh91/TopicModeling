review/text: My boyfriend takes his Whey every single day and was devastated when he was about to run out. So as a early Christmas gift I bought him some, and it arrived super fast! My boyfriend makes his with water due to the fact milk hurts his stomach, but I like mine with milk. Either way it's tasty and does the trick! Would recommend the milk chocolate for sure if you like a better tasting Whey.
