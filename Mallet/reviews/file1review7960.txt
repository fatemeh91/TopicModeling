review/text: In my opinion, the handles and grips on OXO kitchen accessories are some of the best on the market. From a design perspective, the soap-dispensing sponge brush is attractive and feels great in my hand. However, the main function of the device is to supply the attached sponge with soap. I have gone through three sponge heads and enlarged the diameter of the soap dispenser hole and I still can't get the sponge to absorb enough soap to wash my dishes effectively. Most of the time I resort to manually squirting a bit of soap on the sponge from a bottle of dishwashing liquid to get the right amount of soap saturated into the brush.I hope OXO can address this issue, as I love how the handle feels in my hand and how easy it is to replace the sponge. If not for the dispensing problem, I would gladly give the brush 5 stars.
