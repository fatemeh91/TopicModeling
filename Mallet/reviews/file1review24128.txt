review/text: I bought these for my father, who is 84 and has blood circulation problems in his feet. He loves them. A couple of minutes in the microwave, and they are ready to provide him with hours of relief. The only downside is that the Cozys are not designed to walk in, which poses a small issue for Dad. But overall, a great product!
