review/text: I just got this product yesterday. I used it to clean out 4 of my water bottles and their lids. Along with a long handle, the brush has bristles that stick up on the top and allow me to clean the bottome of the bottle very easily. The brush also cleaned up under the rim of the bottles easily due to the direction of the bottom bristles. It rinsed off easily and dried quickly. So far, so good. If it falls apart within 6 months I'll revise my review; otherwise I'd recomend it for cleaning water bottles/baby bottles/etc.
