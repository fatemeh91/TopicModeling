review/text: I purchased this item for my daughter as she is quite the sloucher; I was sick of poking my finger between her shoulder blades to get her to stand up straight.This product lasted one day on her. She had major chafing in her underarm area, and it was constantly "riding up" since the elastic didn't seem to pull back. The other reviews are correct in that the product did not come with any instructions; just tossed in a plastic baggie and shipped off. Heck, I didn't even know there was a "this end up" until I read another review.At least it wasn't a major expense.
