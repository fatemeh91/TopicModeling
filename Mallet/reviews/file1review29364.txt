review/text: BE CAREFUL WITH THIS STUFF...Please fully read the FULL directions and FULL precautions... I didn't and I ended up in the worst pain of my life! My husband had me drink a pretty large amount of water. My stomach felt like it was on fire on the inside. I had AWFUL cramping. The water helped alot. Please be careful with this stuff!I gave it three stars to be neutral because i know it was my fault i didn't take it correctly. I ate one (1) single pill with a bowl of raisin brand and did not drink water right after taking the pill... worst night of my life.
