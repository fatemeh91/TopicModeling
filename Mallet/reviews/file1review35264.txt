review/text: I ordered a glycerite. I am gluten free and cannot take extract as it would make me very sick. What arrived was extract not glycerite. It is irresponsible and dangerous to sell herbs and supplements if you don't know the product. If you don't know the difference from a glycerite and and extract you should be selling costume jewelry. They gave me a link to re-order the product which was the same link that I ordered from in the first place.Herb Pharm has great products, "Nature and Herbs" the seller did a terrible job on this order. Going forward I will only order directly from the manufacturer.
