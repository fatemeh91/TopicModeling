review/text: I just recived this today it came fast only took 2 business days && it came in a brown box no details on it about what it is && it was wrapped in a white plastic bag && so that made me happy && this is my first toy && I love it its not that heavy && it takes 3 aa batteries && it does the job && if ur looking for a medium size this is perfect its not to small or big && the only thing I dislike is the smell it smells like rubber but thats just because its new so it will go away hopefully lol I'm happy with my perches I hope this helps others
