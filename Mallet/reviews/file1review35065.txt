review/text: My sleep is such a tenuous thing, I hate to jinx it by saying this works.....but it usually does. I take it with Source Naturals sublingual melatonin, and unless I'm too tightly wound, they help me drift off to sleep in a reasonable amount of time.That said, I have a Shih Tzu who is well behaved until a storm comes up or we take him anywhere in the car, and then he's a shivering basket case, glued to my lap. Funny thing, we used this spray on him once in the car, and the results were so dramatic that we were looking at one another and whispering, "Did he just walk back to his crate and lie down?" We were happy to have found something to calm him down, but since then, I've tried it on him a couple of times with no results at all. Nada. I've tried several other calming, natural meds that don't work, either.So, I'm not sure what's going on there, but I plan to keep using it for myself.....for now. Knock wood.
