review/text: this prental is not only good for everyone but i love the fact that it's the best for vegans! i'm not sure if i feel any surge of energy by eating it, but i know that it's good for me and the baby, so i feel good taking it. i love that it's just once a day and the size isn't too bad. the taste is kinda grosse but it's not like you gotta chew it! (let's say i keep it in my mouth until i can get to the water, so i can taste that it's kinda grosse but that's my fault and i should make sure the water is with me before i pop it in my mouth! lol).
