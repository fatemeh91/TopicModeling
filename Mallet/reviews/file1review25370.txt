review/text: I looked at a lot of other body-fat scales and read the reviews for them on amazon. Overall, this scale probably delivers the most bang for your buck.The scale delivers what it promises: fast and accurate body fat and weight. It lets you store two settings in the memory. If more than two people will use the scale, it has a guest setting that allows the user to enter age, sex, and height.The interface is not intuitive. I had to read the instructions before I could store my information and weigh in. But overall, it's been a great tool to help me get in shape.
