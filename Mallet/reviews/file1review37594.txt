review/text: I am an adult who uses these vitamins so that I can get a lower daily dose. I'm not an advocate of mega-doses, and these vitamins are just right for me. They are the best-tasting of all the chewable vitamins that I've tried, and I like the fact that the vitamin A comes completely in the form of Beta Carotene.This brand comes in two flavors but I like the Mixed Fruit flavor best. The only thing I don't like about them is that they're difficult to find in stores. I'm glad Amazon is carrying them.Recommended!
