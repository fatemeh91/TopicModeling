review/text: Thank you for your speedy response. It did arrive middle of last week. I am not sure if I was mistaken as to the Classic II or III or if I really have just a Classic Stethoscope. The diaphragm did arrive, it doesn't really look the same as I had. Mine didn't screw on to the stethoscope. I had a lot of difficulty put it on. I am not sure I actually did get it on correctly. The diaphragm itself looks much thinner then I had. I will try this one for now.
