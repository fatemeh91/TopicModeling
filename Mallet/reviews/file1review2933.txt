review/text: I used NSP 5W with one of my babies and I am sure it helped with labor and delivery immensely. Our daughter was born about two weeks early, after only being on the 5W for two weeks. My midwife suggested I begin it 4 weeks before the due date. My water broke at 11 pm and she was born around 5 am. I do wish I would have thought of the fact she was born 2 weeks early where my previous children were born late, including twins born 1 day before their due date.Our next baby I also used the NSP 5W. We had been going through major stresses of one of our children having 2 open heart surgeries. I did not realize that my blood pressure was high. One of the ingredients in 5W is Black Cohosh which should not be taken with high blood pressure. Dong Quai Root can also raise BP. I did not realize how high it was. I began taking the 5W and within days I was having more "Braxton Hicks" so I thought. Long story short, thankfully I was in a doctor's office when I suddenly had a placenta abruption - hemorrhaging blood everywhere. On the day I am writing this, is the birthday & deathday of our daughter who was stillborn because of the placenta abruption. I nearly died myself. An emergency c-section saved my life. Had I been at home - and not in the doctor's waiting office right next to the hospital, I would have also died.This being said, I highly encourage any woman thinking of taking 5W to search the risks of each ingredient. I believe that you will find, as I did, that especially with the Dong Quai Root and Black Cohosh, these should not be used until you want labor to START or to get it going more. To start it weeks before is a risk. Also, absolutely know your blood pressure. Keep monitoring it.From my personal experience and knowing several other moms who have had reactions to it within days, I personally do not recommend this product or would never use again.
