review/text: I tried using this product for menopause symptoms supposedly caused by estrogen domininance. I started out with one capsule and didn't notice any difference in the way I was feeling, so I added a second capsule and all it did was give me extrememly bad trapped gas pain, escpecially if I took it with my dinner. I'm guessing it's because it's made with so many cruciferous vegetables. Sadly, I haven't found this product to be of any help to me.
