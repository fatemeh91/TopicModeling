review/text: I had a similar sleep mask before this one. I still love the shape. The molded eye cups are so helpful. WIth other sleep masks my eyes would get irritated but never with this one since there's room for my eyes to blink and breathe even while blocking out the light. I also really really like the pattern. It seems silly but it really does help me keep track of it better.
