review/text: Bought this and Fungi Nail Anti-fungal Solution - 1 fl oz for my wife. Both her big toes were gross and cloudy and cracking. Why it doesn't bother her more...I don't know, but I took it upon myself to buy her these two products.She started using them, and within a week or two...both nails fell out. It was super nasty...but I'm guessing both nails were so unhealthy, they probably would have come out regardless.Over the last 6 months, they've been growing back. One of them looks great, but the other is cloudy. Why? Because she doesn't use the stuff I bought her. :)I can't say what the two products do individually...because she only used them together. For the price though, it's worth some of the more expensive options at the doctors office. But you have to be disciplined and actually put the stuff on!
