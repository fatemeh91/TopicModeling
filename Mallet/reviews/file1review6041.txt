review/text: I had a blood pressue monitor before that was not a wrist model,and I wanted something smaller and easier to use. This wrist model is very easy to use and the readings for BP and pulse are very large and easy to read. Also, the body of the unit appears to be quite substantial and of high quality; the readings are made quite quickly and I like the feature that you can store the data. Summary: it is portable, easy to use, well made, quick and clear readings and appears accurate. I really can find no negatives, and the Amazon ad gave me all of the data I needed before ordering it.
