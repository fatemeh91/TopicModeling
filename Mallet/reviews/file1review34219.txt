review/text: It does smell bad... I agree as one reviewer already suggested that it is going in a place that smells bad already, but the smell can waft up. No joke. Still, luckily and unluckily, I'm not in much of a position for anyone to notice. That said, this stuff really does work wonders. It's cheap but it's very high quality and it got rid of my hemorrhoids in 4 days.
