review/text: Mixes easily with little or no clumping, tastes great, high nutritional content for the price. This is a great &#34;post&#34; drink for workouts when you just can't get to a real meal soon enough or even in the morning before a race. The only drawback is it doesn't really fill you up if you're hungry in my opinion. The price seems steep for the 5 lb. jar, but it lasts a long time and it's nice to have around.
