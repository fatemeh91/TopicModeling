review/text: After trying some of the prepackaged arginine products, I decided to try this. The effects are better with this, and the cost is way less. But after trying a couple of times to drink this mixed in water, there is no way.What I have done is mix this 2:1 with creatine powder. Then I put in a couple of powder drink mix packets in there and shake it up. Easy way to get your creatine and arginine in one drink, and it helps to take the nasty factor out.
