review/text: I really do enjoy this product. One of the best protein bars that I have tasted. Not overly sweet, and the chocolate taste is very rich. These bars are also very filling so you wont get the urge to be snacking right after you eat one. Mine arrived a little melted, but its summer so that is to be expected when a package is sitting on my porch all day. Overall, great product by Met-Rx.
