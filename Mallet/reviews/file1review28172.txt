review/text: I have had this product before in the double chocolate and vanilla flavors, and all i can say is that this strawberrry flavor was just terrible. I couldn't even mix it with other stuff to make the taste go away. Stay away from this flavor, however, the chocolate and vanilla ice cream flavors are great!
