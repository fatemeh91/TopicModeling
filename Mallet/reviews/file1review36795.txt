review/text: This device is very ingenious and works very well with one exception. I wear athletic socks so the sock does not slide on the terrycloth side of the apparatus. It sticks enough that I almost tore the handles on one side pulling. I do think it would be ideal with nylons or smooth socks, and is very helpful.
