review/text: I was informed that the Master Massage tables were top of the line. Couldn't be more false.The cushioning material has already deformed after only 4 months of moderate use.My cheaper massage table I got 3 years ago has held up better.AS a long term Amazon customer, I am terribly upset that there is no option for returnor compensation. Amazon should be ashamed to carry defective merchandise like this.I will be posting negative comments on any and every massage site I can towarn off other unsuspecting professional from making this mistake.
