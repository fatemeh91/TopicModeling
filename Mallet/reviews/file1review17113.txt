review/text: Nobody ever told me this was a mustache and beard trimmer: I've been using it to buzz my scalp (and beard) for years. I've used it two to three times per week, every week, since the day I bought it. It's been around the world in my luggage. I took it to Thailand fully charged, and managed a full month of brisk use without charging it! It's cordless, so I can buzz my hair in the shower and just wash the mess down the drain. Over the years, it's taken a number of tumbles from counters and shelves. The paint is worn through in a few spots, and the tips of a few teeth on the hair guide have snapped off, but it's still very functional, and you can get a replacement hair guide from Remington for just a couple dollars.The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it would be nice if it had a recessed power switch, since it's switched itself on in my luggage and drained itself a few times. In the meantime, I put a piece of tape over the power switch before packing it away. I suppose another con is that the charger is 120V only, which can be a problem for international travel.There aren't a lot of products that I whole-heartedly recommend to friends, but this is one of them.
