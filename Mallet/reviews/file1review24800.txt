review/text: This is about the third or fourth razor of this model that I have owned. I do not use it everyday but am very happy to have it for a quick touch-up etc. Often if I am rushed in the morning and don't take time for a "wet shave", I'll take it with me and shave in the car on the way to work or where ever. It does not give me razor burn although shaves very close. It is easy to clean and the battery lasts a long time. The small profile of the head makes it easy to shave under the nose. It likely would be a fine razor for eveyday use.It's a good product and I recommend it.
