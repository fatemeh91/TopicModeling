review/text: It really has to get me riled to write a review, but this vendor succeded. I have used the product for years with excellent results. Unfortunately the vendor sent me some very, very old product. So old that they were actually past their shelf life of 2 years. Instead of being dry powder crystal the contents of the packets were a slimy worthless gel. Next time I will buy direct from the manufacturer. The entire order wasn't bad; however, the plastic bottle seems to be OK.
