review/text: This thing is simple to setup and use.Overall, it did a good job making my apartment smell nice, but I wouldn't keep it on all the time as the odor can become overpowering (especially if the space you use it in isn't that well ventilated). So I'd recommend leaving it on for a few minutes, then turning off once the fragrance fills the space you're using it in.However, I'd avoid this thing if you're really sensitive to fragrances (such as perfumes, cologne, etc).
