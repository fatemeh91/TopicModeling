review/text: I purchased this only for my skin. It's completely different from the other Vitamin E oil I had which was Sundown Naturals and I did find out it was synthetic oil. As a result I bought the Now E Liquid. I'm new the E oil thing so I don't have much to judge this on other than the other oil I had. This oil soaks into the skin well, it is made of D - Alpha and not DL - Alpha which is synthetic. The other oil didn't really soak into the skin and was A LOT thicker than the E Liquid. It was the consistency of honey. This is more like an oil, olive oil is the only other ingredient listed. This is a darker color than the synthetic which was clear. It looks just like Extra Virgin Olive Oil.I guess my only worry comes from the oil part. I don't have another real Vitamin E Oil to compare it to so I'm hoping it's right and pure vitamin e oil is oily and like extra virgin olive oil. If so, please let me know! I guess it shouldn't matter because EVOO is apparently great for the skin as well but I'm looking for the benefits of the E oil. And it is listed as an oil which is what it is; not thick like honey. But, like I said, I have no other E oil to compare it to that's not synthetic and I hope it's not just 99% EVOO.However, it feels like a great moisturizer and it just feels great in and on the skin. I haven't used it but a couple times because I just received it but hopefully it does well for my skin and I start to see improvements on some of my lines on my forehead and I'm really hoping it helps some of the acne marks left on my chin. I'm also mainly using it as a wrinkle repellant! so far it has been good!
