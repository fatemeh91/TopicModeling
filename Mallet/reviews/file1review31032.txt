review/text: I used it for a while - it gets a good curve in your brim but I found myself going back to the baseball and rubber bands because that gives you the "wrap around" on the edges - this product makes a very consistent arc and IMHO makes your caps look too "country club" With that being said, I think it would work better with golf caps but not on fitted MLB hats where you either go flat brim (not) or ball player style with the sharper curve on the edges.If you are going for country club, this is the product for you of course.
