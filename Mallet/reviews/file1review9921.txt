review/text: I think these are excellent tweezers. The only thing you have to be careful of when you use them is that they are very sharp. I have actually accidentally sliced my finger open with them. But they are great tweezers and work great for removing ingrown hair. Great for splinter removal also. Just be careful of the sharp points when you use them.
