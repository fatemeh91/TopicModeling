review/text: Really glad that a manufacturer finally thought to expand it's absorbent material to minimize leaking diapers. I have tried so many for my disabled son and ALWAYS experienced failure daily from others I have tried, especially when he is laying down. These are great!!! Rarely are the leaks now and though I have to add a insert pad on the side of the diaper when he sleeps (he likes to lay on his side) the diapers usually hold it all in for the night. I highly recommend this product!! The delivery was also well done. Thank you KENDALL!!
