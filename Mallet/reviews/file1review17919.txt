review/text: I just bought my 3rd bottle of Del Mar because I love it so much and can't find anything that smells better. It's not an in-your-face smell, very subtle yet powerful enough that people will know it's you that smells so great. I've never worn it out without someone complimenting me or asking where they can get some. It's an every day scent that is sexy enough for a date, but casual enough for the office. It also mixes very well with other colognes, I've noticed. I often mix in a littleFLORIDA WATER (PLASTIC BOTTLE) Size: 7.5 OZand it even brings out the scent better!Highly recommended!
