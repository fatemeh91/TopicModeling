review/text: I generally have a 28 to 30 day cycle. I ovulate anywhere between CD12 and CD15. I started this product the beginning of my April cycle. My May cycle started a bit unusual; this was the 1st only cycle after taking product for a month, when I hadn't ovulated by CD20, I stopped taking it. I did not ovulate until CD33 (almost 2 weeks later) and wound up with a 45 day cycle. I have not taken it again. Since this cycle, I've been right back on track. I don't know if this product is to blame for that whacky cycle, but its the only thing I can figure. If you do ovulate regularly and on your own, I really don't think this is the fertility blend to use.
