review/text: I have been through three clipper sets in the past year. This in now my fourth. I do my hair myself because it's easy and it only needs to be one length. The last two clippers I had pulled my hair and cut it unevenly. I am pleased to say this pair went through my thick hair very easily and evenly. The only reason I am giving this four stars is because I had a ringing in my ears for a while after use. The clipper was loud and vibrated quite a bit. I'll deal with the noise for the kind of cut I got though.
