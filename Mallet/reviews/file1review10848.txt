review/text: Very quick delivery of individually packaged batteries. For Christmas, my wife bought some LED remote-control "candles" that required these batteries. Several of the OEM batteries died after short usage. We ordered these batteries. They arrived quickly. They worked well out of the box, and the candles now glow great.
