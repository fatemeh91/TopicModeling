review/text: I bought the Prenatal Cradle when I was about 24 weeks along with twins. Prior to wearing the cradle, my back ached all the time. After wearing the cradle just one day, my back ache had already subsided somewhat. Wearing it a few more days brought near complete relief.The cradle felt natural and comfortable, much more so than the around-the-belly-only varieties of pregnancy support I tried.At this point, I'm 34 weeks along (but I'm the size a typical pregnant woman would be if she went 2 weeks past her due date!), and the cradle is getting tight, so I don't wear it all day. But, it's still a great help to wear for a few hours when I'm running errands or cleaning the house. I hurt in many other ways, but at least my back is happy again! :)The straps can be a little hard to hide under your clothing, especially if you have any low-cut shirts. The sizing guides available online worked well for me. Overall: this is definitely recommended!
