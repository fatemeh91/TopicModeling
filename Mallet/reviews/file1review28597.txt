review/text: I ordered this and received in less than 30 hours. I ordered from Amazon directly and will say that I was quite impressed I was just aiming to get it the day after the holiday. The shakes are good too. Ive had the mint chocolate as well. I use these to help substitute the shakes at Metabolic Research Center to offset the high cost of there stuff and this is only 30 calories more for a higher amount of protein. Very satisfied customer.
