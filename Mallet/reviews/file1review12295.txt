review/text: I bought 2 of these sets from Amazon over 8 months ago when my 96 year old mother went into hospice care. The sheets are soft and fit the hospital bed mattress beautifully, even with the pressure pump pad on the bed. They stay put, the corners don't pop off and the design of the top sheet leaves plenty of toe room.They have been washed and dried at least 3 times a week and have really held up well...still look like new and have kept their shape. I am buying another set just so that I won't have to be washing bedding every day.I like the fact that the bottom sheet is trimmed in blue and the top sheet is trimmed in green. Makes it very easy to grab the right sheet when you are changing the bed. All of the CNA's who have come in to care for my mom have commented on how nice these sheets are and have asked where I got them. Definitely a 5 star product!
