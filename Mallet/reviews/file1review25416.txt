review/text: I've had mine for several years now and I find it very dependable and useful. I initially had some startup problems that I, too, thought might be battery or switch related. However I discovered that a spritz of WD40 into the cutter blades has made this tool very dependable. As with all hair-cutting clippers and shavers, blade lubrication is needed. The other thing people should know is that while the blades cut in a rotary direction, the only way the hairs get into the cutter is through the slots. So this tool cuts on the way IN only, so just putting it in the area and leaving it there will be ineffective...you have to insert and reinsert to get uncut hairs into the slots. Knowing these two things should give you a good experience with this tool. The "pulling" and "tickling" that others report is also minimized by having the blades lubricated so that they cut cleanly rather than jam.
