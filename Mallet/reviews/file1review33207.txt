review/text: Since I started incorporating this product into my vitamin regimen, I haven't felt more protected with all the other sick people around me or gotten over my sinus infections so quickly. To protect myself from others and boost my immune system, I take 1 or 2 of these morning and night. If I'm stressed, feeling like I'm getting a cold or sinus infection, or I'm around a lot of sick people, I take 3 of these at least twice a day, sometimes 3 times a day. These work wonders and are a great bargain if you subscribe.
