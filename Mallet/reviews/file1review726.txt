review/text: I used to use this about a year ago, but i stopped using it. It works well..I was not disappointed even though it takes a bit longer for it to work. It does reduce redness in acne which is one of the main reasons I will be purchasing again..Does clear breakouts faster and works for scars...I do recommend this product to anyone.
