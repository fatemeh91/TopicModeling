review/text: I've had three of these long enough now to have washed them several times and tested them well. The pad does not leak, even holding a considerable amount of urine. It is quiet to sleep on, and it is not sweaty. The pad dries flat and maintains it's shape perfectly. I hang them outside to dry now, but come winter I'll dry them in the dryer. That's the only test I haven't given them yet. The size is plenty long & wide enough to give good protection. It doesn't wrinkle up under me, but I'm not a restless sleeper. I don't know if that would be a problem for more restless folks. I recommend this pad without reservation.Priva Ultra Plus Waterproof Sheet Protector, 34" x 52", White
