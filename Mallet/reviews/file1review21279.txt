review/text: I have been using the brush for about a month. Its not as powerful a a Sonicare but still works fine. I love the feel of the handle, it is slim and very light weight. It hold a charge for sbout two weeks. Only con is after two minutes of brushing it doesn't turn off on it on, you have to manual do it. Great brush so buy one much more bang for buck than Sonicare.
