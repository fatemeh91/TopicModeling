review/text: I'd been taking NOW Foods Calcium Magnesium for about a year. About 6 mos ago, I started having dizzy spells, almost debilitating joint pain, rash after rash, fatigue, etc. Not a fun way to spend your time. They thought I had Lupus at one point. The one thing that baffled all of my doctors was that my Vitamin D levels were testing pretty high; apparently rare.Then I finally get a notification of a recall of certain lots (which I'd been taking from) that had 30,000 - 40,000IU's of D3 rather than the 600 IU's on the label. They chalk it up to a "formula error." that's a pretty huge error - check out quality control!!After a little research, my symptoms were totally consistent with Vit D toxicity. Shame on you NOW Foods, the only reason they even found this was investigating a complaint from someone who put 2 and 2 together. Won't trust my health to NOW Foods anymore!!
