review/text: Aging and weight gain seem to be related...at least in me...aceyl L carnitine has helped me with balancing my metabolism. It is not a weight lost fast fixed...but it has me to keep weight off without changing my dietary intake too much. When I first started taking this supplement, I felt a slight flush, but after a week..my body has adapted with no other reactions.
