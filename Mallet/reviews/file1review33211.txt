review/text: I bought these pills and would take them every now and then when I felt that something was coming on (a cold, a sore throat) and I always felt better soon after. I knew I had found a lifesaver when my husband and I went home for Christmas. EVERYONE was sick with something different and we were both very worried about catching something. We both just kept popping these not-so-little tablets and neither one of us caught anything. It truly was a Christmas miracle. :)
