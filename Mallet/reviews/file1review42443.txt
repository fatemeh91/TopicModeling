review/text: Our dog has had digestive problems since the day that we brought him home. We have tried different premium foods (Blue, Nutro, Natural Balance, grain free formulas), medications, and other probiotics and enzymes such as NaturVet and Fortiflora in order to solve his issues. Certain things worked better than others in our quest to help our dog.None of the things that we tried produced anything other than mild improvement until we tried Probios. After the switch to this product, we saw immediate results. After a week of using this it is like his digestive problems never existed. Normal stools, drastically reduced gas, and a generally happier dog. We couldn't be happier with Probios.
