review/text: Be prepared for a nasty taste and slimy, slippery strips. But they really did work well. Don't believe the commercials that you can use these anytime, anywhere. Not unless you don't mind drooling on people in public. The strips slip all over when you try to talk or even swallow, and especially DON'T SNEEZE! But as for the whitening, I was pleasantly surprised. A lot better than I was expecting.
