review/text: I didn't have a period for over a year after getting off the depo shot. I even went on conventional birth control to jump start my cycle but that whole time I never ovulated.After less than 1 bottle of this product I was pregnant. My baby is now 3 months old.This was my second baby and I didn't have any trouble getting trouble pregnant the first time. So the pills didn't solve any fertility problems (because I don't have any) just my period problems so I could be fertile again.
