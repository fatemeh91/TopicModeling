review/text: The razor blades arrived only two days after I ordered them. The box and blades seemed a little bit cheaper than what I would buy in the store, but they work just fine. The cartridge fits onto my existing handle and provides a smooth shave. Seems like a good deal to me considering what they cost at the grocery store.
