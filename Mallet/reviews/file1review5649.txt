review/text: As with many Ppl who reviewed this product, I too have been using the green thicker plastic ones that are pictured here and measure 1.75" x 4.5" (5 cases), and these have always been the only ones that aren't cheap and made of thin plastic. So after finding these on Amazon I was so excited to have found them again, and I ordered I packs of them, After waiting over 3 weeks to get them thru Nutricity on Amazon, I was furious when I opened the box and found these larger blue ones that were made of that thin cheap plastic all the newer ones are made of. Even worse was when I tried to return them to the Amazon vendor I was told that I am responsible for the shipping. I then contacted Amazon and was told that this is the policy. I think that when they show one product and then send you another, then that company should pay for the shipping one had to pay to get it and the shipping to return the items that were sent. Yet Amazon and it's vendors think that is not the way things should be.So, I am now on a quest again to try and find the ones that are pictured in all these Amazon ads, because after contacting several places using the UPC code used here, I found that several companies outside of amazon also had a picture of these green ones on their ad's but when I had them check they said that they found the description said blue and had the larger 2.0" x 4.5".So if your are like me and only want the better thicker ore durable green pill stack cases then these are not the ones you want to order.
