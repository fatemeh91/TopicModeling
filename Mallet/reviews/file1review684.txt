review/text: My brother bought this chair and I was a little skeptical. I have several of the very expensive put in your chair kinds, many large hand held and I have sat in the ones at the name brand places and not been impressed. Oh they felt okay, but didn't do the trick. When I went to my brother's house, he sat me down and I sat there the entire night! It was incredible. I have never felt anything so wonderfully relaxing other than my own massage therapist. This chair may seem expensive, but it's worth every drop. I am waiting for mine to be delivered!
