review/text: For years, I suffered from mild to severe eczema rashes on my arms. The source was never diagnosed. I tried to relate it to excessive sun exposure, laundry detergent, contact with plants (I do know tomato leaves cause me irritation). Nothing except strong doses of hydrocortisones seemed to provide relief, and I never knew when an outbreak would occur. Then a doctor alerted me to the benefits of quercetin. I was skeptical. But I have to say, two years later and I have had NO eczema outbreaks. Quercetin is certinly no substitute for fast acting antihistamines like Benadryl(R). Use that for acute alergic reactions. But for me, I am convinced that daily (1000mg) doses of quercetin is a great supplement to my daily multivitamin.
