review/text: I purchased a pool brush from a local store. As I would use it it would literally shed all over the tub.So I looked for something from a company that we all know as well as something that could easily get into the crevices and jets.Really happy I stumbled onto this. Perfect for what I was looking for.No shedding, either!
