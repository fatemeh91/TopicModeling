review/text: I've had this for about a year and it does what I need it to. It holds about 5-6 cigarette butts so I don't have to flick them into the street when I can't find a trashcan. It only looses a star because it is very hard to disassemble to empty it and clean it, I usually just open it up and shake it. It's also hard to tell which part is the top in the dark, the top and bottom look exactly the same aside from the Zippo imprint.All in all I recommend it to all my smoker friends.
