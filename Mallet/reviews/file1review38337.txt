review/text: Evidently the person below this got a defective one cause mine barely hurts compared to the other devices I have used. I use it even under the arm to get rid of hair it does hurt duh but not like the old ones. Gets the hair on the first couple of passes instead of trying over and over again till you want to scream and DO. I used to have the rechargeable Emjoi but it died rather quickly and was not able to be used with the cord. Been using removal systems for over 20 years since the first epilady (ouch remember that eeeeek)
