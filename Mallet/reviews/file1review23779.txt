review/text: These arch supports have a hard bottom, but the curve in the middle of them (for the arch support) gives a little, so they give you a very comfortable & almost "bouncy" feel with each step. I have Plantar Fasciitis & these have done wonders to alleviate the pain. The only down side to them is that you can't cut them down to fit your shoe (because of the hard bottom). They fit in my tennis shoes just fine, but are too wide for my dress shoes. Give them a try though. You will love them!
