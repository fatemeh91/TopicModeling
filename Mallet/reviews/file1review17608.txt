review/text: This is my second Remington trimmer and should the time come, I'll buy a third. I purchased this in January of 2010 and after over two years of weekly use, it's just as good as it was the day it came out of the box. It has more length settings than I honestly use, but enough to cover what I need. It's easy to use, easy to keep clean and the battery life is outstanding.What I feel is probably the best feature though, is the charging cord. My previous trimmer needed to be placed in a cradle to recharge and if the battery died while I was using it...well I either had to leave the house looking funny or wait 30 minutes until it had enough juice to finish. This model plugs in to charge just like a cell phone...so in a pinch, I can plug it in and finish up with no problem!
