review/text: I have been overweight (150 lbs. overweight) most time of my life, and as a 24 yrs young woman, was hard to develop long lean muscles, but this product (plus my diet and exercises), is really helping me to make it through my goal.It doesn't taste like Nesquick, but is really great for smoothies, I prepare it with water to minimize the calorie intake, and it taste good.
