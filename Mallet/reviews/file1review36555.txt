review/text: I am a diabetic and one of the side affects of that (for me) is a constant battle with oral thrush. I was able to treat it at first with Nystatin but the sugar in the solution played havoc with my blood sugar and the more I used it the less effective it became. After having the thrush return again, I purchased Gentian Violet 2%. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of having my entire mouth, tongue and teeth purple but I was at my wits end. Not only did it clear the thrush up it was gone after only 2 applications. I will NEVER be without this again. The staining on my teeth lasted about 24 hours. The staining in my mouth in the affected areas lasted 48 hours. After I applied it the second time (even though the thrush was disappearing)the purple disappeared from the healthy skin in 24 hours and 48 hours from the affected area. After that it was completely gone!
