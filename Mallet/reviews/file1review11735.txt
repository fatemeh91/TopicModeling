review/text: My son loves pediasure- all flavors! His favorites are strawberry and vanilla. I gave him pediasure because he stopped growing for almost a year due in part to chronic acid reflux. Pediasure has helped him tremendously. He now is moving up on the growth chart and we couldn't be more greatful. Thankyou pediasure!!!
