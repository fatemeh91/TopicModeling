review/text: Our 5 month old can sit up unassisted, but our non-skid bathtub prevents us from using the infant seats that suction to the bottom of the tub. The Snug Tub is VERY slippery and dangerous for her right now- moreso than just sitting her in the regular tub! We are currently using the infant seat tub placed INSIDE the Snug Tub. Snug Tub will probably be safer and appropriate for her when she is about 8 or 9 months old.
