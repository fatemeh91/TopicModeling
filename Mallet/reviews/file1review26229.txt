review/text: They help a lot with digestion problems with everyday foods, for example: beans & broccoli. Honestly I had given up a lot of foods that used to give me gas or indigestion. After my sister visited me, and had me try these plant enzymes, I was amazed. After taking them for a few days, I noticed no more pressure in my digestive area. Definately recommend these to anyone with digestive discomfort.
