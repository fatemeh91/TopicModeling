review/text: so I got these with the drops. for me the drops were too sour and they irritated my mouth allot. I can live without the ginger flavor but i don't like ginger to begin with. The lavander wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and am wishing I had one now (but I am out here to order more) I took away a star mainly because I wish more came in a pack...
