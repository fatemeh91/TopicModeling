review/text: I purchased these drops after having used Refresh Optive Sensitive (single use vials) to recover from LASIK surgery. Unfortunately the preservative in the non-sensitive type did not work out for me, eyes would develop mucus soon after using and blur my vision. Eyes also felt drier and more irritated after using the product than before.
