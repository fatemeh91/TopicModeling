review/text: I tried these also because I use cloth diapers, etc. and I have yet to find a washable pad that can actually hold enough for one nursing, even with doubling up. My absolute favorite pads are Curity brand, the price is good and they hold a huge amount of liquid. They also stay in place without a sticky backing, so until I find a good washable, I guess that's what I'll be using!
