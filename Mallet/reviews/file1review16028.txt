review/text: I was eager to try this cleanse as I did my research, and was impressed with the reviews provided by other users. However, after only two days of taking the supplements, I have had constant headaches. These are not due to the lack of caffeine as I do not drink this stimulant on a normal basis. I have changed my diet to help with the cleansing process, but haven't noticed too much of a difference. Also, the pills from the third phase must have some sort of sleeping aid in them as ten minutes after I took it, I could not keep my eyes open. This sounds good in theory, but the idea of putting something in my system that forces me to go to sleep makes me a little nervous. Anyway, maybe you'll have better luck with them than I did, as it seems other people have found them helpful.
