review/text: Good stethoscope for the money. As a paramedic this serves my needs well in the field and I do not have to worry about losing/breaking an expensive stethoscope.Pros: Decent sound quality for the price. Great value. Durable.Cons: Ear pieces seem to fall of fairly easily.I would buy again.
