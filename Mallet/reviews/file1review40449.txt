review/text: Mode de Vie Karite lips is a superior lip balm that contains a high concentration of shea butter for maximum moisturizing and regeneration of dry skin. You can tell this balm has a lot of shea butter in it because the initial application of the balm is slightly grainy--this is a characteristic of pure shea butter. After several applications the balm goes on smooth and soft. Karite lips leaves the lips silky smooth and protected, providing a layer of silky emollients that stay on the lips for a while unlike some lip balms which require constant re-application. The natural vanilla in the balm provides a delicious scent and flavor. This wonderful lip balm stick costs a little more but lasts a long time.Shea butter is made from the nuts of the Karite tree from West Africa. Apparently studies have been done on shea butter which reveal some miraculous properties of this ingredient. It can aid cell regeneration and capillary circulation which aids healing of the epidermis. Also, it has restructuring effects on the skin and dry hair.
