review/text: When taking these, get ready to be amped up. I took these as directed, good product, definitely wakes you up and gets you going. I did lose a little weight while taking these, but by no means is this a miracle pill (which I knew before taking). But it gives you extra energy and if you eat right and do cardio, you can really shed weight. I am not a caffine drinker, or soda drinker, just milk and water and when taking these, they hit me hard with energy, even made me a little jittery. When I stopped taking these, I went through caffine withdrawl. Terrible headaches, did not feel well for about 3 to 4 days after. It felt like a bad hangover for 4 days. To avoid this, I suggest coming off slowly, reducing to one pack a day, and then one every other day so your body can get used to not having tons of caffine in it all the time. Other than that, it was great, will probably take again in the future.
