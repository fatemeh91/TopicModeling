review/text: This is my first and I love it. I will admit that the reviews before about the pain were right. I have come up with a tip though: the instructions state to use the epilator after a shower when the pores are more open: Well, I decided that using a heating pad on the area should work pretty good. IT DID! On the areas I don't use the heat pad I can't stand to use the epilator, but on the areas of the heat pad, what a difference. I can tolerate it. I was tempted to put the epilator away and never use it again because it did hurt so much. But not anymore. Give it a try.
