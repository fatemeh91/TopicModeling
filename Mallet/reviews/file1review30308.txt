review/text: I bought this to clean up dog hair on furniture. (My dog is an Aussie/Golden mix with lots of long hair.) I used it on my couch, but I had to go back over it with the hand tools on my bulky upright to get rid of all the dog hair. Maybe it works better for short-haired pets. As for general use (other than dog hair), my cordless dustbuster works just as well as this one, without the hassle of a cord.
