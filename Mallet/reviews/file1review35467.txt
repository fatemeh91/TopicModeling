review/text: We have been looking at new dishwashers forever. Ours is old and with our hard water it had become brown inside a normally white dishwasher. The build up had been in there for at least 5 years. I ran one cycle with dishwasher magic and our dishwasher is like new inside. All the jets are clean and ALL of the buildup on the sides is gone. I can't believe how improved it is. Now it's shiny white with no spots or anything. So glad I saved hundreds of dollars by running a $5 bottle of cleaning fluid through our old dishwasher!
