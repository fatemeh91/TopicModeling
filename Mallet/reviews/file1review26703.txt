review/text: I'm female, not at all handy with tools, but like to take care of small things myself without bothering busy family. For some unknown reason, my toilet gets blocked at least once a month. I've tried chemicals like Drano before with no results and always worry about the effects on the plumbing. This time all the plunging, etc., didn't work. I noticed One Second Plumber and decided to try it. I pressed the device once and wham! The toilet cleared at once! The house is 20 years old and I don't know what the condition of its pipes are. But this did not damage them in the slightest and worked instantly. Try it. It's cheap and effective.
