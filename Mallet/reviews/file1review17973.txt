review/text: I bought this as a cheap back up to my Pediatric Littman and I am SO impressed!!! I've had it for 3 months now and have used it enough to confidently say it's a great stethoscope. Honestly I think that if my Littman ever breaks I may just get one of these to replace it. Good acoustics, good weight, not cheap looking. Good buy. Thanks for all the good reviews - they were right on.
