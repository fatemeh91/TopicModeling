review/text: I picked this up hoping to use it a few times a week and keep a short beard. What I got was a pain in the neck. Unless you want to keep a lumberjack length beard, this is not the trimmer for you. The attachments do not give you a close trim and the razor itself only worked for about 4 months before it started cutting me through the foil. And I'm not even talking through holes in the foil. I come away from using the razor with scrapes all over my face on a daily basis. Save your money and invest in a higher quality product.
