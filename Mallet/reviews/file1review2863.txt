review/text: I bought this razor a a replacement for my old reliable Remington DA-407, which lasted about 15 years. Unfortunately the DA-407 is no longer available, but the DA-307 is almost as good, it just isn't recommended to be used as a corded model (the DA-407 could be used either corded or cordless). The DA-307 is inexpensive and shaves close. I was so satisfied that I bought a second one as a spare.
