review/text: The trimmer just does not do a good job. I went over my beard and head at least 20 times and each time got a bit more trim. After the ~20 times my hair and beard looked neat, but that is not what I expect from a highly rated trimmer. It does not matter what angle or how fast you move the trimmer - it consistently does a poor job.As other customers have noted, "You get what you pay for, and in this case it is not much."
