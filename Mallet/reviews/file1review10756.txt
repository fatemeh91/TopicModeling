review/text: Each one of the 4 daily compartments holds 10 large multivitamin pills without difficulty. The covers snap firmly closed, and open easily with a short fingernail. The hinges may be a weak spot; we'll see.Initially, a two-compartment-per-day organizer was shipped in error. The appearance is identical when wrapped. I am dissatisfied that Amazon provided no means to designate the return as their error and simply exchange the correct product for the wrong one. Amazon paid for the return, but left me to re-order and pay for shipping of the correct item on my own. I hope Amazon is not becoming "iffy."
