review/text: Optimum Nutrition is a trustworthy brand for protein. They tend to be more expensive than other brands, but you know you're getting what you pay for. I found Extreme Milk Chocolate to be a bit too sweet. Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite as it's not quite as sweet. Cookies and Cream is very sweet so I mix it with unflavored whey from another brand. Definitely recommend using a shaker cup to get a good blend. Blending with water tastes a bit like (cold) hot chocolate mix, but I prefer milk.
