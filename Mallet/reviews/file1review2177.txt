review/text: Hi - I sent this as a gift for Fathers day, so I haven't physically seen the product - BUT - MY MOTHER SAYS - its elegant, especially enjoying the illumination behind the waterfall and 'track 4 - the Loons'. She states 'calming, soothing'. She had a dinner party that evening and many were in awe and asked where it was purchased from. - so - indirectily 'I recommend".
