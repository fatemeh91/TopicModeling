review/text: Great product! I own two, one for home and one for my massage practice and have also purchased a few for gifts. You cannot beat the heat that comes from this and the moist heat is far more friendly to the body. You really have to try it to feel the difference beteween this and a regular heating pad. The heat feels like it is soaking into your body rather than sitting on the surface. I like the manual switch for my massage practice so my client is not interrupted by the beeps of the automatic switch, I use a pony tali holder wrpped around the switch to keep it in the on position. I also like the weight and feel of this product better than the automatic switch one, don't be fooled I was sent the wrong product through my last order with Amazon.
