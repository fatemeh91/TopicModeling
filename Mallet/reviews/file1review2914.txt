review/text: I really like these whole-food vitamins. They are easy to swallow. They come in a clear amber, glass jar. They are not stinky when you open the jar. They don't give me stinky breath or leave a weird taste in my mouth. I have taken one on an empty stomach (before breakfast) with no bad effects. The recommended dosage is one per day which is great because I would probably forget if I had to stagger these throughout the day. I like these vitamins and they have everything I want in a vitamin - especially that they are made from whole foods and not from lab created synthetics. I recommend these vitamins.
