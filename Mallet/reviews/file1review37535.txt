review/text: There was no light coming in what so ever in this mask. It's comfortable and yet you can sleep on your side and not even feel it. The strap will fit any size head big or small and it doesn't bother you while you are sleeping. You can still open your eyes with the mask on since it is not pressing up against your eyes. Very good product.
