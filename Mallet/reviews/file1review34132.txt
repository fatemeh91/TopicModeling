review/text: In the last few years, my frequency of urination had gradually increased to the point that I seldom got my seven hours of sleep without having to get up at 3-4 AM to go to the bathroom. I read up on the problem, and the easiest step to take was to try Beta Sitosterol, a phytonutrient that has been reported to reduce the frequency of urination. Beta Sitosterol is found naturally in some plant foods, but I seldom eat any of the foods listed except for peanuts. For several weeks, I've been taking one 375 mg tablet before dinner, and although the results haven't been overly dramatic, it has definitely helped, and I sometimes even get the full seven hours of sleep that I need.
