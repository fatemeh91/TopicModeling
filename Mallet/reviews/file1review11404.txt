review/text: Warning...The dental guard pictured in this listing is not what the buyer is getting.The dental guard pictured sells for about $45 at Walgreen's, so I thought I was getting a good deal when I purchased it from this seller.However, what was delivered was the cheaper model that sells for $25 at the pharmacy.I have submitted a request for the seller to fix the problem, and just maybe, this was an innocent mistake and this transaction was merely an isolated incident.However, if the seller denies to replace the product, I will add to this comment and recommend that you buy the other, cheaper model.I'd like to clarify that this is not a negative endorsement of the sleep right product itself.This is more a warning to buyers to hold off from their purchase of this product until it is concluded as to whether the seller has made an innocent mistake or if the seller is deceiving amazon's customers.
