review/text: I normally don't suffer from shave bumps except maybe on some rare occasions on my upper legs&stomach;, but with 1-spritz a day with TendSkin I haven't gotten any sort of bumps, razor burns, or anything else that comes with shaving. I will warn you that if you spray it right after shaving it will HURT! I normally apply abit a couple hours later every single day though.It's recommended that you apply this product with a cotton ball but the cotton ball soaks up most of it and you pretty much get nothing from doing it that way. So, what I did is I went a bought a 99cent small plastic spray container you get from Wal-Mart and simply put it in there and apply whenever you desire too! I love this product so much that I actually ordered the 8oz. It arrived FAST I believe it got here to KS in 2 days. I tried the TendSkin shave gel but HATED the shave gel because it was to clear that I couldn't see where I shaved. This prodcuct costs more at Sephora & Ulta I saw it there for 30 for a 4oz
