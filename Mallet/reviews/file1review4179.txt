review/text: They are constantly looking for new ways to increase the cost of shaving. All they can do is add more blades. From one to two to three to four to five blades. What is next? I would imagine a 6 or 7 blade shaver. Then 10 or 12. It is utterly absurd. Save your money. You can get a nice close shave using a one blade, cheap disposable shaver. Just take your time and be careful. You'll save hundreds of dollars, though.
