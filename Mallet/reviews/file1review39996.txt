review/text: Kleenex ColdCare are the best tissues! My family has allergies, so we use a lot of tissues. Kleenex ColdCare are strong, but they're also very soft. They're comfortable on noses that get wiped a lot and don't leave a greasy feeling behind. I definitely recommend these to anyone with allergies, sensitive skin, or small noses in the family!
