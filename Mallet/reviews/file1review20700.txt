review/text: This is NOT the Braun 8000FC as indicated by the picture and on the invoice (if you buy). This is Braun's replacement #51S and it SUCKS! The cutter blade design has changed and it does not shave anywhere near as clean as the older design. I'd purchased these hoping to get the original design but was shipped the 51S. Just know and understand what you'll be receiving if you choose to buy!
