review/text: For $21 I am hard pressed to find a better stethoscope. I am using it in a veterinary setting and find the large head to work fine on cats and dogs alike. I am not hearing great lung sounds, but can hear obvious murmurs, etc. Not as clear as some higher ends, sure, but a GREAT spare or primary for a non-doctor. I may find that I am just rusty about placement on getting the best sounds anyway... With some time I may actually find that I like it more than I thought!
