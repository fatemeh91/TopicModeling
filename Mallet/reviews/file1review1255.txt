review/text: I got some like this at a store. I like them a lot, BUT the shape they give you may or may not fit your eyebrow shape. I had to use scissors and trim each one to fit MY eyebrow shape. Have to use more than one to get it all. Once you cut them to your size they do work really well.Easy and fast.
