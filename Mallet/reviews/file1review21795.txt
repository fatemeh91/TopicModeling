review/text: I have tried both Rembrandt and Crest Whitening strips. I tried these first because they were cheaper and got pretty good results. My teeth were considerably whiter and although it is pretty "goopy", it was well worth it. Afterwards, I decided to try the more expensive Crest Whitening strips because of all the great reviews. I found the Crest strips to be inferior. First of all, they would not stay on my teeth and would slide all over the place. The thin piece of plastic also gets pretty disgusting and if you mess up putting it on, well good luck getting it to fit after that. Ironically, although wearing the Rembrandt strips is like wearing a mouth guard, they stay in perfect place so you know there won't be any discoloration. Needless to stay, I have gone back to using the Rembrandt strips because of their great value.
