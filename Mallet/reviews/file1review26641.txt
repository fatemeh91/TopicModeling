review/text: If you don't have a real back problem, but want some lumbar support while sitting at a desk or computer this is comfortable. It works mostly with office/computer chairs, but the strap doesn't wrap around a lounger or recliner. Eventhough you can't strap it down, it does offer some support in a recliner. I had a temporary back problem and it didn't help. I gave it to a person with severe, chronic back pain, to try. Unfortunately, it was of little comfort. It deflates easy, too. I have to keep reinflating it. I rated it a 3-star (not less, not more) because it does have some benefits. Now that my back problem is gone, it does help at the computer. However, for real chronic problems I would try a different product.
