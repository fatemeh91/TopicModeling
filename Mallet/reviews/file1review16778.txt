review/text: We normally buy Halls Mentho-Lyptus & like them pretty well but I had a coupon and these were on sale so we purchased the Sucrets Complete. I put these in our diaper bag so my husband and I would always have them with us while we were out and about as opposed to carrying individual Halls in our pockets and having them melt.Both of us had been sick and using Halls at home to help my husbands cough/sore throat & my sore throat. We finally tried these while we were in the car.Within a minute I started getting relief from my sore throat and it didn't taste bad either. As with every cough drop I've ever tried it is impossible to get every bit of sore throat so I still had some minor sore throat but it was definately much better & worked faster & better than Halls for my sore throat. I kept it on my tongue while it was in my mouth and my tongue went numb which I don't like so if you hate that feeling too then I recommend keeping this between your cheek & teeth most of the time.My husbands cough got better after this and it helped his sore throat as well. Im not sure if these or Halls work better for cough.That was a couple of weeks ago, my sore throat went away and a few days ago I started getting another sore throat that has gotten really bad. To give you an idea of the pain I have when I swallow, I would rather swallow sand paper, tacks, rocks...you get the idea..as opposed to having my current sore throat pain. I've tried some cold medicine that has sore throat listed on the bottle and it really didn't do anything. I've tried Halls & it didn't do anything. The Sucrets have been able to releive some of the pain, it still hurts but is definately better after a Sucrets.I'm sure right now I have something more than just a cold but if you have just a cold or flu I think these work really well for a sore throat and help for anything more serious.
