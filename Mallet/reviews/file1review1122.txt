review/text: I have tried a couple different probiotics, including Align. Kal contains more types of probiotics than Align and at a much lower cost. Also from most of what I have read it is a big plus if the probiotic should be refrigerated, and this one clearly states on the package "refrigerate". Definitely glad I found this product.
