review/text: Dr. Mercola describes Astaxanthin as the most powerful antioxidant on the market. As we learn more about the cancer risks associated with oxygen free radicals (a normal byproduct of cellular metabolism) the more products like this make sense. Source Naturals is a company I trust and I have been taking their products for years. It turns out that their brand of Astaxanthin is also one of the least expensive on the market. So, with little to lose and potentially much to gain . . . I bought this product and take it everyday.
