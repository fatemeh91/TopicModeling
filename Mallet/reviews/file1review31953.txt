review/text: I like this actual product, however, I placed this order a week ago and it hasn't even begun to ship yet!?!? What the heck??! And I have no idea whom to call or contact... verrry frustrating. I guess I will just cancel this order and pay the $18 more from Whole Foods. Why advertise something as being &#34;in stock&#34;??
