review/text: I have had one of these TheraBeads Microwaveable Collar Moist Heat Wraps for several years. Let me be adamant. It does not wear out! However, it does get dirty after years of use, dirty enough to gross out people who see it. It cannot be washed. What then?Go to Amazon where you can truly find just about anything. I cheered when I found it and promptly ordered it. When it came in, I threw out the dirty one.Now here is what you need to know:1. It is shown around the girl's neck--a truly perfect place for tension headaches. Ease the pain in the neck and the headache diminishes or disappears!2. For Restless Leg Syndrome, wrap it around your calves (one at a time) for the heat to ease that wild inclination to kick.3. For Fibromyalgia, place on or under or around the painful areas and feel the pain lessen. I fold mine in three parts and place underneath the area between my shoulder blades. Wow, what relief for that always painful area!Small of the back, top of shoulder, around elbow, place under feet, on abdomen for cramps--wherever it hurts.Therabeads Microwaveable Collar Moist Heat Wrap: a delightful and totally beneficial discovery and necessity for people with fibromyalgia and tension headaches.
