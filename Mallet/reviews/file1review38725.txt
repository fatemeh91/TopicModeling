review/text: This is not like using Vaseline, this is for the pro's who know chaffing and skin abrasion. You can put Cramer's on once and do 50 or 75 miles, and those private places will remain lubed. It stays around in high heat and heavy usage. I love the the stuff. Only one problem......how in the h#ll do you wash it out of your running gear? I don't mind it sticking around for a day or two after I finish a long run, but all my gear shows the evidence of of this stuff in what seems to be perpetuity. I guess its just an ultra runners curse. Bottom line....Cramers is great for ultra running. Nothing better. Use it lightly to start to get an idea of how much to use...so you can get it off in a reasonable amount of washing. If you find a detergent that will wash Cramer's out of clothing let me know.
