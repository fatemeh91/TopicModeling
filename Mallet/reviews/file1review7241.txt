review/text: I have had a job for the last nineteen years that requires me to stand on my feet for the majority of my workday. Recently, I noticed that at the end of my shift my feet HURT more than usual. They began to throb. Two weeks ago I decided to purchase a whirlpool foot spa similar to the one at the salon where I get my pedicures. I wanted to pamper and rejuvenate my arhing feet at home at my own convenience without the added cost of going to the nail shop. My criterion: (1)water level deep enough to immerse my ankles, (2)powerful water jets,and (3)a heating element that would enable the water to stay heated for periods up to two hours. The Aqua-Jet Foot Spa has met all my requirements. In addition, the handles make it very easy to move and lift the spa when full. This unit is a bit more expensive than the other foot spas on the market, however, well worth the money!
