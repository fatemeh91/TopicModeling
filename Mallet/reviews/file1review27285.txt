review/text: This is great value for money. Though a bit more expensive than other powders, the protein per serving, taste and mixability ranks highly. I dont have a mixer and simply used a spoon and that worked just fine with minimal clumping at bottom (very minimal) The vanilla ice cream tastes great and is a pleasant drink to enjoy, not merely tolerable. Very smooth when mixed with milk.The cookies and cream is OK but sweet and not as creamy as the vanilla. My cookies and cream also has a slight bitter after taste could be a bad batch.Overall very good value. No regrets (except will only buy vanilla as of now)
