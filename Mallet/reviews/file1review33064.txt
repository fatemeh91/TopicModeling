review/text: We've taken Wellness for years and they really do seem to cut the time of a cold or flu... There are two "types" of the same formula, tablet and capsule. The tablet are more concentrated, the capsule is easier to take. As the number you take is different, and as the number of "pills" in the various size bottles is different, you may have to do some math to find the best deal... In any case, which ever you prefer, we think it's a good idea to get them before you need them, just in case you get caught in a group of coughers and sneezers...
