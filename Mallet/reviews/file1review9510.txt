review/text: The first day I used this I took two pills within 4 hours of each other, and I could really feel the blood going to my brain. It wasn't the type of feeling one gets when one hangs upside down, but suffice to say I knew it worked. Now, I take three a day separated by several hours and I am more alert. There is no more fog. However, I have been taking it for only a few weeks and I do not notice an improvement in memory.I will continue buying this.
