review/text: The Oral-B CrossAction Power Battery toothbrush uses a single replaceable AA battery to make the bristles of the toothbrush pivot back and forth to stimulate gums and get off food residue before it can turn into plaque or tartar. The toothbrush also lets you choose between replaceable soft and medium brushheads--something I've never seen before. The bristles fade halfway when you need to replace the head of the toothbrush.Oral-B claims that this toothbrush will remove as much plaque as regular brushing and flossing combined. They do make a great toothbrush; but I still use floss or a gum stimulant with a rubber tip to remove food particles after brushing with the toothbrush.If your dentist recommends this, good for you! This very good toothbrush by Oral B cleans my teeth and stimulates my gums better than a regular toothbrush. It's no illusion this time--this is one terrific toothbrush, especially considering the reasonable price for all that you get.
