review/text: While the gloves do offer the perfect amount of pressure, which in turn offers a comforting feel for my sore hands and fingers, the outside fabric is so rough and irritating that it negates any value the gloves could have. And even though they are somewhat helpful in propelling my wheelchair due to their tackiness, I cannot understand why they need to have the tacky (and therefore scratchy and rough) material on the entire back of the hands!I had very high hopes for the gloves based on the great reviews that they have but in this instance I am extremely disappointed. If the idea of scratchy, irritating fabric does not matter to you I think you will appreciate the gentle 'squeezing'. But if the idea of it even slightly concerns you, pass on this pair and keep searching.
