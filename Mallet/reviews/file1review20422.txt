review/text: I'm unfortunate enough to be in my late 20's, but still suffer from hip bursitis and hemorrhoids. I bought this last year for my office chair, and it helped immensely for both. When I started spending more time at my home office, I quickly started to have both conditions worsen... I quickly bought another one of these, and "Wallah!"... both conditions started improving within the first few days, and I wasn't in constant pain while working. I highly suggest this cushion for either condition!
