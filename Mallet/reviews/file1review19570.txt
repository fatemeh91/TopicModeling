review/text: This product is great! It fits well on our toilet and is the perfect size for our little 2-year old to sit on. She is just starting to potty train, and rather than first making the transition to a potty chair and then to the toilet we're going straight to the toilet. And no mess to clean up either. She just uses a little stool to walk up to get on top of the toilet and is comfortable enough to sit there while she reads her books. It's a great solution for someone looking to start potty training their little one.
