review/text: I'm gonna try to be fair here. This is an excellent razor, but it is best for those men with extremely thick beards. The 5 razors there do a good job in removing hair fast. However, it's not necessarily best in giving the closest shave.If you are not a natural "gorilla" like myself (moderately thick beard), then this large clumsy unwieldly razor won't do much, will cost more, and won't even give you the best shave.Truth be told, how many of the 5 razors make a real difference, 3? The rest do minimal work.Thus, number one for a fast quick good shave, but for a nice excellent shave (take a minute/2 longer and a little more effort), I would choose to stick with the Gillette 2 blade disposables. I am going to sell my Fusion.
