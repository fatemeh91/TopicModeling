review/text: I use to love this product, however this version of the Bucky 40 blinks eye mask is not made to last. With in a month the lining that rest on the face peels away. I thought I may have gotten a defective mask yet me second mask also peeled away with in a month. The eye mask it's self is to narrow and lets light in. The elastic strap is very uncomfortable and leaves tender spots on my head. Very disappointing. Wish they would go back to the older version.
