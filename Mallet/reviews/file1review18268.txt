review/text: Ok,I once gotten a sample pack with brands like Liquid Silk, Gun Oil, etc. and this one is actually very good. Odorless, doesn't get too cold or hot, texture and everything is one of the best (don't know about the taste though). The only problem is that it leaves a ring when you set it down, maybe it drips a little, or maybe I've knocked it over but once you get it on the bottle it feels like it's always there. I suppose most of these products are like that, but for the price I would hope it comes in an air tight, no mess container.
