review/text: This was the first flavor of Balance Bar I ever tried and it's still the family favorite. It's not too peanut-buttery and not too sugary - it's more like a dense cereal bar with a bit of pb and choc flavor. As a snack for my son these are healthy and worthwhile and it's so easy to store a box in the pantry and grab one when needed. Very filling, and very tasty!
