review/text: I try to be a healthy person for the most part. Excersize, eat healthy, use natural products when they are convenient or if they work.. No Trans fats - check, no preservatives - check, no high fructose corn syrup - check, no aluminum chloride - wait, what??I think sometimes we put more thinking into what we put into our bodies and less about what we put on our bodies! My mom has told me for years that deodorant causes alzheimers disease... "ok mom, whatever, I'll deal with that later, but for now I don't want to stink and thanks to the genes that were given me by YOU, I WILL stink if I don't use 12 and a half swipes of deodorant on each armpit.. and even then, I will still probably end up with b.o. by end of day..."I ordered this deodorant because it's cheaper and bigger than the L'Occitane deodorant I've been using, which still had the aluminum in it. I honestly didn't think it would work for me, all I have to do is think about getting b.o. and bada bing! I stink.I tried the deodorant the first day I got it. And to my surprise, it really worked! I was impressed, but I wasn't totally sold... I had to put this product to the ultimate test! So this morning, I laced up my tennis shoes and did a 45 minute high endurance work-out burning over 800 calories!! When I was done, I was sweating like a pregnant nun in church, like I had just showered in my yoga clothes! As soon as I caught my breath, I did the old lift the arm and sniff test.. I was really expecting to smell a combination of b.o. and roses, but there was no sign of b.o. at all!!! I still haven't showered yet.. I was too excited to write this review, and my armpits still smell fresh (the rest of my body, not so much)I'm switching my whole family to this product, if it works for me, it will work for anyone. Of course, I'll have to get the more masculan, less rosey scent for the hubby.. but first I'm hitting the shower.
