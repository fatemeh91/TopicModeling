review/text: This stuff destroyed my comforter. I was trying to remove pale yellow stains from a cat barfing on my comforter. Instead of removing stains, this product left large dark green stains on every spot I sprayed it on my comforter. Yes, I followed the directions exactly. I called the 800 number on the bottle and was offered a refund on the product but nothing for the ruined comforter. Wish I could rate this product lower.
