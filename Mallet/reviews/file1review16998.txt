review/text: I've had one of these for 2 years now and it has not given me any problems. I use the trimmer on its lowest setting to quickly shave off enough stubble to be considered clean-enough for work. The battery holds a charge for an impressive amount of time; I've been surprised to be able to shave without charging after not using the trimmer for a month. If I had to complain at all about the product I would say that, when it is getting low on battery, it starts to wind down and you can feel it losing power. This has become worse as the trimmer has aged. It's not much of an inconvenience though. Just plug it back in for at least 30-45 minutes and you should be able to get through a single shave. Bottom line: For the price, this trimmer would be hard to beat.
