review/text: When I received the product I was looking for something to work fast on cataracts. This isn't it. I still continued taking the product even when my sight wasn't getting any better. Besides I bought 4 bottles. At first I was doing the drops 4 times a day for the first 4 months. Then dropped down to morning and night after that. So after taking this since April of 2010 till November 2010, I have notice improvement. One eye was just starting to get a slight fog over it and now it is gone. Hurray!!!! The right eye was a lot worse then the other, even though it has improved. The color was all distorted when I started and a fog over the eye. Right now the color is back (Hurray) even though the fog is still their. I will continue this product, due to the improvement even if it is slow but on going. Not an over night improvement that everyone wants. Still worth it for those who want to wait or the doctor says your not bad enough for the operation. Remember those cataracts didn't just come in overnight and won't leave overnight either. I can understand those people who want to have an overnight improvement. I did too!It does take a while to get use to the drops because it does cause a little discomfort for a few seconds when you put them in your eye. Remember to follow the directions on the thing. Use a sterile needle when you open the bottle top. Don't make the hole to big or you will be hurting for certain.Good Luck to those who try this. Hope it works a little faster then me.
