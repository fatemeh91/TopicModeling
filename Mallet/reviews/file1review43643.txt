review/text: Before I settled on this model, I also considered the manual inflation model. I just needed one so that I could monitor my blood pressure, ups vs downs, morning vs evening, before exercise vs after. The manual one makes sense since it's smaller and much more portable at mere $30. I decided on this model for its excellent price/utility ratio: for $25 more I get automatic inflation with intellisense so the inflation could be more consistent, and 60 reading memory so I can track a couple of weeks at a time. It has met my needs; now I have a much better idea when and by how much my blood pressure will swing.
