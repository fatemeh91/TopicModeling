review/text: I've been using this product for 4 days and I can see a result already. Not the glow in the dark, frighteningly unnatural white that you often see on people who have had a dental bleaching--you know that silvery white look that doesn't occur in nature. I think the strips have whitened my teeth without making it obvious I've been whitening them. It's how my teeth looked ten years ago, before ten years of coffee and soda buildup. Although I've read reviews that state people have had pain in their gums and teeth, I've not had a bit of trouble with pain. The only real caution is--DON'T SNEEZE. Or if you have to sneeze, keep your mouth firmly closed. When I sneezed, the strips came flying out of my mouth. Also, you really can't talk very well while they're in your mouth, and you feel a bit like you're foaming at the mouth. However, there is very little after taste--and my teeth look cleaner without look other worldly. I would definately recommend.
