review/text: I have a very bad vaginal dryness, and for some reason, it's not doing the trick. I've tried many products. I will be talking to my doctor about this. This review is not to say that this is a bad product. I guess things work differently for everyone. My issue is due to having had a hysterectomy. And I cannot use estrogen products.
