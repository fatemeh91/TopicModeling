review/text: I tried this brand of oil of oregano when the brand I usually buy only had the huge bottle available and I found that out of my price range.I wish I had splurged, though, because I don't think this product actually did anything; I didn't notice a difference in how i was feeling. I think it's worth it to buy the Gaia brand Oil of Oregano, instead.
