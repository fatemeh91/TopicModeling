review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with the Irish Spring Deodorant Sport Soap. I have very sensitive skin and usually don't use a deodorant bath bar, thinking it will be harsh on my skin. Not so with the Irish Spring. I didn't have any skin irritation problems and I enjoyed the fresh scent. The only thing I would change about this product would be the size of the bar. It's a very large bar and if you have small hands, you might have a difficult time holding onto it in the shower. Other than the size, I would highly recommend this product.
