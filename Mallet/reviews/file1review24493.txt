review/text: I purchased a packet of these gel cushions last week & they are far better than I ever expected. I have metatarsalgia in my left foot at the inside edge of my second toe near the arch. It was sheer agony with every step that I took but these gel pads have completely alleviated my pain! I had to position the pad a few times to get the perfect placement but once I found it I was good to go. They do stick very well but I wear sandals quite a lot and since mine is needed to be placed just below the ball of my foot I do use a couple of pieces of 1" clear waterproof medical tape to keep it in place. These pads work so well that I can't live without wearing one now & have already bought another set to have on hand. They wash up beautifully & are as sticky as new once they dry. I highly recommend these pads to anyone with pain in the ball of their feet! They are very reasonably priced so don't hesitate to try these for yourself before spending a lot of money on other pads that are fairly worthless and don't give you the relief that you need to get back to living without foot pain.BTW- If you have pain in the ball of your foot near the arch rather than the toes- do not place these pads where they are shown in the picture but try putting them below the ball of your foot- not on it.
