review/text: I've tried other cranberry concentrates and they were far inferior to this product.First, the bottle is very well made. It is quality plastic, not too thick, not too thin, not too rigid, not too flexible. It pours exact amounts easily without dripping, and, of course, it's recyclable.Next, the juice is completely homogenized...no sludge or separation the entire time I used the solution.Third, the taste is just as you would expect from unsweetened unadulterated cranberry concentrate. It's sour and very cranberry!I drink it mixed with water and ice during the day, usually once a day. In the evening, I have one or two cups hot mixed with an herbal zinger tea and a packet of sweetener.I gave up beer because of some 'fluffy' tummy changes...Cranberry Concentrate prepared as above is a perfect substitute for me!
