review/text: For as long as I can remember, shaving has been a dreaded event. I always got razor bumps and ingrown hairs, and my facial hair isn't even curly. I have tried everything from electric razors, to clippers, to double edge safety razors, and even changing the directions that I shaved. Nothing has ever really worked.I received a free fusion in the mail, and was skeptical. I tried it, but I still got razor bumps. But then I thought for a second about shaving WITH the grain and NOT stretching the skin, and thought even more about using a shaving brush that I had purchased. I also decided to use a simple, cheap shaving cream, Barbasol Aloe Shaving Cream that I already had in my closet. I found the SOLUTION!But I should also mention that I shave in the shower with a mirror. I now look forward to shaving, and I feel that shaving everyday is best because it allows your face to grow accustomed to shaving, also allowing the hairs on your face to grow in the direction that you shave, remember-WITH the grain. If you shave with the grain you greatly reduce your chances of having ingrown hairs. If you want to love shaving, and be like that guy who has a perfect shave, get yourself a gilette fusion, a shaving brush, a shower mirror, and a mug.Shave in the shower:Let your face get wet with hot water for at least 2 mins, put some shaving cream on a brush and stretch your skin out (only while brushing) and brush your beard for 2 mins, fill your mug with hot water and dip your razor in the mug every couple of strokes. Shave in the direction of hair growth, never against and don't stretch it, if anything puff up your face! I make two passes, after the first one I re-lather and fill my mug up again with more hot water. And you don't need to leave the water on!!! That's what the mug is for. Try this for a few days and tell me, someone who has suffered for 7 years, that it isn't the best shave you ever had.
