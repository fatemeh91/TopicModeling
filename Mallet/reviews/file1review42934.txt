review/text: The Lemon Verbena fragrance in the scrub cleanser is great -- a friend gave me some as a gift, and I really like the way it smells and the way it cleans my kitchen sink, which is a composite, and I dont want it scratched up. I posted a review of the Dish Soap, and commented that the Geranium scent is much too strong. After that experience, I plan to stick to the Lemon Verbena, and not fool with the others -- I'm afraid they will stink up the whole house like the Geranium did. The price on the cleanser here at Amazon is very good, maybe unbeatable. The stores that carry the Mrs. Meyers line often have to mark it up fairly high, so buying the six-pack is a wise move.
