review/text: Being the razor is about 4 years old, buying replacement blades isn't easy at local stores, finding them at Amazon and at a cheaper price then other sites I checked was great. Tried a few other electric razors, but always go back to the old standby. Delivery was quick too, now my hubby has a nice smooth shave again.PS......My hubby is disabled from a stroke, and I am the one who handles his shaves, nice that he doesn't flinch from old worn out blades, and the razor is easy for me to handle.
