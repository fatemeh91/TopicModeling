review/text: The size and double compartment along with the stand, make this the perfect pill storage system. If one is conscientious, it is almost impossible to make mistakes!The only suggestion for improvement would be to devise a way for containers to stay open and lay flat... of course, I am not sure how!!!With that said, based on poor experiences with other med dispenser trays, I definitely recommend this one. Just take your time filling and stacking them back in the tray!All the best,Jay
