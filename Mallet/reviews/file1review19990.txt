review/text: I have used many infant tubs and I love this one! It folds so nicely I keep it in the kitchen pantry. It fits in the sink, and I keep the faucet running like a little shower, and I can rinse her with fresh water. I actually think the angle is great for an infant, but with a newborn I use one of those "yellow bear sponges" in the tub for extra support (but I use one with all the infant tubs I have used).
