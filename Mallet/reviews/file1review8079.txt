review/text: I have gained a respect for OXO products. They usually offer a quality, well designed product and this brush is no exception...works great! It doesn't leak and does a wonderful job of removing fried residue from my stainless steel frying pans. You may want to order a couple replement brushes. It's not a design fault, they just wear out over time. Great product.
