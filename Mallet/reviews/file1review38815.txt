review/text: Like many others I switched to the powder after the pre-made shakes went drastically up in price. At first, I was a little skeptical because of the additional work needed to prepare the shake and powders were just intimidating to me. However, the experience forced me to do some research and actually turned out to be pretty tasty. First off, I used almond milk instead of skim because I don't really like milk (and the effect it has on me...) and because of the benefits of almond milk - the nutrients, etc, as well as avoiding the potential dangers of non-organic milk (look it up. Hormones, etc). Delicious! My advice is to fork over an extra couple bucks and pick up the Blender Bottle -Classic Mini 20oz Blender Bottle Purple. VERY helpful. I tried just mixing it up with a spoon the first time and it was almost impossible to blend up, not pleasant. But if you have the right tools, the powder give you increased versatility with the deliciousness and filling nature of Slim Fast
