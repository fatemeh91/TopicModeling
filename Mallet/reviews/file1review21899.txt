review/text: I love the Bioflex Magnetic Shin Support because it actually works. I was surprised that it did because it was not very expensive. -- The pain in my shin and knee was gone in about 10 minutes after I put it on. Plus I got the support that I needed for my knee and shin. What a great product and super fast shipping.
