review/text: I received a 5lb. container of the Double Rich Chocolate on March 28, 2012. About an hour after drinking the first shake, I got sick (won't go into the details). I wasn't sure if it was the powder or one of the other ingredients in the shake, so I tried it again the next day. I got sick again. I paid $52.99 for this giant container, though, and really hoped I hadn't received a bad batch. I tried it two more times and got the same results. I've since stopped drinking it but wanted to post a warning after seeing some other recent reviews of people getting sick.I got such a big size because I'd bought a 1lb. container in February from Amazon and really liked it. No issues with the product that time. I don't know what's in the 5lb. container this time, but it's not good. I won't buy this product again.
