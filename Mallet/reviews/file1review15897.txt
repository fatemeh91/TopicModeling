review/text: This belt did offer some support, however it was bulky and kept sliding up my middle. I was going to physical therapy and had help properly positioning it and it still slid. I also found that I needed to wear a tank top under it because the sides chaffed. I found that it was easier to spend less time on my feet!! With all of this said, I tried 3 different brand and style maternity belts and this one offered the best support.
