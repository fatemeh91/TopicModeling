review/text: Nothing special to write about this product. The shipping was great and just as promised. The product was exactly as pictured. I have tried it and I am not really crazy about it. It taste better in 1% milk than it does in skim milk.I compared it to Medifast and Medifast won hands down. Not a bad product, just not for me.
