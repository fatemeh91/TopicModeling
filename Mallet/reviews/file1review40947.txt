review/text: This is not a fast fix, but over 6 weeks I lost 4 pounds and have not been successfull with anything else. The stickey marks come off easily with bath oil, and if you don't stick them in the same spot every time, they do not irritate much. I've tried other patches and have come back to this product for a slow, but sure weight loss program. Great for reducing appetite!
