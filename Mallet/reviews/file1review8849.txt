review/text: I have been using Green Vibrance for over a month now and absolutely love it! Since I never purchased this for an "energy boost" I am puzzled by all the posts regarding that or the lack of. That really is not it's primary purpose!Anyway, as some said - the taste is pretty awful, but then most of them are. I make my own green smoothies at home, and actually love the taste. This stuff is different though, so it takes some time to find the best way to drink it. My doctor recommended it to me, and he said he drinks it with half a packet of the individual Crystal Light peach teas. I tried that and it was more tolerable, but not great. So one morning (I'll probably gross someone out here...) while fixing my pre-gym chocolate protein shake, I thought "what the heck?" and added a scoop of Green Vibrance. The chocolate flavor almost complete drowned out the grassy taste of it and it is now my "go to" breakfast shake! I think the taste that stands out to me is the alfalfa grass, as I have always found that flavor to be YUCK.Regardless, it is great stuff and I will continue to purchase!
