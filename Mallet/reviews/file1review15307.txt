review/text: I purchased this in hopes of curbing one of my cats' IBS issues. Unfortunately this product gave my cat a reaction; violent vomiting after eating it. In fact, my poor cat was trying to run away from himself while vomiting, he was so scared!I measured everything correctly and after mixing it in with his food is when he had the reaction. I won't be purchasing this again and I've since thrown it away. I now use Purina's FortiFlora and am very satisfied with the results.Just a quick note, they only give the measurement per cup of food, they don't give any sort of variation for smaller servings.
