review/text: This stethescope has a clear sound with little distortion. I use it in multiple areas. General Med/Surg, Critical Care. The Bell is big enough to use a label with my name on it. The customers like it because they can read my name when my stethoscope is around my neck better than my name tag because it is larger print. It lays nice around my neck,not too long or short. My EMT niece like hers too. Nice stethescope.
