review/text: I bought the one on the picture (black and green) and after just a little over 3 months they don't hold the charge for half a day Horrible! i've even have a good charger it's the La Crosse Technology BC-700.But the Tenergy pre-charge bought at the same time still working fine, this is really bad, now i'm going to try theSanyo Eneloop or the Powerex AA 2700mA.Hope this helps
