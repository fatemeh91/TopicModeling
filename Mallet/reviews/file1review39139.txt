review/text: The machine itself is of very good quality and would deserve the attachments to be of a similar standard instead of the cheap rabbishy plastic made in China that don't even fit properly at times. I had to send for a replacement of the number 2 comb that didn't fit. They did send me another one from Wahl very promptly, however, the fitting is not that much better I'm afraid.
