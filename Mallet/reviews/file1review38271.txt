review/text: This product suggests that you take one pill in the morning or 2 in the morning for more rapid results. Well I went out on a limb and took 2 in the morning and 2 in the early evening.What I like most about this item is that I noticed the difference by the 2nd day of usage. My friend gave me a few, so I only had 3 days worth. By the 4th and 5th day I was still able to maintain the hunger control without even taking the pills. So they definitely work and they don't give you the jitters or nervous feeling that other diet pills give you. It does not speed you up which is a good thing for me because that feeling scares me. It simply decreases your appetite. But it is very important to eat breakfast so that you can get your metabolism going and eat small meals through the day. Snacking on healthy foods is even a great idea to keep your metabolism going so that you can burn calories."LOVE THIS PRODUCT"
