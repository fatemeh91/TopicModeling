review/text: With two little boys, a good potty seat is a necessity around here. I must have bought four different potty seats and was in despair. One scratched the toilet seat permanently, one didn't block anything so there was messy clean up each time, etc., etc. Finally, in desperation, I read reviews and saw that most people were saying they wished they had bought this seat first. I completely agree. We've had it for two or three years now and it still works great. It blocks all the mess little boys can make, and it has a little wheel behind it so that you can adjust its size to your toilet. So far I haven't encountered a toilet it doesn't fit. It's more expensive than the cheap ones, but since I bought about four of those, buying this one outright would have saved me money in the long run.
