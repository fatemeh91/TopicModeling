review/text: I love these inserts I have had them for 2 years now and they work just as well as when I originally purchased them. THey are also easy to move from shoe to shoe. THey fit most of my causual shoes/boots as well. They are a lil wide for some fancy ladies shoes so that hasn't been a problem for me. These are really great inserts to avoid plantar facitis at a reasonable price.
