review/text: The trimmer itself is great. Numerous depth adjustments and the guard can be removed for sideburns or detail work. However, the battery will not hold a charge for more than 2 days. I only trim my beard once a week, so I have to charge the trimmer before every use (minimum of 2 hours charging for 2 minutes of trimming operation time). If this trimmer was simply a corded model it would be fine. Since it's battery only and can't work when connected to the outlet (until the battery is charged), it's frustrating. It works (in it's own special way) and my pride won't let me replace a working machine. I'm patiently waiting the day when it dies so I can get a different trimmer with a working battery or a cord. Save yourself the $25 and pass on this one.
