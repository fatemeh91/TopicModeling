review/text: I found this product to be excellent. It whitened my teeth several shades. The product left an awkward aftertaste in my mouth at first. But this product is definitely better at whitening my teeth than most products. However, its cost per ounce is very high. Overall, it's a great product and I'd use it again in the future.
