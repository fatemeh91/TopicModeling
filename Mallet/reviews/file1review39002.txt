review/text: I also have been shaving with my Personal Touch razor for over 20 years. I've had to replace the handle a few times only because I've lost/left them somewhere. I have tried some of the "new" razors and concur with all the other reviewers--Personal Touch is the best and replacement cartridges are no where to be found locally. THANK YOU Amazon for keeping these blades available as SCHICK has no idea what they are doing by discontinuing this line of razors. I was already a repeat customer--you've now just strengthen this customer's loyalty to you.
