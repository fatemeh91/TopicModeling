review/text: I have a rare disorder, Acute Intermittent Porphyria, which causes extreme neurogenic pain. It also caused peripheral neuropathy in my feet which adds pain to the point where walking is difficult. I've tried several foot bath/massagers by different manufacturers that seem to collect dust and then sold, for a loss, at a yard sale as they do not work so good. This Brookstone item is different in the way it maintains water temperature, and the power of its water jets which are directed at the toes. I use it twice a day and it is, by far, the best unit I have ever tried. Pain reduction is significant and lasts several hours. A downside is the foot rollers. Instructions advise to move feet forward and back over them but there is little room to do so. A minor flaw. This unit will never make a yard sale. I'm happy!
