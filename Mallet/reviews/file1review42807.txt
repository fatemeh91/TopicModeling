review/text: I've been taking Primal Defense for years. Garden of Life, the manufacturing company, was founded by Jordan Rubin who himself was stricken with Crohn's colitis, had cured himself taking an original form of this product among others. Read his book, "The Maker's Diet," and place yourself on the path to health and wellness. I take 6 Primal Defense caplets daily for my struggle against arthritis. It has improved my immune function as well as my four big dogs.In 2003 my eight yr. old Rottweiler was sick with an open infection in his paw. His immune system was done as it refused to respond to copious amounts of an antibiotic with prednisone. After 6-8 weeks he lay exhausted on the floor that left me thinking he may not pull out of it. I then decided to give him four Primal Defense caplets with his meds. In two days, I was shocked as he got up and slowly walked to the front door. He was getting well. Eleven days later he was off all meds and his wound healed completely. Seeing a revival like this was unbelievable experience that I argued was a valid testimony to the efficacy of this probiotic. It fell on deaf ears with his veterinarian. My dogs now see a holistic vet who advocates natural or raw foods for dogs and a probiotic. My own diet reflects a natural approach with green foods (See review of "Perfect Food") and natural oils and Primal Defense. I feel better than I have in a long time and my arthritis is waning. Thanks Jordan.Amazon offers the best price I can find anywhere at $32, free shipping and two day delivery. At 6 caps/day, I go through the 180 every month so I save a lot. The auto shipping makes it so easy as it comes to my door after they give me a 5 day heads up. Good deal!
