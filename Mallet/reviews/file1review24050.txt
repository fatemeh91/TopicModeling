review/text: This stuff really helps with constipation. Having suffered from IBS for nearly 20 years now, and the constipation it causes i had stuck a TON of money into colon cleansers, magnesium citrate, casgara sagrada, senna, fiber concoctions, etc. I had also tried cheap probiotic "pearls" which had done nothing for me. Then one day i saw a health program ON PBS in which an expert on probiotics said that if you buy one make sure it has at LEAST 15 BILLION bacteria colonies. The pearls i had been using didn't even approach that. Anything less then 15 Billion is ineffective she said. This one is also enteric coated to prevent stomach upset. After just 2 weeks of being on this i noticed improvement in my bowels; much less straining at the stool, much easier to "go". The beneficial bacteria seem to lubricate the colon and thereby prevent dry, hard stools, so throw out those useless stool softeners! No more feeling like you are trying to have a baby or passing cement blocks when you go to the bathroom. If you have ever been on antibiotics or colon cleansers or laxatives you should replenish your gut with beneficial bacteria anyway. Among the probiotics out there, this is worth the $19 i spent. Others were not. BEWARE: IF YOU ARE SHIPPING THIS IN HOT WEATHER MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR EXTRA ICE PACKS. WEBVITAMINS ONLY PUT ONE TINY ICEPACK IN THE LARGE BOX AND IT JUST FLOPPED ALL OVER, DOING NO GOOD WHATSOEVER. THANKFULLY I ORDERED THIS IN RELATIVELY COOL SPRING WEATHER. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE EXPOSED TO HEAT OR WARM TEMPS. DO NOT LEAVE THE PACKAGE SIT OUT IN THE SUN ON YOUR FRONT DOORSTEP FOR HOURS UPON DELIVERY.
