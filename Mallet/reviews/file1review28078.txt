review/text: I'm convinced this company has its own people put in false reviews on this product. It definitely does not mix easily without a blender or mixer, be prepared for 5mins of stirring and you'll still end up with lots of clumps. You also can not mix this in water as it tastes awful in anything more than 3 ounces of water and even then, pretty bad. If you put the normal 6-8ounces of water, it tastes like water with a tint of chocolate. Not a good taste..With milk, the mixing is even worse with a spoon but at least the taste vastly improves and it tastes a lot closer to chocolate milk.. Sorry, I will not buy this product again. I am still searching for a good protein shake, Twinlabs has a good one that mixes well in water or milk, but I won't refer it since it will put into doubt my review. I thought this one was a better buy, value wise.. But taste and hassle wise, it's not.
