review/text: Cons: you have to remember it takes 3 batteries not 2! that was my first problem i thought it was broken but really i forgot about the 3rd battery.Pros: great size, great vibration, great everything really! i would highly reccommend this toy to anyone looking for something to blow their sheets off
