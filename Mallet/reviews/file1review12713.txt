review/text: Based on the first week of use, I have to say I'm disappointed. There are 2 problem areas - first, the adjustment screw for the flame doesn't work right; second, the valve for refilling the lighter with butane seems to leak badly. Maybe I'm just not doing it right, but I've tried to figure out a way to refill & just seem to keep getting leaks. Also, I can't tell how much butane is getting in - probably not much since the lighter doesn't keep the flame for long.
