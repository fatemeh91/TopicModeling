review/text: I was skeptical about buying beauty products online from an unknown seller. I have no regrets! The product arrived with original seal. Not only did the product arrive sooner than estimated arrival time given here on amazon, DermaShoppe included samples with my purchase. It was obvious that the samples were selected based on my purchase - they are perfect for my skin. Now that's what I call customer service!!! BTW, I have sensitive skin and this special cleansing gel by Dermalogica is not too harsh for my skin. I use it as make-up remover (pre-cleanse) and regular face wash. Also perfect to clean make-up brushes. Highly recommend this product and this seller.
