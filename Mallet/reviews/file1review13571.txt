review/text: I love these insoles.....I wear them in every pair of shoes I own. The first time I bought them and started using them I definitely felt sore the next day but after I used them for awhile I do not feel it working my legs anymore but they are still awesome insole that help with my bad knees. One caveat is that they are fairly thick so they do not fit in some shoes.
