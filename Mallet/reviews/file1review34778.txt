review/text: I was using another very popular natural deodorant, and it just wasn't very effective, plus I was starting to get bumps and redness from it. So I was delighted when I tried E Plus High C and found it extremely effective in stopping perspiration odor. And the irritation went away immediately.I really don't like the fragrance, though. I see that others here like it a lot. That may be personal preference or body chemistry may make it smell different on them. To me it smells like perfume an old lady would wear. And it smells strong to me. On the other hand, I met a good-looking guy the other night who stopped me to tell me I smelled great. I had a jacket on, so maybe it was my Alba hand lotion (which smells strong, but I like it). I don't know. It wasn't my hair and I wasn't wearing perfume. If it was the hand lotion, at least the deodorant didn't overpower it.If anyone knows of a natural deodorant that is as effective but has a different kind of fragrance, please click on the comment option underneath this review and let me know.
