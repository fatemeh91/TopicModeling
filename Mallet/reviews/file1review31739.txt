review/text: Imagine this:At first you are afraid- you are petrified- You're traveling down the Mississippi river when suddenly your canoe overturns. You are wet, cold, and your gear and your canoe float gently down the river. Unfortunatly, you were knocked out when you hit your head on the side of the canoe. Your PDF keeps you afloat, but once you come to and return to shore, the only thing you have for the night is your POCKET SURVIVAL PAK located in your back pocket (yes, it is small enough to fit in there).For the price, it's worth it. The materials, you will find, are heavy duty and there is even a little sheet of paper in there to help you know what to do with the aluminum foil that is included - and everything else.I did buy some water purification tablets which also will fit into the waterproof pouch. That's about the only thing that I could really see as missing from this great little kit.Highly recommended and, for the price, well worth it. If you plan on going into the woods, take it along. It may save you life and You will Survive! ENJOY!
