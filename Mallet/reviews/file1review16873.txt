review/text: I have been using this hand soap on a consistent basis for several years. I find it is gentle to my skin, effective, and rinses reasonably well -- especially if diluted to desired strength. I even use it to clean our little doggie when necessary. I trust this soap and keep plenty on hand because it has become difficult to find in stores.
