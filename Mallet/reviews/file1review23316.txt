review/text: My burning question when ordering this was would it pick up the freaking Cheerios from the berber carpet under the baby's high chair? The answer is YES! In fact each Cheerio makes a satisfying little *plunk* sound as it lands inside this thing's dust pan. Thank goodness, I was so tired of stepping on those things in my socks! It picked up the smaller crumbs, as well--I wish I had bought this three months ago.
