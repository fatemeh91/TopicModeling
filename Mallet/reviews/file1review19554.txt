review/text: We tried several different stools and seats, with horrible results. They were usually too small for the average child and didn't provide adequate protection for boys who might "overshot" the toilet. The baby bjorn seat solved all our problems. It is easy to clean and no mess. My son now only uses it to go #2, but it still fits him nicely and is comfortable for him.
