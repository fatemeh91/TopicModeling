review/text: Product works well for pet hair. Sawdust gets trapped in the filter, but the filter is removable so it can be shaken out in the garabage can (not washable). The way the filter attaches to the vaccum doesn't always hold well, but i have found this a very minor issue. Very happy with the product!! Very good performance and great price!
