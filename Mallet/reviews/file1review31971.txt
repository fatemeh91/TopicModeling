review/text: I wish I had a better way to say it...other than YUCK!!! I have used green powders for years and seem to be pretty tolerant of the flavor and have found ways to make smoothies with them that masks the taste. But this one has me stumped -- no matter what I do I can not mask the flavor of it and can not tolerate it. I suggest you buy a small amount and try it before investing in the large sized one like I did...
