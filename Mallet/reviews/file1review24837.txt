review/text: Have been trying to conceive for 10 months with highly irregular cycles that range anywhere from 30-48 days. I've spent hundreds on OPKs and HPTs, Pre-Seed etc because I never knew when I would actually ovulate. I have been taking Fertilaid for 16 days and just got a positive OPK, on Day 16! I knew it would work because there are so many great reviews out there but now I can say it worked for me too. Can't report that I'm pregnant yet but just knowing that I'm "normal" again is almost (almost :) ) as good. Only thing for me was that I do get a dull headache taking this product, but increasing my typical water consumption eliminates it completely (and we all need to drink MORE WATER!) I feel more positive than I have in a long time and plan to take this product for as long as it takes. Any doubters out there, I was there with you but it really does work.
