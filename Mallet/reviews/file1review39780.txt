review/text: I have used the Lemon scent furniture products for many years. Now that I live in Florida the constant humid heat is hard on real wood furniture. My oak Lion Head/Foot table was drying out. Now I keep it clean and oiled with a faint Orange scent. I like the scent but I appreciate how it keeps my table looking new. Stopped the warping caused by the humid heat and fights that bit of sea in the air along the Treasure Coast.
