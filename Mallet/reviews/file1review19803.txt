review/text: Perfect fit, easy to use, my 3 yr old can place the seat on the toilet himself and can sit on it with the help of a small step stool. We rinse it off and hang it on the back of his bathroom doorknob. The seat doesn't wiggle at all, which I could see being a huge issue with some of the other over the toilet seats. Worth the extra money.
