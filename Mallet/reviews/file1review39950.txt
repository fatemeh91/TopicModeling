review/text: This whey protein really helps with muscle recovery especially when I am doing a different weight regime or a workout where I would normally expect sore muscles. I have been using this for about a year.Sometimes I mix it in my morning yogurt with a little fruit or for a workout usually a banana shake with skim milk. I make the shake before my workout: 1 banana, 1 scoop of whey vanilla bean protein and skim milk. Then I pop it is the freezer and it is partially frozen when my workout is winding down.On three occasions I have been sent the natural vanilla by mistake (shipper error). Happened again this week. Personally, I don't like the texture of the natural vanilla or the flavor. The Vanilla Bean has a superior texture, mixes better with other foods and has a truer vanilla flavor.Why isn't this a subscribe and save product? I love to save 15%!
