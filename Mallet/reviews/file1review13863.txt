review/text: I purchased these as a Christmas present for my fianc&eacute;e and she loves them. You really cannot walk-around with them on, but they are great when we are relaxing on the couch, watching a movie. They stay warm for quite a long time and she says that they are quite comfortable. I would highly recommend the neck pillow as well.
