review/text: This did not work at all for me. I might as well have been applying water to my armpits. Actually, that might have worked better. This stuff has a decent smell which is very mild. I wish it would have worked. If you're searching for a natural deodorant, Weleda spray deodorant and Queen Helene mint julep deodorant worked better for me. Another thing that works is applying Dr Bronner's liquid soap as a deodorant.
