review/text: Only gets one star because the review won't go through unless I give a star.THIS ITEM IS SIMPLY PUT... NOT UNSCENTED ANYMORE.The old unscented product was awesome. No scent and stopped the stink.Don't be fooled by the pic. The new "unscented" STINKS something awful.Just a damn disgrace how they discontinued this product. Just made absolutely no sense...
