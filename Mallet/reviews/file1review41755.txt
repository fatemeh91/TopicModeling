review/text: This was a great toothbrush while it worked. I've only had this tooth brush for 4 months and the handle now out of control. It just wouldn't shut off one day. I finally realized if you put it back in the charger is shuts down. It now won't turn back on. I'm going to try and get a replacement but I don't have much confidence in the product.
