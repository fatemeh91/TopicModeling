review/text: This product wonderfully cleans and restores all types of wood. It smells good and natural and is very easy on my sensitive hands. I heard an NPR home improvement show recommend it and he encouraged homeowners to try this product first before refinishing cabinets. While my cabinets do not need refinishing, I have used this product annually for quite a few years to keep the wood nice. They are still beautiful. It also cleans my cupboards when I spill something on them. I highly recommend this product.
