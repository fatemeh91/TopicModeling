review/text: I got this as a "hand-me-down" that was never used and I see why. My child won't sit on it at all, she prefers a potty chair. She cries as soon as I try to put her on it, and it does NOT fit that tight on our toilet. I tried to give it away to a friend, who bought the seat and her child won't sit on it either.
