review/text: I rated this item 4 stars simply because of the stomach issues that occur during the first few days of the cycle. It's not THAT bad, completely tolerable - I just felt a little nauseous (not enough to feel like I'm actually going to vomit, but good enough to where I don't want to eat a single thing that day). So, I guess that does help in the appetite suppressant department! Joking aside, this product is solid. I really like it, and it will be my number one choice for a while now. It gives me great energy without jitters or sleeping problems. The diuretic is gentle yet effective. I've noticed that I don't have to urinate more often, it's just when I do, it's much more than normal. My advice would be to drink lots of water as well (a no brainer with any supplement especially on gym days!). I'll also add that I'm a 22 year old female, healthy, and my goal is to cut fat, build some more muscle, and most of all tone up. & I feel that this product is GREAT for similar goals, and definitely even for those who are much more hardcore than I am when it comes to hitting the weights! Give it a try.
