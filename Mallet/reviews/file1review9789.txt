review/text: I thought that these tweezers were ultra sharp...perhaps a little too sharp. Even when I got the hair perfectly... the tweezers would act like scissors and cut it leaving little hair left for me to grab. It's more than a little frustrating. I also found that mine aren't perfectly aligned so even when I'm right on top of a hair it wont' grab it because the point is so specific. I think this tool is perfect to dig down to your ingrown hair and try to bring it above your skin surface and then use another pair of tweezers to actually pull it.
