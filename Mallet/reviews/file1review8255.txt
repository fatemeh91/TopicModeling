review/text: I purchased this bottle brush specifically for my Iced Tea/Coffee maker...not expecting it to be better (or worse ) than the one I had. To my surprise, the brush did a better job than I had expected. The flexible neck gave it more access to the bottom corners of the beverage maker and also to the plastic bottle I carry my beverage in.
