review/text: I have received this product as a gift from my friend. She knows I love to drink tea! I have had those little tea ball brewers, but by far this is really neat. Put the amount of tea into your cup and brew away. I also like how I can use the Bombilla to mix any natural sweetener like a spoon. The neat part of this product is you can even get every last drop from the bottom of the cup with just a slight tilt. In agreement with other customers the Bombilla is easy to clean. The quality is nice, and product is heavier then it looks this is a good thing because it is nice and sturdy. The red ruby studs add a nice "royal" touch.
