review/text: The MS-2 is fantastic. I am on my fourth... I've been using them for over 20 years. Much more power than any other shaver, easy to use and i travel around the world with it. The reason I'm on my fourth is that the internal battery eventually wears out. Thats it. For me no other shaver comes close.
