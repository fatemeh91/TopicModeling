review/text: I went from disposables to the Mach 3 Turbo when they sent me one in the mail, and i loved it, got so much closer. Now i use the Fusion exclusively. Some say the 5 blades is a gimmic, but i can feel a difference in that i dont cut myself at all, and the surface is wide enough to cut more at a time.
