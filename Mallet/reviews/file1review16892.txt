review/text: There are two Major design flaws that make this potty a disaster. The first problem is Elmo's hand. The toddler is supposed to high five Elmo to get "encouraging phrases". Unfortunately, Elmo's hand is right where my son's leg hits. As soon as he sits on the potty, it starts shreiking and doesn't shut up. This even annoys my Elmo loving son enough to keep him from sitting on it for more than a few seconds. The next problem is that the pee deflector just pops off. Any toddler can, and will, pop it off instantly. We had to run out to get a different potty right away. Leo loves Elmo but this potty is truly useless.al mom to leo
