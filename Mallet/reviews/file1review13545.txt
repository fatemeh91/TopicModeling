review/text: These insoles didn't fit into any of my shoes very well. I figured they would have best chance of fitting in my Nikes, I removed the insole from my shoes, put these in, and couldn't even make it out the front door they were so uncomfortable. The plastic on the bottom is very hard and hurt part of my foot since it wouldn't lay right in my shoes. I definitely would not recommend these.
