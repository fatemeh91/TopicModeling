review/text: The nylons are less fine than some support stockings out there, so they aren't to be worn with dresses. However, they do last longer and are more comfortable than some of the other brands. The maternity panel is comfortable. Jobst thigh highs last longer, but the sticky band can give you a rash. Over all, was fairly pleased with these.
