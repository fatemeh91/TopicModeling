review/text: I really like the waterproof function and that the buttons are easy to manage. It is also really quiet. What i don't like is it is too big around.....i know, i know...that is supposed to be a good thing, right? but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. The girth makes it difficult to insert and much less stimulating when using it to manually simulate intercourse. If it was 1/2" - 1" smaller around it would be great!
