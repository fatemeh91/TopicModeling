review/text: By law home heating pads are limited to a certain temperature unless they have a manual safety switch which automatically shuts off if you let it go even momentarily.This heating pad has a manual safety switch, so it can get extra hot.For some people with some injuries, only the extra hot heating pads reduce pain and inflammation and restore mobility in the joints. It is wonderful to be able to provide this relief at home and not have to pay the expense of a physical therapy session just to get a hot enough heating pad to provide relief from severe pain and stiffness in my joints and impaired range of motion for a few hours.Very strongly recommend this for you if you find most heating pads don't help much and you are careful not to fall asleep or anything else that could cause a burn. Not as safe as most heating pads, but much more effective at relieving my pain and allowing me to regain some use of my injured arm.
