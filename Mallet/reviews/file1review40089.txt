review/text: For just over 20 bucks you get everything you need for yoga. I was afraid this cheaper kit (compared to other brands) would arrive and be all, well, cheap and crappy, but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this package. The mat is nice, sufficiently thick and sticky; the strap seems sturdy, and the blocks are nice and soft but firm. The material that the carrying bag is made out of does seem a bit thin, but still very useable, and hey all this for barely over 20 bucks, the bag is really just an extra in my eyes. If you are looking for an inexpensive but very functional kit to begin yoga, this kit is it.UPDATE: Over a year later, this kit is still going strong, no problems whatsoever from anything. I use it regularly and it is holding up very well. Very pleased with this purchase.
