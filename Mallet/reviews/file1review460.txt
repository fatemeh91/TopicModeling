review/text: This product works for me. I'm a first time buyer and am pretty happy with my purchase! I read a few reviews complaining about how much noise the product makes but its really not too bad. If you have a fan or a TV on you're good. Also others were complaining about the smell, but its only noticeable if you put your nose right up on the device.
