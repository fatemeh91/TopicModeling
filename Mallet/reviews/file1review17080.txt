review/text: WARNING: DO NOT BE A FOOL LIKE ME::: Yes, I read the reviews that said the battery would die on this w/i months of purchase... I thought '..that won't happen to me.' This was a great product while it worked...now less than a year after purchase it may work for 5 minutes after I charge it all day or it may not last but 5 seconds. The adjustable blade is really nice but without working motor it is kinda useless. You may have guessed I would not recommend the MB100 to a friend nor purchase another. Good luck but don't say you were NOT warned...
