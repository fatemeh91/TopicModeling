review/text: I bought the Double rich chocolate as a meal replacement to aid weight/fat loss and promote muscle growth.Pros:-Cheaper than Muscle Milk-Has fewer carbs and costs less than Muscle Milk and Muscle Milk lightCons:-Tastes awful with water-Tastes alright with milk, but that adds about 10 carbs-Works with non-sweet Almond milk (still nothing to look forward to)-Did I mention it tastes bad-Really badSuggestions:If you're looking into a good cheap protein shake and don't care about taste try this. If taste is your thing go with Muscle Milk or MM light. Also the scooper that some reviewers can't find was located at the very bottom of my container. I had given up on it until about 1/4 of the jar was left and I saw the handle poking out. Not a bad product with Almond Milk. Mixes about the same as every other product I've tried
