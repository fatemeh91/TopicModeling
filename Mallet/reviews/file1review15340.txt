review/text: I just moved to the wild-fire prone desert southwest, and after a big fire in March, I knew as a smoker, it was not good enough to stub out my ciggies on the sole of my shoe and put the butt in the cigarette package. The chance of sparks flying from putting them out on my shoes is just too great. So, I went to good old amazon.com and found this ashtray, made by Zippo. I'm very pleased with it; it's come in quite handy. No complaints. More people should have them. The price was low, shipping was reasonable, and I received it quickly. Great!
