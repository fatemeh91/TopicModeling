review/text: This is the best toothpaste I've ever bought! No saccharin, no preservatives, no dyes, no animal products, kosher, and ADA approved! And it's all natural! No sweet after taste like conventional toothpastes. Fresh and clean feeling after ever brushing. I feel like this is much better for your teeth than conventional toothpaste. Even my dental hygienist commented on how clean my teeth wear at my last cleaning. I don't think I'll ever buy regular drug store toothpaste again.
