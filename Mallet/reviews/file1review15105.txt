review/text: Only one half of the product worked the first time we tried it. It was also very cheaply made and loud. I called the company, and they did agree to send me a replacement. When the replacement came it started to smoke as soon as I turned it on (thank God I tried it before I decided to use it!). On top of that the company wrote that it was an adult novelty product right on the package when they shipped it (so much for "discreet" packaging!). The company offered that I could choose any product from their website as an apology. Unfortunately, there were no prices anywhere....I didn't want to get something worth $5, so I asked them to send another Adonis to me. I turned it on, and it didn't smoke, but I really have no desire to use it after the grief it's caused me. I was incredibly disappointed with how cheaply made this product was, and will never order a Berman product again.
