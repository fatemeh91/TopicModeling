review/text: Battery gave out fairly quickly before it wouldn't hold a charge for less than five seconds. I had to open it up to fix and decided it wasn't worth spending the money to buy a new battery and solder it back on, instead I by passed the battery and applied 5V directly to the trimmer. Putting it together though was hard as once you open it stuff moves around because as aforementioned it is cheaply made. Would not recommend because it could not tolerate a once a week trim for a more than a few months. Also it cannot be used while charging so once you batteries blow you lose your trimmer essentially.
