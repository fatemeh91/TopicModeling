review/text: The sweeper is just what I expected it to be. It works well on carpeting, and so-so on hardwood floors. The handle must be put together with some force, or it will not stay together. Once it is put together with force (properly) it does stay together and the sweeper works very well for carpeted floors. Would recommend it for sure.
