review/text: Oxy-Powder Colon CleanseThis product is nothing more than a souped up laxative. Do not waste your money. It does not de-toxify or regulate. The product claims to produce three to five bowel movements the next day. It took three days to have any effect and then only produced one movement, and resulted in sever diarrhea later. I was left feeling the same afterward as I did before taking the product. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
