review/text: If you have any itchy spots on your skin that bother you - this is the product that will alleviate your problem. It is a great soap even for general cleansing every now and then to keep your skin healthy. The main tip is that it is kind of watery when you pour it on your hand so use it sparingly - then lather it in your hand and THEN wash with it. Otherwise too much gets wasted. For any athletes who have any fungal problems (groin, feet, etc.) this is the solution. Wash with it regularly.
