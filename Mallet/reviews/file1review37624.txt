review/text: Purchased from Walmart, when I tried opening the tube, the plastic top would not release. Then, when I finally did get it free, the vacuum inside sucked the nozzled top up with it. This led to some of the contents being drawn out as well. Now, when I turn the knob to lift the deodorant through the nozzle, it does not work well. I get too much deodorant. Any "body" else having this problem? And. . . . how can i reach P&G; to get a refund?Jack
