review/text: I bought a cruzer3 last year before I left on a 4 month trip. I was traveling light and didn't want to bring both a shaver and a trimmer, plus a separate recharger for both.As a combo device it does very well. This is the first foil shaver I've used, so I can't really compare it to any others; although I found that I preferred it to the rotary shaver I had been using. The trimmer worked fine, but it's width made it somewhat awkward & uncomfortable at times. Plus, there are only 4 cutting level adjustments. Once I returned home, I immediately switched back to a dedicated trimmer; it was simply more effective and comfortable.The only real complaint I have is with the battery life. After a year of use, I now only get 4 shaves out of a charge. If I were using it as a trimmer as well, that might only be 2. When new, I was getting 5 or 6 days (trim & shave) from a charge, so it's lost approximately half it's battery life in a year.For traveling, I definitely recommend the cruzer3. The shaver & charger are reasonably small & lightweight, although including some sort of case would have been nice of Braun. And the charger is dual-voltage, so you only need a plug adapter, not a voltage converter, in most places around the world.But for daily use, I think a separate trimmer works much better.
