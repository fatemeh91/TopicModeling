review/text: My husband has been taking this fertility blend pill four times a day as instructed to do, they were making him so tired and feel weak, so he only took it once a day two pills. He is still complaining that he feels tired and achey in his back and legs. So i don't know if its from this or just what he does for a living cutting trees. ? But just wanted to see if anyone else is having this problem with these pills? I don't want to keep having him take them if they aren't good for him.?Fertility Blend for Men
