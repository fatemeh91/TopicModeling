review/text: I could not figure out how to customize the shape to my liking without the risk of burning myself. So, after leaving them out to collect dust for a few months thinking about how to shape and not burn, I finally decided to use them as they were.They helped, but they wore out rather quickly. After six months of rotating these with orthotics, they stopped supporting my arch. Still a nice alternative, though, to costly orthotics.
