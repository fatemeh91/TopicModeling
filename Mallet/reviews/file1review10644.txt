review/text: It came in the roll of paper and to be able to test it, I have to touch the paper. A couple inches of paper is not an ideal size to test and the reading seems to be inaccurate. My husband and I have the same color reading which I know it is not so. And the color does not match to any of the color chart. I bought this product based on the reviews I red, and needless to say, I regret it.
