review/text: This thing looks crazy when you take it out of the package but it works wonders. I briefly glanced at the instructions and then got to work on my problem areas. I was able to work though a constant nagging knot in my shoulder/back area. I've had it 3 weeks or so and am primarily still working my upper back and shoulders. I know not to bother the knots too much but a few minutes every other day should be good for starters.Great product. It has helped me tremendously. If I could bring one to work and not look like an idiot I would. But I would, so I won't.
