review/text: I got this product for my 5 year old daughter. She had 2 huge planters warts, went to podiatrist, and that helped some. The doctor said that we would need up to 6 treatments in her office, costing a total copay of $300. I decided to try this and wait and see. It worked great and saved me $250!!
