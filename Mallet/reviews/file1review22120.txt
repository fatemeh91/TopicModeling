review/text: This set sounds like a good idea, but it has never worked for me! My son has taken a pacifier since he was a week old, but he hates this one! The surface is too flat and hard, he will never keep it in his mouth. I have never been able to get the display to work properly, it only displays partial numbers. I have always used a rectal reading for him (Safety First 10 Second Safety thermometer is GREAT!!!!).
