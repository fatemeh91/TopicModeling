review/text: As a nurse in the Cardiac ICU, I needed a good quality stethoscope. After reading the good reviews, I decided to try this one. I am very satisfied with this purchase. I have compared it with the Ultrascope and several different types of Littmann stethoscopes. The only one that is better, in my personal opinion, is the Master Cardiology by Littmann. Considering the price difference, I can't regret my decision to purchase this item.If you need to differentiate between a grade two and grade three systolic ejection murmur, you might want to select something else. But this is more than adequate for S1S2, even S3 & S4. Works fine for murmurs, rubs & clicks. Easily detect even fine crackles and wheezes. Bottom line: it works, and it works well. Can't miss for this price!
