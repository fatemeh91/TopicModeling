review/text: "I didn't realize the cabinets were that light of a color." That was the response from my husband after using this cream to clean the cabinets above the stove. I have used baking soda,among various other commerical cleaners. This makes the grease/grime ball up and wipe off. It does take a fair amount of cleaner. I have a small kitchen and it took almost the whole bottle. It leaves them with a clean shine. I will buy again and get a bottle for my daughter.
