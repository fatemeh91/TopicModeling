review/text: The new version of Glide floss is not what it used to be. The taste is unctuously sweet and it now breaks more easily. Why does Crest insist on messing with success? Its toothpastes, like this new version of floss, are sickeningly sweet. Is Glide still made using the original Goretex material? It doesn't seem so -- now it's just expensive floss tape ruined by marketing overkill.
