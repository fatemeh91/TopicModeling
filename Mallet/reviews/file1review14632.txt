review/text: I've been using this xylitol for months in my sinus irrigation machine. I mix it with the salt and warm water. The xylitol really helps to clean out my sinuses. The first time I used it, I was really shocked at home much I was able to blow my nose and clear my sinuses. It still continues to help after a year of use. It hasn't cured my sinus issues, but it makes a difference.
