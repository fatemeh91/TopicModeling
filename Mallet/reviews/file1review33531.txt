review/text: Noisy, and does not tolerate addition of mouthwash to the water. Unit failed after about 2 months. Contacted Waterpik who advised me not to use mouthwash in the flosser tank because there is a materials issue involving a gasket that swells because of the mouthwash ingredients . Ridiculous, I had another brand for several years with no mouthwash issues. Waterpik sent me a replacement part which I installed . I should not have to deal with a product that has gross limitations. Will never purchase a waterpik product again!
