review/text: After years of struggling with obesity, this product has turned my life around. Two months ago, I was parked on my couch watching reruns of "Small Wonder" pondering the idea of having a robot maid that could give me turkey whenever I wished. At this moment, I thought to myself, "You are stupid and fat. Why are you wasting your time thinking about turkey-serving robots when you could be getting ripped?". So I grabbed my laptop and started researching ways to get ripped quick. I didn't want to exercise because that is hard and I didn't want to change my diet because that's what crazy people do. After learning as much as I could about bodybuilding, I came to the conclusion that I needed to pound protein shakes if I wanted to look like a professional bodybuilder. So I ordered 6 tubs of protein powder and started a very regimented daily routine of mixing protein powder into all of my drinks and food. It was delicious (except for the gravy incident) and you can't argue with the results I'm getting. I have gained nearly 40 pounds and I can tell that in few more months, I will start to see my muscles start to bulge through my sweatsuit. Lookout summer, there will be a new contender for king the beach next year!
