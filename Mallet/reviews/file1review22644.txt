review/text: I have used Opalescence (10%) previously purchased from my dentist. Of course, the 15% is stronger and also works great. The Opalescence web site says this product can be used for 4-6 hours. I used it with custom-fit trays for 6 hours and saw immediate results. You should not be disappointed in this product.
