review/text: These breast pads were next to the worst breast pads I tried. I would end up soaking wet after one let-down!! The disposable Avent breast pads were great, I just couldn't use these. The absolute worst breast pads I used were the ones by evenflo. The gel/crystals would come out of the side of the pads and end up everywhere - including all over my son's face. I don't know if that stuff was non-toxic or not, but I just wasn't comfortable with the possibility of my son ingesting all that absorbant gel... The Evenflo pads were definitely the worst.
