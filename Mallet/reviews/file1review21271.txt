review/text: I bought two of these Oral-B toothbrush units in mid-December 2009, one for me and one for my husband. They are very effective, leaving the teeth looking and feeling clean. Problem: The units don't last long. Mine died after seven months, after a normal level of use. You can't get into the unit to see if the battery contacts need readjusting or something--if anything inside goes wrong, you're looking at purchasing a new unit. Like I just did, not having found a more durable alternative on the market. (The quality of the Sonicares I formerly used declined to the point where a unit typically lasted only a month or two.)
