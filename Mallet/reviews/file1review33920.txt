review/text: We love the idea of Seventh Generation and what it's stands for. We are horribly disappointed with the performance of the detergent. We had to run the dish washing cycle twice and it was still dirty. We thought our relatively new dishwasher was broken. There were stains that didn't go away until we switched to a different detergent (Electrosol). We will continue to purchase other Seventh Generation products except for their dishwasher detergents.
