review/text: this is seriously a great toothbrush. i reviewed a whole bunch of electronic toothbrushes to see which one stood out above the others. and this one claimed to be the best. i was so excited to get it and when i used it, it definitely lived up to its expectations. your teeth feel soo clean after using it, like you just came back from the dentist! the best part abt this toothbrush, aside from the cool timer and different settings, is the holder. i know, sounds pointless, but i like the fact that it can hold multiple brushes right there in the stand and has a cover to close it. im some what of a germ-a-phobe when it comes to toothbrushes being near other toothbrushes, so this is great! haha. and it's got a nifty lil travel case too. what more could u ask for ;o)
