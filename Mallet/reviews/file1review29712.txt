review/text: I have to agree with some other online reviews regarding sticking. They do stick a bit after some leakage. Let's face it, in the beginning, disposables are the only thing that make sense. I used disposables for the first 2 months and then switched to the washables. I tried Medela pads and they didn't absorb ANYTHING! The Avent pads absorb well and I didn't have leakage problems that other reviewers have had. My pads would get soaked and I wouldn't have wet spots on my shirt. They do move around within my bra, though. I have had times that the pad wasn't properly posiitoned and I had a let down and got wet. Let's face it, it's the &quot;hazard&quot; of the job! :)
