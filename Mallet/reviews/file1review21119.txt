review/text: We have used for several several years, and now the switch is broken. We have been happy with product, but when I called the company to get new switch, was told that they will not send replacement parts. Switch is simple to replace. 4 screws, clip off old clip on new, 4 screws back on cover. They are happy to have you send it in for repair, for $30, plus shipping, plus all the time you do not have the thermophore. by the time I would ship and have it repaired, it would be too close to new price. Bummer! so easy, yet company will not simply sell switch. So beware, it will work well for time, but if you need repair, you might as well throw away and get new one, perhaps different brand.
