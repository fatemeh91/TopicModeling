review/text: I usually use ON's Double Chocolate in the same line. I've been very satisfied with that product. I don't know why, but I decided to try something different. This is very different! It is incredibly sweet. As well the flavor is highly artificial. I've basically just got this sitting around. I don't think there is any chance that I will finish it. So, time to go back to double chocolate.This product is gross.
