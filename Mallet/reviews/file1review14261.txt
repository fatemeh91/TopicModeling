review/text: I bought this unit thinking it would help keep the shower clean. I was not under the impression it would clean every part of my shower. After all showers come in many shapes and sizes. And, it never cleaned one half of my 4 by 4 shower. But, I helped it by cleaning the other part of the shower.HOWEVER...Most problematic was the DESIGN FLAW in the battery compartment. The cleaner leaks or spatters into the closed battery compartment when it hits the nearest wall behind it.I recycled it today!Back to more manual cleaning...BH
