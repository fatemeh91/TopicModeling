review/text: I can't proclaim the benefits of this Q except those of what I've seen and my friend has experiences following a major surgery.I'm no medical professional so I can't explain the science behind this supplemental however bruising, inflammation & soreness even shocked the surgeon on her post-op office visit.Her incisions line were smooth and scar tissue has diminished of course she used in conjunction with a OTC scar gel but the results are remarkable.So you may ask how can you compare? Glad that you asked since she had a similar procedure no less than 2 yrs ago and scar tissue ,bruising & swelling lasted nearly 3 months.Also she caught a terrible cold that made recovery miserable. Her soreness remained for nearly 4 months post-op which resulted complications because she felt horrible for such an extensive amount of time.She takes the Q two times a day because she noticed that it caused her to haveMederma Skin Care for Scars, 1.76 oz (50 g)Boericke & Tafel Arniflora Arnica Natural Topical Pain Reliever Gel, Maximum Strength 2.75ozfrequent urination duh reduces inflammation that fluid has to exit the body right? Her energy was great and we noticed the difference on the morning that she did not take it. She's so excited and tells everyone how taking Q has transformed her life as well as expedited her healing time.I'm well aware of the skeptics and placebo effects however be that as it may..it worked & now I'm placing my own order. Hope that this helps especially for those of us who do not enjoy taking or giving our loved ones those addictive and possibly harsh prescription pain meds that only temporarily numbs the pain but does not aide in a speedy recovery.
