review/text: My Vicks thermometer arrived with a dead battery. I ordered a replacement battery (Energizer CR1225) and the thermometer then worked fine... one time. I put it away for a couple of months with the power definitely off; the plastic sleeve is quite hard, so there's no chance that the power switch was accidentally pushed during storage. The next time I needed the thermometer, the "new" battery (used just that one time) was just about dead. The thermometer would turn on briefly, but then the screen would fade out. I should have listened to all of the other reviewers who described severe battery problems for this and other Vicks thermometers. I suspect the small number of reviewers who said "it's great" just got lucky with specific thermometers that don't have rapid battery drain problems, whereas most of the thermometers have this problem. If you buy one of these cheap Vicks thermometers, be prepared for it to fail very quickly, even with a brand-new battery.
