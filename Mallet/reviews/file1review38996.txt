review/text: I have been searching high and low for the Personal Touch Razors. I'm assuming that this product line is being phased out by Schick since is is so very difficult to find in retail stores. In my opinion the "new" items that Schick has placed on the market are patently inferior to the Personal Touch product. The new products are clumsy, awkward and flimsy. I was thrilled when I found some remaining Personal Touch products on-line and have purchased enough to last me at least 6 years. I'm hoping that the Schick company comes to its senses and reinstates this wonderful product during that time. I can understand wanting to upgrade a product line, but to replace it with an inferior product? I really do not understand that logic.
