review/text: These saved me when I started working at a job where I was on my feet for 12 hours a day. I wasn't used to it and my legs ached something awful at the end of every shift. When I started wearing them my legs felt great after a long shift. The only thing I didn't like was after 4 months of wearing a pair maybe twice a week they lost there firmness and started riding down on me. Meaning I would have to visit the restroom hourly to pull them back up cuz the rode down as I walked. Kind of expensive to need to replace so often.
