review/text: Bought this after my last, more expensive beard trimmer bit the dust on an overseas trip (I plugged it in and it didn't have a switching adapter built-in!). I have only used this once (today), but I am as pleased as can be. Works incredibly well and I love the fact that it has a built in battery. Really a terrific bargain.
