review/text: In this instance I can honestly say, nothing beats the original produt. The price looks great until you realize you have to take twice as many as you did when you were using the "Original Body Mint". In additiona to the increased intake is the fact that this product didn't seem to work as well either. Sadly I purchased a bulk supply hoping to save some money, (bad move on my part) this will be the first and last order of this product. I'll gladly pay the higher price for the product that does work.
