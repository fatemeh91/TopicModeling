review/text: I bought this product after a lot of research on skin care. Retinol is drying but if you use it once every couple days at first you will be fine. I started using it once every three days for the first couple weeks, then every other day. Make sure you have a good lotion because your skin will peel. When your skin peels it means the top layer is coming off to get to the healthy skin underneath. Exfoliation is important as well, if you don't get the dry skin cells off you risk your pores getting clogged and causing acne. I used the entire bottle and now I use the 10x. My family and friends noticed a difference in my skin and have asked what I use. My skin was never the best growing up. I'm happy I found this product, even though it is very expensive. The price made me hesitate at first, but I read as many reviews as I could from different websites and went for it.
