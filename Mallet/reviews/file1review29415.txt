review/text: I had a problem with my blood pressure and needed something portable and easy to use. While this item fits the bill, the BP readings are not reliable just like the Dr. told me. I hate the arm cuff machines but they are much more reliable. This one has all of the bells and whistles but I wish they could make them have more reliable readings. My BP readings with this items were 30+ points off each time that I compared them with the readings from the Doctor's office.
