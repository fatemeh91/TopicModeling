review/text: I've been taking these on a empty stomach to help break up a fibroid and to prevent a reoccurance of breast cancer. I'm not yet sure if they are helping but I am pretty sure that they are not hurting. I recently read that serraptase (sp?) and nattokinase were better. I'm trying them now. Prices were best on Amazon.
