review/text: I was given a small box of these as a gift at the beginning of my pregnancy and I ended up taking these religiously for the rest of 40 weeks.Pros:- It has enough acid folic and iron- It has lower lead level (not the lowest though) than other prenatal vitamins in the market- My baby was born at a good size (I am a very small woman)- My baby is healthy. He latched on well at birth. He had mild reflux which he already outgrown at 4 month-old. He has mild cow milk protein allergy (I blame genetics) But he is the most content baby I have ever known. He will go without a single cry most days after the first couple months.Cons:- Yes, these are in fact horse pills with a terrible smell. I gagged in the first month but took on a tip to take it with smoothie. After a while, I learned to relax my gagging reflex and it was fine to take with milk (I still could not take it with water)- Not enough calcium. I needed to supplement.I am debating of taking 1 star off for the cons but the fact that my baby is healthy at birth and latched on, I will have to give it 5 stars.I stopped taking these after the birth of my son. Wish I continued. I heard it would help with hair falling out after birth.
