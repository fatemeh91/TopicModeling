review/text: When my Chirpractor told me to get the Body Back Buddy because it would save me money in Dr. bills I highly doubted him. My problem is tight muscles from overuse keeping them same positon for too long. Wirh thw Body Back Buddy you can get directly to the muscle a and with a little pressure can release that muscle. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. Highly recommended.
