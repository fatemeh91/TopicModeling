review/text: I originally started taking the Women's Just 1 multivitamins until I became pregnant. These pills are big but they are not hard to swallow. They don't really have a bad after taste and it goes down pretty easily. I love that it's only once a day and you are good to go. It does make your urine darker so remember to drink plenty of water with it.
