review/text: I bought this item with high expectations after reading all the reviews...After a few weeks of use, I can't say I feel any difference both short term (right after I take it) or long term(since I started taking it). I continue to take it, much as I do vitamins, on the good faith that it's beneficial for me, even though I feel no difference physically.
