review/text: This was my first purchase from CondomMan, and I can say that I'll probably purchase from him in the future. My variety pack contained 104 condoms of five different brands and thirty varieties. I'm definitely not complaining that I received a few extra! Overall, I am pleased with the variety. That being said, my variety pack DID NOT contain Okamoto or Kimono brand as advertised, and was VERY skimpy on Trojan. All expiration dates were at least two years out. Most expire in 2014 with some expiring in 2015. I would not recommend this variety pack for those that are not into flavored condoms, as this pack contained quite a few. Here's a breakdown of what my variety pack contained:4 CautionWear-iron grip (silicone lubricant)8 Durex-enhanced pleasure lube4 Durex-high sensation4 Durex-performax4 Durex-pleasure max4 Durex-extra sensitive4 Durex-her sensation4 Durex-maximum love4 Durex-Avanti BARE (polyisoprene, non-latex)4 Durex-rainbow colors4 Durex-orange flavored2 Durex-apple flavored2 Durex-strawberry flavored2 Durex-banana flavored6 Lifestyles-pleasure shaped4 Lifestyles-ribbed pleasure4 Lifestyles-sheer pleasure4 Lifestyles-ultra thin4 Lifestyles-ultra sensitive4 Lifestyles-assorted colors4 Lifestyles-Tuxedo (black)2 Lifestyles-SKYN (polyisoprene, non-latex)2 Lifestyles-banana flavored2 Lifestyles-strawberry flavored2 Lifestyles-vanilla flavored4 ONE-super sensitive2 ONE-pleasure plus2 ONE-The Legend (larger)2 ONE-glowing pleasures (glow in the dark(!!!))2 Trojan-ENZ (regular lubricated)1 coupon for 10% off on my next purchase from CondomMan!
