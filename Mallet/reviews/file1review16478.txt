review/text: I had ordered this back in May and I got to tell you it works great. I use this stand everyday to give my hair volume and curls with my stand up hair dryer stand. It does work great and I couldn't be more happier. I would recommend this to any one who really wants volume and curls with the curling brush, volume brush, or both. I love it.
