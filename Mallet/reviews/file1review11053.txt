review/text: I had used Body Mint in the past, I've been on a low carb diet for the past year. When I saw the price difference between this product and body mint ($12 difference) I decided to try this out. I've been using it for the past three days and can already tell a difference. One thing that is important for anyone to know who takes this supplement or body mint is that your poop will be green. It just will, and I didn't know that when i first started using it, so i hope that this little disclosure will help any newbies.
