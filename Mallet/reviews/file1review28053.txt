review/text: I've been using this protein for several months now and it seems to work well for me. It is low carb and doesn't taste bad (better with skim milk though). I've only tried the double chocolate, so I don't know if the other flavors are good or not. The price is very competitive compared to other brand and non-brand proteins, and the serving size of 24g per serving works well, because you can always double it if you want more, yet 1 scoop plus milk is usually good for a good 32-34g serving.
