review/text: I was so impressed with some of the reviews, I bought 2 sets of pads and could not wait for them to come because I was having some much pain on my left metatarsal. This pad is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!! It made my pain worse. The pain got so bad it went all the way up my leg and was burning so bad. The pad is too thick, so it takes up too much room in your shoe which makes the pain so bad. Also, it dosen't stay in place. The pads ended up all the way down by me heels. Not worth the money!!!!!! Try Footminder's catwalk orthotics They are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry FootSmart this product is not good.
