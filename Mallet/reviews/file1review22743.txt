review/text: I ordered this product with high hopes after reading many really good reviews; however it literally made me sick to my stomach! I took the product and 20 minutes later I was doubled over in pain. I tried taking it another time just to make sure and the same thing happened. I am someone who works out 5 days a week, eats a clean diet and drinks about a gallon of water a day. I guess I'm one of the unlucky ones that cannot tolerate it.
