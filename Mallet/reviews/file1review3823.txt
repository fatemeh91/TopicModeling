review/text: I have been getting painful cluster headaches, and read in a nutrition book that there are several herbs that will dull or get rid of your headache. I noticed that this tea has a lot of those herbs, and it worked! It has worked several times! I don't know if it only works for cluster headaches, but try this (along with a hot pad or cold compress) before any painkillers. It helps so much!!!
