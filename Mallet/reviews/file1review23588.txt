review/text: I am 40 with mixed oily and dry/wrinkled skin. The fruit fiesta peel (used alternatively with the pumpkin peel) has taken years off my appearance, reduced wrinkles, eliminated blackheads, and has pretty much eliminated acne breakouts. It burns a bit (which means it's working). I use it 1-2 times per week and the pumpkin peel 1-2 times per week.This product is 100% natural, smells delicious, and my skin glows and looks so fresh and new after I wash it off!
