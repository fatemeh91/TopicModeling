review/text: Got this in the mail today along with 4oz of Zippo fluid and 3 packs each of flints and wicks. The lighter has a wick and flint in it already but has no fluid for obvious reasons. It's already got that "used" look to it (which I enjoy) so there is no harm in throwing it around in your pocket with change and whatnot. It lights on the first flick of the wheel almost every time and the fluid lasts a long time. DO NOT OVER FILL! If fluid drips out of either the top of the unit or spills out the filling end, you will have to wait for it to evaporate, otherwise when you flick your Zippo on the entire thing will burst into flames and you will most likely drop it. This has not happened to me but it is definitely possible. Remember this isn't a disposable lighter and it requires maintenance. You need to refill it, and replace the flints or wicks every so often, but it is a very nice lighter. Great for your money, and it's made in the USA like they always have been. Despite popular disbelief, this is a legit Zippo from Bradford Pennsylvania. I don't actually smoke but I love these little things. A friend of mine uses Ronsonol (yellow-bottled lighter fluid commonly found at grocery stores). Highly recommend this product.
