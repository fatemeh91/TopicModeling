review/text: I was really surprised when I read some of the other reviews. My son is 16 months old and I've been using these covers since he was about 6 months old. I have three of them, all have been washed and dried more times than I can count and I've never had any problem with shrinkage or fading at all. I will agree that they snag easily, and my rings are always catching the terry, but I think it's fantastic!
