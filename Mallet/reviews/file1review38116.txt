review/text: I've been suffering an elbow tendonitis for 15 years now,due to heavy arm workouts.My right hand is my weak one,so I get a lot of pain there.First,I decided to control the pain using a special training plan,consisting exercises that don't put so much pressure on the elbows.That worked out,but just for a while. Recently I discovered the healing power of the magnets.I purchased the magnetic elbow support and started wearing it around 15-16 hours a day. At the beginning I wasn't so optimistic about it,but in a while I started noticing improvements. It took me about 2 weeks until the pain stopped! Unbelievable! And the most important thing is I don't have to stop working out,reasonably of course. I recomend it,but be patient. If you've been in pain for years, it'll take longer to heal.Best Regards
