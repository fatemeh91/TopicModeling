review/text: I've had trouble with Plantar Facitis for years. Podiatrist gave me one of those big clunky AirCast Night Splint Boots. It works, but not for me. The Freedom Dorsal PF Night Splint, however, keeps my foot in position without being so clunky and uncomfortable. Also, I don't have to take it off for midnight trips to the restroom or to check on the kids - which means I don't wake my husband up with that loud, ripping velcro noise. It's a win all the way around.
