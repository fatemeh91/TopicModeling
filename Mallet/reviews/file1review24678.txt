review/text: This was my first time ordering a product other than books or CD's offline. And it may be my last. It's not that the vanity bench is terrible, it's just not as nice as I expected from the photo and description. Somehow I must have missed the product description, because I did not see that it was a metal frame, or that the seat cover was vinyl. I think it must have been updated since I purchased. Based on the description of the canvas drawer, I also imagined the seat cover being canvas and I imagined the frame being wood or a lighter metal that isn't so heavy. Getting past my preconceived notions, the product is okay. I would never have bought it if I had seen it in a store. It looks more like a $25 item you would get at wal-mart. By the time you add shipping, the bench ends up being close to $50 and for that price I would have rather spent a few more bucks and picked out one that I really liked. It was really simple to put together and it seems really sturdy so if you just need a basic white bench, with no frills, then this may be the bench for you. The vinyl seat cover is practical since it will be easy to clean, but it's not very attractive. I personally prefer a little more in the way of "pretty" details.
