review/text: After searching the internet for reviews and ingredients for the best prenatal; I decided to order these. I don't have issues with taking large pills, but even for me, these are bigger than I prefer to have to take on a daily basis. I started taking while trying to conceive and so I can't comment on how they affect my pregnant tummy (yet). They have not given me any side effects except turning urine bright yellow. I liked what the included for ingredients and plan on continuing during an entire pregnancy unless my stomach decides otherwise.
