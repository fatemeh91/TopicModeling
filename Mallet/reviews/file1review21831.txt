review/text: Ok, I LOVE this stuff. When I combined slimquick extreme with a low carb diet, I lost and maintained a good amount of weight. I went from 145 to 133 in 13 days. Yes, I know, results will vary, but I had fantastic results.DON'T ever take it on an empty stomach!!! You will get majorly ill for hours. The caffeine and everything in it will make you feel yucky unless you eat first.
