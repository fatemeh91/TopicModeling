review/text: We substitute breast milk with formula since i dont produce enough breast milk. We have tried Similac when he was 2 weeks old and he never finished it and we swicth to Nestle but he also refused to drink it. We finally get a free sample from enfamil and we give it a shoot and he love it. Since then he never fuss again and he always drink it! I think Enfamil is the closest to breast milk
