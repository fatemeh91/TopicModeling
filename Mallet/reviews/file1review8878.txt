review/text: I definitely feel great after my morning "Vibrance"... but sometimes I have a hard time getting the last little sip down... it is gritty. My husband makes fun of me though, and he has no problem with it, so I guess everyone wouldn't agree with me on that one:) Overall... great product and definitely worth a little grit to have all the benifits!!
