review/text: I do only use it for energy boosting in the mornings. One in the morning and one in the early evening. Two at a time makes you feel wired! It is a great helper when you do tread or other cardio for lasting longer. No pill does it by itself but if you eat right (Atkins) and exercise the pounds will go away.
