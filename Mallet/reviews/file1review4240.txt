review/text: I shave my head - so a clean, heavy-duty blade is a must. The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can't dull after 2-3 attempts either.These Fusions are the best blades I've used for the task. I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face. The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.Even with a week's growth on the head, the blade is up to it (granted, I'm pretty bald, so we're not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here). It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that's needed.The one flaw is not the blade's fault - but it's still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you're using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.I've cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I'm switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick. It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot. It can be the kind of cut you'll actually need to pay attention too.Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor's series of blades will make it quite a bit worse. If it was just my face, I probably wouldn't make the mistake, but since I'm shaving my head I can't always see what I'm doing, and that can be the problem. I've never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.That is not the blade's fault - it's mine! But I can't imagine I'm the only one whose done this. I know we're all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised. If you need a clean shave for thick stubble, this should work for you.
