review/text: Well it did change my color. I didn't bleach it out which I wish that I had because it didn't show up purple at all on my reddish brown hair. It just made my hair look dark brown. It also washed out in weeks and now my hair is a funky fake red color which I really hate. I would say bleach first but don't expect it to stay in for long.
