review/text: The shaving stick is meant to be rubbed over your warm wet face a few times, and then the lather is built directly on your face with a not too wet shave brush. Rewet the brush slightly every so often as you build. I've tried a few shaving soaps and this is my favorite. Light scent of musk and citrus, gobs and gobs of lubricating, moisturing lather that doesn't leave your face dry like so many canned shaving creams do. Inexpensive, but a classic scent. Highly recommended.
