review/text: I suppose all thermometers work well. I mean, if they don't tell you the temperature, they won't last long.I rarely get sick. But when I do, I get cranky. Sitting for minutes, trying to breathe through a stuffed-up nose, while an oral thermometer reads my temperature doesn't help.This product is fast, and accurate - and it doesn't cost a fortune. If I use it once a year, it's worth it for the comfort. For a larger family, it's even more valuable. Good buy.
