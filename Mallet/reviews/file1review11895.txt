review/text: Does an effective use but I regret the purchase because:- the charger weighs more than the normal rechargeable shaver and thus difficult to carry on trips, and- it does not have a universal charger/adaper that can work on 110-220 volts as rechargeable shavers normally do. So it is useless if you travel to Europe as I do.From now on, I will stick to Braun, Philips etc.
