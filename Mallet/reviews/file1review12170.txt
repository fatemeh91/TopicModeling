review/text: I have been taking the Rainbow Light Prenatal vitamins since early pregnancy and still am 15 months after giving birth, as I am breastfeeding my son. I never had any problem with them. I don't think they're any larger than other prenatals, and I didn't mind the mild after-taste that quickly vanishes. I felt great all throughout my pregnancy and know that these vitamins had something to do with that. They're excellent quality, in my opinion, and all-natural which was very important to me. I recommend them!
