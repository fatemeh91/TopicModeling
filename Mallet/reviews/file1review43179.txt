review/text: I have been using this product for 6 or 7 yrs now and I am telling the truth when I say you will NEVER EVER have to scrub your tub again. I use my hand held shower head to spray down the walls and shower curtain when I am done showering to get off any visible soap, then I dry off my body to give the walls a moment to drip off, then I spray it all down with the Daily Shower Cleaner. Since I have been using the product for years, I know now that I can skip a day or two a week and it does not matter - it still stays clean. If you have more than one person using the shower, I would say you would only need to use this product after the last person has showered for the day - I think the trick is not to let the soap residue dry before spraying. The only cleaning I have had to do is to use a cleaning cloth (like Clorox wipes) around the corners where I keep the shampoo bottles etc. No scrubbing - no kidding! I tell everyone to get this stuff - I even bought a case of it so I could give each of my sisters a bottle to prove how good it is. You won't be disappointed.
