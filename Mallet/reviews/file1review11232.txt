review/text: The thermometer tries to be "speedy" and gives faulty readings. If you take three readings in a row, with a minute in between, its reading can vary by an entire degree. I've NEVER gotten the same reading twice in a row. :-/In order to get a valid reading, I have to take 4 readings and average them. In my opinion, this defeats the purpose of it being "speedy".Go with another brand ...
