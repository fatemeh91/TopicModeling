review/text: I used to buy the bargain brand whey for 30 bucks a 5 pound bag. It tasted bad, didn't mix well, and had shady ratings on review sites. Here, ON continues to impress with their high standards, great taste, and excellent nutritional content. This flavor beats out all of their other vanilla flavors. This, along with their double chocolate, will likely be the new staple protein powder in my diet as a college club athlete.
