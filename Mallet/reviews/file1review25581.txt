review/text: This fell on the floor as I was taking it out of the box, fell totally apart, and despite all sorts of effort on my part to put it back together, it doesn't work very well. Maybe it is my fault and I am butterfingers, but something should not break that easily, especially if it is something that is made to be used around hard floors, i.e. the bathroom.
