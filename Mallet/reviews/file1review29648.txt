review/text: These are SO much better than the disposable. They may seem like a big investment to begin with, but they more than pay for themselves. And they don't get heavy like the disposable pads. They're so soft you don't feel like you're wearing anything in your bra. I bought three packs and now I only have to wash once a week or so. Wonderful!!!
