review/text: This oral spray caps my anti-bad breath regimen. I've had bad breath for a while and I started using the Therabreath system. When I discovered that bad breath also originates from the back of the throat and the tongue, I asked Therabreath if they had something for it. And of course they did! Therabreath has everything bad breath related you can think of. I started using this oral spray and it has helped eliminate my bad breath.If you're serious about getting rid of bad breath, and want to kill it at the very source, you must add Therabreath Plus Oral Spray to your regimen. It reaches those parts that your toothbrush, floss, or oral rinse cannot, and maybe the the long-overdue solution to the bad breath problem you've had for years.
