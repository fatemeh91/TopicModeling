review/text: If you plan on keeping your teeth, I wouldn't recommend buying this product. You'll practically rip your front teeth out trying to bite off each chunk, and your rear molars will be sore the REST OF THE DAY from the chewing, and that's from consuming only one bar! If available, select the choc-choc chunk. It's tastier and much easier to eat!
