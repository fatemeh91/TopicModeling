review/text: This changing pad cover is ok but am fairly disappointed on the softness, or the lack thereof. For the Simmons name you would think that they would have made it softer. I washed it and also used fabric softner and it still feels like a cheap towel. I ended up getting another changing pad from Pottery Barn Kids for a couple dollars more and its super soft. I now just use this one as a back up in case my son has an accident on the one I prefer.
