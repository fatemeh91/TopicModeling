review/text: I take a bubble bath nightly, and I have tried every kind of bubble bath that I can get my hands on. California Baby's Overtired & Cranky bubble bath is hands-down the best product of its kind that I've found!I like California Baby for a number of reasons, including the fact that there is no Sodium Laureth Sulfate or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in the bubble bath, both of which really dry out my skin. It's almost impossible to find even a handful of products that don't use one of those two ingredients, so I was thrilled to discover California Baby! I also love the light, natural smell (you don't feel like you're bathing in an air freshener), the large amount of bubbles (a lot more than you might expect from a soap-free product), and the fact that it's extremely gentle. Plus, each bottle comes with a bubble wand inside, so you can blow bubbles all over your bathroom!I know that I'm carrying on a lot, but I really think that anyone who enjoys a nice bath should try California Baby. If you're like me, you won't want to use anything else.
