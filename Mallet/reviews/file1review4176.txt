review/text: This situation goes back to September 2010!! THIS PURCHASE DEMANDS A SUBZERO PRODUCT RATING.The 12 Gillette Fusion Blades were copies not made by Gillette. DULL AS A HOE!! When I contacted Amazon I was told that the money that I paid would be refunded and a new cartridge of GILLETTE blades would be sent. (Email Documentation is available..) As of this date none of the promises has been met.Be careful about your purchases!!!I'm through with Amazon.-- Don --
