review/text: Having had a hysterectomy 8 years ago, I was prescribed Premarin. I took this prescription faithfully for 3 years, despite feeling horrible. Finally I had enough and weaned myself off of it. However, menopause set in, and at 45 I began to have all the symptoms associated with it. The hot flashes were the worst. I heard about Dim on "Know the Cause" and decided to give it a try. I can honestly say that my hot flashes have decreased by 50 - 75%. I take one capsule with breakfast and one with supper. I have had no negative side affects whatsoever. I would recommend this product to any woman who wants to go the natural route to control hot flashes. Another good thing to know about this product is that it is made from broccoli and not soy.
