review/text: I ordered this product around 20 weeks of being pregnant with twins. I was experiencing intensive pelvic pressure and even strained my stomach ligaments from the extra weight of my boys. I followed the ordering chart initially; ordering a small since I'm 5'4" and my pre-pregnancy size was 0-3. I couldn't even fit that cradle around my lower waist!I sent it back and ordered the medium to accommodate my larger than normal stomach with twins. I have worn this everyday since, and I know it has kept me from bed rest and able to work.Around week 30, I started experiencing extreme stretching in my stomach as my boys were gaining weight. I ordered a BellyBra as well (in medium), and I wear both at the same time! The combination helps me to stay as active as a woman with twins can. This cradle has been a great investment to get me though this pregnancy. I recommend it to anyone that needs support.The only down-side is that the straps are visible, especially in summer outfits.but I think it's a small price to pay for comfort. For work, I just made sure to buy shirts that covered the straps.
