review/text: Ben-Gay, Icy Hot, blah blah... These products are mild dilutions compared to Tiger Balm. I tiny smear goes a long way. I have used it in the past for all types of muscle aches. Most recently I have been recovering from a ruptured patellar tendon repair and fractured ankle. Walking was horrendous and the physical therapy was making this 6'1" 40 year old man cry like a baby. I started rubbing a little Tiger around the kneecap and ankle before any strenuous activity and the pain has gone down from a 6+ to a 1. A 1.7 oz tin will last in my house of 4 for close to a year. I even put a dab under my nose when I'm congested.
