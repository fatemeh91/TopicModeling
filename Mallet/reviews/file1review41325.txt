review/text: I can't tell you how happy I was when these finally hit the market. Traditional condoms (even magnums) had left me a virgin till I was 20 for fear of un-protected sex. If you're looking for a condom larger than a standard magnum this is your gimmick. The price has gone way down and they are well worth it. Never had a breakage problem and the fit is perfect. Ecks and Peter Steele give it 2 big thumbs waaaay up.
