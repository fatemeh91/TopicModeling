review/text: I gave it 2 stars because it does what it says it does, but about as enjoyable as eating a really good steak just after having novocaine injected into your mouth. (you know it should be great, but your getting no feeling at all)So if your goal is to brag about how long you can go, then this is the product for you. If you want to have any idea what is going on then look else where. Could not tell if I was in or out, "at attention" or limp.
