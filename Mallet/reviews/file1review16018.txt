review/text: I love it. I find it less awkward then a traditional razor. It did not take long at all to learn to use, but it did take a couple extra passes to clear the remaining stubble. I did buy a bottle of the "headslick" product to go along with it, and it was definitely worth the purchase. You will NOT be disappointed. Plus, if you order from the official headblade website, a portion of the purchase goes to childrens cancer research through St. Baldricks. Sorry, Amazon. Great shopping site, but I had to plug theirs!
