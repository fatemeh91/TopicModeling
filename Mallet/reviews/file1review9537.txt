review/text: This ice pack was great to take traveling because you can fill it with the hotel's ice. Unlike other ice therapy bags that need to use a freezer to recharge the cold. The only thing I would have liked would have been ties instead of the velcro. I have a broken foot and used this to reduce the swelling. The bag doesn't wrap around my foot the way I wanted it to. Also, after taking the velco straps on and off kind of shredded the material on the outside of the bag . It probably would work better on a body part that is straight, like an arm, leg, etc. Otherwise, I was very happy with the fact that it did not leak or sweat all over the place.
