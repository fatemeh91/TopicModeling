review/text: Big box, small container. Actually a container in a container. It reminds me of the wine bottles with the huge indention in the bottom. The old container lasted a couple months. This one lasts a little over a month. $12 for the product, $6 postage. I am in search of a zinc oxide underarm deodorant that is not full of talc and has more than tablespoon of product.
