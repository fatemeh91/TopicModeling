review/text: Once you're stuck with Gillette, you're stuck for life!!!! OK so yah this new blade system they got going on is nice. It is a nice shave. And the first use or 2, it doesn't feel like shaving cause it's that smooth. But really that's it. You only get maybe 4 shaves out of each blade before you have to switch. Unless you LIKE looking like a bloody mess. Expensive - Gillette has a death grip on all American men. Cause the stuff works that good but they charge you a mint just to get the goods. I like it, I'm a user, but arg there's no way these are worth so much money.
