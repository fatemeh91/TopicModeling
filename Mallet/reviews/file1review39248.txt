review/text: I purchased this in 2006 so I could avoid paying $20 per haircut at the barber. My wife has used it to cut my hair about every 3 weeks since then and it still works flawlessly. I've never oiled it or performed any kind of maintenance. Read the other reviews for features, how well it cuts, etc. -- but believe me, this will last you a while.
