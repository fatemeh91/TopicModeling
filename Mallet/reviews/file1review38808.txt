review/text: Some reviewers mentioned that they mix it with water??? I don't think you're supposed to do that, you're supposed to use non-fat milk.Anyway, unsure whether they changed their formula, the first can I got did not mix too well as others have mentioned, but the second one mixes easily with no issues.The powdered product tastes better than the cans for sure. The mix of vegetable fats and fiber does a good job supressing your appetite. It is not too hard to keep near 1200 calories per day without feeling like you're starving. I have lost about 5 lbs in about 2 weeks. (hopefully fat, not muscle) Be sure to have plenty of protein, eat smart, fruits and V-8 or something. And the 500 calorie meal they recommend...that's a substantial meal if you don't lard it up with butter and cheese.
