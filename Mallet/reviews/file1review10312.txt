review/text: I have Type 1 diabetes and use an insulin pump. My insulin pump company recommends that you use only Energizer Max alkaline batteries because other brands often aren't "read" correctly by the pump and the pump will reject them, saying the battery is no good. So I have always bought the Energizers. I have no access to Costco, WalMart or anything like that on a regular basis and do not drive so I usually get mine from Walgreens or CVS. Sometimes I'd find a 16 pack of AAA on sale for $12-$13 but the last time I checked the regular price was around $16. When I saw Amazon had these as a Gold Box deal I ordered 3 packs that cost me half of the normal drugstore price. I was a little worried when I got them and the packaging looked slightly different than what I normally get. The ones I just got from Amazon seem to be made for the Canadian market. I don't really care because they work in my insulin pump and I dont have to worry about buying batteries for more than a year (each one lasts 10 days for me). I also use AAA batteries in some of my other diabetes equipment plus various remote controls.Even when I need batteries for other uses, such as a smoke detector or a scale, I buy Energizer. I've found them to be more reliable than Duracell or any other brand.
