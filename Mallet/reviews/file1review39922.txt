review/text: This is a nice protein that mixes really easy. The taste was odd at first, but I got used to it. I use it for a before bed Low calorie supplement. It has the lowest level of the bad stuff such as cadmium, arsenic, lead and mercury vs Muscle Milk and the EAS products. Thats the big selling point for me
