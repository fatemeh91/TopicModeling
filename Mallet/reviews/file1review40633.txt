review/text: I made the mistake of buying two big bottles of this stuff at Costco. When I first used it I though the dishwasher was broken, washed dishes were gross. Lots of food residue, sometimes to the point that it looked like the dishwasher hadn't even cycled. Really nasty. Switched back to our normal brands and everything is fine. I'm going to see if Costco will refund the money on this and make sure they know it is a useless product.
