review/text: I would have given this product 5 stars for design, comfort and ease of use but quality was a big issue. As most moms who are potty training know, it's kind of messy. I was wiping down the potty seat with a Lysol wipe and the oval handle at the back of the potty seat cracked along the plastic edge. The potty seat can still be used, but it was disappointing considering the price. I probably wouldn't let this discourage me from purchasing the product. It's a great design that can be used easily and makes the potty look more comfortable for little ones.
