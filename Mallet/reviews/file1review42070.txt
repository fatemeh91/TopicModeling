review/text: I finally got my "massage chair" after a long 4 weeks. As soon as it was available, the shipping was fast and it arrived prior to the estimated date of arrival. Putting it together only took a few steps, I probably don't even need to read the instructions. However, after putting it together and tested it, I was a bit disappointed to find out that there were no actual physical motion going up and down or any movement of any direction. It is just a vibrating chair with multiple settings to simulate massaging procedures like hammering or sliding. It is "okay" but I guess I was expecting too much and from what I have read from previous reviews, I thought that it was a great buy. To make the matter worst, the vibration is really loud and annoying, I have to set it to the lowest setting to bear the noise. When watching TV, I have to turn off the massage chair completely to enjoy a show or keep it "on" but increase the volume of the TV which is unwelcome to others around me. This vibrating lounge chair shouldn't be compared to a $1500 massage chairs, it is nowhere near the cheap Homedics antigravity Shiatsu Massage chairs. The only advantage I can compare this unit to the others is its portability of folding it for stowage or transport. In addition, a full body "vibrating massage" which includes the legs and lower extremities was good. But this lounge chair would have been better if those vibrating motors were on a moving (sliding, squeezing) carriage or something similar. I am considering about returning it and get a Shiatsu massager instead.I gave it 3 stars because of the price and portability.
