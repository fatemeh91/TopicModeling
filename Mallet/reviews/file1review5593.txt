review/text: Great job in getting the food out of your teeth. Recommended to use as a back up to your regular flossing (though I am no dentist to advise of this) we use this regularly especially after those sumptuous steak meals. Does what is ti supposed to do.TIP: I also use these as micro brush cleaners for model trains as they do a great job to clean micro debris from your motors or wheel sets.Wish they came MINT flavored!
