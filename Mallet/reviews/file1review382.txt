review/text: I decided to update my collection and went with this on a whim, and I'm SO glad I did! It is not too hard or too soft and the bunny ears are not hard at all, it's very soft all over. This one is a bit girthy and took some getting used to but other than that, if I could give it 10 stars I would. I've only used it once and I can say with confidence that nothing compares and if and when this one should die on me I will be ordering another promptly. You don't need a man, honey, you just need batteries! I'll keep my other toys as a back-up but I can say for sure they will be collecting dust now.
