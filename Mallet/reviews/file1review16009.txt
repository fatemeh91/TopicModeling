review/text: I've been shaving my head "traditionally" for years, stumbled across this product on the internet and decided to give it try. Yes it does provide a less irritating shave, but i could do a better job with a boxcutter. Shaved exactly as the directions state and still had to go over many areas two to three times and still didnt get a close shave. In my opinion it's not worth the price. Go buy a good 4 or 5 blade razor instead.
