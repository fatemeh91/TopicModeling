review/text: I bought this for my toddler to use on his pillow in case there were night time accidents. The material made a lot of noise which he didn't like. Also, it made him get really hot/sweaty. It does not zip closed, it overlaps but this does not work very well. The pillowcase ends up to be only MOSTLY waterproof. I bought a zip close terrycloth cover to replace it and I'm very happy with that.
