review/text: Renew Life's FiberSmart is a great alternative and/or addition to psyllium fiber products. My family swears by this stuff. Four capsules 1-3 times per day taken with plenty of water gives you superior fiber sources (flax seed, borage seed, fennel seed, etc.) as well as a helpful probiotic combination to nurture/protect your &quot;good bacteria&quot; intestinal ecosystem. Worth the price...it's a staple in my household.
