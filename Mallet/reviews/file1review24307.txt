review/text: I like these and they work for me. You have to make sure your sock doesn't ball up as you put your shoe on (especially with boots) and they can initially feel like you have a big rock in your shoe but you have to use them a bit and you forget they are there. The advantage for me is that I have flat feet and sometimes I can roll my ankle to the inside. Because of the way these fit they pretty much prevent this from happening when I'm hiking downhill over steep terrain. I use them in normal work shoes too and they seem to help my feet and add support. I would buy them again. The first pair cracked in the heel area after a lot of use.
