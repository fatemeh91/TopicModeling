review/text: Someone at work told me about the Tide Pen. I was skeptical but I bought one anyway. Now I always carry one in my purse. I've given them to family members as stocking stuffers at Christmas and they think they're great too. I read a bad report about them in a popular "Consumer" testing magazine. I don't know what kind of stains they tested them on but their tester didn't know what they were talking about! I've used mine on blood, coffee, mustard and a myriad of other spills and it hasn't failed me yet.
