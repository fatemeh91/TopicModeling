review/text: Not only are Oral-B Humming Bird Dental Picks the choice of dentists from Albert Lea, Minnesota, to Zongo, Zaire, but once used upon your remaining teeth they become the perfect implement for cleaning the scuzz out of your bassoon reeds and cornetto mouthpiece. I'm reasonably sure that anyone can master their primary use in a few easy practices. In fact, I'd guess that if a pack were left open on the outskirts of Zongo, the first chimpanzee that happened upon them would perceive their utility for picking bush-baby hairs out of his/her teeth.
