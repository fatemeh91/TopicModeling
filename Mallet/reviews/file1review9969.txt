review/text: I was looking forward to getting this, but am not really impressed by it. It comes with a caliper, myotape, and some instructions. The best part of this package is the myotape. This works like a retractable ruler. It allows you to wrap the tape around any body part, lock the end back on the unit, and push a button to release any slack. You can easily slide it too to make sure you measure the thickest part of the place you are measuring. What you get is a really accurate measurement. No more measuring with that old school tape measure.The caliper did not impress me. It feels cheap and clumsy. You have to force the arm by squeezing it to make measurements. Because you are squeezing it, you end up squeezing too little or too much. To capture a measurement, you need to press the button on the arm, which was awkward for me. The device allows you to keep measurements for 3 users. The unit itself calculates a body fat percentage by taking 3 measurements: the chest, abdomen, and thighs. For the price the unit is okay, but you want to spend a few more bucks for a better unit.
