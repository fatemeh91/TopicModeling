review/text: I have dry eyes to the point that sometimes I need to wear two pairs of dark lenses, and my prescription fluctuates from minute to minute. That stopped after starting with Theratears (optometrist suggested). I still need to wear dark glass (one pair) outside often, but the vision has settled down and it's never so bad that I have to stay indoors in the dark. Phew.
