review/text: I have been using Green Vibrance for five weeks now and I can say that I don't feel more energetic or healthier. In fact, the use of this product has actually interferred with my past complete vitamin program.In my opinion, Green Vibrance is an incomplete product. For example, the only "B" vitamin included is B12 and only at 44% daily value. What happened to the other "B" vitamins. One deletion that affects us all, especially men, is the exclusion of zinc. The calcium and magnesium amounts are severly lower than optimum values and not in the accepted ratios of 2 to 1. The manufacturer also omitted amino acids.The real problem lies in the fact that the product does contain threshold amounts of Vitamin A and 2.5 times the threshold of Vitamin D. This prevents someone from supplementing with a multi-vitamin because that would put A and D over the recommended dosages. The only way I see to have a balanced vitamin and mineral regimen while taking this product is to purchase individual Calcium and Magnesium, Zinc, and B complex vitamins. Does one really need or want 25 billion probiotics daily? I'm not so sure I want that everyday. You can make up your own mind.For the price that this lists for (and thank heaven for Amazon's pricing) this should be a complete supplement,(of course with the exception of omega 3 fish oil).To be honest, I'm a little suspect of all the positive reviews.
