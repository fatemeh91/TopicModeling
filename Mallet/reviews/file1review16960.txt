review/text: This is a great and affordable trimmer. I've been using it for a almost two months now, and I'm liking it a lot. No need to hassle with individual attachable guide combs to choose the length of hair you want to cut. This trimmer an adjustable guide comb operated with a switch. And battery life is excellent. For the two months which I have been using it, I've only had to recharge only twice (I use it twice a week to do a quick touch-up on my facial hair and sideburns). Overall, I would recommend this to any of my friends or family members.
