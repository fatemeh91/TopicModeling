review/text: This is a great product. Having bone cancer it makes it almost impossible to bend over to put on my socks. This product not only saves time getting on my socks it saves me the pain and aggrevation of bending over trying to put socks on my feet. What use to take me 5 to 10 minutes of pain and agony now takes me just a minute or two with no pain and aggrevation. Just slide the sock on the unit, then on to your foot and you are good to go. A very useful item! I would reccommend this to anyone who has problems putting on their socks.
