review/text: Finally I have found something that has been a issue for me for many years now. Heathers tummy fiber has helped me feel normal again. I have struggled with constipation, gas, and bloating!! I have tried so many different products of fiber which either made me more bloated or have much more gas. I absolutely love that it dissolves and has no flavor. I would say I am healthy person for the most part. I am 37 I eat healthy (not much processed food) and practically live in the gym. I also drink a gallon of water every day. I do everything I am suppose to. I cant tell you how awful I felt doing everything right and still could not understand why my stomach looked as if I was 6 months pregnant everyday.I started taking heathers tummy fiber along with the peppermint oils capsules about 2 weeks ago. I have 1 or 2 BM's a day and my bloating has dramatically changed!! This stuff works!! I strongly recommend these products! I will never go without!
