review/text: I've tried a lot of protein shakes and this one just tops them all. The taste is excellent! So far i've tried vanilla ice cream and cookies 'n cream and they're both excellent, not too strong of flavor like most shakes. Which is a plus & it doesn't make your shake all thick and hard to take down. My friends also say chocolate mint is a good flavor too. This is an excellent post workout protein, since it absorbs a lot quicker than other shakes out there, ie. Muscle Milk. Muscle milk is a great product also, I use to take it before bed..since it slowly gets absorb so it'll last through the night. I'm sold this will be the only whey protein I will ever buy!
