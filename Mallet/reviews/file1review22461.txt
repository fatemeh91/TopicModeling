review/text: I have an autoimmune disease, Systemic Lupus. People come out of the woodwork with all their miracles cures. I have had this awful disease for 22 years and have spent many long days in the hospital. I happened upon these vitamins along with a powdered drink that I mix with orange juice. Within a week, I actually began to feel stronger. Just being able to get out of bed a couple days a week was a huge improvement. I have problems eating food but tolerate those products quite well. I was at the point of completely giving up. I know it sounds melodramatic but these supplements (my major food source) helped me little by little to improve. Sometimes I have to sort of choke down drink but I just thnk,this is like medicine, if I want to have any good days I have to get this down. If this can help someone who has almost lived on chemotherapy then it must do truly amazing things for those in better health. Give it a try...it just may be the thing that helps provide you with a better quality of life. Good luck and may this product bless you as it did me.
