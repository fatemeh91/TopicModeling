review/text: I've been using eye drops for years due to my serious dry-eye condition. I had been using the best eye drops that HAVE a preservative, making it easy for me to carry them around. Then, one day, my eyes starting getting an allergic reaction. After spending weeks trying different solutions, e.g., eye-lid scrub, hot compresses, night gels, etc., I happened to read on some website that constant use of eye drops with preservatives can result in this allergic reaction.I stopped using eye drops with preservatives and, presto, my eyes got better - still dry eyes, but no allergic reaction. At home I use Refresh preservative-free eye drops, but now I can carry these eye drops - GenTeal tube - wherever I go. They seem to work as well as the other Refresh products I'm now using. This is good!
