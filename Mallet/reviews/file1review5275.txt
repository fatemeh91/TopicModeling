review/text: I bought these because the Altoid Ginger mints are no longer availabe in stores and you need to spend $20.00 or so and get boxes of them at Amazon. Unfortunately, these ginger candies did not do the trick for my nausea. They don't even taste gingery. They do have a pleasant enough taste though.
