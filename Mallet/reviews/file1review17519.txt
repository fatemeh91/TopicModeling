review/text: Remington has cut too many corners manufacturing this low lifespan trimmer.The NiCad battery as you will see in many of the other reviews is very low quality and guaranteed not to last as long as one would expect.I got less than 6 months of use out of this trimmer and would not advise others to purchase one unless you need another plastic paperweight when it dies.
