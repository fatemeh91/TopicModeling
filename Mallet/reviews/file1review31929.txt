review/text: From all the reviews on this product, I don't have to tell you that this is a great quality product. The downside is definitely the taste. I have just started drinking it. My plan is to drink a half a scoop three times a day. I'm trying to recover to optimal health. Anyway, my advice to get this drink down without gagging is to mix it in 4-8 oz of water and add the juice of half of a lemon (a quarter is not enough). Chug it all in one take. The lemon is so strong that it does a pretty good job of covering up at least some of the taste. Unfortunately it's still tough to get down. The second part of my advice is the use a wide straw placed towards the back of your throat. I've used this trick to get through the nasty concoctions you have to drink for a liver flush. You still get hit with some of the nastiness, but it's WAY better than drinking it without a straw. Hope this helps.
