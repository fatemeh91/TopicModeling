review/text: I love these veggie caps and use them to add l-lysine powder to my cat's dry food. Cats need lysine to control runny eyes and boost their immune system from herpes virus. Solgar brand is the best and cheaper than cat-specific Elysel brand.Best dose is 250mg up to 1,000 mg daily. 250 is the maintenance dose and 1,000 is for flare ups. I add 1 veggie cap to 1/2 cup dry anytime I put out their dry food dish. It works extremely well.
