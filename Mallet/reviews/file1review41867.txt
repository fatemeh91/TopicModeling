review/text: I received the Oral B toothbrush about a month ago, and it is definitely the best $80 I have ever spent! My teeth look whiter, and even my dentist complimented me. My teeth also feel clean, and are less sensitive now because the toothbrush does not allow the user to brush too hard- it applies the correct pressure and cleans teeth incredibly well. It also has a two-minute warning to let you know when you have been brushing for the recommended 2 minutes, so you never have to guess whether or not you have brushed long enough.
