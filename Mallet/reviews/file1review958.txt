review/text: I bought these in place of the name brand Phazyme, which is what I normally purchase. While these pills do work well if you have indigestion gas or minor gastric episodes, you will wait for relief a bit longer than you would with the name brand Phazyme pills.But these are still a good purchase esp. on your wallet if you don't suffer from severe gastritis.
