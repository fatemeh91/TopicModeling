review/text: A few years ago when I discovered this product, I was only getting the occasional ingrown hair. My esthetician recommended this product, and it lived up to her description. During my last pregnancy, my skin changed. I started getting ingrown hairs more often on my bikini line. I thought I would try this product again, not having used it for a few years. The name changed a bit, but it was in the same jar, so I assumed all that changed was the company. I have been using the new In-grow Gold for almost two months now, and I have not seen any improvement. It used to only take a couple of days to clear any bumps, but now it does not seem to do anything, or if it does, it is slow. I will be trying something new once this jar runs out.
