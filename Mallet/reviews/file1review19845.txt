review/text: Pros:-My 3 year old is very comfortable with this seat. Another kind he had before would flip and move on the toilet all the time and cleaning was not easy.- With this one, it is easy to clean.-It is also easy to adjust to the toilet, it fits securely, and you can easily remove it from the toilet and put it back on.Cons:-After using this toilet seat for a few weeks, there is one con that bothers me (however, I still prefer it to the old seat very much). The pee guard is not vertically long enough in the down-ward direction. My son sits when he pees and even though he is very good at directing his pee downward, the pee hits the bottom of the guard and splashes under the potty seat onto the toilet seat. I find myself cleaning the toilet seat almost every time after potty time :) I have searched a lot and even with this mis-design, this seat seems to be one of the best out there.
