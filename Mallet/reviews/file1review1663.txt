review/text: Purchased at local store and was doubting the lotion working but loved the smell right away. Took home applied to feet thinking I would be slipping and sliding on my wood floors but after a minute it had absorbed completly into my skin and my feet feel supple and non-sticky. Smooth and Soft. I now use head to toe and love the way it makes my dry summer skin feel soft and smooth. Love the smell but it is not to over powering like some bath and body lotions or body butters. Will definatly purchase again.
