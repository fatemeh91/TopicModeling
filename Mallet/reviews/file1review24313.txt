review/text: These inserts work better for me than the custom inserts I had made. I have severely flat feet from years of doing courier work, on my feet for 10-14 hours a day. These inserts put my feet, ankles, and knees back inline. They also help with lower back pain. The only complaint I have is because they are so ridged, they tend to cause heal pain by the end of the day. For me it's worth that discomfort for the other benefits. If you're not use to wearing ridged inserts. They will take some time to break in and get use to. I owned a pair of these year's ago and couldn't wear them because they were very painful. Now that I am 40 years old and my feet are worse than they were then. These are the best solution for me.
