review/text: So, the current style on men is having some stubble on your face but still groomed. Meaning shave your neck line and above the cheeks so you still look clean cut. Anyways, I wanted a trimmer that would give me that "in" look of having stubble, but still be office appropriate. Well, this thing does the job splendidly! I use number 3 on my sideburn area and then #2 everywhere else for a quick, precise, and stylish trim. Love this thing, perfect for that modern look of stubble yet groomed.Pros-really inexpensive-trims evenly and with precision-never any pain or pulling-easy to clean-holds it charge for a long timeCons-should of bought one years ago;-)
