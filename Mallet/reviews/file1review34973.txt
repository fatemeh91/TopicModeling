review/text: I love this product! It works, and the German Chocolate is so yummy - in fact, this flavor doesn't even resemble the taste of the regular flavored product at all (thankfully!). I highly recommend this product. It's great for those times when your stomach is just not digesting your food properly and you have a belly ache that just won't go away. As a side note, DGL is highly recommended and effective for people with ulcers (peptic/gastric/duodenal)caused by the H.pylori bacteria. DGL is composed of several flavonoids which have been shown to inhibit H.pylori. DGL is extremely safe and is less expensive than the standard treatments. Research it on the internet!
