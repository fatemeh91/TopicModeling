review/text: I absolutely love this mask and cannot stop talking about how much I love this mask.Do you ever have one of those days where your eyelids hurt? You know, where you come home from work and all you want to do is pass out in your clothes but you have kids or a dog and you can feel the headache coming on and your eye make up has pretty much all worn off and someone tells you that you "look tired"?Yeah, me too.I have been looking for a product like this for forever. As a kid my mother had one of those gel eye masks that froze and became a rock solid and she'd sit in front of the TV with it on looking like an alien. I bought one of those recently - turns out they're super uncomfortable.This mask is perfect. It's super soft and lays comfortably across your eyes. Plus, it's not water based so there's no condensation or leaks. I often times fall asleep with it on! For some reason, my eyes just HURT all the time. I don't know why. But if I can lean back with this on my face and listen to some music, I am transported to heaven and instantly my eyes feel better. It only takes about 5 minutes.I leave it in the freezer during the day and then use it at night. The next morning I put it back in the freezer. I've never waited to see how long it takes to get cold since I leave it in for hours between uses.Sometimes if I'm having bad allergies or am just tired and I need to put on make up, I put this on my eyes first for a few minutes and it completely eradicates the puffiness and redness. It just makes your whole face cool off.I have never tried this hot, but it is incredible cold. I'm sure it would be perfect if you had a fever. It cures a headache!The only con is that you (obviously) can't see while you have it on, so no watching TV or reading.If you are deciding between this mask and some cheaper gel one that freezes solid, put your money into quality and get this mask!!
