review/text: I bought this at a health food store to try. We live in the country and have septic. So we want what goes into our ground to be safe for us. This doesn't have any of the harmful chemicals that are on the lists. So, is it effective? Most definitely. I was using Cascade which is a good product for the most part(except for the gray film on all the glasses, yuck). Wave leaves my dishes clean and my glasses clear. Just what I wanted. It was very reasonably priced as well.Maybe the reviewer who said that you shouldn't use too much has something. I usually fill the cup only half full and that does a great job. Maybe I will try even less and see how that works. One more thing to make it more economical.
