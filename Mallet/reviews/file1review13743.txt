review/text: I was very excited to use this product. Even before opening the box, you could smell the aromatherapy/herbal scent. It works fairly well if you are lying down flat when using it and you have someone else lay it on your back. Since the "pocket" areas are not sewn completely, the beads inside shift around. It makes it very difficult to use in any position other than flat on your stomach. It also does not stay warm as long as other similar products I have used. I would probably still recommend it, but with the warning that you need to have patience to shift the beads around from the outside and bottom area before every use and if you move at all while using this product.
