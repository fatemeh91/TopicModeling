review/text: Originally I had purchased this product, just the bubble bath though, for alot more! I thought it would make my daughter's bedtime routine alot easier- and it did! But to my suprise the overtired and cranky products take away my headaches!!! I recommend all of the California Baby products, espically anything overtired and cranky. Also, not pictured, this comes in a gift bag with a rubber duck. This is a super bargain price!
