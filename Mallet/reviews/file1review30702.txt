review/text: First things first, this is really the Merkur 34C also known as the Merkur HD (Heavy Duty). The 178 is just a number that the distributor gave it.As they say, "Good things come in small packages". It's small safety razor (roughly 3" tall), with excellent weight and balance. It's a three piece, and you must unscrew it to replace blades. It was recommended to me as a not very aggressive safety razor that you'll be able to learn how to wet shave with much easier. Overall a very popular safety razor that does what it's suppose to do perfectly.
