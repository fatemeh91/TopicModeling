review/text: I am a terrible dieter. I love my sweets. Especially chocolate. This is really the only diet plan that works for me because the Chocolate Royale is delicious and chocolate and when mixed with skim or soy milk and ice it's like having a chocolate shake. It controls my hunger so I don't snack between meals and satisfies my chocolate cravings.
