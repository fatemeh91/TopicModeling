review/text: Bought 8 of these Duracell 2650 mAh rechargeables right before my 2-week archaeological expedition to a remote desert in Peru, because they were supposed to last so long in my digital camera. Wow, did it *suck* that not a one of them held their charge! These batteries are worse than useless - they almost caused me to miss my photo-ops for this whole trip!Good thing I'd also brought along a pack of Energizer Lithium batteries, because they seriously kicked *ss, and even lasted much longer than I'd expected (way over 600 pictures per set)!Never trusting Duracells again!(wish I could give zero- or negative-stars in the rating!)
