review/text: My wife & I have been trying to get pregnant for over 1 year. My wife had irregular periods her whole life. It seemed to be due to a hormonal imbalance that also interferred with her fertility. We tried this product before we decided to spend major money with fertility doctors. The first bottle she took her period came at what would be normal to most people instead of random 35-50 days after her previous. She was almost through the 3rd bottle and she became pregnant. We tried this being extremely skeptical that it would work as most herbal supplements are bogus. I would give this stuff a try for at least 4 months before you give up on it. It sure is cheap enough to give it a try for few months compared to visits to a fertility doctor.
