review/text: Took this to India, never got sick. Took 2 a day. It's actually hard to find probiotics that don't need to be refrigerated. At home mine are refrigerated. 1 billion is not a lot, so when you are home take a higher dose, maybe 5 billion or more per day to get really healthy digestion. I'm buying another bottle now to take with me for a month long trip to rural China. Thanks now.
