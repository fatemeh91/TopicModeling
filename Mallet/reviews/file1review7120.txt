review/text: I purchased this shaver 6 weeks ago after being very happy with a Wahl 4400 which I retired after inexpensively rebuilding it myself several times over 6 years. The new shaver arrived quickly direct from Amazon and the price was right at $40.88 including shipping and instant promo discount. (It also included a bonus personal nose/ear trimmer of which I have a drawer full of and none work very well). The shave is great and powerful enough for a week's shaves on a single charge, but be aware that the powerful Wahl's are louder than other brands. Unfortunatly, the pop up trimmer snagged and pulled my sideburns and neck hair, so I returned it to Wahl for repair per their advice. I received it back 3 weeks later along with a spare foil I had requested (although not the exact one I requested) to offset my $10 return shipping cost. Sadly, the pop up trimmer still snags hair, therefore I can only recommend the shaver if the trimmer is not important to you.
