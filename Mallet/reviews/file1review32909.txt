review/text: I originally purchased only one box of this tea in the chocolate to see how it worked. If I was not pleased, I did not want to be stuck with 6 boxes. I was so surprised, it works very well without side effects. I'm a 51 year old female near menopause with a very erratic digestive system, despite lots of fiber and good diet. I have been using this tea for almost two weeks now and my body is very fine tuned now each morning. I have this tea each night about and hour before bed. Even if I am out in the evening and have it later, it still works. Im so pleased, I did order the regular herbal flavor for six boxes. The herbal has a much better taste than the chocolate. Also, if you buy in bulk, it comes out to around $3 a box. I first read about this tea in a raw food cookbook. I personally do not have any side affects. I was off one morning, so I had the tea in the afternoon as well as evening. It is caffeine free, but does not make you tired, so ok to drink during the day. I will continue to order this product.
