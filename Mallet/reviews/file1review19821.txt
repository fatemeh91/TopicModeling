review/text: I have personally bought and tried several potty seats, and this is the best out there for an 18 month old boy +. It has a nice subtle design, strong and clamps onto the toilet so that it doesn't move all over when the kid climbs onto the potty alone. The rise to catch urine for a boy is contoured and not scary to them unlike other seats that have a cup attachment that clips on. I have recommended this to many people and continue to do so. We are still using it and it has been 8 months!
