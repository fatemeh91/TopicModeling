review/text: I ordered one of these mirrors for my mom and one for me. After much prodding, she admitted that she couldn't see with the mirror, the lights didn't shine on the viewing area. The next time I visited, I checked the mirror and sure enough, the lights were dim. I ordered another one for her and tried to return the first. The price had gone up $5 and there is a return fee. I just ordered another one, it didn't work either. Out of three mirrors, one worked sporadically. I boxed up the other two and sent them back with a letter. I was never reimbursed, didn't get the mirrors back and didn't hear from the company.Crappy mirrors, crappy service.
