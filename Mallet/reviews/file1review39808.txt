review/text: I bought one of these a year ago, liked it and bought a second six months ago. I'm confined to a wheelchair so I use both of mine nearly every day. I had a problem with one when the screws in the suction cups stripped out. So I took a dab of epoxy and replaced them. I've been using it ever since with no problems.I'm very happy with these. I don't believe they'll pick up five pounds, however. I read a lot, two or three books a week, and they will grab a book off a shelf or a jar quite nicely. They are very handy for anyone in need of a little assistance.I plan to buy a couple more so I always have one nearby wherever I am in the house.
