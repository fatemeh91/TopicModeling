review/text: I had really good results with this product. In the 3 week supply, I went from 192lbs to 183lbs which is usually difficult for me to do since I'm relatively thin built. To be sure it was the product, I kept a pretty strict workout routine and diet a month prior to using it. I continued this same routine when I started the product and lost 9lbs. I continued to gain strength and didn't lose any of it during the 3 weeks. I didn't experience any bad side effects. At times, I could feel the thermogenic working as I felt like I was hot sometimes and I was using it during October where the weather was cool. I found myself going to the bathroom a lot. Both of these were expected since it's considered a thermogenic and a diuretic. It's a little tough to take 18 pills a day, but worth it if you're looking to shed some weight in a short period of time. The flip side to the results I received is that my wife didn't experience the same gains. Instead, she experienced better results with Oxyelite Pro. So, I guess you have to try different things to see which works best for your body.My workouts included 3 days of circuit training and 3 days of weightlifting with 20 minutes of cardio afterwards. One day off.
