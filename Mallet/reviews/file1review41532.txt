review/text: The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9000 performs worse than less expensive Oral-B models. It claims to prevent you from brushing too hard...it doesn't. Brush harder and it continues to run as it normally would. Also, compared to the Oral-B 3d Excel (which is replaced by the Model 1000 so I've read), the 9000 is heavier due to the display and larger battery, and it vibrates slower for a less vigorous cleaning. I much prefer the 3d Excel because it performs and cleans better.You may not want or need all the extra features in the 9000. The large button is the power on/off button, and the small triangular button changes the cleaning mode from Clean(Normal) to Soft to Massage to Sensitive and back. While you're cleaning, the brush does a noticeable jiggle in your hand every 30 seconds and then does a long triple jiggle at the 2 minute mark to indicate that you have reached the recommended amount of cleaning. If you can remember all that or don't need 4 different cleaning modes, then you may want to opt for a lighter, better, less expensive Oral-B model without the display and with fewer cleaning modes.
