review/text: As a young woman, I've taken this for the past several months for two reasons. First, I was having IBS-type digestive symptoms. I really felt like Benefiber had given me a lot of relief along with taking probiotics.Then, I got pregnant and took a break from all kinds of supplements until I could check with my doctor. I began to have daily uncomfortable bloating to the point that I didn't fit in most of my clothes. (Maybe from pregnancy, or maybe that's just how I am without Benefiber!) Once I got the go-ahead from my doctor to be back on the Benefiber, I take two doses daily and I've been comfortable and back in regular clothes for a few more weeks before the baby causes actual growth.What I like, besides that it works: I find that it's not noticeable stirred into most things, though I don't like it in plain water. It takes some stirring in cold things, but will dissolve. There's no sugar or artificial sweeteners. Because it's soluble fiber, it helps even things out whether your system is too slow OR too fast. Soluble fiber is also the kind that's great for lowering cholesterol. Plus, I've found that it relieves rather than causing extra gas.
