review/text: These are a fine addition for quick easy fiber. However, two tablets provide 4 grams of fiber. Since it is recommended to eat 25-35 grams of fiber a day, I take a large glass of water with four spoons of Metamucil (powder) to provide the "bulk" of my daily dose. The Fiber Choice comes in handy when I go on vacation or any place else that lugging a large bottle of Metamucil is not an option. They also do taste very much like candy (sweet tarts).
