review/text: I was using Rainbow Light before getting pregnant and it was an easy decision to use it for my prenatal needs. Vitamins that are food based work better for me. My body absorbs them better and best of all I don't get sick after taking them. I typically get nauseous with chemical based vitamins. I like the fact that I only have to take it once a day and the only reason I don't give 5 stars is because of the smell, which I have gotten use to but might be a problem for some people.
