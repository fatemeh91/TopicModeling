review/text: I toasted them lightly in the frying pan as research on the internet suggested - There are many forums on this topic that state that seeds need to be lightly toasted to get rid of their bitter taste and must never be consumed raw or on their own to prevent upset stomach.They don't taste good to me and there is a lack of recipes in ways to use it that don't involve sprinkling them on home made bread after baking.I am at a loss on how to use these seeds properly and toasting them and mixing with honey on a daily basis is not very appealing.The touted health benefits of this seed are all over the internet, but unless you have a favorite recipe that allows you to consume them daily as part of your daily intake, I have no idea how best to use them.The warnings for both the seeds and the oil is to avoid when pregnant. Not to be used by people with low blood pressure because it lowers blood pressure even further.I'll post more if I find a much better way of consuming these seeds. Also, for those trying it for the 1st time, when they say 'toast lightly' they mean it. The seeds must be toasted on very low heat and constantly moved around, they burn very quickly and must be thrown away.Best wishes.
