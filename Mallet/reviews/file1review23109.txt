review/text: I bought this to sweep quickly in the few areas where we still have rugs or carpet. It's very good for the sunroom (playroom when the grandkids come by), for the wool area rugs (my upright vacuum is too hard on them) and for the rug by the kitchen sink that clings to its dirt when shaken and is almost digested by the upright. Perfect for a quick cleanup, even on the hardwood at times. It won't do the job a vacuum would, but it's useful between big cleans.The added point of interest:My grandson LOVES to use my sweeper (He is 2 years old) He has a grand time cleaning the rugs when he visits. Since the top third of the handle does not stay on well, I just use it with 2/3 handle--perfect for him, and stores nicely. My son joked that I ought to get grandson a sweeper for Xmas. So I have just ordered 3 more sweepers for presents---one for each of my children. They all have 1 or 2 year olds, and if it's not a hit as a toy, it is a very practical household item. More useful then most toys we buy for them!Bissell Swift Sweep Sweeper, 2201-2
