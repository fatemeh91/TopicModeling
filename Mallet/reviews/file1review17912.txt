review/text: I've been breathing through my mouth for as long as I could recall due to a deviated septum which totally sealed shut my left nostril. No air could pass through my left nostril (if you shine a torch light into my left nostril, there is absolutely no empty space there for air to pass through). The downside of breathing through my mouth is that I constantly end up with dry/sore throat that can really hurt for days.My mum obtained some sample strips of Breathe right for me to try and although I was skeptical at first, I quickly changed my mind after applying it. The strip seems to work by lifting the top wall of the nose to create a larger nasal passage and this gave me back half of my left nostril instantly which without it would have been totally blocked by cartilage. I'm now able to rely on my nose for breathing again despite the semi blockage that still exists in my left nostril.On the whole, I'm very satisfied by it. I'll continue to rely on it until I get a nose surgery. My only complaint is that the strip doesn't blend well with my skin color making it somewhat obvious on my nose.
