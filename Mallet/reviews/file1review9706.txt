review/text: Lets make this simple. I smoked a pack a day for 10 years. I tried Patches, Gum, E-Cigs, and Candy. The reason those things dont work is becuase you maintain a nicotine addiction and well as a ritual attachment.With Smoke away I was able to lose all cravings within day 5. YES it was the easiest way I have ever attempted.The first few days are hard but after a week you can feel damn good about yourself.
