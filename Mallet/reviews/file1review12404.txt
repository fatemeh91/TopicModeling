review/text: Instead of being slippery beyond belief or great feeling to use, this product is rather mediocre. Yes, they did a decent job making a water based lubricant, but it does dry out somewhat quickly which means applying more and more until it becomes too much and not worth the effort.If you're looking for a great moisturizer for ole willy, then you've found a good one. But, in my opinion, it's so-so for solo action (which is its main function I guess), but NOT recommended for his & her action.
