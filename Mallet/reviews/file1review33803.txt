review/text: Used once, and decided to return it.Pros: this is a nicely designed piece in a nice storage box. Engine seems reasonably strong and battery life is long. But...Cons: (1) I used the shortest comb and did my whole head for several minutes. After nothing further came off, I looked at the mirror and discovered that the result was horribly uneven and cluttered. Only after shifting to the next shortest comb and spending extra 10 minutes on fixing the result it ended up okay. (2) In the process, I also took off the comb for fine trimming, but I could barely touch my skin without getting burned: after 20 minutes of work, the blade was insanely hot! Finally, (3) the machine is very noisy compared to others I've used before.I went back to use my old Panasonic, but this one is really decaying and mostly unusable at this point. Need to find another one soon...
