review/text: I like the relatively low-carbohydrate profile of this powder compared to some others. I also like that, according to Consumer Reports, it contains lower levels of heavy metals than comparable whey powders.However, it has an annoyingly artificial taste, probably due to the artificial sweeteners and possibly partly due to the artificial vanilla flavor.I thought about switching to Optimum Nutrition's "Natural" whey powder, which doesn't use artificial sweeteners, but I didn't like that the Natural version contains more carbohydrate (and sugar) per serving than this one.The best alternative I've found is Whole Foods' store-brand whey protein powder. Like the Optimum Nutrition powder, it's relatively low-carb, but it achieves this by using stevia extract as a (zero-calorie, natural) sweetener as opposed to Optimum Nutrition's sucralose and acesulfame K. Due to that and, I suppose, its use of natural vanilla flavor, the Whole Foods whey powder doesn't have the artificial taste that the Optimum Nutrition powder has.
