review/text: It's no secret razor blade cartridges are outrageously expensive. That's why the handle itself with 1 cartridge is always cheap--where they get you is on the replacement cartridges. I bought the batch of 12, it came exactly as advertised. Not sure why some people had bad experiences and gave 1 star ratings; the ones I got are definitely legitimate. Comes in a little white box with the Gillette logos all over. 3 sets of 4 cartridges. Much more cost efficient than buying a pack of 4 or 8 retail.
