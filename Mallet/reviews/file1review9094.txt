review/text: I am 61 years old and have been taking green super-foods for over 20 years. I started out with a product called Exsula Iridesca (excellent but expensive). I have tried numerous others (the 2nd best for me was Boku Super-food) that were good as well. Green Vibrance has been overall the best for me. Green super-foods have detoxed my liver and has given me the nutrition my body needs and filled the nutritional voids from eating even a healthy diet.If you are not used to green super-foods the taste may seem terrible at best. I suggest mixing it in cranberry or other strong juice to start. If you are into green smoothies as I am you can put it into the green smoothie (or other smoothie). It will however change the taste, but the nutrition you get from this supplement will be worth it.The price Amazon has for this product (go for the autoship-you can change your mind later)is an excellent price.
