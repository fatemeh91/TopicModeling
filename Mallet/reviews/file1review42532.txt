review/text: I enjoyed the Cafe Mocha Version of this product it dissolved quickly when added to milk or water. The nutrient facts were as stated. I find the product helps after my workouts so that I am not so sore the next day and can still move, and don't end up feeling like an old geezer the next day.Dymatize Nutrition Elite Whey Protein Isolate Powder, Cafe Mocha, 2.03-Pound Tub
