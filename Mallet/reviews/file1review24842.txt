review/text: I've been taking FertilAid for 2 cycles since a miscarriage in March and after being on the pill for more than 7 years. My cycles, which were all over the place since going off the pill in October '06, have really "normalized" and settled into a nicely predictable 28 day pattern, which I'm sure will help when we're ready to try again.I didn't take FertilAid 3 times a day [I also didn't read the directions, though], I took 3 tablets in the morning, all at once, and I've only been taking them up until ovulation.
