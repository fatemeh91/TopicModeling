review/text: I started using these 3 weeks ago - on three small keloid scars. Not sure if they're working or not, but I've lost half the box on having them roll off. I agree - you can end up spending a LOT on medical tape and make things look much worse then they are. Today I tried a little superglue along the edges and will see. I wrote to Pfizer...will see and will return with more results. Pfizer replied promptly with full refund - sure have to admire that!
