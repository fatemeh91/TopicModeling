review/text: There were very few seats I could find specifically for the car this season so I was very excited to find this one. There are two problems as far as I am concerned:1. The seat has a molded pillow at the lumbar and the neck... Whose lumbar and neck? It is not adjustable so tall people end up with pillows in less than optimal positions.2. The seat heats... but only the lower back... not the butt like any good car seat should in a car in the snowbelt.Last Target Online - their shipping policies are highway robbery. Amazon makes the statement that shipping policies of 3rd party vendors are according to that vendor. I paid ALOT of extra money for one day shipping on this purchase. ALOT. But instead it took 5 days - which I watched every step of the way on the package tracking. According to the web site this was ok because the estimated ARRIVAL date at my house that they gave when I ordered was still met. And so someone pocketed all that extra $$ and shipped it the cheapest way. It really really steams me up even now. I have heard other complaints about Targets shipping policies from other people too and would never have anything shipped from them again.
