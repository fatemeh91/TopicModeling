review/text: I wanted this Zippo for its color and matte finish. I was not dissapointed. The color and the matte finish are like a Miami sunset. For the price and its beauty, buy it. You will be glad you did. My sadness is that I will not use it because I don't have a life. I collect Zippos to fill my day. I'm glad that Amazon didn't wrap tape around the box.
