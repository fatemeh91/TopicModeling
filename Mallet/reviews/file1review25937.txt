review/text: I purchased this 2 weeks ago. It does not work. I put the batteries in the charger. The red "charging" light came on for about 15 minutes, then it went off. The green "fully charged" light never came on. I installed the batteries in my digital camera (my camera takes 2 of the AA). I took 4 pictures and the battery low indicator came on. I tried the batteries in my friend's digital camera (different make and model), same thing, with any/all of the batteries. I tried charging the batteries again, and again. Same thing every time --- charging light comes on for less than 20 minutes, then goes off, and the fully charged light never comes on. The batteries do not get anywhere near a full charge, and the batteries get very, very hot while in the charger. It appears to be of questionable quality. I will be returning it and asking for a refund. I do not recommend the product.
