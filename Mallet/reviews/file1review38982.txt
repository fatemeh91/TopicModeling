review/text: after a 4 day search I was able to call schick @ 1-800-Shavers, THIS ITEM IS NOT DISCOUNTUNUED they still make it but its up to your local store whether or not they want to carry it!!You can buy the razor for $3 and the refills from either:www.nationwidecampus.comwww.hocks.comMost walmarts have the refill cartiges.Call schick and tell them to promote this item again!! It was introduced in 1977 and people are still using it, this is something good!! Revisit this razor you all!!
