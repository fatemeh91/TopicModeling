review/text: Your baby is going to get roughly 1 tooth a month for 18 months, once they start teething. I'd recommend stocking up. My son was making nice progress toward sleeping through the night when he got his first tooth, and next thing we know he's waking up every hour on the hour, and taking forever to go to sleep. No luck with tylenol or orajel (they say that stuff is bad for the baby anyway, it can numb their throat and cause a choking hazard). This is the only thing that seems to help him. I can't say enough about it!
