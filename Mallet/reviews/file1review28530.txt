review/text: Love this protein powder! Has everything I need in the way of protein and health benefits, plus it tastes great! I'm very picky about taste and this is by far the best tasting protein powder that's also actually healthy! I started with Muscle Milk but learned it's really not good for you. $30 is very reasonable. I've only ever been able to find this at the Vitamin Shoppe or on Amazon.com. At the Vitamin Shoppe it's $25, but there isn't one near me, so I order it on here.
