review/text: These little push sweepers have been around for years. Great for general pick up of items, but there are a few small things that are annoying.1 - If you have stray strings in carpet that come off shirts, socks, etc., you might as well forget using this. It will not pick them up. It also does not do the greatest on bare floors.2 - Another big problem we have with this, is that the rubber protector that goes around the outside edge tends to fall off. After the third time it fell off, I just left it off.3 - The number 1 major issue with this, as other people have said before, is that the 2 piece handle does not stay together too well. It will pull apart. I remedied that by wrapping black electrical tape at the connection.Other than these few things, it still does a decent job for a quick clean up in between the times you vaccuum.
