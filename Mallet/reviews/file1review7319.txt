review/text: i bought this as a gift so i have not used it. but im told that it keeps the water hot and at times to hot but i figure that will go away as it breaks in a bit. the jets are very strong in it, its very quiet as well but it is massive witch is nice because it looks like it would work for my size14 feet. i think its defiantly worth the money.
