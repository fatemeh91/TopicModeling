review/text: I have owned this toothbrush for several months and am very happy with the results - especially since my most recent dental cleaning was over in record time, and my dentist said that my teeth and gums looked great.Unlike other reviews, I like the LCD display and the multiple cleaning speeds. I find the timer very helpful - especially when I'm doing other things, like reading the paper, etc. Sometimes I find that I've been brushing for 6+ minutes without realizing it. The timer helps keep track of that so you don't do it too often.Also, my wife uses the lower speed since she finds the higher speed a little too strong for her gums.Overall, I've been very happy with the results and the reduction of tartar. I even take it with me when I'm traveling.
