review/text: I like the cane - only problem is that you sent me four canes and I only ordered one. The one that I liked was the flower print cane (of which you sent me three). However, I decided to keep all of them - one for my sister who is having a hip replacement and one for my other sister who may or may not need one - but it would be a good gag gift.How in the world did you get this order so screwed up? I really didn't like the blossom pink but decided to use it anyway. Plus, it takes time and money to return all three canes!
