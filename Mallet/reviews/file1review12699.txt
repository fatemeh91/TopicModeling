review/text: I've purchased athletic tape in bulk in the past, and have received brands that loose their adhesive, or are too sticky, but J&J is a quality product. It has just the right amount of adhesive without being difficult to work with. I've been taping my own ankle for soccer for years now, and this is a great bargain. I highly recommend this product!
