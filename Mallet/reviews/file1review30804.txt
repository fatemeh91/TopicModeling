review/text: My orthodontist provides only wimpy little between-the-teeth brushes that shred and break after one or two uses. These snap-on tapered brushes are much sturdier, and the angled toothbrush-size handle they snap into is a lot easier to use effectively than those little pocket-size brushes with their tiny handles.
