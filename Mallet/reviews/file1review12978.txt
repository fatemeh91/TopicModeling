review/text: I loved the idea of this product, and it does fit nicely (although it's a little big for my neck, but I'm a small woman) which is the only reason I give it two stars instead of one star. This product simply does not get cold enough, and the little bit of chill it does reach, only lasts for 10 minutes at most. Same goes for the heating. As well, I recently put it in the microwave for 2 minutes to heat it up as directed, and on one of the creases, the gel/plastic somehow started to burn, pop and smoke. We also purchased the wrap around version for your leg, and it used a different type of polyester material (the neck one was cotton) to house the gel pack, and that material is completely snagged from the velcro strap and looks awful after only a few uses. If we could, we'd return them.
