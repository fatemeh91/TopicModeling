review/text: Have a look at the photograph and you will see that the head of brush is about half to three quarters an inch across, with the bristles I would guess you would struggle to fit it into any bottle with a mouth less than 1 inch.It is also very short (shorter than most bottles and flasks).In short it is too wide and too short to use in most glass bottles, thermos flasks, or the Guinea Pig's bottle (which is what I bought it for). It would work for wide mouth baby bottles, wine glasses, and plastic sport bottles, but I have no problem cleaning these without buying a special brush. I don't know what I will do with mine - probably keep in the drawer and throw it out next time we move...
