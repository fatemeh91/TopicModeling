review/text: I love these vitamins. I started taking them about 4 years ago. I had read to start prenantals a year before trying to conceive. Anyway, it took me a long time to get pregnant due to other issues, so I have been taking them for a long time, and plan to continue them forever as I feel so much better with them.After a week or so of taking these vitamins, I started to feel much better than I ever had before. I had not taken a vitamin before and eat junk, so maybe any vitamin would have had the same results, but I used to have a lot of stomach aches and they stopped after using this vitamin.Also, i never had any trouble with them upsetting my stomach.That said, the pills are VERY large. Also they do not taste that good. Neither of these issues both me, but could be a concern for others.Also, I don't think they contain a stool softener. The vitamins themselves never caused constipation for me, but now at 7 months pregnant, I am having some issues from the pregnancy (not the vitamins) and need to take something separate.
