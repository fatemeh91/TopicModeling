review/text: I've been hesitant to write a review for this product as my reviews are published under my real name. While reviewing my purchases, however, I realized this is one of my regular ones and it's a product I really, really love! I'm an adult woman, so why should I feel shy to admit I have sex and use products to make it better?Hallelujah for turning 40 and beginning to realize there is no reason to be embarrassed.I've tried a lot of lube. This is, by far, the best. It doesn't get sticky or dry up too quickly and it actually makes your skin uber soft after use (I'll leave what skin up to your imagination). The only caveat is that because it is silicone based you cannot use it with any items made of silicone. Settle for KY on silicone toys, but go for Pjur Eros for everything else.
