review/text: This supplement really works for me. It increased my stamina as I had read about it in other reputable, medical publications. I'm on it to stay. Also, other benefits of this supplement is that it relaxes your blood vessels and results in decreased blood pressure - my blood pressure is now well within the normal limits - which I believe is partly due to taking this Arginine supplement. I highly recommend this product to adults.
