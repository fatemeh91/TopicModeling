review/text: Works great when I start to get a sore throat or other viral infection. Even my sceptical husband admitted that it helped him, & that's saying a lot! I give it to my kids, too, when they start getting sick. Sure cuts down on school & work days missed! This came recommended by my primary care physician.Another great remedy & immune-system booster you might want to try is Super Lysine +. That my chiropractor recommended.Be well!
