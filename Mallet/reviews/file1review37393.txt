review/text: This is hands down the best beauty purchase I have ever made. If you are used to the pain of waxing, you can get used to this pain. The starter head helped thin out the amount of hair on my legs and got me used to the sensation. Then I moved to the normal head and got used to that with the slow speed and then worked up to normal speed. It hurt like a mofo, but it is absolutely worth it. It's way better than waxing at home b/c you don't end up sticking to everything you touch. I wish I had bought this sooner. Just start out slow and you'll be fine.
