review/text: We used this since my daughter was 2 year old. At that time, she cannot take OTC cold or cough medicine. Whenever she feels to have cold, we give it to her before bed or in the morning, then it seems it boost her immune system, and she feel much better and get over cold like symptom. It does not work every time (of course she caught a cold sometimes even she take this) but overall I think this is good to prevent cold for little kids.
