review/text: I have used four different brands of progesterone cream since my hysterectomy. I would not live without them even though I take estrogen also. I really like this, has a nice scent but want unscented, goes on great! I love how smooth and easy it goes on, I just would prefer unscented. I also think it doesnt do AS MUCH for my sex drive as some others did. The last one, F**G**** is great for that but is like spreading on wax, hate it, very difficult. But love the way it made me feel all around. This is good, just not as good.I am reordering because it is so nice going on and does work well....
