review/text: These things are actually very good. Custom fitting them to your mouth can be a challenge at first (which I think is why they come in a 3 pack). As others have stated, you are best to only dip these for about 2-3 seconds and then fit them. Do this multiple times until you get the fit you want. I got mine to the point where I think they are perfect, but I did ruin one in the process. These are so inexpensive that it would be wise to order extra. The product itself is very good, the challenge is getting them molded without making a mistake. It seems that if this product folds over on itself and cools, you will not get it apart. If you soak these things in boiling water for 5-10 seconds like the directions say, they will be too difficult to handle without folding. I would (and probably will) buy these again.
