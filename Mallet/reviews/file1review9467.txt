review/text: I purchased this shaving cream due to the comments left by others.I am comparing this to "Art of Shaving" Non Scented shaving cream, "Art of Shaving" Sandle Wood disk shaving cream.I use a shaving brush and a Merkur razor with Light Feather Blades.I was very impressed with the lather, thick and moist. In fact very little is needed for "Method" shaving using three applications in one morning shave.Cleans off the brush easy.Moisturizes my face all day and very comfortable.I would definitely compare this to the Art of Shaving creams, in fact I think it is a bit better.
