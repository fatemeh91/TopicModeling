review/text: I've used a number of Universal products in the past and been pretty happy with them, expecially Animal Pump. But Cuts didn't seem to do anything for me other than give me some energy from the caffine. I work out twice a day, cardio @ lunch and weights after work and I didn't see any change while taking these. My advice would be to save your money and spend it on creatine or whey protein.
