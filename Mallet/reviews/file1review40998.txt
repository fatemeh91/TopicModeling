review/text: I like this product, with one exception. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. It doesn't dissolve well in cold water wash (we have soft water). I run warm water, add detergent and swish before adding the clothes. As this is an extra step, I think I prefer the liquid Free Clear product better. It does seem to be Allergen free as I have two folks in my home with sensitive skin and allergies and they have had no detergent reaction to their skin.
