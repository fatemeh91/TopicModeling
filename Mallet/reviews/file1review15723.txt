review/text: The multi-function abilities of this pen is what originally caught my eye in the office supply store.I purchased this on pen Amazon over 2 years ago and still use this pen every day.I use off brand refills as they are cheaper and can be found in colors other than red and black.In terms of the balance and feel of this pen I couldn't ask for a better design.I am knocking off one star because the eraser cap (or just the chrome part) can easily be lost and the pencil mechanism can only hold a few pieces of graphite.
