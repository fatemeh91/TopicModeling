review/text: This stuff is so cool, it actually works! I received it as a gift from a friend... I'm going to Europe where I wasn't sure there would be an iron in the hotel room. I tried it on a pair of 100% linen capris, and it works like a charm. You just smooth the wrinkles with your hands. Smells nice, too, and with the 3 oz size, it should not be a problem (I hope) to take the aerosol on the plane.
