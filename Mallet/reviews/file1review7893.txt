review/text: I'm Italian and I have very coarse and thick hair. When using this product on my legs it would only pull out about 10 hairs and they were randomly placed, so I would have to go over the same place at least 5 times. If you have hair like me this is a complete waste of time and money and if possible I would give it 0 stars.
