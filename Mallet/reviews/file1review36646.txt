review/text: Irish Spring is the BEST deodorant soap I've ever used. I feel fresh and clean all day. I was using another brand, which my husband really liked, and he wouldn't use anything else. After I talked him into trying this one, he made me throw the other brand out and go to the store to buy more Irish Spring. If you are using another brand of soap, I highly recommend you at least try this one. I believe you'll like Irish Spring even more!!
