review/text: I purchased theOXO Good Grips Bottle Brushto clean my Nalgene bottles and Vita Mix blender. The flax meal I use in my smoothies tends to cling to the inside of my containers and blender. A standard bottle brush is just too short. The length of this brush is perfect for this type of task and the bristles are gentle, yet thorough for a quick cleaning. Get it!
