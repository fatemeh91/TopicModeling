review/text: I was nervous to use this peel because I have had professional peels before at the spa and they have irritated my skin and caused breakouts afterward. So it was with trepidation that I used the trial-sized version of this peel yesterday. What a difference! My skin looks fresh for the first time in over a year! My recommendation to others who are nervous about buying skincare products is to get the travel kit: MyChelle Sampler Travel and Gift Set - 1 Kit(s) I have been going through the kit and trying new Mychelle products slowly to discover which ones I like (so far, all of them). The peel tingles a little, smells tasty, works perfectly, and is paraben free!
