review/text: This stuff stinks to high heavens but is by leaps and bounds the very best Hemorrhoid pain reliever out there. The first time I used it was like sticking and icycle up my butt. The relief was instant and long lasting. Use the applicator and not you finger. Normally putting your finger there won't help it smell like roses but this stuff will give you a stinky finger that won't wash off easy. The smell is really weird like menthol, musky, wintergreen, and dirty arm pit. I highly reccomend this if you are in pain..worth every cent..get at least 3 tubes, you'll thank me!
