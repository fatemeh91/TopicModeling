review/text: I was on synthyroid many years ago. My hypothyroid symptoms improved. Then my primary doctor retired. The next doctor took me off. My symptoms returned. I found gaia herbs thyroid support on amazon.com and will continue to take. I am very pleased with my improved symptoms! My hair & nails growing, brain function & energy up, and losing 16 lbs!
