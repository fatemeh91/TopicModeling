review/text: This was a very good diet bar, however, the taste was a little bland. I used it for breakfast and was very pleased with how well it satisfied my hunger. I didn't get as hungry for lunch when I usually do. (Previously, I would normally eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast.) The taste could use some improving upon. The nuts did create a better taste. I've used Slim Fast before and this seemed to satisfy better than the Slim Fast products. I'd recommend this to anyone trying to lose weight or to someone who doesn't have time for breakfast and/or lunch. This makes a great meal substitute and is quick and easy.
