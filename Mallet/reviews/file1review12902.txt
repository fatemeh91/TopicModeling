review/text: For now this gets a 1 star because there's a giant part on the top that isn't even stitched. If this is intended then I apologize and will change this to a better rating, but it looks odd to me. And it's not mentioned anywhere about there being a giant part that isn't stitched closed. It's kind of in the middle but more to the left a little bit. And also when the product came the velcro part of the strap was stuck to the blue gel part (the side you put on your face) and even while gently pulling it off it managed to damage it a little bit. While that's a bummer, the biggest issue for me is the stitching at the top. As far as I'm aware there's no reason to ever take it out of it's pouch so why would it be like that? I hope they didn't send me a used product...
