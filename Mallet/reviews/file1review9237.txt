review/text: This is the perfect med pack for me. I love that I can divide up my doses at the beginning of the week. Then each day, I can just grab the correct pod and stick it in my purse. The plastic is a good thick quality, and is slightly see through, to all you to see if you've missed a dose. Each pod is big enough to hold several pills. I take a big vitamin pill and several smaller pills and they fit quite nicely in each pod, even with the divider. The lids do not open seperately though. There is no chance of doses getting mixed up while the pod is closed. However, I had difficulty opening these sometimes. Once the lid is open, both am and pm doses are exposed. So be careful not to spill your pills everywhere and get them mixed up.
