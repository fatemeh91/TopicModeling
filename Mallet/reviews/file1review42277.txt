review/text: I have a hard time getting my proper vitamins from regular food and I can't digest pills so liquid was the only way to go for me. This product when mixed in something is FANTASTIC! Taking it as a &#34;shot&#34; is very fruity, tart, and heavy on the vitamin taste, but if you do not have time to mix it in with anything--it is not the worst tasting liquid vitamin I have swallowed. Absolutely delicious in a smoothie!
