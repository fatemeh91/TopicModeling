review/text: I must start by first saying that the reason for me considering this product was due to the fact I have PCOS, and birth control was not working well for me. I have very irregular periods. Recently my last period was 5 months ago. I must say that I have been taking fertilaid for the last 2 months. The first month I felt a change in my body immediately, but no period, no pregnancy. I was about to give up on it, but I read a few post and some have waited atleast 3 months, so I decided to press on.The second month I again thought that all hope was lost, 8 weeks on this product and no period. I have had stomach cramps, breast soreness, I have taken several preg test and all negative, so I figured the product was just crap. Well today I got a great surprise, I have now come on my cycle and it feels GREAT!! I never thought I would say that, but I need this to happen so that I can ovulate and concieve. I was so excited. So I now have hope that the product does work. I was just about to go back on the pill since that was the only thing that brought on my periods, well now I'm glad i pressed on. I love the stuff and feel that it will help me to concieve.
