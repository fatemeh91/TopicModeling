review/text: I had used this product some number of years ago and started a regimented workout routine after a few years absent from the game...The new formula looks, mixes, tastes and works exactly like the former. It mixes well with just a spoon, and tastes about as good as products like this come. I use it to supplement a protein laden diet, typically first thing in the morning, pre-workout and later in the evening. It is quickly soluble, so I am likely changing to a casien protein mix or cottage cheese or lean meat before bed because of longer protein provisioning while asleep, but for those who aren't particluar it can be used whenever you need that quick protein ingested. If you can find an equivalent product for a better price let me know!!!
