review/text: HelloI want to let all the ladies know that this product really works! I am PCOS and the last 3 months I've lost nearly 20 lbs. then my period came on 7th of july, then again 4th of august and was expecting it 1st of september which it did not come. So I went online and order tha product and rush it and started to take it tuesday night, well today I hot my period and no cramps, no PMS feelings only a little bloated, but I guess is normal for being the first day. I do have a 7 yr old boy, and I am looking for having more children!
