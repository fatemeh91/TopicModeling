review/text: I bought this changing pad cover because it was really affordable. However, I did not read the description closely enough where it states 'flat changing table cover'. I have a Summer Infant changing pad that is the standard shape and size and this cover did not fit - it is way too small to cover the pad. Make sure when you purchase this you have a FLAT changing pad.
