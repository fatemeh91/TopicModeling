review/text: I have had my Triumph Professional Care 9000 for less than 2 years (came with multiple handles). This is the second time that one of them stopped working. The first time it broke soon after I purchased and was able to return. Now this time my handle says it's charging but as soon as I remove it NOTHING!!So, now I have to contact a authorized service provided -- which took a lot of hunting on the web site to find for a phone #, then to only be lead to another web site, with more phone #'s. What happen to customer service?Buyer Beware...I do love the battery operated toothbrush but you may want to pick another brand.
