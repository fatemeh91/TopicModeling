review/text: Length:: 1:13 MinsOur daughter has been recently assessed by an Occupational Therapist. The OT suggested the red (soft) Theraputty to help build fine motor skills. The OT thought yellow Theraputty would be too easy and the green too hard. I did order the red, but also ordered 2oz of green (medium) for the occasional challenge.Our daughter loves both colors, but seems to prefer the green. I think she really likes the challenge of working harder (maybe a result of her sensory seeking). One of the exercises for Theraputty is to hide objects in the putty and let the child dig them out. This video is of our daughter digging out very small legos with the green (medium) putty. She does it fairly easily, so I may be ordering the blue soon!
