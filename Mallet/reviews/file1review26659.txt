review/text: I just used my new Booster support on a trip across the county and back. The material was thicker and more durable than I expected. It was easy to blow up and held the air load throughout all four legs of my trip. It has a good quality valve - one that requires you to squeeze it to release the inner flap. This way that air does not rush out as you are inflating. I was also happy to see that it came with an small storage pouch to contain it while traveling. As for the support, it was pretty darn good. I felt plenty of lumbar pressure (as I wanted) in the poor airline seats. In fact, I deflated a bit to reduce the pressure for more comfort. Totally worth the money.
