review/text: I am satisfied with the posture bands and after buying 2 posture bands last year, I ordered 6 of them recently. I had read all the negative reviews, and agree these comments are correct. However the posture bands help remind me to keep my shoulders back. To keep the posture bands from riding up on the back of my neck I attached them to my bra.They are soft, flexible, easy to wash and fairly comfortable. If I want more shoulder pull power I use two of them at a time. That is why I now have 8 of them and use them every day for a better posture and better appearance.
