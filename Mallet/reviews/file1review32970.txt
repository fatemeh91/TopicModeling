review/text: My shoulder has ached for over year and upon a recommendation from a relative I tried Wellesse Joint Movement Glucosamine with Chondroitin to see if it would help. After one bottle, my shoulder didn't ache as much so I bought another. After two bottles I noticed a huge relief from pain. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from joint pain. I was afraid my shoulder pain would require surgery but now see that by using this product I have reduced the discomfort by 99%! Give it a try, it might work for you as well!
