review/text: I am a semi-frequent flier, and I like lumbar support when sitting on a plane or in a car. This Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion is the BEST back pillow I have ever used.It is slightly larger than its competition, it is made of thicker material, it has a clever waist belt attached so that the pillow stays in the exact perfect position behind you, and most importantly it has a tough plastic valve for inflation. The problem with other brands, especially the Lewin N. Clark back pillow, is the valve eventually fails, and then the air seeps out while you are using it. The Back Booster uses a heavy duty valve that requires the user to pinch it open while inflating. This makes for a secure seal. Much better than Lewis N. Clark.
