review/text: If you've only tried water-based lubricants until now, Pjur Eros will make you a convert to silicone-based products. Goodbye stickiness. Goodbye five-second moisture. Pjur Eros lasts and lasts, with a wonderful, velvety feel. My boyfriend and I originally tried this as part of a sampler pack, along with ID Millenium and Wet Platinum. This is better than the other two BY FAR. We love it!
