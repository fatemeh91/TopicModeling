review/text: i love the scent (which is not too strong) of this foot cream and more importantly the feel of it. it feels thick but definitely not cloying or too thick. it's easily rubbed in, NOT greasy, and it feels great. i also use it on rough spots on my knees, and anywhere else my skin is really dry. a little bit of the cream goes a long way, so this 2 ounces will last a while.
