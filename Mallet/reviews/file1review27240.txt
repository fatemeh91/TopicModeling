review/text: I've reviewed several different brands. ON had high protein per serving similar to the $40-$50/2lb. container brands but I paid like $15 shipped.I haven't noticed much muscle gain yet but given the number of lifters claims It should start soon. I have noticed that I don't get as sore after lifting.The taste with milk is delicious. I got the banana cream and it tastes just like a shake. I tried it with water the first time and it was pretty bad.I'm happy with it and will continue to order more.
