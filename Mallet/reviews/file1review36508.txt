review/text: I went through many stinky days searching for a natural deodorant that worked and this one ended my search! The reviews are spot on. A few notes on this product; it is expensive, it will sting if you spray it on right after you shave your underarms, the scent is quite strong (but dissipates quickly)But for the pro of it working, and working really well it's definitely worth it! Buy the large size, the small will only last you just over a month or so.
