review/text: I was hesitant to spend this much on a toothbrush that I had never even heard of. However, I am glad I spent the cash. The bristles are very soft, yet manage to leave your teeth squeaky clean. It takes a few more passes than a regular manual toothbrush, but is worth the effort. And, the technology seems to work. I haven't been to the dentist since trying it, but my teeth do feel really clean. I use it with and without toothpaste. I think using toothpaste is a little better (maybe the lubrication factor), but water alone does the trick. The only drawback is that you need to keep your hand wet and in contact with the metal part to get the ionic part to work. A minor inconvenience for an otherwise great product. An added bonus is that it comes with a spare head. I will buy again.
