review/text: Contrary to my previous feedback, and after receiving a very nice email from Wellhaven's customer service department, this reacher's claw does actually rotate, as stated in the description(the instructions that came with the reacher itself are not clear on how to make the 'claw' rotate, and I didn't think to print the instructions as listed on the seller's page...I doubt most people would).I originally ordered it to help me reach items stored on the upper shelves of my kitchen cabinets, but quickly discovered it's versatility...I have an adorable, 'free-range' parakeet who likes to climb to the top of his cage, and toss his little toys off the edge; often they end up either behind or under his oversized cage and stand, and the reacher has proved quite helpful in retrieving those toys that had been difficult for me to get. I just may have to order another one for the kitchen...again!
