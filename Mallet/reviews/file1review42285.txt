review/text: I ordered this product because I have a horrible time swallowing pills. Most vitamins are quite large (relatively speaking). I ordered Source of Life Liquid a month ago and I swear that as long as they make it, I will buy and use it. After getting beyond its appearance and putting a capful in some Tropicana 50/50 orange juice, I tried it. It is wonderful!!! It turns the juice a sludge green (and you need to stir it so that it mixes well) but I can't see taking anything else.I actually look forward to it in the mornings and just received my 2nd bottle.
