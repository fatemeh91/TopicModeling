review/text: The model advertised and ordered on Aug 29, 2009 was no. 9878-511, the model they shipped to me was the much outdated 9876-536, which doesn't have the charging light, cannot be used while plugged in to the wall (corded use) and doesn't have a storage pouch. The e-mail Cosmetic Solutions and Amazon.com sent to confirm my order just stated: WAHL TRIMMER BEARD & MUSTACHE XL and Wahl Groomsman Cordless Trimmer, no info on the model number, leaving themselves ample wiggle room to ship any model they wanted. I trusted the vendor since it was selling through Amazon.com, but I was fairly pissed when I saw what they sent. I already own a Wahl rechargeable trimmer, just like the one they sent, which works well but has a very poor battery life and can not be used in corded mode, so I know exactly the type of bait and switch trick they did. I live in Mexico so it would be too expensive to return the item for an exchange or refund. But my 1st experience shopping with "Cosmetic Solutions" was bad, I would never order anything from these folks ever again.
