review/text: I love this seat. It is secure and easy to sit on. I also like the splash guard in the front, it really helps with the messes that could be from my son. The only thing I recommend is getting one in your child's favorite color. I have a black one and a blue one, my son will only use the blue one because it's his favorite color.
