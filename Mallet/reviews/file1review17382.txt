review/text: I've grown frustrated with my previous trimmer, an otherwise excellent Wahl model, which required that I swap out different attachments to control the trim depth, or else used a disastrous adjustable slide that would collapse in use. (Surprise! You're bald! Or at least patchy.)This Remington integrates an excellent depth control device, selectable with a thumb-rotated wheel, and the guard can be removed for a closer trim. There are no other accessories needed, although it does come with the ubiqitous munchkin comb and rapidly discarded miniscule cleaning broom. Aside from those, I no longer need to keep track of an array of tiny flimsy pieces.There are some problems with this, nothing glaring, but it does feel flimsy, especially the guard. I have no reason to expect it will fall apart soon - nothing has broken yet, or even hinted at it- but it does not have the solid and compact hand-feel that my Wahl has.Which brings me to the next point: This is not compact. It's an exceptionally long device, at least an inch longer than any trimmer I've had before, and it makes it difficult to maneuver at times. Tilting my head back, tucking it under my chin, and trying to eye the mirror has made for some memorable and lopsided shaves.Still, when managed properly this is a very good trimmer. I'd recommend it.
