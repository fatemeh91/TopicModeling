review/text: This is a nice price for 12 cartridges/$20 in case if one needs a replacement. Being lazy shopping in Brick-and-Mortar stores, I figured out that Amazon is a great source of everything I need including my shaving supplies. Buy something else to qulify for free shipping. Additionally, if you shop with Amazon CC you will be earning 3 points for every dollar spent. Out of $20, this is like $0.60 discount.As for the Mach3 cartridges, I use them for years now. Compared to many other brands this is the winner. Expensive: may be, good quality: absolutely Yes!
