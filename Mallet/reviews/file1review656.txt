review/text: I am a banquet cook at a large resort and frequently have to do tedious things like slice 2000 slider buns or cut 1000 tomato slices. Everyone who has borrowed this knife in the kitchen comes back to me and asks where I got it. It's simply fantastic. The knife is light, the grip is excellent, and the blade is thin, which are all things you want out of your bread knife. Definitely keeps you going long after the guy with his 4 pound club has gotten fatigued. Would recommend to home cooks and chefs alike.
