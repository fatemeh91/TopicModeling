review/text: This is an excellent pediatric stethoscope. It's funny to think that I had to adjust to listening through a new stethoscope, but that is exactly what I experienced. Now that I am accustomed, this works as well as my last Littmann, which served me well for 9 long years. Happy Auscultating!!
