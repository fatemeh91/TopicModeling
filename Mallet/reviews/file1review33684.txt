review/text: The WaterPik works much better than floss for me...when I can actually get it to work. Since the second week I've had it, it has worked intermittently. After tearing the thing apart, which was no easy task, I discovered that a very small part was not letting water pass through it. After calling WaterPik for a replacement part, I was told that the piece can not be sold individually and that I would have to replace the entire assembly. I decided to continue trying to use it when it worked until it stopped working completely, now because the pause button on the handle is not responding. I have now only had the product for two months and it already needs completely replaced!
