review/text: Ok, so it's supposed to be tasteless. It is not tasteless, if you put it in water you can definitely taste it. If you put it in ice cream you can feel the granules. My daughter is very very picky and she somehow has a 6th sense that I am trying to sneak it in things...(she is underweight and desperately needs more calories) and a lot of times she won't eat the food I put it in. We will have to try putting it in baked stuff. Works in scrambeled eggs sometimes.
