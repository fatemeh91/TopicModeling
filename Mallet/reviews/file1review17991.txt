review/text: I use these by myself, first time I got Strawberry, Chocolate, Banana, and Vanilla. I decided to get more. I've only used the strawberry & chocolate. I would recommend just 2-5 little drops from a little packet is plenty for me. The strawberry is very strong, its not something you just want to lick off, if its mixed its better. The chocolate is good, just sugary by itself. I can't wait to try all of them! Just from getting them, the orange and grape smell very strong. Don't buy these thinking you can just lick it right off, actually use it and then you can lick it off.
