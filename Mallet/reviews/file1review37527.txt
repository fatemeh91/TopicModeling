review/text: If you want old school scented aftershave, this one is a good one. The scent it basically a bay rum, it smells good when you put it on, but its not overpowering and it leaves a light fragrance most of the day. It did not burn my skin either like other similar aftershaves such as clubman. The bottle is 15oz, I was surprised at how big it was when i opened the box, even for people who like to dump aftershave on, the bottle will last a long time. Considering how expensive a lot of the bay rum aftershaves are, this one is reasonably priced and is definitely worth a try.
