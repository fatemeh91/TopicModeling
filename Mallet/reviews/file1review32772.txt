review/text: Overall, these are good shakes for protein. That is mainly what I use them for, and not really as part of my diet routine. I don't eat breakfast, so I guess you could say I have these in the morning instead because it is good for you and isn't cookies or other junkfood at the office. ;-)I'd like to point out that Sams Club has this for cheaper. Although it seems like you are getting a good deal, let's do the math.1 can from amazon, costs 8.99 (26.97 divided by 3 is 8.99 per can, alright) for one 12.83-oz can, which equals 0.70 per ounce.1 can from Sams Club, costs 13.48, and is a 31.18-oz can, which equals 0.43 per ounce.So, if you want to buy three, it's cheaper elsewhere. :-)
