review/text: I have no idea why anyone wouldn't love this product. I live in an area with hard water. When I installed this product I didn't even clean my shower. I have not cleaned/scrubed my shower in a month! It looks better than when I would scrub. It is brighter and doesn't have that icky film that used to make it feel dirty even when I had cleaned it. Also, there is no pink or green unwanted stuff. The key is to hit the button after the last shower of the day. If you are doing that daily it works great! My only caution is shower doors. If you don't want spots squeegy it down after a while.
