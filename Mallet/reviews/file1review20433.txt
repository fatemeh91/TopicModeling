review/text: I spend way too much time sitting at the computer and driving (3500 or more miles per month) Most of the chairs I use are very comfortable, however, the boss bought a used delivery truck with one of the thinnest, most uncomfortable seats I've sat in. The Tush Cush has the ride bearable.
