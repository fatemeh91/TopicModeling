review/text: I have read and watched many beauty blogger reviews on.this product and finally gave in...I had to see for myself if it really could "cure" cracked dry lips and stay on all night. Initially I had doubts and felt the price was high for a lip balm. However, upon using for one night, I am a believer. This product stayed on all night in an air conditioned room with a ceiling fan running all night. My lips still had some product on when I woke. Revel de Miel is more like a lip treatment disguised as a balm. I now see that heals cracked and dried lips and intensely moisturizes them over night. The product is thick but not greasy. A very small.bit goes a long way if you massage into the lips. Great value and great results. Will be repurchasing when I run out (I cant imagine how long that will take).
