review/text: Reduce the pain and hassle of blood glucose testing. The ACCU-CHEK Multiclix lancing device uses a drum of 6 preloaded lancets. Plus, it uses the same technology as the ACCU-CHEK FastClix device, which has been proven least painful.1 With 11 depth settings for maximum comfort, and minimal side-to-side motion for less skin tearing, it helps eliminate the pain of blood sugar checks. Will definitely purchase again"
