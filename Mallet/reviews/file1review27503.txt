review/text: The cookies and cream product used to be awesome. Ordered my first one couple of months back and it was the best protein flavor made by Optimum. The next one that came in had something horribly wrong with it. Smelled like crap, did not mix well in water and was nasty overall. Sent that back and Amazon sent us another one as a replacement. This one does not smell, but has the same mixing / color issue. Maybe Optimum had a bad batch or they have changed their formula. Pretty much sucks now.
