review/text: I have been using this product for about a week, less then a week actually.Amazing.My energy is better, I feel more upbeat, less physically exhausted. I feel like my recollection is even getting better... I'm more regular, my body is detoxing, this stuff is just amazing! I'm even less anxious, I used to have panic attacks and little OCD things... but they are basically gone! Though that much I'm not sure if that is due to the green vibrance or the fish oil I started taking about a week and a half ago, or maybe them working together. I cant wait to see how I feel after a month on it, or more! This stuff is fantastic, I've been recommending it to everyone I know, though mostly they go "ewww I'm not drinking that!" hahaI'm never going without my Green Vibrance again!It does taste horrible, I mix it with grape juice or cranberry juice and it isn't as bad. My friend who takes it suggests apple juice, though I've never tried it. I do alot of supplements/herbs so I'm used to drinking yucky stuff for my health, it doesn't really bother me. I just drink it down, and then have something good to drink. I mean, your talking 4-8 oz of juice with the green vibrance, its not that bad, not like you need to mix it into a 2 liter.This stuff is magic!The only problem is it needs to be frozen or refrigerated after you open it, and the container is big, so its hard to fit it in there if your fridge/freezer is usually full.
