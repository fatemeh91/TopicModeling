review/text: Unfortunately I was in a rush to buy a Christmas present for my child's teacher. We came up with the idea of a "set" of tuning forks for the Sound Unit he was teaching. We saw the price, we saw the product picture, and we ordered it. Usually I scroll down and read reviews before purchasing, but I didn't this time and I am sorry I didn't. As previous people stated, I was annoyed that I received only one fork when thinking I was getting a set. Now I am stuck because it will cost me money if I return it and I would be out a fork and shipping. Amazon needs to revamp this product description and picture because it is misleading. The set is actually in the 50 dollar range not 5 dollars. So if you were to order, READ CAREFULLY to ensure that you are purchasing EXACTLY what you think you are ordering. This is the first time I have ever been dissatified with a purchase through Amazon.
