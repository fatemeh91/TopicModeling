review/text: Ever since i was little, my family has used this detergent. Growing up in Germany it was widely available. When i moved to the USA, i had to do with american soaps and did not like the way they cleaned or how the laundry felt after washing and drying.when i received my front loader a few years ago, i found Persil at Amazon. After a few washes with this detergent, i noticed that a layer of gray disappeared from the laundry. The whites were whiter and color were brighter. The laundry feels and looks clean. It is also very economical i use about 1/2 the recommended amount and get really great results. I can only recommend it.
