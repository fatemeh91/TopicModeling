review/text: I got one of these in a free promotion. I have to admit, there I was standing in the shower looking at this thing and thinking "I think I can pick up a squadron of German bombers coming in". Seriously, it looks like a WW2 coastal radar, not a razor. I mean it is big.. huge..ridiculous. I pictured the coroner finding my severed head in the shower, this thing clutched in my hands, "air raid" scrawled on the shower in blood. I have to admit- it is arguably the best shave I have ever had. I shave my head as well and I half expected it to look like a bowl of coleslaw when done but nary a nick at all. I found that due to it's size it did need fixing on a curve or two, but overall I was very impressed. I have been using Gillette disposable up till now. So it has impressed my skin, but now it has to make peace with my wallet. It all boils down to how long the blades last. I expect at least a week out of each. Usually those green "lube" strips are the first to go and after that the razors become pretty brutal. AT this price point I don't want to use more than one blade every week. If they can manage that and send me some coupons then I am sold. But I think 5 blades is the stopping point- anything beyond that needs a pull starter.
