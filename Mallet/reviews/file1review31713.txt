review/text: Our 14 year old pug was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and given 3 months to live. In addition to his medications, I started giving him 30mg CoQ10 each day. It's now almost two years later and he's still doing well! The vet says that this is a record for his practice and "whatever you're doing, keep it up". I think that this CoQ10 has helped, and I now give all our pugs the same dose each day. Prayer and CoQ10 has saved our pug.
