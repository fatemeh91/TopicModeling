review/text: On the recommendation of a nurse practitioner and later my nutritionist, I take this to compliment the Cal/Mag supplement I take. I have osteoporosis and am trying to do everything possible to keep my bones strong. (I also take Fosamax with vitamin D). In addition, I take biotin, which my nutritionist said might strengthen my fingernails. It definitely has, or at least the combination of all I'm doing has done that! I was never able to grow them out at all before. They always broke and were quite thin. You should see them now! I have found TwinLab to be a good company over the years and the biotin I take is their brand as well.TwinLab - Tri-Boron, 3 mg, 100 capsules
