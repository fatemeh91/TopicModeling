review/text: I use many elasto gel products at my work and find them to do quite a good job. This eye mask does not dissapoint. It gets cold and stays cold for about half an hour. The mask is very soft on the face and provides much needed relaxation for the eyes after a day of driving, reading and looking at screens. Solid product, swift shipping. Only 4 stars because I hoped it would stay cold a bit longer. But overall great eye mask.
