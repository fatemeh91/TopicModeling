review/text: I love the Emjoi! It is money well spent. I have hirsutism where I grow an thick unsightly patch of coarse hair on the underside of my chin. It is extremely detrimental to my self esteem. Waxing, shaving, and dipilitories all leave stubble within a matter of 24 hours. ALTHOUGH THE EMJOI SAYS NOT TO USE IT ON THE FACE, I use the Emjoi on my chin because the hair is very tough. (Even facial depilatories do not work for me) It hurts a lot, but that should be expected with any type of epilation, and you get used to it, and the sacrifice to be hair free and smooth is totally worth it. I found it less painful and with less side effects than electrolysis which is unbearable and requires longer treatment time in one sitting. What doesn't even get done satisfactorily in 45 mins of electrolysis is done in 15 minutes with the Enjoi...and the pain subsides much quicker, and the skin is a LOT more smoother. The directions are easy to follow. The shaver smoothes the skin by getting rid of the stubble after using the tweezer attachment, so hair removal is COMPLETE! I couldn't believe how great it works. I have tried EVERYTHING. I want to find whoever invented this and plant a big HUGE kiss on them! I will always rely on my Emjoi. I really have no compaints.For what it's worth it comes in a neat case for the unit and the attachments.
