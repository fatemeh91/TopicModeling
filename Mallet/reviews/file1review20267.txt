review/text: These are the least expensive and what my mom raised us on--but NOT. The negative reviews of this product are quite true. (Wish I had listened). I thought if I washed these on hot 4-5 times as some have suggested, they would turn into what I remember my younger sibling having. Nope--can't tell you how much water and electricity I have wasted and they are still gauze. They come out of the drier looking like the tissue you forgot to remove from your pocket. I found myself trying to iron them back into a square; rediculous and difficult.They are absorbent, but lack substance while still being bulky. In other words not much capacity. Not easy to fold in the shape they turn into. Not even worth using for a burp cloth (which the old Gerber ones were great for)--your shoulder will get wet. These are NOT what Gerber used to make (sadly). See OsoCozy for a true birdseye flat fold--even better than what Gerber used to produce.
