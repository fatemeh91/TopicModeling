review/text: I use these bars for a quick tune up and loss of about 5 pounds with this strategy...I'll do a 24 hour fast on water using the strategies described in Paul Bragg's "The Miracle of Fasting." Water fasting throws me into ketosis in about 16 hours.Then on the 24th hour, I break the fast with a low carb, Atkins induction diet for 24 to 48 hours.Then, I finish the week feeling great and 5 pounds lighter using my everyday diet (which is very much like that described in "The Abs Diet, Eat Right Every Time").I'm not over weight, but I keep a 6 pack at 45 years old by walking 20 milse a week and using this routine every month or two.For those who are overweight, I'd recommend that you consider fasting...the physician's who say nay have probably never tried it.These bars work great for the Atkins induction day following a 24 hour water day (you'd be surprised how good almsot anything tastes after 24 hours on water...my experience has been the more overweight the person the pickier the eater).For the Atkins induction day...I usually start with an omlette for breakfast, use three of these bars with lots of water (I prefer Dannon's bottled water) while at work, and finish the day with a salad on arrival home and another omlette at bedtime.Of course, all of these strategies should be approved by your physician.
