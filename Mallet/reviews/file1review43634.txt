review/text: This is my second blood pressure monitor - the first was a piece of crap where the batteries always went dead and the velco lining on the arm band couldn't hold the arm band tightThis is a plug-in, so no dead batteries and the velco lining is strong enough to hold the arm band tightWorth the money
