review/text: I don't know how I have managed to do without this until now! This is a great item, a good back scratcher. The massager rollers are adequate as is the scratcher. I have also found it useful to get things that have rolled under furniture (like my puppy's ball :)) Easy to use, reasonably made, great value.
