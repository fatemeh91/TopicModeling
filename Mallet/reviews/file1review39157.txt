review/text: After watching how easy my hairdresser cuts my hair in the 12 minutes that it takes her and realizing that it was costing me $16 every 2 weeks and time to drive there, I bought the Wahl and gave it a shot. It comes with great instructions and a dvd that makes it very easy to learn. Now, I am not spending the $450 a year on haircuts and gas but I'm still getting a nice haircut all year. As for the quality of the shaver, it is top notch quality. The clips are great and strong as well. If you use the oil that it comes with, keep it somewhat dry and use the little brush after each haircut, it will last for many years! I will forever be a Wahl customer.
