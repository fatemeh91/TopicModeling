review/text: Good Eye Mask. I've been using the mask for approximately nine months now. It's somewhat true to its description; it is in fact very comfortable, and the contour design is excellent, with plenty of room for "eye fluttering", and the pattern I purchased is very pretty and true to its description. However, when it comes to blocking out light...it does not. Light definitely seeps through the bottom. Moreover, it tends to slide off (more often than not). As many other reviewers attested, it is definitely a great mask for traveling, etc. I'm still using it on/off (I have another mask that works really well for sleeping). Unfortunately, I can't 100% recommend this mask for "actual" sleeping or blocking out light, but would definitely recommend for traveling, or relaxing for a short while; hence my 3-rating.
