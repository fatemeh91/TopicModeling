review/text: I had a full beard and mustache for most of the last 25 years, because I couldn't tolerate the corresponding cuts, irritation, and discomfort caused by shaving with a blade. As my facial hair became whiter and whiter, I did a little research on electric razors and decided to try the Braun 8585 because of its features and feedback from other users. No doubt about it, I get just as close a shave with the 8585 as with a blade, with zero irritation. Also, suprisingly, it didn't take my skin any time to adjust to an electric razor. As far as the cost of the cleaning solution, for the comfort you receive with this product, it's more than worth it. I wish I had found this shaving system years ago; Friends tell me I look much younger now without the facial hair.
