review/text: This was my first electric toothbrush purchase and I'm a happy convert now. It really does feel like a dental cleaning after every brushing.I did a little bit of research and decided to get this one because hey, I won't deny it--I like my stuff well designed. I thought the form factor of this brush was much simpler, cleaner, and less bulky than the other electric toothbrushes out there with similar features.I really like how the charger base is convertible from one that houses the brush heads (up to 4) to an extremely minimal base that is just the charger only, not much bigger than the base of the brush itself. I haven't traveled with it yet but I'm looking forward to having this brush with me when I do, especially with the nifty travel case.I'm sure not many people care about LCD screen all that much, but I for one appreciate the little smilie that shows up for a few seconds after you've completed the 2 minutes. It makes me smile! What other toothbrush makes you do that?Another major plus is how easy it is to attach and remove the brushhead, which makes cleaning after every use totally doable and moreso, easy.Some think that this brush is a little overpriced, with unnecessary features, but I think the form factor and design of this brush, added with its effectiveness in cleaning, makes it worth it.
