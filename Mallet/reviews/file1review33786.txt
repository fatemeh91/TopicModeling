review/text: I get really bad ingrown hairs on my legs since I started waxing 2 years ago and I was hoping this would help to control them. It doesn't stop them or get rid of them...I use it like a toner after I've exfoliated or had to dig a few ingrowns out.Smells very chemically but I enjoy it and it definitely lessens the redness left by ingrowns.
