review/text: I've been using Crest Whitestrips for about 4 years to maintain a professional whitening. The Whitestrips definitely help brighten teeth and even out discoloration from coffee & tea. I must warn that the Premium strips can cause some serious sensitivity. I am on day 3 of 7 and had to take the strips off 1/3 through because the pain was so intense. Another person who rated suggested applying the strips every other day and I agree. The strips do work well though, without a doubt. I swear by them and get a lot of compliments on my teeth. Just keep in mind the sensitivity issue.
