review/text: I have been trying to find something that it is natural but without the aluminum elements that most anti-antiperspirants have, however I understand this is a difficult task. This product is good - it neutralizes the odors, but it didn't stop the sweat.I think most naturals items won't stop the sweat (after all it is the natural thing that our body does), so maybe the problem is me. For this product don't expect to wear a green or blue shirt w/o seeing the sweat spots in the armpits....The smell is pleasant, but a little too strong for me - I didn't think I could wear my fragrance and the deodorant at the same time - that's why I gave the four stars.
