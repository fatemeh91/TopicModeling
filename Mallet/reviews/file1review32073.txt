review/text: Had an interview in an hour and got a pizza stain, panicked, went to 3 different dry cleaners in the city, and none would do an emergency cleaning. Went to the pharmacy and bought the Tide to go. Totally saved my Butt. Everyone should carry one of these in their briefcase/car/whatever. It removed a red marinara like stain from the pizza, I applied it about 30 minutes after the stain, and it worked. Even though it didn't remove it 100%, it got most of it and faded the stain to the poitn where it was difficult to see, which is what counted at that time. Just make sure you use it right (push-blot, then rub/mark out)
