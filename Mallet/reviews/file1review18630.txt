review/text: I bought this because I know some professional cleaners who use it, and I carry it around the house for carpeted steps where my big vac can't go. It's also great on hard surfaces like bathroom tile and wood floor. Once in awhile I haul it to the garage for the car because the attachments are small enough for crevices, but it's no shopvac and that is a hard cleaning job. For actual carpet I use my big vac, it's much more powerful. This is a good little machine but I don't think it's possible to get the same suction as you get in a big one. But, it's super for the steps and getting around the bathroom tile in the small spaces. I am going to look for disposable bags, the cloth one does fill up quickly, it's easy enough to change, but I think having a spare would be good. You can wash the filter in the machine after you shake off most of the gunk.
