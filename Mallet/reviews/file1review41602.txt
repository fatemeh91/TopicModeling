review/text: I have never used an electric toothbrush before this one. But it is clear to me this is an excellent product. My teeth felt noticeably cleaner after two uses. It's a great toothbrush for traveling...charge lasts for two weeks and the charger works in outlets other than the standard 120v ones we have in the US.
