review/text: I've been using Heather's tummy fiber for only 4 days, and I am already feeling some relief from my IBS-D. I also highly recommend the peppermint tummy tea, it's very soothing and tastes wonderful. I haven't had any problems with the fiber dissolving, I simply add 1/2 tsp. to a little water, stir with a fork, wait, stir some more, and then add more water. It has almost NO flavor. A work friend recommended this product, and I'm very grateful that she did. She claims that it completely resolved her gas and bloating issues due to IBS.
