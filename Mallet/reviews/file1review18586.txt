review/text: I purchased the Omron large cuff which says on the package you can use with all Omron automatic or manual digital blood pressure monitors with a D ring cuff. I have no idea what a D ring cuff is as my Omron blood pressure machine doesn't mention it. My husband has a big arm so I read all the reviews and believed I had found just what we needed so he could comfortably use my machine. Today his cardiologist took him off his meds for a week but he wanted to see what his pressure was. I opened the box, followed the instructions, and the tip did NOT fit in my Omron bp machine. So before you buy this, make sure you don't believe everything you read!
