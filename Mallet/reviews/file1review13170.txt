review/text: I appreciate the size of this protector, as it makes it suitable for use on a larger bed and prevents shifting. The pad itself is very plain and backed in polyester. It certainly guarantees that any accident will not reach the mattress. We machine wash and dry it after every use. If accidents are frequent, I recommend buying multiple pads--certainly two at the minimum.
