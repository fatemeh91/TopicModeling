review/text: I'll add skim milk, a pinch of vanilla extract, and a few ice cubes...and I have myself a nutritious, delicious, and easy meal replacement for breakfast and sometimes in the afternoon too. I use to buy the pre-made ready shakes at walmart but find this much more economical over the long run. My goal was to lose 25 lbs by the time it begins to get warm outside. I have ten pounds to go and the clock is ticking so I have really been relying on this drink more than usual lately. I also give a ton of credit to CLA and raspberry ketones,Primaforce Max CLA 180 Softgels + Free 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder. I started taking CLA (blocks fat from building up in the stomach area) and also raspberry ketones which has been a great appetite suppressant. They really help keep my cravings in check which is always an uphill battle with me. Oh and if you plan on not using a blender with the shakes, I highly recommend getting a cheap shaker from amazon or the store. Using a spoon to mix does not work nearly as good as the blender or even the shaker.
