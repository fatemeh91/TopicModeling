review/text: I've used this product for about 3 months now, and couldn't be happier! I only have to use it once a week, and presto! my legs look and feel great.Regarding the ever-so-sensitive underarm area: it's definently worth the pain. I used to shave only two or three times a year, and that at great deliberation, because I would get horrible itchy rashes (yuck) and painful bumps that would last days. Now I epilate once a week, with almost no problems.What a relief that someone invented this!
