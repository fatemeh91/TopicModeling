review/text: I usually don't review books or products, but when I came to this page to order twelve more Gophers and saw that no one had reviewed the product yet, I couldn't resist.The Gopher caught my attention one day while I was shopping at Wal-Mart and suffering with a low backache. I bought it, and now everyone in my household is hooked. My back is better, and I still find the Gopher very handy. My 8-year-old enjoys using it to sort laundry and put clothes in the washer. I use it to reach jars on high shelves in the pantry or linens stored out of reach in the closet. We've used it to pick up trash along the road.I'm buying one for all my siblings and my mother and mother-in-law for Christmas. My 80-year-old mother-in-law lives alone in her home and is stooped over with osteoporosis. I know it will be extremely handy for her.I appreciate the cleverness and simplicity of the design and the fact that it really helps lighten my load. The Gopher is easy to use, lightweight, and easy to store. I'm getting a couple of extras for our home, so I can be sure we'll have one years from now. It's a great functional product. It's a product I'm excited about!
