review/text: We bought this for my son when he needed a haircut because it was easier to cut his hair at home then take him to a hairdresser. We like this because it's wireless. Like all clipper, it makes the buzz sound, which my son is kind of scared of, but as long as we distract him, it doesn't bug him. We dropped the trimmer once, and broke the #1 clip, so we use it without the clip, and it still works great.Saved us a lot of money by not taking my son to the hairdresser.
