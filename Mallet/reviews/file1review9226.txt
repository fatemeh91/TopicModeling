review/text: I have purchased O'Cedar mopheads for 20 years. They are usually yellow, and much fuller than the blue one I received. The only good comment I have is that there is cloth where there was plastic, so perhaps, this won't tear, as the plastic has in the past, necessitating replacement.I am very disappointed in this.
