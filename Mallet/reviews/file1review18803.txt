review/text: I got the first one in July of 2005 and it failed in November of 2005. I used it at most once a day. I contacted Goodmans and they informed me that all warranty work was handled by Medelco. I contacted Medelco and got it shipped back to them at my expense. After 20 days they shipped me another one which just failed as well on April 25, 2006. This is not a quality product and Medelco carries no spare parts.
