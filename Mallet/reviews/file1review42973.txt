review/text: I have owned commercial-style stainless appliances for 4 years and had yet to find a cleaner that really worked - and I've tried them ALL. I recently found this product and will never use anything else again!A tiny amount polishes away all dirt, fingerprints, oils, etc. with NO STREAKING! Even if you rub against the grain, you don't get smudges. On my double oven, I can buff right over the glass doors and they sparkle, too. No smearing, clouding or getting out the glass cleaner!! Plus, this product is much more budget-friendly since such a small amount is required to do the job. It saves time, too; I can clean my 7-foot-tall refrigerator, warming drawer, double ovens and 48" cooktop in less than 5 minutes! It is superior on our stainless steel sinks and grill also.I'm especially thrilled that this is chemical-free and fragranced with botanical oils, so I don't have to worry about what I'm spraying around my house. I highly recommend the entire line of Mrs. Meyer's products, and being able to buy them from Amazon saves me time and money, too.
