review/text: I have bought this product many times and this was definitely a bad batch. The caplets were more friable than others I have bought. However, as the bottle seals were intact, and it was not even close to the expiration date, I attributed the product's condition to being roughly shipped. The more I used it, however, the more it didn't smell right, look right. It almost seemed as if it had been water damaged and then dried out. Upon closer examination, it appeared that the Lot # had been altered. At this point it was too late to do much about it, as half the product was used up, but I will not buy from this seller in the future.
