review/text: I've tried strawberry banana, vanilla ice cream, and banana cream. They all taste like crap and artificial. I couldn't stomach it alone with water.However, the double rich chocolate is very doable with water. It doesn't have a strong chocolate taste but it doesn't taste artificial either. I can add in 4-6 oz of water with a scope and be done with it in a few seconds.Overall, Double Rich Chocolate is recommended.
