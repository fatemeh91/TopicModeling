review/text: This is my favorite brand of Vitamin C. It is the purest that I have seen on the market, in other words, the one that is simply Vitamin C and not a bunch of other items added as well. I like these because they are time released which is reputed to be better for the system to absorb. The 1000mg pills are especially large, so I don't recommend swallowing too many at a time. But this KAL brand of Vitamin C is one that I seek out especially in all the health food stores, as it is the one that seems to be the most effective for me. And it doesn't have any added ingredients such as gelatin that causes me to have MSG headaches and so forth. So in closing, this line of Vitamin C is pure and healthy. I recommend it heartily.
