review/text: Just received my replacement Phase 4 insoles as the last 2 pairs began cracking after 10 years of use. The replacements are the new and improved Walk-fits and are even better than the Phase 4's.I encountered no problems in reporting the life time guaranteed Phase 4s and requesting that replacements be made. All was done quickly and pleasantly.I'll continue to be a lifetime customer!Bob TempleSisters, Or.
