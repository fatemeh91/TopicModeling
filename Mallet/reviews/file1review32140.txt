review/text: Bought this for my son (along with their protein powder). He loves them...much more than other protein bars he has tried.He's working out six days a week, including lifting weights, and is seeing a huge difference in his endurance and strength with the protein added to his diet.Good price on both items; great, fast shipping by Amazon/vendor.
