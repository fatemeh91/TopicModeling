review/text: this mask is the best i have used since i started using sleep masks. the internal pockets line up with my eyes taking the pressure off of them which was one of my biggest gripes with sleep masks. the padded nose bridge not only helps lift the mask to give additional lift over the eyes it also enables you to get a complete block of light by adjusting the pad, eliminating that anoying sliver of light at the nose and cheeks of those cheaper masks. it took a little while to get used to the slight bulkiness of the mask but if you give it a couple of nights you will barely notice it on your face.
