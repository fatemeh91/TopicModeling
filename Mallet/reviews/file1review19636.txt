review/text: We absolutely love this potty seat. My son has been potty training but is outgrowing his little potty (he's tall and long legged) so we thought we'd better get something he could use with the real toilet. This seat is very comfortable for him and easy to adjust to fit any toilet. My son is only 2 1/2 but can put this on and take it off the toilet by himself. I would highly recommend it!
