review/text: I purchased this item together with a La Crosse chargerLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Chargerfrom MTA Trading.Shipment was fast, service was great but this product is not as great as expected.I am using these batteries on toys for my kid. Nothing that needs a high capacity though (not for digital camera).The batteries don't hold a charge, I never managed to reach the maximum capacity.The batteries that came with the charger are of far better quality even if not from a brand.So, don't buy these DURACELLs. I bought them feeling secure about Duracell quality but I was wrong.They are of any use now. I'll just dispose them.I hope this can help you to avoid making the same mistake as I did.
