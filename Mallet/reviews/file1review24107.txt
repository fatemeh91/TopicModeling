review/text: i was at the point where i really didn't think anything would work. i have incredibly sensitive skin and i am extremely allergic to everything. this product not only cleared up my acne it also cleared up the blackheads, completely. i have to caution that this soap is drying but after a week or two my skin adapted and is no longer dry (i can't use moisturizers because i'm allergic). i strongly suggest this product.
