review/text: sick and homicidal all day, then this is the product for you. Tried this stuff to drop a few pounds and found myself sick as a dog, bloated out, and murderously angry. Even my coworkers thought I was on something and I was taking ONE a day! Does not help lose weight as I was running 20 miles a week and eating less (probably because I wanted to vomit all the time) and gained about 5 pounds. Returned to GNC and got my money back.Decided to run three times a week vice five and to try Atkins again and was down nine pounds and four inches in a week. You can keep these so-called "supplements."
