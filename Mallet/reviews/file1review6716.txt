review/text: I received one of these this past Christmas after trying one that my mother had ordered, and I have used it every night since, (its only been a couple of days), however, within those few days, the occurring back knots and shoulder knots have diminished greatly. When using the back buddy it really feels like someone is doing the work for you. The design of the back buddy allows you to apply the desired pressure without utilizing the muscles you are targeting.
