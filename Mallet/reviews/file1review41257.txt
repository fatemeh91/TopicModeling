review/text: Having played and coached sports for over 40 years, I've been around injuries and pain most of my life. Now at age 77, many of those old injuries are coming back, but with a new name called "Arthritis." Elbows, both shoulders, old dislocated fingers, both knees and ankles cry out when those cold weather fronts move through Texas. After reading an article about Australian Dream Arthritis Cream, I thought 2 oz. is worth trying. My left elbow was killing me, but after applying the Cream, twice a day, on the 4th morning the pain was totally gone. That's when I order another 2 oz. to keep next to my bed and 4 oz. for refills. Good thing I bought enough, my son and 2 neighbors are bugging me for more. They are all sold on Australian Dream Arthritis Cream, but I want them to buy their own and leave mine alone!
