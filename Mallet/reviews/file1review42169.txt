review/text: I first bought a few of these diapers from a one-sale-a-day site, they had discontinued some of the colors. I used them for a while, really liked them, so ordered a lot more. They are big on a newborn, but my little guy grew into them. He is now 10 months old, around 18 pounds, and they fit him well. I am still folding the front down, so there's room to grow. So I was happy with these diapers for many months. They are absorbent, hold in messes, and wash up well.After a little while, I started noticing velcro problems. On some of the diapers (the newer ones that I ordered last), the fuzzy velcro strip on the outside of the diaper will curl up longways when out of the wash. Not a huge deal, but makes it a little harder to maneuver on a wiggly baby. But worse is the fact that, on most of the diapers, the velcro square started detaching off the tab. I sewed many down by hand before I realized that the velcro tab itself is degrading, making the velcro "hooks" disappear. This is only happening on the hooked velcro on the left side of the baby.Yet another problem is that some of the diapers leak. I always have the extra insert in, but I'm noticing leaks around the legs, even when the back half of the diaper is perfectly dry. Stripping them does not seem to help. I wonder if the stitching has caused leakage through the PUL layer, although other brands of diapers are stitched the same way and don't have the same problems.
