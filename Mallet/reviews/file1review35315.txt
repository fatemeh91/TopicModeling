review/text: As subject line suggests, my last year has been devoted to getting off of Paxil...worst mistake of my life getting on that crap. Anyhow, I haven't been able to function properly since getting off of it. I couldn't concentrate, always felt like I needed more sleep, and I was loaded with insecurity and social anxiety. So, I went to my local health food store and got this to sample Maca. The first time I took it, I was cool and calm and a social beast again. Discarding that to Placebo effect, I took it again and again and again. Now I'm at 2 weeks and I haven't felt a moment of anxiety or tiredness. I just finished this bottle and got the larger green bag from another manufacturer (Navitas maybe?). Anyhow, do try this if you feel hopelessly sapped like I did. It will change your f'ing life!! I'm a salesman but not for Amazon or this product...or anything health related or remotely similar ;)
