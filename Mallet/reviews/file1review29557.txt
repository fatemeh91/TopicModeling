review/text: This is a wonderful bombilla, works great with my Mate.What was not clear to me is that the picture shows only the straight part of the straw when in fact, the whole length starts with brass curved lip piece then what you see in the picture followed by and opposite curve (S curve) to where the spoon shape filter is. All is silver with the exception of the mouth piece.This is much prettier than the picture shows.
