review/text: I bought this product based on its reviews. I also had a bit of trouble with the handle falling apart at first. After assembly, I had banged it on the (magazine on the) floor as directed by a couple of the reviewers. The top part still came off. So I unscrewed the handle, reassembled the top part and turned it upside down and, this time, banged the top part of the handle on the floor. This made it all snap together and I have not had any further trouble with the handle coming apart since.Otherwise, the product is very handy to have around for a quick sweep daily. Works great and is so easy to empty. Does not work in corners and along baseboards and is a bit noisier than I thought it would be but, overall it gets my floors and carpets clean quickly and easily. So lightweight too. It's great! One of my best purchases of the past 12 months. I will get another for upstairs.Best price was from Ace Hardware. Quick delivery too.
