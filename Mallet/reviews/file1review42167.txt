review/text: I bought 4 of these diapers thinking the MF would keep my heavy wetter dry at night. Well they do that, but they also leak badly out the legs and the waistband on my 3 mo. old son. I tried adding bulk under the sewn-in insert, but it didn't help. Customer service never responded to my request for suggestions on the leakage. I regret my purchases and will not buy diapers from Mommy's Touch again. There may be something I could've done to fix the leaking for all I know, but we will never know because customer service was completely unresponsive.
