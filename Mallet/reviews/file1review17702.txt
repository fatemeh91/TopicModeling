review/text: This is a well made product. It re-placed my Norelco which is made by Phillips and I've never had a product from Phillips worth a crap.(t.v. ,cd player, boom box just a few) . This trimmer holds a charge and is easy to use. I highly recommend this product. I even shaved my head with it.
