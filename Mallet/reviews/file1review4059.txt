review/text: Just opened and tried the first blade. I have been using Fusion Blades since they have been on the market and my face told me with the first stroke that the blades were counterfeit. A convenience store cheapo throw-away blade is a lot sharper. A few years ago I was given a web page that I could buy this type blade at a discount price. They too were counterfeit. I realise that you have to be skeptical when buying on the internet, but I trusted Amazon to have checked their vendors out. What is most aggravating is there was no deal in the price. I could have went to the nearest Walmart and bought for the same price when adding the cost of fuel for the round trip.......
