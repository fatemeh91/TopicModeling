review/text: I was having pain in my arch whenever I walked or jogged. I got these to help, and they worked wonderfully. The arch support hits me right where I had the most pain. Now it only hurts when I take off my shoe! I can go on long walks with the dog and not feel any discomfort. I'd definitely recommend these to anyone with arch pain.
