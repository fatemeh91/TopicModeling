review/text: These diapers are PERFECT as burp cloths and mini-towels. We used them as burp cloths when our daughter was an infant, and we continue to use them to wipe messy faces after meals, as well as to wipe runny noses during teething. We keep them all over the house! Be careful though - there are two types, one with padding and one without - make sure to get the ones without, as the ones with extra padding are useless in this capacity. (They make great car shammies, though!)
