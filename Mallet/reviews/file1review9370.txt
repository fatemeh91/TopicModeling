review/text: I was in a desparate search for the perfect pill tray for both my son and me who take pills in the AM and PM. A pill tray is helpful to me because I am dreadfully forgetful as to whether or not I have taken my pills or not and is helpful for my son so that his doses are pre-dosed for him for easy taking (and we know if he's taken his dose or not). The individual pods are a fabulous feature because if we're running out to dinner, we just pop the pill pod into a purse or pocket and know that the pills will be with us and never miss a dose! I brought it on vacation with me as well and each day would just grab my pod for the day and off I'd go! We couldn't have found a better pill tray!
